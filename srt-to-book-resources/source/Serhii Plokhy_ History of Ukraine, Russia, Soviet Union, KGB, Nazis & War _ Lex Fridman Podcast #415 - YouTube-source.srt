1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,128
- What happened during World War II was

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,381
that once the Germans started to run out

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:11,381
of manpower, they created foreign legion groups.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,390
But because those people were not

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,940
Aryans, they couldn't be trusted.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,190
So they were put under the command

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,370
of Heinrich Himmler under command of SS,

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,554
and became known as SS Waffen units,

9
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:31,563
and one of such units was created in Ukraine.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,810
- The following is a conversation with Serhii Plokhy,

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,735
a historian at Harvard University

12
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:42,180
and the director of the Ukrainian Research Institute,

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,650
also at Harvard.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,610
As a historian,

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,911
he specializes in the history of Eastern Europe

16
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:49,537
with an emphasis on Ukraine.

17
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:53,100
He wrote a lot of great books on Ukraine

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,120
and Russia, the Soviet Union, on Slavic peoples in general,

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,246
across centuries on Chernobyl and nuclear disasters,

20
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:03,240
and on the current war in Ukraine,

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,612
a book titled The Russo-Ukrainian War,

22
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:08,309
The Return of History.

23

25
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:17,403
And now, dear friends, here's Serhii Plokhy.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,708
What are the major explanations

27
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:22,230
for the collapse of the Soviet Union?

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,530
Maybe ones you agree with and ones you disagree with?

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,666
- Very often people confuse three different processes

30
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,590
that were taken place in the late eighties

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,400
and early nineties, and the one was the collapse

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,310
of communism as ideology.

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,280
Another was the end of the Cold War,

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,603
and the third one was the end of the Soviet Union.

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,642
All of this processes were interrelated, interconnected,

36
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:54,960
but when people provide ideology as the explanation for all

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,252
of these processes, that's why I disagree,

38
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:02,717
because ideological collapse happened on the territory

39
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:05,160
of the Soviet Union in general.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,026
Soviet Union lost the Cold War, whether

41
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:11,190
we are talking about Moscow, Leningrad,

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,730
or St. Petersburg now, or Vladivostok.

43
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,390
But the fall of the Soviet Union is about a story in which

44
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,330
Vladivostok and St. Petersburg

45
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,163
ended up in one country, and Kyiv, Minsk,

46
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:25,623
and (speaks foreign language)

47
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:27,870
ended in different countries.

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,490
So the theories

49
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,180
and explanations about how did that happen for me,

50
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,060
this really very helpful theories

51
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,443
for understanding the Soviet collapse.

52
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:43,380
So the mobilization from below, the collapse

53
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,270
of the center, against the background of economic collapse,

54
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,587
against the background of ideological implosion.

55
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:57,690
That's how I look at the fall of the Soviet Union

56
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,800
and that's how I look at the theories

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,390
that explain that collapse.

58
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,390
- So it's a story of geography, ideology, economics,

59
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,961
which are the most important to understand of

60
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:14,580
what made the collapse of the Soviet Union happen?

61
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,962
- The Soviet collapse was unique,

62
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:20,976
but not more unique than collapse of any other empire.

63
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:23,722
So what we really witnessed,

64
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:27,420
or the world witnessed back in 1991,

65
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,340
and we continue to witness today

66
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,808
with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, is a collapse

67
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,913
of one of the largest world empires.

68
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:39,900
We talked about the Soviet Union,

69
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,867
and now talk about Russia as possessing plus, minus,

70
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:45,867
one sixth of the surface of the earth.

71
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:51,000
You don't get in possession of one sixth of the earth

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,695
by being a nation state.

73
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:56,452
You get that sort of size as an empire.

74
00:03:56,452 --> 00:04:00,591
And the Soviet collapses continuation of the disintegration

75
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:05,591
of the Russian Empire that started back in 1917,

76
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,443
that was arrested for some period of time by the Bolsheviks,

77
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:12,499
by the communist ideology,

78
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:13,469
which was internationalist ideology,

79
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,295
and then came back in full force in the late eighties

80
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:19,410
and early nineties.

81
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,400
So the most important story for me, this is the story

82
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,980
of the continuing collapse of the Russian Empire

83
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,480
and the rise of not just local nationalism,

84
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,080
but also rise of Russian nationalism that turned out to be

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,742
as a destructive force for the imperial

86
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:41,123
or multi-ethnic, multinational state,

87
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:45,840
as was Ukrainian nationalism or Georgian

88
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,870
or Estonian for that matter,

89
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,720
- Well you said a lot of interesting stuff there in 1917,

90
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,290
Bolsheviks, internationalists, how that plays with the idea

91
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,730
of Russian Empire and so on.

92
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,520
But first, let me ask about US influence on this.

93
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,200
So one of the ideas is that, you know, through the Cold War,

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,560
that mechanism, US had made your interest

95
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,060
to weaken the Soviet Union,

96
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,931
and therefore the collapse could be attributed to pressure

97
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:16,572
and manipulation from the United States.

98
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:18,780
Is there truth to that?

99
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,090
- The pressure from the United States,

100
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,545
this is part of the Cold War

101
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,173
and Cold War part of that story,

102
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:29,760
but it doesn't explain the Soviet collapse.

103
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,880
And the reason is quite simple.

104
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,251
The United States of America didn't want

105
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:40,072
the Soviet Union to collapse and disintegrate.

106
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:45,051
They didn't want that at the start of the Cold War in 1948.

107
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:46,830
We now have the strategic documents.

108
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,630
They were concerned about that.

109
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,010
They didn't wanna do that,

110
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,647
and certainly they didn't wanna do that

111
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:56,647
in the 1991, as late August of 1991,

112
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,960
the month of the coup, in Moscow,

113
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,760
president Bush, George HW Bush travels from Moscow

114
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,100
to Kyiv and gives famous,

115
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,370
or infamous speech called Chicken Kyiv speech,

116
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,370
basically warning Ukrainians against going for independence.

117
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,170
The Soviet collapse was a huge headache

118
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,098
for the administration in the White House

119
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,894
for a number of reasons.

120
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,687
They liked to work with Gorbachev.

121
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:28,950
The Soviet Union was emerging as a junior partner

122
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,875
of the United States on the international arena.

123
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,550
Collapse destroyed all of that.

124
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,220
And on the top of that, there was a question

125
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,833
of the nuclear weapons, unaccounted nuclear weapons.

126
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:46,833
So the United States was doing everything humanly possible

127
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,649
to keep the Soviet Union together in one piece

128
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:54,992
until really late November of 1991, when it became clear

129
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:59,040
that it was, it was a lost cause

130
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,310
and they had to say goodbye to Gorbachev

131
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,640
and to the project that he introduced.

132
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,719
A few months later,

133
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,073
or a year later, there was a presidential campaign,

134
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:13,680
and Bush was running for the second term

135
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,540
and was looking for achievements.

136
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,159
And there were many achievements.

137
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,180
I basically treat him with great respect,

138
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,080
but destruction of the Soviet Union

139
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,700
was not one of those achievements.

140
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,450
He was on the other side of that divide.

141
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,600
But the politics, the political campaign,

142
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,297
of course have their own rules and they produce

143
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:41,297
and give birth to mythology with which we still,

144
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,610
at least in this country, we live till now, till today.

145
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,502
- So Gorbachev is an interesting figure in all of this.

146
00:07:47,502 --> 00:07:50,006
Is there a possible history

147
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:52,127
where the Soviet Union did not collapse

148
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:55,260
and some of the ideas that Gorbachev had for the future

149
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,943
of the Soviet Union came to life?

150
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,230
- Of course, history, on the one hand, there is a statement.

151
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,560
It doesn't allow for what-ifs.

152
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,154
On the other hand, in my opinion, history is full of

153
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,832
what-if, that's what history is about.

154
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:11,100
(Lex laughs)

155
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,140
And certainly there are scenarios,

156
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,160
how the Soviet Union

157
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,160
would continue beyond, let's say Gorbachev's tenure.

158
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:26,850
And the argument has been made that the reforms

159
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,890
that he introduced, that they were mismanaged

160
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,570
and they could be managed differently,

161
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,977
or there could be no reforms

162
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:34,328
and there could be continuous stagnation.

163
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:36,870
So that is all possible.

164
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,863
What I think would happen one way

165
00:08:38,863 --> 00:08:43,289
or another is the Soviet collapse in a different form

166
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,790
on somebody else's watch at some later period in time.

167
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,020
Because we're dealing with not just processes

168
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,273
that happening in the Soviet Union,

169
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:56,430
we're dealing with global processes

170
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,224
and the 20th century turned out to be the century

171
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:03,720
of the disintegration of the empires.

172
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,497
You look at the globe at the map of the world in 1914,

173
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:11,017
and you compare it to the map at the end

174
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,670
of the 20th century in 1991, 1992.

175
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,064
And suddenly you realize that there are many candidates

176
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:20,220
for being the most important event,

177
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,158
the most important process in the 20th century.

178
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:26,640
But the biggest global thing

179
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,610
that happened was redrawing the map of the world

180
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,610
and producing dozens, if not hundreds of new states.

181
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,240
That's the outcome of the different processes

182
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,284
of the 20th century.

183
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:43,960
Look, Yugoslavia is falling apart around the same time.

184
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,770
Czechoslovakia goes through

185
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,873
what can be called a civilized divorce, a very,

186
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:52,500
very rare occurrence in the fall

187
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,709
of multinational states.

188
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,090
So yeah, the writing was on the wall,

189
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,400
whether it would happen under Gorbachev

190
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,480
or later, whether it would happen as the result of reforms

191
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,942
or as the result of no reforms.

192
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:09,090
But I think that sooner

193
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,550
or later, that would happen.

194
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,600
- Yeah, it's very possible.

195
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,770
Hundreds of years from now,

196
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,450
the way the 20th century is written about

197
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,610
as the century defined by the collapse of empires.

198
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,590
You call the Soviet Union the last empire.

199
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,240
The book is called The Last Empire.

200
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,951
So is there something fundamental about the way the world is

201
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:34,951
that means it's not conducive to the formation of empires?

202
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,190
- The meaning that I was putting in the term the Soviet

203
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,867
Union as the last empire was that

204
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:44,867
that was the Soviet collapse, was the collapse of the

205
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:50,070
last major European empires, traditional empires

206
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,130
that was there in the 18th century, 19th century,

207
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,752
and through most of the 20th century,

208
00:10:55,752 --> 00:11:00,630
the Austria Hungary died in the midst

209
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,500
of World War I, the Ottoman Empire disintegrated,

210
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,740
the Brits were gone and left India.

211
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,020
And there was the successor

212
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,150
to the Russian Empire called the Soviet Union,

213
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,030
was still hanging on there.

214
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,757
And then came 1991.

215
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:20,940
And what we see even with today's Russia,

216
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,900
it's a very different sort of policies.

217
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,900
The Russian leadership tried to learn a lesson from 1991,

218
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,607
so there is no national Republics

219
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:40,000
in the Russian Federation that would have more rights than

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,162
the Russian administrative units.

221
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,490
So the structure is different.

222
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,040
The nationality policies are different.

223
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,980
The level of unification is much higher.

224
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,716
So it is in many ways already a

225
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,640
post imperial formation.

226
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,879
- And you're right about that moment in 1991,

227
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:06,510
the role that Ukraine played in that

228
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,730
seems to be a very critical role.

229
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,910
Can you describe just that

230
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,650
what role Ukraine played in the

231
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,090
collapse of the Soviet Union?

232
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,363
- History is many things,

233
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:20,430
but it started in a very simple way

234
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,360
of making notes about on the yearly basis

235
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,160
what happened this year at that.

236
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,290
So it's about chronology.

237
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,360
Chronology in the history of the collapse

238
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,980
of the Soviet Union is very important.

239
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,048
You have Ukrainian referendum on December 1st, 1991,

240
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,730
and you have dissolution of the Soviet Union

241
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,930
by the leaders of Russia.

242
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,805
Ukraine and Belarus respond a week later,

243
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,763
and the question is why?

244
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,220
Ukrainian referendum is the answer.

245
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,900
But Ukrainians

246
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,380
didn't answer their referendum question

247
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,836
of whether they want the Soviet Union

248
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:57,780
to be dissolved or not.

249
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,425
They answered very limited in terms of,

250
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:05,133
it's been in question whether you support the decision of

251
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,810
(speaks foreign language) of your parliament

252
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,500
for Ukraine to go independent,

253
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,040
and the rest was not on the ballot.

254
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,780
So why then one week later, the Soviet Union is gone?

255
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,059
And President Yeltsin explains to President Bush around

256
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,753
that time, the reason why Ukraine was so important.

257
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:30,840
He said that, well, if Ukraine is gone,

258
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,470
Russia is not interested in this Soviet project

259
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,120
because Russia would be outnumbered

260
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,540
and outvoted by the Muslim republics.

261
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,300
So there was a cultural element,

262
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,800
but there was also another one.

263
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,450
Ukraine happened to be the second largest Soviet republic

264
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,203
and then post-Soviet state in terms of population, in terms

265
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:54,900
of the economy, economic potential, and so on and so forth.

266
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,354
And as Yeltsin suggested, close culturally, linguistically

267
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:01,200
and otherwise to Russia.

268
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,640
So with the second largest republic gone,

269
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,160
Russia didn't think that it was in Russia's interest

270
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,710
to continue with the Soviet Union.

271
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,380
And around that time, Yegor Gaidar

272
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,160
who was the chief economic advisor of Yeltsin,

273
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,630
was telling him, well, we just don't have money anymore

274
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,980
to support other republics.

275
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,270
We have to focus on Russia.

276
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,740
We have to use oil

277
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,740
and gas money within the Russian Federation.

278
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,550
So the state was bankrupt, imperial projects,

279
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,240
at least in the context of the late 20th century,

280
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,530
they costed money.

281
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,140
It wasn't a moneymaking machine

282
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,056
as it was back in the 18th and 19th century,

283
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,779
and the combination of all these factors led

284
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,779
to the processes in which Ukraine's decision

285
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:57,687
to go independent, spelled the end to the Soviet Union.

286
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,560
And if today anybody wants to restore,

287
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,730
not the Soviet Union,

288
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,652
but some form of Russian control over the post-Soviet space,

289
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:10,834
Ukraine is as important today

290
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:13,290
as it was back in December of 1991.

291
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,529
- Lemme ask you about Vladimir Putin's

292
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:22,800
statement that the collapse of the Soviet Union is one

293
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,666
of the great tragedies of history.

294
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,080
To what degree does he have a point?

295
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,910
To what degree is he wrong?

296
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,590
- His formulation was that this is

297
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,702
the greatest geopolitical catastrophe

298
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:36,914
or tragedy of the 20th century.

299
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:41,520
And I specifically went and looked at the text

300
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,184
and put it in specific time when it was happening.

301
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,070
And it was interesting

302
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,560
that the statement was made a few weeks

303
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,070
before the May nine parade

304
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,883
and celebrations of the victory,

305
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,180
a key part of the mythology

306
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,940
of the current Russian state.

307
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,417
So why say things about the

308
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,980
Soviet collapse being

309
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,650
the largest geopolitical tragedy

310
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,490
and not in that particular context, the Second World War?

311
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,140
My explanation at least is that the World War II,

312
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,090
the price was enormous,

313
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,210
but the Soviet Union emerged as a great victor

314
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,913
and captured half of Europe.

315
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,518
1991, in terms of the lives lost at

316
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:38,400
that point, the price was actually very, very low.

317
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,043
But for Putin, what was important that the state was lost.

318
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,440
And he in particular was concerned about the division

319
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,070
of the Russian people,

320
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,310
which he understood back then,

321
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,626
like he understands now in very, very broad terms.

322
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:58,626
So for him, the biggest tragedy is not the loss

323
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,220
of life, the biggest tragedy is the loss

324
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,810
of the great power, status,

325
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,170
or the unity of those whom he considered

326
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,790
to be Russian nations.

327
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,134
So at least this is my reading, this is my understanding of

328
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:14,339
what is there, what is

329
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,400
on the paper and what is between the lines.

330
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,650
- So both the unity of the sort of quote Russian Empire

331
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,470
and the status of the superpower.

332
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,619
- That's how I read it.

333
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,960
- You wrote a book, The Origins of The Slavic Nations.

334
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,570
So let's go back into history.

335
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,990
What is the origin of Slavic nations?

336
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,350
- We can look at that from different perspectives.

337
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,580
And we are now making major breakthroughs

338
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,540
in answering this question with the very interesting,

339
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,410
innovative linguistic analysis, the study of DNA.

340
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,560
So that's really the new frontier.

341
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,700
We're getting into a prehistorical period

342
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,609
where there is no historical sources.

343
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,767
And from what we can understand today,

344
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,083
and that can of course change tomorrow

345
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:12,030
with all these breakthroughs in sciences, is that

346
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:17,030
the Slavs came into existence somewhere in the area

347
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:22,256
of Pripyat marshes, northwestern part

348
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,130
of Ukraine, southwestern part of Belarus,

349
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,821
eastern part of Poland.

350
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:31,980
And that's is considered to be historical homeland of Slavs.

351
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,780
And then they spread,

352
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,450
and they spread all the way to the Adriatic.

353
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,160
So we have Croats,

354
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,903
we have Russians spreading all the way to the Pacific.

355
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:45,300
We have Ukrainians, we have Belarusians, Poles.

356
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,560
Once we had Czechoslovaks, now we have Czechs and Slovaks.

357
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,823
So that's the story of starting with the eighth

358
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:54,480
and ninth century.

359
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,270
We can even a little bit earlier, we can already follow

360
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,870
that story with the help of the written sources,

361
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,087
mostly from Byzantine, then later from Western Europe.

362
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,513
But what I was trying to do, not being a scientist,

363
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:13,954
not being an expert in linguistics

364
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:18,510
or not being an expert in DNA analysis,

365
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,382
I was trying to see what was happening in the minds

366
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:26,193
of those peoples and their lives in particular,

367
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,997
whom we call today

368
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:31,290
not Slavs, but Eastern Slavs, which means Russians,

369
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,572
Ukrainians and Belarusians.

370
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:36,019
How they imagine themselves, how they imagine their world.

371
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:38,640
And eventually I look at the

372
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,064
so-called nation building projects.

373
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:44,261
So trying to answer the question of how we arrived

374
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:48,300
to the situation in which we are today,

375
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,450
where there are not just three East Slavic nations,

376
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,380
but there are also three East Slavic states, Russian,

377
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,430
Ukrainian, and Belorussian.

378
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,300
So this is the focus of my book.

379
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,640
And admittedly in that particular book

380
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,926
I end on the 18th century before the era of nationalism.

381
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:10,850
But then there are other books like Lost Kingdom

382
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,790
where I bring the story all the way up to today.

383
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,468
- So what aspects of the eighth

384
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:21,468
and ninth century, the East Slavic states

385
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,350
permeates to today that we should understand?

386
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,790
- Well, the most important one is that the existence

387
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,180
of the state of Kyivan Rus

388
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,340
back during the medieval period

389
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,200
created a foundations for historical mythology,

390
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,820
common historical mythology.

391
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,080
And there are just wars

392
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,270
and battles over who has the right, or more right

393
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,360
for Kyivan Rus.

394
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,460
The legal code that was created at

395
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,668
that time existed for a long period of time, the acceptance

396
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:59,610
of Christianity from Byzantium, that became a big issue

397
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,390
that separated then eastern Slavs from their Western

398
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,573
neighbors, including Czechs and Poles.

399
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:12,573
But united in that way to let's say Bulgarians

400
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,727
or Serbs and the beginning of the written literature,

401
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:19,650
beginning in Kyiv.

402
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,700
So all of that is considered to be part of heritage.

403
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,066
All of that is being contested.

404
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:30,066
And this debates that were academic

405
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,265
for a long period of time,

406
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:36,687
what we see now tragically have been being continued

407
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:38,850
on the battlefield.

408
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,700
- What is Kyiv, what is Rus that you mentioned?

409
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,250
What's the importance of these?

410
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,773
You mentioned them as the sort of defining places

411
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:52,773
and terms, labels at the beginning of all of this.

412
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,720
So what is Kyiv?

413
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,930
- Kyiv became a capital

414
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,647
or the outpost of the Vikings

415
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:05,740
who were trying to establish control over the

416
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,488
trade route between

417
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:13,488
what is today's Western Russia and Belarus

418
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,740
and Northern Ukraine.

419
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,604
So the forest areas and the biggest

420
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,981
and the richest market in the world that existed at

421
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:26,280
that time, which was in Constantinople, in Byzantium.

422
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,570
So the idea was to get whatever goods you can get in

423
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,130
that part of Eastern Europe.

424
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,825
And most of those goods were slaves.

425
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:39,825
Local population put them on the ships in Kyiv

426
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,290
because Kyiv was on the border with the step zones.

427
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,528
Step zones were controlled by other groups,

428
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:52,528
(speaks foreign language) and so on.

429
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:58,733
And you name it.

430
00:22:58,733 --> 00:22:59,566
And then staying

431
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:02,917
on the river being protected from attacks of the moments

432
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,680
to come to the Black Sea

433
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,620
and sell these products in Constantinople.

434
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,498
That was the idea.

435
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:10,939
That was the model.

436
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:15,939
Vikings tried to practice that sort of

437
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,070
business model also in other parts of Europe

438
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,085
and like in other parts of Europe, they turned out to be,

439
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:29,085
by default creators of new politics, of new states.

440
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,586
And that was the story

441
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:34,680
of the first Kyivan Dynasty

442
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,657
and Kyiv as the capital of that huge empire

443
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:42,657
that was going from the Baltics to today, central Ukraine,

444
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,460
and then was trying to get through the southern Ukraine

445
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,034
to the Black Sea.

446
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:50,100
That was a major,

447
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,648
major European state kingdom, if you wanna call it,

448
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:59,550
of medieval Europe with a lot, creating a lot

449
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,570
of tradition in terms of dynasty, in terms of language,

450
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,450
in terms of religion, in terms of, again,

451
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,545
historical mythology.

452
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:12,545
So Kyiv is central for the nation building myth

453
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,203
of a number of groups in the region.

454
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:22,590
- So in one perspective

455
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,390
and narrative, Kyiv is at the center of this Russian empire,

456
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,264
at which point does Moscow come to prominence

457
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:36,210
as the center of the Russian empire?

458
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,340
- Well, the Russian Empire is a term

459
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,623
and really creation of the 18th century.

460
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:44,553
What we have for the Kyivan,

461
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:46,280
and we call it Kyivan Rus.

462
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,825
Again, this is a term of the 19th century.

463
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:49,773
They call themselves Rus,

464
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,850
and there was metropolitan of Rus

465
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,769
and there was Rus principalities.

466
00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:00,420
So very important to keep in mind that Rus is not Russia,

467
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,500
because that was a self name for all multiple groups on

468
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,344
that territory.

469
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:11,344
And Moscow doesn't exist at the time when Kyiv

470
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,653
emerges as the capital.

471
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,890
The first reference

472
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,210
to Moscow comes from the 12th century when it was founded

473
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,210
by one of the Kyivan Princes, and Moscow comes

474
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:30,240
to prominence really in a very different context

475
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,073
and with a very different empire running the show

476
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:34,170
in the region.

477
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,270
The story of Moscow and the rise of Moscow.

478
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,229
This is the story of the Mongol rule

479
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:44,229
over former Rus lands and former Rus territories.

480
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:49,448
The part of the former Rus eventually

481
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:54,780
overthrows the Mongol control with the help

482
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,454
of the small group

483
00:25:57,454 --> 00:26:00,303
of people called Lithuanians,

484
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,430
which had a young state and young dynasty

485
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,230
and united this lands,

486
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,736
which were mostly in today's terms,

487
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:10,890
Ukrainian and Belorussian.

488
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,290
So they separate early.

489
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,350
And what is today is Russia, mostly Western Russia,

490
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,620
Central Russia, stays under the Mongol control up

491
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,889
until late 15th century.

492
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:25,700
And that was the story when Moscow rises

493
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,790
as the new capital of that realm replacing

494
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,000
the city of Vladimir

495
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:37,080
as that capital for those who ever went

496
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,890
to Russia, they familiar with, of course,

497
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,310
Vladimir as the place of the oldest

498
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,380
architectural monuments, the so-called

499
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,570
the Golden Ring of Russia, and so on and so forth.

500
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,920
Vladimir is central.

501
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,856
And there were so many architectural monuments there,

502
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:58,500
because before there was Moscow there was Vladimir,

503
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,355
eventually in this struggle over control of the territory,

504
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:08,116
struggle for favors from the Mongols

505
00:27:08,116 --> 00:27:10,151
and the Tatar horde, Moscow emerges as the center

506
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:14,823
of that particular realm under Mongols,

507
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,213
after the Mongol rule is removed,

508
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:22,110
Moscow embarks on the project that historians,

509
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,139
Russian historians of the 19th century called the gathering

510
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:29,139
of the Russian lands, using Russian now for Rus.

511
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,254
And trying to bring back

512
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:39,240
the lands of former Kyivan Rus,

513
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,759
but also the lands of the former Mongol empire.

514
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,980
The Russians get to the Pacific

515
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,120
before they get to Kyiv, historically,

516
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,120
and really the quote-unquote gathering of the

517
00:27:56,806 --> 00:27:59,979
quote unquote Russian lands.

518
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:04,979
And only in 1945 when the Soviet Union

519
00:28:05,273 --> 00:28:08,398
bullies the Czechoslovak government into turning

520
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,398
what is today's Ukraine to the Soviet Union.

521
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,040
It is included in the Ukrainian Soviet socialist republic.

522
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,450
So that's the moment when that destiny, the way

523
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,408
how it was imagined

524
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:25,920
by the 19th century Russian historian was

525
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,072
eventually fulfilled.

526
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,780
Moscow was in control of all this lands.

527
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,931
- So to what degree are the Slavic people one people?

528
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:36,390
And this is the theme that will continue throughout,

529
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,055
I think, versus a collection of multiple peoples,

530
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:42,850
whether we're talking about the Kyivan Rus

531
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,160
or we're talking about the 19th century Russian

532
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,051
empire conception.

533
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:51,130
- Well, a number of ways to look at that.

534
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:55,514
One, the most obvious, the most clear is language.

535
00:28:55,514 --> 00:29:00,514
And there is no question that

536
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:04,833
Poles speak a separate language in their Slavs.

537
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,614
And there is no question for anyone

538
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,310
going to Ukraine,

539
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:16,310
and hearing Ukrainian realizing that this is not Russian,

540
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,660
the level of comprehension can be different.

541
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,097
You can understand certain words

542
00:29:20,097 --> 00:29:23,400
and you don't understand others.

543
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,950
And the same would be with Polish,

544
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,600
and the same would be with Czech.

545
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,430
So there is this linguistic history

546
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,630
that is in common, but languages very clearly indicate that

547
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,653
you're dealing with different people.

548
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,510
We know that language is not everything,

549
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:49,350
Americans speak a particular way of English.

550
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,611
Australians speak a particular variant of English.

551
00:29:53,611 --> 00:29:56,565
But for reasons of geography history,

552
00:29:56,565 --> 00:30:01,565
we pretty much believe that despite linguistic unity,

553
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,990
these are different nations and different peoples.

554
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,719
And there are some parts

555
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:09,500
of political tradition more in common.

556
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,060
Others are quite different.

557
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,780
So the same when it comes to language,

558
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,880
the same when it comes to political tradition,

559
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,430
to the loyalty to the political institution applies

560
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,265
to Slavic nations.

561
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:24,706
So again,

562
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:28,532
there is nothing particularly unique about the

563
00:30:28,532 --> 00:30:30,750
Slavs in that regard.

564
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,420
- You wrote the book, the Cossack Myth,

565
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,410
History and Nationhood in the Age of Empires,

566
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,350
it tells the story of an anonymous manuscript

567
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,535
called the History of the Rus.

568
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:44,226
It started being circulated in the 1820s.

569
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:46,440
I would love it if you can tell the story of,

570
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,830
this is supposedly one

571
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,465
of the most impactful texts in history, modern history.

572
00:30:51,465 --> 00:30:53,970
So what's the importance of this text?

573
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,803
What did it contain?

574
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:56,910
How did it define the future of the region?

575
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,640
- In the first decay of the 19th century,

576
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,900
after Napoleonic Wars, a mysterious text emerged

577
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,170
that was attributed to a orthodox arch bishop

578
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,741
that was long dead,

579
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:14,741
which was claiming that the Cossacks of Ukraine

580
00:31:16,345 --> 00:31:20,451
were in fact the original Rus people,

581
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:25,340
and that they had the right

582
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,657
for a particular place for central place

583
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:30,212
in the Russian Empire.

584
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:34,243
And it tells the history of the Cossack.

585
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:36,720
It's the era of romanticism,

586
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,580
full of all sorts of drama.

587
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,052
There are heroes, there are villains,

588
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:44,210
and the text captivates the attention of

589
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,421
some key figures

590
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:49,620
in the Russian intellectual elite

591
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,620
in St. Petersburg, people like (speaks foreign language)

592
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:01,970
who was executed for his participation in 1825 Uprising

593
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,860
writes poetry on the basis of this text.

594
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,950
Pushkin pays attention to it as well.

595
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,751
And then comes along the

596
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:17,751
key figure in Ukrainian national revival

597
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:22,719
of the 19th century Ukrainian National Project.

598
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:25,230
(speaks foreign language) and reads it as well,

599
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,143
and they all read it very differently.

600
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,081
Eventually by the beginning of the

601
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:37,643
mid 20th century, some of the Russian

602
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:42,643
mostly nationalist writers called this text

603
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,859
the Quran of Ukrainian nationalism.

604
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:49,440
So what is there?

605
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,578
The story, it's very important in a sense that

606
00:32:52,578 --> 00:32:54,570
what the authors,

607
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,011
and that's what I claim in the book, what the authors

608
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:59,611
of the text were trying to say.

609
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:04,185
They were trying to say that the Cossack elite

610
00:33:04,185 --> 00:33:08,943
should have the same rights as the Russian nobility,

611
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,380
and brings the long historical records to prove

612
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,794
how cool the Cossack were over the period of time.

613
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,370
But at the beginning of the 19th century,

614
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,480
they put this claim already, they used new arguments,

615
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,610
and this arguments are about nation and nationalism,

616
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,693
and they're saying that the Cossack are a separate nation,

617
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:36,651
and that's a big, big, big claim.

618
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,634
The Russian Empire,

619
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:43,950
and this is a very, very good argument in historiography,

620
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,630
that Russian empire grew

621
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,358
and acquired this one sixth of the Earth,

622
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:53,093
by using one very specific way of integrating those lands.

623
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:57,600
It integrated elites, it was making deals with their elites,

624
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,667
whether their elites were Muslim

625
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,864
or their elites were Roman Catholic,

626
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:03,003
as the case was with the Poles,

627
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,490
elites would be integrated,

628
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,188
and the empire was made based on that estate,

629
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:14,114
the state loyalty and the state integration.

630
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:19,114
But once you bring in the factor of nation

631
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,226
and nationalism and language, then once in a sudden

632
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:28,739
the whole model of the integration of the elites,

633
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,960
irrespective of their language, religion,

634
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,603
and culture starts falling apart.

635
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:37,504
And the Poles were the first who really

636
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:42,257
produced this sort of a challenge

637
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:47,257
to the Russian empire by two uprisings in the 19th century.

638
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,813
And Ukrainians then followed in their footsteps.

639
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:54,739
So the text, the importance of the text is that

640
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:59,355
it was making claim on the part of a particular estate,

641
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:03,690
the Cossack officer class, which was

642
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,970
that empire could survive.

643
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,220
But it turned it, given the conditions

644
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:13,158
of the time into the claim for the special role of

645
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:15,993
Cossack as a nation,

646
00:35:17,368 --> 00:35:20,880
creating that this is a separate nation, a Rus nation.

647
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,550
And that is the challenge of nationalism

648
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,890
that no empire really survived.

649
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,140
And the Russian Empire was not an exception.

650
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,843
So there's a turning point when the discourse switches from

651
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:32,676
loyalty based on the integration of the elite

652
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:35,159
to the loyalty based

653
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:40,159
on attachment to your nation, to your language,

654
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,960
and to your culture and to your history.

655
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,543
- So that was like the initial spark, the flame

656
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:50,460
that led to nationalist movements.

657
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,860
- That was the beginning and the beginning,

658
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,850
that was building a bridge between the existence

659
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,640
of the Cossack state in the 17th and 18th century.

660
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,734
That was used as a foundation for the Cossack mythology.

661
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:06,180
Ukrainian national mythology went into the Ukrainian

662
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,930
national anthem and the new age

663
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,660
and the new stage where the Cossack were not there anymore,

664
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,260
where the professors, intellectuals, students, members

665
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,260
of the national and organizations.

666
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,580
And it started of course, with romantic poetry.

667
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,340
It was started with collecting folklore,

668
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,305
and then later goes to the political stage

669
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:32,313
and eventually the stage of mass politics.

670
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,157
- So to you, even throughout the 20th century under Stalin,

671
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:40,899
there was always a force within Ukraine

672
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,890
that wants it to be independent.

673
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,610
- There were five attempts for Ukraine

674
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,110
to declare it's independence

675
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,288
and to maintain it in the 20th century,

676
00:36:52,288 --> 00:36:55,830
only one succeeded in 1991.

677
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,527
But there were four different attempts before.

678
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:02,023
And you see the Ukrainian

679
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:06,167
national identity manifest in itself

680
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:10,445
in two different ways, in the form of national communism

681
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:15,445
after the Bolshevik victory in Bolshevik controlled Ukraine,

682
00:37:19,142 --> 00:37:22,467
and in the form of radical nationalism in the parts

683
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:27,467
of Ukraine that were controlled by Poland and Romania.

684
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,520
And part of that was also controlled by Czechoslovakia

685
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,633
and later Hungary.

686
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:37,367
So in those parts outside of the Soviet Union,

687
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:41,639
the form of the national mobilization, the key form

688
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:45,113
of national mobilization became radical nationalism in

689
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:49,830
Soviet Ukraine, it was national communism

690
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,003
that came back in the 1960s and 1970s.

691
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:56,075
And then in the 1991, the majority

692
00:37:56,075 --> 00:38:00,415
of the members of the Ukrainian parliament who voted

693
00:38:00,415 --> 00:38:03,444
for independence were members of the Communist Party.

694
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:08,444
So that spirit on a certain level never died.

695
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,968
- So there's national communism and radical nationalism.

696
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,540
Well, let me ask you about the radical nationalism,

697
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,069
because that is a topic that comes up in the discussion

698
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:21,767
of the war in Ukraine today.

699
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:26,767
Can you tell me about Stepan Bandera, who was he?

700
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,380
This controversial far-right,

701
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,733
Ukrainian revolutionary?

702
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,395
- The right list two Stepan Banderas.

703
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,591
One is the real person

704
00:38:36,591 --> 00:38:40,920
and another is mythology that really

705
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,903
comes with this name.

706
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,975
And the real person was a young student,

707
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:51,865
nationalistically oriented student in the late 1920s

708
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:54,540
and the early 1930s in the part of Ukraine

709
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,925
that was controlled by Poland, who belonged

710
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:00,720
to the generation who regretted

711
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,757
that they were not born in time for the big struggles

712
00:39:03,757 --> 00:39:06,573
of the World War I

713
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:09,737
and revolution at that time, they believed

714
00:39:09,737 --> 00:39:13,350
that their fathers lost opportunity for Ukraine

715
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:18,163
to become independent and that a new ideology was needed,

716
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:22,470
and that ideology was radical nationalism

717
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,440
and new tactics were needed.

718
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,800
So Bandera becomes the leader

719
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,186
of the organization

720
00:39:30,186 --> 00:39:34,020
of Ukrainian nationalists in Ukraine at the young age

721
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,027
and organizes a number of assassinations

722
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:38,710
of the Polish officials

723
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,240
or members of the Ukrainian community

724
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,618
who this young people in their

725
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:49,618
17, 18, 19 considered to be collaborators.

726
00:39:50,466 --> 00:39:55,145
He is arrested, put on trial.

727
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:58,950
And that's where the myth of Bandera starts

728
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:03,210
to emerge because he uses the trial

729
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,159
to make statement about the

730
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:12,159
Ukrainian nationalism, radical nationalism and its goals,

731
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:16,440
and suddenly becomes a hero among

732
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,130
the youth, Ukrainian youth at that time,

733
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,130
he's sentenced for execution, for death.

734
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,177
So when he delivers his speech, he knows that

735
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:31,010
he probably would die soon.

736
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:36,010
And then it was the sentence was commuted to life in prison.

737
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,991
Then World War II happens,

738
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:43,050
the Polish state collapses under the pressure coming,

739
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,090
of course from Nazi Germany.

740
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:49,624
And the Soviet Union, Bandera walks away

741
00:40:49,624 --> 00:40:54,420
and presides over the act of the split over the organization

742
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,120
of Ukrainian nationalists into two groups.

743
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,660
The most radical one you called Revolutionary,

744
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,533
they call themselves Revolutionary, is led by Bandera.

745
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,480
They worked together with the Nazi Germany at that time,

746
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,530
with the hope that Nazi Germany would deliver them

747
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,453
independent Ukraine.

748
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:20,520
First days of the German attack,

749
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,247
Nazi attack on the Soviet Union.

750
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:27,247
The units formed on the basis of organization,

751
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,410
Ukrainian National march into the city of Lviv,

752
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,333
and declare Ukrainian independence.

753
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,680
That was not sanctioned by the German authorities,

754
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,453
that was not in German plans.

755
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:44,234
So they arrest Bandera, members of his family, his brothers,

756
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:47,573
leaders of the organization.

757
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:52,573
So his two brothers go to Auschwitz, die there.

758
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,988
He was sent to Sachsenhausen for

759
00:41:56,988 --> 00:42:01,353
most duration of the war until 1944,

760
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:07,080
refusing to revoke declaration of Ukrainian independence,

761
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,450
which again, contributes further

762
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,480
to his mythology after the war.

763
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,060
He never comes back to Ukraine.

764
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,118
He lives in exile in Munich.

765
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:22,118
So between 1930 and his death in 1959,

766
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,088
he spent in Ukraine maybe up to two years,

767
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,470
maybe a little bit more,

768
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,470
but most of the time was either in the Polish prison

769
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:38,335
or in the German concentration camp or in exile.

770
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:43,050
But the myth of Bandera lived,

771
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,690
and all the members of the organization

772
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,770
of Ukrainian nationalists

773
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,368
and then the Ukrainian insurgent army

774
00:42:48,368 --> 00:42:53,167
that fought against the Soviets all the way into the early

775
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,493
1950s, they were called Banderites.

776
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,110
They were called Banderites by the Soviet authorities.

777
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,025
They were known also in that way to the local population.

778
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:07,723
So there was a far away leader that barely was there

779
00:43:07,723 --> 00:43:12,480
on the spot, but whose name was attached

780
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,485
to this movement for really liberation

781
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:17,190
of Ukraine at that time.

782
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,870
Again, the battle that failed.

783
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,779
- The fact that he collaborated with the Nazis sticks.

784
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:23,375
For one perspective

785
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:27,870
he's considered by many to be a hero of Ukraine, fighting

786
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,910
for the independence of Ukraine.

787
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:34,233
From another perspective, coupled with the fact

788
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:38,940
that there's this radical, revolutionary extremist flavor

789
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,328
to the way he sees the world.

790
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:45,328
That label just stays, that he's a fascist, he's a Nazi.

791
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:49,890
To what degree is this true?

792
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,010
To what degree is it not?

793
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,970
- Nazi, this label is certainly promoted by, first,

794
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,350
by the Soviet propaganda

795
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,390
and then by Russian propaganda.

796
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,779
It works very nicely.

797
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:03,779
If you focus on the years of collaboration,

798
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:07,122
those were the same years when Joseph Stalin

799
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:08,940
collaborated with Hitler.

800
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,990
Right?

801
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,038
So we have the same reason

802
00:44:12,038 --> 00:44:17,038
to call Stalin Nazi collaborator as we have

803
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:21,780
the reason to call Bandera Nazi collaborator.

804
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,894
We look at the situation in the Pacific,

805
00:44:25,894 --> 00:44:29,206
in Indonesia and other places, the leaders

806
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:34,206
who worked together with Japanese, with the idea

807
00:44:34,222 --> 00:44:36,723
of promoting independence of their countries

808
00:44:36,723 --> 00:44:40,530
after the Japanese collapse, become leaders of the empire.

809
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,093
So the difference with Bandera is

810
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:45,273
that he never becomes the leader of empire

811
00:44:45,273 --> 00:44:47,627
and immunity that comes with

812
00:44:47,627 --> 00:44:52,087
that position certainly doesn't apply to him.

813
00:44:52,087 --> 00:44:57,030
But there are other parts of his life,

814
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,570
which certainly put this whole thing in question.

815
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,637
The fate of his family,

816
00:45:01,637 --> 00:45:05,350
his own time in the German concentration camp,

817
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,717
certainly don't fit the propaganda

818
00:45:08,717 --> 00:45:12,553
one-sided image of Bandera.

819
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:16,860
In terms of him being a hero, that's a very,

820
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,060
very interesting question

821
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,570
because he is perceived in Ukraine today,

822
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,950
not by all, and probably not by the majority,

823
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,010
but by many people in Ukraine as a symbol

824
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:33,990
of fighting against the Soviet Union

825
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,695
and by extension against Russia and Russian occupation.

826
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:38,789
So his popularity grew

827
00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:43,762
after February 24th, 2022, as a symbol

828
00:45:43,762 --> 00:45:44,794
of that resistance.

829
00:45:44,794 --> 00:45:48,358
Again, we are talking here about myth and mythology,

830
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:52,830
because Bandera was not leading the fight against

831
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,429
the Soviet occupation

832
00:45:56,429 --> 00:46:00,394
in Ukraine, because at that time he was just simply

833
00:46:00,394 --> 00:46:02,640
not in Ukraine, he was in Germany.

834
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,995
And you can imagine that geography mattered at

835
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,250
that time much more than it matters today.

836
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,361
- There's a million questions to ask here.

837
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:11,670
I think it's an important topic

838
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:16,159
because it is at the center of the claimed reason

839
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:18,996
that the war continues in Ukraine.

840
00:46:18,996 --> 00:46:20,880
And so I would like to explore

841
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,140
that from different angles.

842
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,170
But just to clarify, was there a moment where Bandera chose

843
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,629
Nazi Germany over the Red Army when the war already began?

844
00:46:32,629 --> 00:46:35,787
So in the list of allegiances,

845
00:46:35,787 --> 00:46:38,454
is Ukraine's independence more important

846
00:46:38,454 --> 00:46:42,873
than fighting Nazi Germany, essentially?

847
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,424
- The Ukrainian independence was their goal,

848
00:46:46,424 --> 00:46:51,145
and they were there to work with anybody

849
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:55,250
who would support and in one way

850
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,020
or at least allow the Ukrainian independence.

851
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,306
So there is no question that

852
00:46:59,306 --> 00:47:02,608
they're just classic nationalists.

853
00:47:02,608 --> 00:47:05,524
So the goal is,

854
00:47:05,524 --> 00:47:09,000
nationalism is the principle according to which,

855
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,060
or at least one definitions is according

856
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,630
to which the cultural boundaries coincide

857
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,742
with political boundaries.

858
00:47:16,742 --> 00:47:21,742
So their goal was to create political boundaries

859
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:24,840
that would coincide with the geographic boundaries in the

860
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,297
conditions of the World War II.

861
00:47:27,297 --> 00:47:31,379
And certainly making deals with whoever

862
00:47:31,379 --> 00:47:36,379
would either support, as I said,

863
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:39,870
or tolerate that project of theirs.

864
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,980
- So I would love to find the line between nationalism,

865
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,002
even extreme nationalism and fascism and Nazim.

866
00:47:47,002 --> 00:47:50,883
So for Bandera the myth and Bandera the person,

867
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:55,922
to what degree, let's look at some of the ideology of Nazis.

868
00:47:55,922 --> 00:47:58,258
To which degree did he hate Jews?

869
00:47:58,258 --> 00:47:59,823
Was he anti-Semitic?

870
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:06,434
- We know that basically in his circle, there were people

871
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,440
who were anti-Semites in a sense that, okay,

872
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,180
we have the texts, right?

873
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,410
We know that.

874
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,320
We don't have that information about

875
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,860
or that sort of text

876
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,749
or that sort of evidence with regard to Bandera himself.

877
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:27,749
In terms of fascism, there is very clear

878
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,186
and there is research done

879
00:48:30,186 --> 00:48:33,720
that in particular Italian fascism

880
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,420
had influence on the thinking of people in

881
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,138
that organization, including people at the top.

882
00:48:40,138 --> 00:48:44,800
But it is also very important to keep in mind

883
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,540
that they called themselves

884
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,071
nationalists and revolutionaries.

885
00:48:50,071 --> 00:48:55,071
And despite the fact that in 1939 and 1940

886
00:48:55,324 --> 00:48:58,795
and 1941, it was very beneficial for them

887
00:48:58,795 --> 00:49:02,055
to declare themselves to be Ukrainian fascists

888
00:49:02,055 --> 00:49:06,990
and establish this bond with, not just

889
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,405
with Italy, but with Nazi Germany.

890
00:49:11,405 --> 00:49:13,315
They refuse to do that,

891
00:49:13,315 --> 00:49:16,816
and then they refuse to recall their independence.

892
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:21,780
So influences, yes,

893
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:26,780
but clearly it's a different type of a political project.

894
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,530
- So lemme fast forward into the future

895
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,554
and see to which degree the myth permeates.

896
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:38,143
Does Ukraine have a neo-Nazi problem?

897
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:40,990
- My understanding is there are Nazis in Ukraine

898
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:47,420
and there are supporters of white supremacy theories,

899
00:49:51,147 --> 00:49:56,147
but also my understanding is that they're

900
00:49:56,184 --> 00:49:58,030
extremely marginal

901
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,120
and they're more marginal than the same sort of groups

902
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,313
are in central Europe,

903
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,883
maybe in the US as well.

904
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,430
And for me, the question is

905
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,101
not whether the Ukraine has it,

906
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:22,473
but why even in the conditions of the war,

907
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:28,561
the radical nationalism and extremism

908
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:33,005
and white supremacist is such a marginal force

909
00:50:33,005 --> 00:50:37,594
when in the countries that are not at the war, this is this,

910
00:50:37,594 --> 00:50:40,380
you look at France, you look at, again,

911
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,090
it's not exactly national,

912
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,899
but really right, radical right

913
00:50:44,899 --> 00:50:47,615
is becoming so important.

914
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:52,615
Why Ukraine and the conditions of the war

915
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,164
is the country that

916
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:57,754
manages relations between different ethnic groups

917
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:02,754
and languages in the way that strengthens political nation.

918
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,880
So for me, as a scholar,

919
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,530
and a researcher, what I see is that in Ukraine,

920
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:13,230
the influence of the far right

921
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:17,767
in different variations is much lower than it is

922
00:51:17,767 --> 00:51:20,670
among some of Ukraine's neighbors

923
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,422
and in Europe in general.

924
00:51:22,422 --> 00:51:25,607
And the question is why, I don't know, I have guesses.

925
00:51:25,607 --> 00:51:27,360
I don't know answer.

926
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,291
But that's the question

927
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:32,891
that I think is interesting to answer.

928
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:35,124
How Ukraine ended up

929
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:39,252
to be the only country in the world outside of Israel

930
00:51:39,252 --> 00:51:40,085
who has a Jewish president, who is,

931
00:51:40,085 --> 00:51:44,280
my at least understanding,

932
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,384
is the most popular president in history in terms of

933
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:52,290
how long his popularity goes after the election.

934
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,280
So this are the really, from my point of view,

935
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,260
interesting, interesting questions

936
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,690
and again, we can certainly debate that.

937
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,421
- So just for context,

938
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:07,421
the most popular far right party won 2.15%

939
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,930
of the vote in 2019, this is before the war.

940
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,773
So that's where things stood.

941
00:52:11,773 --> 00:52:13,476
It's unclear where they stand now.

942
00:52:13,476 --> 00:52:16,151
It'd be an interesting question whether it escalated

943
00:52:16,151 --> 00:52:19,634
and how much, what you're saying is that war in general

944
00:52:19,634 --> 00:52:24,634
can serve as a catalyst for expansion of extremist groups

945
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:27,728
of extremist nationalistic groups,

946
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:30,360
especially like the far right.

947
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:35,360
And it's interesting to see to what degree they have

948
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,300
or have not risen to power sort of in the shadows.

949
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,771
- So no nationalist

950
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:43,980
or nationalistic party actually crossed the barrier

951
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,240
to get into the parliament.

952
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,048
So Ukraine is the country where there is no right

953
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:50,790
or far right in the parliament.

954
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,410
We can't say that about Germany,

955
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,700
we can't say that about France.

956
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,840
So that's just one more way

957
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,637
to stress this unique place of Ukraine in that sense.

958
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:06,913
And the year 2019 is the year already of the war.

959
00:53:06,913 --> 00:53:11,814
The war started in 2014 with the annexation of the Crimea.

960
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,910
The frontline was near Donbas.

961
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,441
All these groups are fighting there.

962
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:20,493
So Ukraine, maybe not to a degree that it is now,

963
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:22,500
was already on the war footing.

964
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,500
And yet, the right party couldn't get more than 2%.

965
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:31,170
So that's the question that I have in mind.

966
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,058
And yes, the war historically

967
00:53:33,058 --> 00:53:35,345
of course puts forward

968
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:40,345
and makes from the more nationalist views

969
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,861
and forces turn them from marginal forces

970
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:45,027
into more central ones.

971
00:53:45,027 --> 00:53:46,744
We talked about Bandera

972
00:53:46,744 --> 00:53:49,734
and we talked about organization of Ukrainian nationalists.

973
00:53:49,734 --> 00:53:53,920
They were the most marginal group in the political spectrum

974
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,743
in Ukraine in the 1930s that one can only imagine.

975
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,095
But World War II comes

976
00:54:02,095 --> 00:54:06,270
and they become the most central group

977
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:10,380
because they also were from the start, go, they knew

978
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,689
they had the organization.

979
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:14,681
Violence was basically one of their means.

980
00:54:14,681 --> 00:54:16,137
They knew how to fight.

981
00:54:16,137 --> 00:54:20,880
So historically, war did produce those results.

982
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,673
So we're looking at Ukraine, we're trying

983
00:54:22,673 --> 00:54:25,230
to see what is happening there.

984
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:28,132
- So Vladimir Putin in his interview with Tucker Carlson,

985
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:29,118
but many times

986
00:54:29,118 --> 00:54:33,283
before said that the current goal for the war in Ukraine

987
00:54:33,283 --> 00:54:37,203
is denazification, that the purpose

988
00:54:37,203 --> 00:54:40,288
of the war is denazification.

989
00:54:40,288 --> 00:54:42,693
Can you explain this concept of denazification

990
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:44,967
as Putin sees it?

991
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:48,544
- Denazification is the trope

992
00:54:48,544 --> 00:54:51,990
that is accepted quite well

993
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:55,740
by the former Soviet population and Russian population.

994
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,622
In particular, the most powerful mythology,

995
00:54:58,622 --> 00:55:03,622
Soviet mythology that then was basically passed as part

996
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,360
of heritage to the Russian Federation

997
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,411
was World War II, was fighting against fascism.

998
00:55:09,411 --> 00:55:12,373
So once you use terms fascism and Nazi

999
00:55:12,373 --> 00:55:13,950
and denazification,

1000
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:18,180
suddenly people not just start listening,

1001
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,935
they just stop analyzing.

1002
00:55:19,935 --> 00:55:23,289
An as a propaganda tool this is

1003
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:26,223
of course very, very powerful tool,

1004
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,640
in terms of to what degree this is the real goal or not,

1005
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,200
we discussed the importance of the far right

1006
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:38,070
in Europe and in Ukraine.

1007
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,160
So if that's the real goal of the war,

1008
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,040
probably the war would have to start not against Ukraine,

1009
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,080
but probably against France

1010
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,585
or some other country if you take this at face value.

1011
00:55:48,585 --> 00:55:51,480
- Well, there's something really interesting here,

1012
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,566
as you mentioned that's spoken to a lot of people in Russia,

1013
00:55:55,566 --> 00:55:59,703
and you said analysis stops,

1014
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,040
in the West, people look at the word denazification

1015
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,873
and look at the things we've just discussed

1016
00:56:05,873 --> 00:56:10,062
and kind of almost think, this is absurd.

1017
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:12,885
When you talk to people in Russia,

1018
00:56:12,885 --> 00:56:16,170
maybe it's deep in there somewhere, the history

1019
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,830
of World War II still reverberates through the,

1020
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:22,869
maybe the fears, maybe the pride,

1021
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:27,313
whatever the deep emotional history is there.

1022
00:56:27,313 --> 00:56:32,010
It seems that the goal of denazification appears

1023
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,920
to be reasonable for people in Russia.

1024
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,837
They don't seem to see the absurdity or the complexity

1025
00:56:38,837 --> 00:56:43,120
or the even the need for analysis, I guess in this kind

1026
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,485
of statement, word of denazification .

1027
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:50,013
- I'll say this is broader.

1028
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,840
The war that started under the banner that Russians

1029
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,665
and Ukrainians were one and the same people

1030
00:56:56,665 --> 00:57:00,291
and produces that sort of casualty,

1031
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:05,291
really goes against also some, any sort

1032
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,483
of logical thinking.

1033
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,492
But the Russia is a place

1034
00:57:10,492 --> 00:57:13,590
where the free press doesn't exist already

1035
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,237
for a long period of time.

1036
00:57:15,237 --> 00:57:18,370
Russia is the place where there is

1037
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,779
an echo chamber to a degree.

1038
00:57:22,779 --> 00:57:25,860
And as war started first in 2014,

1039
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,722
and then all out war in 2022,

1040
00:57:29,722 --> 00:57:34,170
I came across a lot of people on the personal level,

1041
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,970
but also in the media reporting

1042
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,490
that they really can't find common language

1043
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:42,810
with their close relatives in Russia, people

1044
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:45,660
who visited Ukraine, who know that it is not taken over

1045
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,829
by nationalists and is not taken over by Nazis.

1046
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:53,517
But the media around them, the neighbors around them,

1047
00:57:53,517 --> 00:57:56,199
the people that they work basically say one

1048
00:57:56,199 --> 00:57:58,165
and the same thing.

1049
00:57:58,165 --> 00:58:02,347
And we as humans in general, whatever our background,

1050
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:06,804
we are very, very, our mind is really,

1051
00:58:06,804 --> 00:58:10,445
it's relatively easy to manipulate it

1052
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:15,445
and to a degree that even even family connections

1053
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,118
and even family ties don't sometimes help

1054
00:58:20,118 --> 00:58:25,106
to maintain that ability to think

1055
00:58:25,106 --> 00:58:29,196
and to analyze on your own, to look at at the facts.

1056
00:58:29,196 --> 00:58:31,573
- So Putin has alluded

1057
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:35,565
to the Yaroslav Hunka incident in the Canadian parliament

1058
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:38,124
September, 2023.

1059
00:58:38,124 --> 00:58:41,790
This man is a veteran

1060
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,569
of World War II on the Ukrainian side,

1061
00:58:43,569 --> 00:58:47,824
and he got two standing ovations in the Canadian parliament,

1062
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:52,066
but they later found out that he was part of the SS.

1063
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:55,844
So can you explain on this, what are your thoughts on this?

1064
00:58:55,844 --> 00:59:00,844
This had a very big effect on the narrative, I guess

1065
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,540
propagated throughout the region.

1066
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,213
- Yes.

1067
00:59:05,213 --> 00:59:08,480
What happened during World War II

1068
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:13,385
was that once the Germans started to run out

1069
00:59:13,385 --> 00:59:16,426
of manpower, they created

1070
00:59:16,426 --> 00:59:21,426
sort of foreign legion groups.

1071
00:59:21,593 --> 00:59:24,950
But because those people were not Aryans,

1072
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,315
they were created for fighting

1073
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:28,734
on the battleground

1074
00:59:28,734 --> 00:59:32,843
because they were not Aryans, they couldn't be trusted.

1075
00:59:32,843 --> 00:59:37,662
So they were put under the command of Heinrich Himmler

1076
00:59:37,662 --> 00:59:39,600
under command of SS

1077
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,473
and became known as SS Waffen units.

1078
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:47,738
And one of such units was created in Ukraine

1079
00:59:47,738 --> 00:59:50,850
with great difficulties

1080
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:54,098
because Nazis didn't consider Slavs to be generally

1081
00:59:54,098 --> 00:59:57,490
worthy of even even that sort

1082
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,685
of foreign legion formations.

1083
00:59:59,685 --> 01:00:02,190
But they made an exception

1084
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,680
because those people were coming from Galatia,

1085
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,570
which was part of Austria Hungary,

1086
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,340
which means part of Austria,

1087
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:12,436
which means somehow were open to the benevolent influence

1088
01:00:12,436 --> 01:00:14,983
of the Germanic race

1089
01:00:14,983 --> 01:00:19,983
and called the Division Galatian, or Galatia,

1090
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:28,110
part of Ukrainian youth joined the Galatian division.

1091
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,623
The one of the explanations was

1092
01:00:30,623 --> 01:00:34,245
that they were looking at the experience of World War I

1093
01:00:34,245 --> 01:00:37,500
and seeing that the units,

1094
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,524
the Ukrainian units in the Austrian army then played a very

1095
01:00:40,524 --> 01:00:43,440
important role in the fight for independence.

1096
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,970
So that is one of the explanations.

1097
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,320
You can't just use one explanation

1098
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,278
to describe motivations of everyone

1099
01:00:50,278 --> 01:00:54,120
and every single person who was joined in there.

1100
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,239
So they were sent to the front,

1101
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:59,920
they were defeated within a few short days

1102
01:01:00,854 --> 01:01:03,324
by the Red Army.

1103
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:07,499
And then were retreating through

1104
01:01:07,499 --> 01:01:10,950
Slovakia where they were used to fight

1105
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,600
with the partisan movement there

1106
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,210
and eventually surrendered to the British.

1107
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,483
So that's the story.

1108
01:01:17,483 --> 01:01:21,644
You can personally maybe understand

1109
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:25,230
what the good motivations were

1110
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:26,428
of this person or that person.

1111
01:01:26,428 --> 01:01:31,428
But that is one of the best, one of the very tragic

1112
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,942
and unfortunate pages

1113
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:37,481
in Ukrainian history.

1114
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:42,481
You can't justify that as a phenomenon.

1115
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:48,352
So from that point of view, the celebration

1116
01:01:48,352 --> 01:01:51,287
of that experience as opposed to looking at that, okay,

1117
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:52,740
that happened.

1118
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:56,860
And we wish that tho those young men

1119
01:01:57,883 --> 01:01:58,716
who were idealistic

1120
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:02,340
or joined the division for idealistic purposes had

1121
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,136
better understanding of things or made other choices.

1122
01:02:05,136 --> 01:02:08,880
But you can't certainly celebrate it.

1123
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,670
And once that happened, that of course became

1124
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:15,670
a big propaganda item in the current war,

1125
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,390
we're talking about about 10

1126
01:02:22,777 --> 01:02:24,783
to 20,000 people in the division,

1127
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:28,110
and we're talking about two

1128
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:31,472
to 3 million Ukrainians fighting in the Red Army.

1129
01:02:31,472 --> 01:02:34,174
And again, it's not like Red Army's

1130
01:02:34,174 --> 01:02:38,040
is completely blameless in the way how it behaved

1131
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,160
in Prussia in Germany and so on and so forth.

1132
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,555
But it's basically, again,

1133
01:02:42,555 --> 01:02:45,600
we are going back to the story of Bandera.

1134
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,580
So there is a period of collaboration

1135
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:51,308
and that's what propaganda tries to define him by.

1136
01:02:51,308 --> 01:02:55,225
Or there is a division Galatian by 20,000 people

1137
01:02:55,225 --> 01:02:59,670
and somehow it makes irrelevant, the experience of two

1138
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:01,380
to 3 million people.

1139
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,469
- I mean, just to clarify,

1140
01:03:02,469 --> 01:03:05,839
I think there's just a blunder on the Canadian parliament

1141
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:10,839
side, the Canadian side of not doing research of, maybe,

1142
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,480
correct me if I'm wrong,

1143
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,068
but from my understanding, they were just doing

1144
01:03:15,068 --> 01:03:17,627
stupid shallow political stuff.

1145
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:21,330
Let's applaud, you know, when Zelenskyy shows up,

1146
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,620
let's have a Ukrainian veteran, let's applaud a veteran

1147
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:27,060
of World War II, and then all of a sudden you realize, well,

1148
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,702
there's actually complexities towards, we can talk about,

1149
01:03:29,702 --> 01:03:32,693
for example, a lot of dark aspects on all sides

1150
01:03:32,693 --> 01:03:36,257
of World War II, the mass rape at the end of World War II

1151
01:03:36,257 --> 01:03:38,244
by the Red Army.

1152
01:03:38,244 --> 01:03:40,507
When they say martial German, there's a lot

1153
01:03:40,507 --> 01:03:43,903
of really dark complexity in it on all sides.

1154
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,710
So, you know, that could be an opportunity

1155
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:48,465
to explore the dark complexity that some

1156
01:03:48,465 --> 01:03:51,450
of the Ukrainians were in the SS,

1157
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,382
or Bandera, the complexities there.

1158
01:03:53,382 --> 01:03:57,150
But I think they were doing not a complex thing.

1159
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:59,479
They were doing a very shallow applaud,

1160
01:03:59,479 --> 01:04:02,070
and we should applaud veterans, of course.

1161
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,530
But in that case, they were doing it for show,

1162
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:05,820
for Zelenskyy and so on.

1163
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,300
So we should clarify that the applause wasn't knowing,

1164
01:04:11,339 --> 01:04:15,346
it wasn't for the SS, (laughs) it was for a Ukrainian,

1165
01:04:15,346 --> 01:04:19,104
it was for World War II veterans, but the propaganda,

1166
01:04:19,104 --> 01:04:24,018
or at least an interpretation from the Russian

1167
01:04:24,018 --> 01:04:26,726
side, from whatever side is

1168
01:04:26,726 --> 01:04:31,080
that they were applauding the full person standing

1169
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,157
before them, which wasn't just a Ukrainian veteran,

1170
01:04:33,157 --> 01:04:36,750
but Ukrainian veteran that fought for the SS.

1171
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:39,720
- I don't have any particular insights,

1172
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,094
but I would be very much surprised if even one person

1173
01:04:43,094 --> 01:04:45,930
in the parliament, I mean the members

1174
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,900
of the parliament actually knew the whole story.

1175
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,250
I would be very surprised.

1176
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,792
- Yeah, the whole story of this person,

1177
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:56,792
and frankly the whole story of Ukraine and Russia

1178
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:58,383
and World War II period.

1179
01:04:58,383 --> 01:04:59,283
- Yes, yes.

1180
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,760
- Nevertheless, it had a lot of power

1181
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,071
and really reverberated in support of the narrative

1182
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:09,532
that there is a neo-Nazi, a Nazi problem in Ukraine.

1183
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:12,680
- This is the narrative that is out there,

1184
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,680
and especially powerful in Russia,

1185
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:21,251
it's especially powerful in Russia, given that there are

1186
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:26,251
really the atmosphere

1187
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:29,856
that has created really is not conducive

1188
01:05:29,856 --> 01:05:32,640
to any independent analysis.

1189
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,407
- Well, I wonder what is the most effective way to respond

1190
01:05:34,407 --> 01:05:37,983
to that particular claim?

1191
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:41,985
Because there could be a discussion about nationalism

1192
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:45,180
and extreme nationalism and the fight for independence

1193
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:49,253
and whether it isn't like Putin wrote, one people,

1194
01:05:49,253 --> 01:05:52,262
but the question of are there Nazis in Ukraine seems

1195
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:55,150
to be a question that could be

1196
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:03,390
analyzed rigorously with data.

1197
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:05,460
- That is being done on the academic level.

1198
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,520
But in terms of the public response

1199
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:13,260
and public discourse, the only response

1200
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,124
that I see is not to focus

1201
01:06:16,124 --> 01:06:20,340
on the questions raised and put by the propaganda,

1202
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,140
because you already become victim

1203
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,913
of that propaganda by definition.

1204
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,681
But talk about that much broadly

1205
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:32,681
and talk about different aspects,

1206
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:35,273
or if it is World War II, about different aspects

1207
01:06:35,273 --> 01:06:39,000
of World War II, if it's about issue

1208
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,140
of the far right in Ukraine, let's talk about US,

1209
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,570
let's talk about Russia, let's talk about France.

1210
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:46,413
Let's compare.

1211
01:06:46,413 --> 01:06:49,320
That's the only way how you deal

1212
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,667
with propaganda, because propaganda is not necessarily

1213
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:56,667
something that is an outright lie.

1214
01:06:57,142 --> 01:07:00,231
It can be just one factor

1215
01:07:00,231 --> 01:07:02,574
that's taken outta the context

1216
01:07:02,574 --> 01:07:06,316
and is blown out of proportion.

1217
01:07:06,316 --> 01:07:09,330
And that is good enough.

1218
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:11,460
- And the way to defend against that is

1219
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,922
to bring in the context.

1220
01:07:12,922 --> 01:07:16,440
Let us move gracefully throughout, back

1221
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,771
and forth through history.

1222
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:22,771
Back to Bandera, you wrote a book on the KGB spy

1223
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:24,813
Bogdan Stashinsky.

1224
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:26,913
Can you tell his story?

1225
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:31,040
- This is a story of the history of the organization

1226
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,740
of Ukrainian nationalists and Bandera as well already

1227
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:37,022
after the end of the second World War,

1228
01:07:37,022 --> 01:07:40,169
because what you got

1229
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:45,169
after the second World War, so imagine May of 1945,

1230
01:07:46,097 --> 01:07:48,813
the red banner is all over Riksdag.

1231
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,340
The Red Army is in control of half of Europe,

1232
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,844
but the units of the Red Army are still fighting the war,

1233
01:07:56,844 --> 01:08:01,230
and not just behind the Soviet lines,

1234
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:03,493
but within the borders of the Soviet Union.

1235
01:08:03,493 --> 01:08:08,493
And this war continues all the way into the early 1950s

1236
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:11,540
up to almost up to Stalin's death.

1237
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:15,840
The war is conducted by the organization

1238
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:16,716
of Ukrainian nationalists,

1239
01:08:16,716 --> 01:08:19,857
which have a Ukrainian insurgent army.

1240
01:08:19,857 --> 01:08:24,857
And the government tries to crush that resistance.

1241
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,871
So what it does is basically recruits local people

1242
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:33,871
to spy on the partisans on the underground.

1243
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,410
And Bogdan Stashinsky is one of those people.

1244
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:40,194
His family is supporting the resistance.

1245
01:08:40,194 --> 01:08:42,140
They provide food.

1246
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:46,210
His sister is engaged with one of the local

1247
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,616
commanders of this underground unit.

1248
01:08:49,616 --> 01:08:54,616
And they know everything about Stashinsky's family

1249
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,939
and they know everything about him

1250
01:08:56,939 --> 01:09:00,243
because he is also collecting funds for the underground.

1251
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,267
So they have a conversation with him saying that, okay,

1252
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:06,149
that's what we got.

1253
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:10,051
And you and your family can go to to prison

1254
01:09:10,051 --> 01:09:12,662
or you help us a little bit.

1255
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:16,830
We're interested in the fiance

1256
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:19,866
of your sister, and we wanna get him.

1257
01:09:19,866 --> 01:09:22,593
And Stashinsky says yes.

1258
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,779
And once they round up the fiance,

1259
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:29,430
he basically betrayed a member

1260
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,042
or almost member of his family.

1261
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,450
He is done.

1262
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:35,671
He can't go back to his village.

1263
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,620
He can't go back to his study.

1264
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:40,020
He was studying in Lviv at that time.

1265
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,890
So he becomes, as I write in my book,

1266
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:46,290
the secret police becomes his family.

1267
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:48,689
And he is sent to Kyiv.

1268
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:52,410
He is trained for two years, sent to East Germany,

1269
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:56,206
into Berlin and becomes an assassin.

1270
01:09:56,206 --> 01:09:58,832
So they sent him across the

1271
01:09:58,832 --> 01:10:03,832
border to Western Germany, to Munich,

1272
01:10:04,904 --> 01:10:08,080
which was the headquarter of different

1273
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:12,107
organizations, anti-Soviet organizations, Ukrainian

1274
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:16,440
and Russian and Georgian and so on and so forth.

1275
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,046
And he kills two leaders

1276
01:10:19,046 --> 01:10:24,046
of the organization of Ukrainian nationalists, one editor

1277
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:28,710
of the newspaper, and eventually he kills Bandera.

1278
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:32,880
He does that with the new weapon,

1279
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,310
a spray pistol that eventually makes it into the Bond

1280
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:39,897
novel, The Man With The Golden Gun.

1281
01:10:39,897 --> 01:10:44,760
And that whole episode is a little bit reshaped,

1282
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,640
but it's not in the film, but it's in the novel itself.

1283
01:10:51,228 --> 01:10:55,363
And then later has a change of mind under the influence

1284
01:10:55,363 --> 01:11:00,363
of his German fiance and then wife.

1285
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:03,505
They decide to escape to the west.

1286
01:11:03,505 --> 01:11:08,505
And while they're doing that, they discover that their

1287
01:11:10,732 --> 01:11:12,870
apartment was bugged, and probably the KGB knows

1288
01:11:13,838 --> 01:11:14,671
all of that.

1289
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:19,195
so a long story short, his son dies

1290
01:11:19,195 --> 01:11:24,195
in Berlin, the KGB doesn't allow him to go there,

1291
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,920
but his wife has a nervous breakdown.

1292
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,890
So they allow him to go there to just calm her so

1293
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:33,703
that there would be no scandal.

1294
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:37,140
And two of them, one day

1295
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,723
before their son's burial,

1296
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:43,846
because after that they would be sent to Moscow.

1297
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:45,551
They jumped the ship

1298
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:50,010
and go to West Berlin, two hours

1299
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:55,010
before the Berlin Wall was being built.

1300
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,140
So if they would stay for the funeral,

1301
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:01,290
probably the KGB would not let them go.

1302
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:02,670
But also if they would stay,

1303
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,250
the border would be there.

1304
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:08,460
And he goes to the American intelligence

1305
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,519
and says, okay, that's who I am,

1306
01:12:10,519 --> 01:12:11,960
and that's what I did.

1307
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,133
And they look at him and they say, we don't trust you.

1308
01:12:16,133 --> 01:12:20,681
We dunno who you are, you have documents in five names.

1309
01:12:20,681 --> 01:12:23,321
You say you killed Bandera.

1310
01:12:23,321 --> 01:12:25,389
Well, we have a different information.

1311
01:12:25,389 --> 01:12:29,324
He was poisoned and probably by someone

1312
01:12:29,324 --> 01:12:34,324
in his close circle.

1313
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:35,553
A spray pistol?

1314
01:12:37,539 --> 01:12:41,335
Did you read too much Ian Fleming,

1315
01:12:41,335 --> 01:12:43,083
where does this come from?

1316
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,870
He insists, they said, okay,

1317
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:49,140
you insist, if you committed all those crimes,

1318
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,090
we're giving you to the German police.

1319
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:54,960
And German police will be investigating you.

1320
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,510
And then the trial comes.

1321
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:02,510
And if he takes back his testimony,

1322
01:13:02,725 --> 01:13:07,725
the whole case against him collapses, he can go free.

1323
01:13:07,789 --> 01:13:10,026
But he knows that if he goes free, he is a target

1324
01:13:10,026 --> 01:13:14,580
of his colleagues from the same department.

1325
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:17,883
So his task at the trial is to prove that he's guilty,

1326
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:19,923
that he did that.

1327
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:25,860
And then he disappears and nobody knows where he goes.

1328
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,444
And there are all sorts of cover stories.

1329
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:31,720
And I was lucky to interview a commander, former chief

1330
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:36,594
of the South African police, confirmed to me that

1331
01:13:36,594 --> 01:13:37,427
Stashinsky was in South Africa.

1332
01:13:37,427 --> 01:13:41,412
- He fled.

1333
01:13:41,412 --> 01:13:44,040
- The West German intelligence thought

1334
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,121
that it was too dangerous for him to stay in Germany.

1335
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:49,427
They sent him under a different name

1336
01:13:49,427 --> 01:13:51,140
to South Africa.

1337
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:56,140
So that's the story of Stashinsky himself.

1338
01:13:57,586 --> 01:13:59,024
But going back to Bandera, of course, the fact that

1339
01:13:59,024 --> 01:14:03,099
he confessed and it became known

1340
01:14:03,099 --> 01:14:06,700
that KGB assassinated Bandera, that added to the

1341
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,180
image and to general mythology about Bandera.

1342
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,590
- What a fascinating story

1343
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:17,087
of a village boy becoming an assassin who killed one

1344
01:14:17,087 --> 01:14:20,984
of the most influential revolutionaries of the region

1345
01:14:20,984 --> 01:14:22,429
in the 20th century.

1346
01:14:22,429 --> 01:14:27,003
So just zooming out broadly then in KGB,

1347
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,910
how powerful was the KGB?

1348
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:32,910
What role did it play in this whole

1349
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:34,740
story of the Soviet Union?

1350
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,690
- It depends on the period.

1351
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:39,246
At the time that we just described, late fifties

1352
01:14:39,246 --> 01:14:44,246
and early sixties, they were not powerful at all.

1353
01:14:44,692 --> 01:14:49,692
And the reasons for that was that

1354
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:52,350
people like (speaks foreign language)

1355
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:54,180
were really concerned about the secret

1356
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,280
police becoming too powerful.

1357
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,085
It became too powerful in their mind under Stalin.

1358
01:15:00,085 --> 01:15:03,032
And it was concern about

1359
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:08,032
Beria's power as a secret police chief that led to the

1360
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:13,771
coup against Beria and Kryuchkov come into power

1361
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,953
and Beria was arrested and executed.

1362
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:19,950
And what Kryuchkov was trying to do

1363
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,543
after that was trying to put

1364
01:15:22,543 --> 01:15:27,543
since '54, the name was already KGB,

1365
01:15:27,897 --> 01:15:29,014
KGB under his control.

1366
01:15:29,014 --> 01:15:34,014
So he was appointing the former council leaders

1367
01:15:34,222 --> 01:15:36,900
as the heads of the KGB.

1368
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,017
So the people who really,

1369
01:15:38,017 --> 01:15:43,017
really owned everything to him, that sort of position

1370
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:47,570
and the heads of the KGB were not members of (indistinct),

1371
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,510
it changed in the seventies with Andropov where KGB

1372
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,460
started to play again, very important role

1373
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,148
in the Soviet history

1374
01:15:58,148 --> 01:16:02,079
and let's say decisions on Afghanistan

1375
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,342
and the Soviet troops marching into Afghanistan were made

1376
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:11,342
apart from Beria, by the trio of the

1377
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,290
people who are not,

1378
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:15,942
would be called today, (speaks foreign language)

1379
01:16:15,942 --> 01:16:17,424
or not all of them were (speaks foreign language)

1380
01:16:17,424 --> 01:16:19,890
but one of course was Andropov, the head of the KGB.

1381
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:23,370
Another was the Minister of Defense.

1382
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,170
And then there was secretary in charge

1383
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:26,790
of the military Industrial Complexity,

1384
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:29,490
Minister of Foreign Affairs.

1385
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:30,348
So, the head

1386
01:16:30,348 --> 01:16:32,282
of the KGB became really

1387
01:16:32,282 --> 01:16:34,830
not just the member of (speaks foreign language)

1388
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:38,280
but the member of that inner circle.

1389
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,181
And then the fact that Andropov

1390
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:44,547
succeeds Beria is also a manifestation of the power

1391
01:16:44,547 --> 01:16:46,950
that KGB acquired really

1392
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:50,733
after Kryuchkov in the 1970s

1393
01:16:50,733 --> 01:16:53,070
and then going into the 1980s.

1394
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:54,130
- Who was more powerful, the KGB

1395
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:58,377
or the CIA during the Soviet Union?

1396
01:16:58,377 --> 01:17:03,300
- The CIA, it's the organization that

1397
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,497
is charged with the

1398
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:08,730
information gathering

1399
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:12,600
and all sorts of operations including assassinations

1400
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,153
in the fifties and sixties abroad.

1401
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,370
The KGB was the organization that really

1402
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:22,985
had both the surveillance

1403
01:17:22,985 --> 01:17:26,657
over the population within the Soviet Union

1404
01:17:26,657 --> 01:17:31,470
and also the operations abroad.

1405
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:32,532
And its members,

1406
01:17:32,532 --> 01:17:37,532
its leaders were members of the inner circle

1407
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,448
for making decisions.

1408
01:17:39,448 --> 01:17:42,085
Again, from what I understand about the way

1409
01:17:42,085 --> 01:17:45,360
how politics and decision work

1410
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,140
and decisions are made in the United States,

1411
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:52,920
the chief of the CIA is not one

1412
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,140
of the decision making group

1413
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:56,940
that providing information.

1414
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,151
Yes.

1415
01:17:58,151 --> 01:17:59,940
So I would say it's not day and night,

1416
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:02,070
but their power, political influence,

1417
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:04,860
political significance, very different.

1418
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,743
- Is it understood how big the KGB was,

1419
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,201
how widespread it was, given its secretive

1420
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:13,410
and distributed nature?

1421
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:15,109
- Certain things we know, others we don't

1422
01:18:15,109 --> 01:18:18,270
because the Stasi archives are open

1423
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,940
and most of the KGB,

1424
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,708
especially in Moscow, they're not.

1425
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:27,708
But we know that the KGB combined not only the

1426
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:33,679
internal sort of a secret police functions at home

1427
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,378
and counterintelligence branch

1428
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:40,620
and intelligence branch abroad,

1429
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:43,140
but also the border troops, for example.

1430
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,100
Right?

1431
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,410
So really institutionally

1432
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:49,106
it was a huge, huge mammoth.

1433
01:18:49,106 --> 01:18:51,963
And another thing that we know, we can sort

1434
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:54,920
of extrapolate from what we know

1435
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:59,700
from the Stasi archives, that the surveillance at home,

1436
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,218
the surveillance was really massive.

1437
01:19:02,218 --> 01:19:07,218
The guess is, the soviets were not as effective

1438
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:12,030
and as meticulous and as scrupulous

1439
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:14,560
and as methodical as probably as Germans were.

1440
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,180
But that gives you a basic idea

1441
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:21,660
of how penetrated the entire society was.

1442
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,100
- What do you think is important to understand

1443
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,125
about the KGB?

1444
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:27,027
If we want to also understand Vladimir Putin,

1445
01:19:27,027 --> 01:19:29,525
since he was a KGB foreign intelligence officer

1446
01:19:29,525 --> 01:19:32,463
for 16 years.

1447
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:38,010
- From my research, including on the Stashinsky,

1448
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,210
what I understand is that

1449
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:45,210
in KGB, and it was a powerful organization, again,

1450
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,670
less powerful in fifties and sixties,

1451
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:49,844
but still very powerful organization.

1452
01:19:49,844 --> 01:19:53,832
There was on the one hand the understanding

1453
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:56,910
of the situation in the country

1454
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:59,070
and abroad that probably

1455
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:00,783
other organizations didn't have.

1456
01:20:01,647 --> 01:20:05,616
They had also first pick in terms of selection,

1457
01:20:05,616 --> 01:20:10,350
the work in the KGB was well paid

1458
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:12,404
and considered to be very prestigious.

1459
01:20:12,404 --> 01:20:16,110
So that was part to the degree

1460
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:18,286
of the Soviet elite in terms of

1461
01:20:18,286 --> 01:20:20,460
whom they recruited.

1462
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:23,370
And they had a resentment over the party leadership.

1463
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:27,360
They didn't allow them to do James Bond kind of things

1464
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,282
that they would wanna do because there were political risks

1465
01:20:30,282 --> 01:20:35,282
after this scandal with Stashinsky,

1466
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:40,390
at least on many levels, the KGB stopped

1467
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:43,390
the practice of the assassinations,

1468
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:45,690
political assassinations abroad

1469
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,670
because it was considered politically

1470
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:50,070
to be extremely, extremely dangerous.

1471
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:52,645
The person who was in charge of the KGB at the time

1472
01:20:52,645 --> 01:20:55,620
of Bandera assassination, Shelepin,

1473
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:59,597
was one of the candidates to replace Kryuchkov

1474
01:20:59,597 --> 01:21:03,820
and Brezhnev used against him that scandal abroad

1475
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,500
eventually to remove him from (speaks foreign language)

1476
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,758
so the KGB was really looking at the party leadership

1477
01:21:08,758 --> 01:21:13,600
strategically as ineffective, corrupt

1478
01:21:15,293 --> 01:21:16,800
and who was on their way.

1479
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,493
And from what I understand, that's exactly

1480
01:21:20,493 --> 01:21:25,493
the attitudes that people

1481
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:30,617
like Putin and people of his circle brought

1482
01:21:30,617 --> 01:21:34,080
to power in Kremlin.

1483
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,130
So the methods that KGB use they can use now.

1484
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,870
And there is no party

1485
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:42,930
or no other other institution actually stopping

1486
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,151
them from doing that.

1487
01:21:44,151 --> 01:21:48,219
And the thing about, my understanding

1488
01:21:48,219 --> 01:21:52,637
the operations abroad about foreign policy in general in

1489
01:21:52,637 --> 01:21:55,755
terms of the KGB mindset of planning operations

1490
01:21:55,755 --> 01:21:59,040
and executing particular operations and so on and so forth.

1491
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,165
So I think a lot of culture that

1492
01:22:02,165 --> 01:22:06,690
came into existence in the Soviet KGB now became part

1493
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:11,690
of the culture of the Russian establishment.

1494
01:22:12,028 --> 01:22:12,861
- You wrote the book, the Russo-Ukrainian War,

1495
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:17,861
The Return of History, that gives the full

1496
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:25,251
context leading up to the invasion

1497
01:22:25,251 --> 01:22:29,607
of Ukraine by Russia in February, 2022.

1498
01:22:29,607 --> 01:22:34,607
So can you take me through the key moments in history

1499
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:37,410
that led up to this war?

1500
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:40,440
So we'll mention the collapse of the Soviet Union.

1501
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:43,853
We could probably go much farther back,

1502
01:22:43,853 --> 01:22:47,703
but the collapse of the Soviet Union mentioned 2014.

1503
01:22:47,703 --> 01:22:50,874
Maybe you can highlight key moments

1504
01:22:50,874 --> 01:22:53,817
that led up to 2022.

1505
01:22:53,817 --> 01:22:54,650
- The key moments would be first

1506
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:57,142
the (speaks foreign language)

1507
01:22:57,142 --> 01:23:02,142
known as Oragne Revolution in Ukraine,

1508
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:08,490
and then in 2014, known as the Revolution of dignity.

1509
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:13,109
Both were the revolts against something that

1510
01:23:13,109 --> 01:23:17,980
by significant part of Ukrainian population was considered

1511
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,820
to be completely,

1512
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:23,248
completely unacceptable actions on the part

1513
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:26,666
of the government and people in the government at that time.

1514
01:23:26,666 --> 01:23:29,050
So the Orange Revolution of 204

1515
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:33,428
was a protest against falsified presidential elections

1516
01:23:33,428 --> 01:23:38,428
and rejection of a candidate that was supported

1517
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,360
by Russia, publicly supported by Russia.

1518
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,160
I remember being in Moscow at that time

1519
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,170
and couldn't believe my eyes when in the center of Russia,

1520
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:49,713
I saw a billboard with Yanukovych.

1521
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,571
The trick was that there were a lot of Ukrainians

1522
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:55,980
in Russia and in Moscow in particular,

1523
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:57,978
and they had the right to vote.

1524
01:23:57,978 --> 01:24:02,815
So, and it led to the election of

1525
01:24:02,815 --> 01:24:07,815
Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych,

1526
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:13,440
who put on the agenda the issue

1527
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,720
of Ukraine's membership in NATO.

1528
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:18,845
So it was very clear pro-Western orientation.

1529
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:23,845
And the second case was the Revolution of Dignity

1530
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:26,828
2013 with some of the same characters

1531
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:29,880
including Yanukovych who at

1532
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,679
that time was already president of Ukraine.

1533
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:38,476
And there, the question was of the government

1534
01:24:38,476 --> 01:24:43,389
promising the people for one year at least

1535
01:24:43,389 --> 01:24:46,770
to sign association agreement with European Union

1536
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:50,498
and then turning over almost overnight

1537
01:24:50,498 --> 01:24:53,343
and saying that they were not going to do that.

1538
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,970
And that's how things started.

1539
01:24:56,970 --> 01:24:59,433
But then when they became really massive

1540
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:02,848
and why something that was called revolution,

1541
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:07,380
Euro revolution became Revolution of Dignity

1542
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:11,062
was when the government police

1543
01:25:11,062 --> 01:25:15,783
beat up students in downtown Kyiv,

1544
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:20,970
who judging by the reports were basically already,

1545
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:24,990
almost ready to disperse, almost ready to go home.

1546
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:27,210
And that's when roughly half

1547
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:29,103
of Kyiv showed up on the streets.

1548
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:35,070
That sort of, the police behavior, that sort of,

1549
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:37,776
was absolutely unacceptable in Ukraine.

1550
01:25:37,776 --> 01:25:41,640
Still in elections

1551
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,835
and falsification of elections was unacceptable.

1552
01:25:44,835 --> 01:25:48,450
That's where, around that time

1553
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:52,359
and around 204, the president of Ukraine at that time,

1554
01:25:52,359 --> 01:25:55,427
Leonid Kuchma, writes a book called

1555
01:25:55,427 --> 01:25:58,075
Ukraine is Not Russia.

1556
01:25:58,075 --> 01:26:01,140
And apparently the term comes from

1557
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:05,190
his discussion with Putin.

1558
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:09,000
When Putin was suggesting to him quite strongly

1559
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,580
to use force against people on the square in Kyiv.

1560
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:17,013
And Kuchma allegedly said,

1561
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:19,800
"You don't understand.

1562
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,943
Ukraine is not Russia,

1563
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,760
you can't do things like that.

1564
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,370
You get pushback."

1565
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:30,073
And that's this two events 204

1566
01:26:31,443 --> 01:26:34,627
and then 2013 became really crucial point in terms of the

1567
01:26:34,627 --> 01:26:39,627
Ukraine direction, the survival of Ukrainian democracy,

1568
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:43,350
which is one of very few countries in the post-Soviet space

1569
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:47,106
where democracy survived the original flirt

1570
01:26:47,106 --> 01:26:51,780
between the government leaders

1571
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,206
and democracy of the 1990s.

1572
01:26:54,206 --> 01:26:58,500
It was the whole Soviet story in Russia,

1573
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,473
everywhere else there was high democratic expectations,

1574
01:27:01,473 --> 01:27:05,040
but they came pretty much to an end

1575
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,810
by the end of the decade.

1576
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:08,171
Ukraine preserved the democracy

1577
01:27:08,171 --> 01:27:12,823
and the orientation of Ukraine

1578
01:27:12,823 --> 01:27:17,640
toward integration in some form, into Western

1579
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:22,380
and European structures, that

1580
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:26,760
Ukrainian democracy plus Western orientation was something.

1581
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,852
And in Russia, we see the strengthening

1582
01:27:29,852 --> 01:27:33,789
of the autocratic regime under Putin, that

1583
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:37,421
if you look deeper, these are the processes

1584
01:27:37,421 --> 01:27:40,500
that put two countries on the collision course.

1585
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,570
- So there's a division, a push

1586
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:47,091
and pull inside Ukraine on identity of whether they're part

1587
01:27:47,091 --> 01:27:50,545
of Russia or part of Europe.

1588
01:27:50,545 --> 01:27:53,865
And you highlighted two moments in Ukrainian history that

1589
01:27:53,865 --> 01:27:58,691
there's a big flare up where the statement

1590
01:27:58,691 --> 01:28:01,470
was first Ukraine is not Russia,

1591
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:03,979
and essentially Ukraine is part of Europe,

1592
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:06,243
but there's other moments.

1593
01:28:07,170 --> 01:28:08,370
What were the defining moments

1594
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:10,053
that began an actual war?

1595
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,383
- The war started in February of 2014,

1596
01:28:13,383 --> 01:28:16,920
with the Russian takeover of Crimea

1597
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,570
by military force, right?

1598
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:20,579
The so-called Green Man.

1599
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:25,579
And the big question is why,

1600
01:28:26,858 --> 01:28:31,858
and it's very important to go back to the year 2013

1601
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:36,231
and the start of the protests

1602
01:28:36,231 --> 01:28:39,960
and the story of the Ukraine signing association

1603
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,015
agreement with European Union.

1604
01:28:42,015 --> 01:28:44,260
So from what we understand today,

1605
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:48,900
the Ukrainian government under President Yanukovych,

1606
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:52,590
did this suicidal sharp turn

1607
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:54,210
after one year of promising

1608
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:56,130
association agreement saying that, okay,

1609
01:28:56,130 --> 01:29:00,040
we changed our mind under pressure from Moscow.

1610
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:04,320
And Moscow applied that pressure

1611
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,580
for one reason, at least in my opinion,

1612
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:12,450
the Ukraine signing an association agreement

1613
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:16,170
with European Union would mean

1614
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:21,120
that Ukraine would not be able to sign association agreement

1615
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,615
with any Eurasian union in any shape or form.

1616
01:29:24,615 --> 01:29:29,070
That was, at that time in the process of making,

1617
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:32,820
and for Vladimir Putin, that was the beginning of his,

1618
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:36,670
or part of his third term, one of his

1619
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,940
agenda items for the third term was really a consolidation

1620
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:45,291
of the post-Soviet space and Eurasian space,

1621
01:29:45,291 --> 01:29:48,600
and not membership in NATO,

1622
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,216
not membership in European Union,

1623
01:29:50,216 --> 01:29:55,112
but association agreement with European Union meant that

1624
01:29:55,112 --> 01:29:59,580
that post-Soviet space would have

1625
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:02,220
to exist under Moscow's control,

1626
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,720
but without Ukraine,

1627
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,420
the second largest post-Soviet Republic,

1628
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,886
the republic on whose vote depended the

1629
01:30:08,886 --> 01:30:12,780
continuing existence of the Soviet Union

1630
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,048
and whose vote ended

1631
01:30:14,048 --> 01:30:17,151
in many ways the existence of the Soviet Union.

1632
01:30:17,151 --> 01:30:20,190
So that is broadly background,

1633
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:22,039
but also there are of course personalities,

1634
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:24,900
there are also their beliefs,

1635
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,760
the readings of history.

1636
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,680
And all of that became part of the story.

1637
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,207
But if you look at that geopolitically,

1638
01:30:34,207 --> 01:30:36,578
the association agreement is

1639
01:30:36,578 --> 01:30:41,578
putting Ukraine outside of the Russian sphere of influence.

1640
01:30:44,069 --> 01:30:48,780
And the response was an attempt

1641
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:53,780
to topple the government in Kyiv that clearly was going

1642
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:01,400
to sign that agreement to take over Crimea

1643
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:05,340
and to help to deal with a lot

1644
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,440
of issues within Russia itself

1645
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:12,440
and boost the popularity of the president.

1646
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:16,111
And it certainly worked in that way as well.

1647
01:31:16,111 --> 01:31:21,111
And once Ukraine still,

1648
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,670
after Crimea continued on its path,

1649
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:25,314
then the next step started the

1650
01:31:25,314 --> 01:31:29,400
so-called hybrid warfare in Donbas.

1651
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:34,400
But again, unlike Crimea from what I understand,

1652
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:40,260
Russia was not really looking forward to taking possession

1653
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:43,480
of Donbas, Donbas was viewed as the way

1654
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:45,983
to influence Ukraine,

1655
01:31:47,556 --> 01:31:49,470
to stop if from drift towards the west.

1656
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:52,410
- Maybe you can tell me about the region of Donbas.

1657
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:54,330
- I mentioned that nationalism

1658
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:57,443
and principle of nationalism is the principle of

1659
01:31:57,443 --> 01:32:00,480
making the political borders to coincide

1660
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,163
with ethnic and cultural borders.

1661
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:05,862
And that's how the maps of

1662
01:32:05,862 --> 01:32:09,390
many East European countries had been drawn in the

1663
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,238
19th and 20th century.

1664
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:15,837
On that principle, Donbas,

1665
01:32:15,837 --> 01:32:20,657
where the majority constituted by the beginning

1666
01:32:20,657 --> 01:32:24,599
of the 20th century were Ukrainians was considered

1667
01:32:24,599 --> 01:32:26,953
to be Ukrainian and was claimed

1668
01:32:26,953 --> 01:32:31,860
in the middle of this revolution and revolutionary wars

1669
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:35,073
and civil wars by Ukrainian government.

1670
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:40,140
But Donbas became a site, one

1671
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:42,220
of the key sites in the Russian empire

1672
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:44,610
of early industrialization,

1673
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:48,630
and its mining industry with mythological industry.

1674
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:53,130
So what that meant was that people from other parts of,

1675
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:54,166
not Ukraine, but other parts

1676
01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:56,910
of the Russian empire congregated there,

1677
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,128
that's where jobs were.

1678
01:32:58,128 --> 01:32:59,700
That's how Kryuchkov

1679
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:03,330
and his family came to Donbas, the family

1680
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:05,340
of Brezhnev overshoot a little bit.

1681
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:08,029
They got to the industrial enterprises in the city

1682
01:33:08,029 --> 01:33:11,133
of Kaminsk,

1683
01:33:12,661 --> 01:33:15,570
the city that was called. (speaks foreign language)

1684
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:18,310
So those were Russian peasants moving into the area

1685
01:33:20,915 --> 01:33:22,113
looking for the job.

1686
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:27,980
And the population became quite mixed.

1687
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:34,010
Ukrainians still constituted the majority of the population,

1688
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:37,800
but not necessarily in the towns and in the cities.

1689
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,770
And culturally, the place was becoming more

1690
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:44,226
and more Russian as the result of that moment.

1691
01:33:44,226 --> 01:33:47,724
So apart from the Crimea,

1692
01:33:47,724 --> 01:33:50,940
Donbas was the part of Ukraine

1693
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:53,399
where the ethnic Russians were

1694
01:33:53,399 --> 01:33:56,460
the biggest group.

1695
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:57,480
They were not the majority,

1696
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,510
but they were very, very big and significant group.

1697
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:03,500
For example, in the city of Mariupol, that was all

1698
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,848
but destroyed in the course of the last two years,

1699
01:34:07,848 --> 01:34:12,510
the ethnic Russians constituted over 40%

1700
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:14,940
of the population, right?

1701
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,520
So that's not exactly part of Donbas,

1702
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,213
but that gives you general idea.

1703
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,580
Now the story of Donbas

1704
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:28,200
and what happened now is multidimensional.

1705
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,833
And this ethnic composition is just one part of the story.

1706
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:35,044
Another very important part of the story is economy.

1707
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:40,044
And Donbas is a classical rust belt.

1708
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:46,680
And we know what happens with the cities that were part

1709
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:47,741
of the first or second wave

1710
01:34:47,741 --> 01:34:51,300
of industrialization in the United States and globally,

1711
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:54,642
know about social problems that exist in those places.

1712
01:34:54,642 --> 01:34:58,410
So Donbas is probably the most dramatic

1713
01:34:58,410 --> 01:35:01,879
and tragic case of implosion of the rust belt

1714
01:35:01,879 --> 01:35:06,879
with the mines not anymore producing the sort of,

1715
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:11,033
and at the acceptable price, the coal that they used

1716
01:35:11,033 --> 01:35:14,950
to produce, these people losing jobs

1717
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:19,338
with the politicians looking for subsidies as opposed

1718
01:35:19,338 --> 01:35:24,338
to trying very unpopular measures of

1719
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:28,590
dealing something and bring new money

1720
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:30,960
and new investment into the region.

1721
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,370
So all of that become part of the story

1722
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:40,260
that made it easy for Russia,

1723
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:43,654
for the Russian Federation to destabilize the situation.

1724
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,880
We have interviews with Mr. Girkin

1725
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,410
who is saying that he was the first

1726
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,910
who pulled the trigger

1727
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:53,829
and fired the shot in that war.

1728
01:35:53,829 --> 01:35:57,150
He became the Minister of Defense in

1729
01:35:57,150 --> 01:36:00,070
the people's republic.

1730
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:04,750
You look at the prime minister, he is another person with

1731
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:07,653
Moscow residency permit.

1732
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,390
So you see key figures

1733
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:14,340
in those positions at the start

1734
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:18,630
and the beginning, not being Russians from Ukraine,

1735
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:20,700
but being Russians from Russia

1736
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:23,472
and Russians from Moscow closely connected

1737
01:36:23,472 --> 01:36:24,990
to the government structure

1738
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:27,540
and intelligence structure and so on.

1739
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,940
So that is the start and the beginning.

1740
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:34,328
But the way how it exploded the way it did

1741
01:36:34,328 --> 01:36:39,328
was also a combination of the economic and ethnocultural

1742
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,810
and linguistic factors.

1743
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:44,938
- So for Putin, the war on Donbas

1744
01:36:44,938 --> 01:36:49,436
and even in 2022 is a defensive war against

1745
01:36:49,436 --> 01:36:53,190
what the Ukrainian government is doing against ethnically

1746
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,309
Russian people of Donbas.

1747
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:58,110
Is that fair to say how he describes it?

1748
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:03,110
- What we see, this is certainly the argument, right?

1749
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:07,840
This is certainly the argument and a pretext

1750
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,320
because what we see there is

1751
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,817
that there would be no,

1752
01:37:14,817 --> 01:37:19,014
and there was no independent mobilization in Crimea either,

1753
01:37:19,014 --> 01:37:22,753
in Crimea, in Donbas, without Russian presence,

1754
01:37:22,753 --> 01:37:27,753
without Russian occupation de facto of the Crimea,

1755
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:30,930
there would've been no, and there was no

1756
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:34,692
before, at least in the previous five

1757
01:37:34,692 --> 01:37:38,356
to six years, any mass mobilizations of Russians,

1758
01:37:38,356 --> 01:37:43,356
there was none of such mobilizations in Donbas

1759
01:37:43,410 --> 01:37:46,597
before Gerkin and other people with military,

1760
01:37:46,597 --> 01:37:51,597
with parts of military units showed up there.

1761
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:56,451
So it is an excuse, you've been

1762
01:37:56,451 --> 01:38:01,451
to Ukraine, you know that Russian language is not

1763
01:38:01,498 --> 01:38:03,783
persecuted in Ukraine.

1764
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:08,970
And if you've not been to Donbas, it would be difficult

1765
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:10,590
or to the Crimea it would be difficult

1766
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:13,800
to find one single Ukrainian school.

1767
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,660
Not that they didn't exist at all,

1768
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:19,771
but it would take quite an effort for you to find it

1769
01:38:19,771 --> 01:38:23,870
or sometimes even to hear Ukrainian language outside either

1770
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:28,743
of the institutions or the farmer's market.

1771
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,068
So that's the reality.

1772
01:38:33,068 --> 01:38:35,970
That's the reality that is clear, that is visible.

1773
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:38,803
So imagine under those conditions

1774
01:38:38,803 --> 01:38:42,859
and context that someone is persecuting

1775
01:38:42,859 --> 01:38:46,473
ethnic Russians or Russian speakers,

1776
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,484
to believe in something like that,

1777
01:38:50,484 --> 01:38:53,370
one important precondition is

1778
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:56,913
never to step your foot in Ukraine.

1779
01:38:57,810 --> 01:39:01,500
- I should mention maybe this is a good moment to mention,

1780
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,390
when I traveled to Ukraine, this is

1781
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:04,740
after the start of the war,

1782
01:39:06,321 --> 01:39:09,540
You mentioned farmer's market, which is funny.

1783
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,574
Basically every single person I talked to,

1784
01:39:11,574 --> 01:39:15,063
including the leadership, we spoke in Russian.

1785
01:39:16,609 --> 01:39:19,620
For many of them, Russian is the more

1786
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,411
comfortable language even.

1787
01:39:21,411 --> 01:39:24,360
And the people who spoke Ukrainian are more on

1788
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:28,731
the western side of Ukraine.

1789
01:39:28,731 --> 01:39:33,000
And you know, young people that are kind of wanting to show

1790
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,890
that in an activist way that they want to fight

1791
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:39,540
for the independence of their country.

1792
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,240
So I take your point, I wonder if you wanna comment about

1793
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,633
language and maybe about the future of language in Ukraine,

1794
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:52,010
is the future of language going to stabilize on

1795
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,140
Ukrainian or is it going to return

1796
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:59,011
to its traditional base of Russian language?

1797
01:39:59,011 --> 01:40:03,270
- Very roughly before the start of the war in 2014,

1798
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:06,690
we can talk about parity between Russian and Ukrainian

1799
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:09,870
and also with, as you said,

1800
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:13,230
clearly Ukraine being a dominant language in the west

1801
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:18,120
and Russian being a dominant language on the streets,

1802
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,283
certainly in the east of the country.

1803
01:40:21,564 --> 01:40:26,490
And then in between of that

1804
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:29,737
to pause a number of these transitional areas

1805
01:40:29,737 --> 01:40:34,649
and Ukraine in my experience,

1806
01:40:34,649 --> 01:40:38,520
and I visited a lot of countries, not all of them,

1807
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,060
and probably, maybe I'll be still surprised,

1808
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:44,670
but in my experience,

1809
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:46,309
this is the only truly bilingual

1810
01:40:46,309 --> 01:40:48,900
country that I ever visited.

1811
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:50,754
I lived in Canada for a long period of time.

1812
01:40:50,754 --> 01:40:53,134
There is Quebec in the West.

1813
01:40:53,134 --> 01:40:58,134
And in Ukraine, you can talk in either Russian

1814
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:02,550
or Ukrainian in any part of the country,

1815
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,780
and you would be understood

1816
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:07,410
and you would be responded in a different language

1817
01:41:07,410 --> 01:41:10,980
with the expectation that you would understand.

1818
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,990
And if you don't understand,

1819
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:15,180
that means you don't come from Ukraine.

1820
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:16,200
That's the reality.

1821
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,500
The war and loss of the Crimea

1822
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:24,500
and partial loss of Donbas, of it's major industrial areas

1823
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:30,089
really shifted the balance toward mostly

1824
01:41:30,089 --> 01:41:35,089
Ukrainian speaking regions.

1825
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:40,773
And also what you see,

1826
01:41:40,773 --> 01:41:43,354
and you clearly pointed to that, starting

1827
01:41:43,354 --> 01:41:46,680
with 2014, even a little bit earlier,

1828
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:49,660
the younger generation chooses Ukrainian

1829
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:53,670
as a marker of its identity.

1830
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:55,200
And that started in 2014.

1831
01:41:55,200 --> 01:42:00,200
But we have a dramatic shift after 2022.

1832
01:42:01,326 --> 01:42:06,326
And on the anecdotal level, I can tell you

1833
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:08,980
that I speak to people who

1834
01:42:12,838 --> 01:42:15,023
be in Geneve at the time, this is east

1835
01:42:15,023 --> 01:42:18,120
of Crimea at the time of the Russian aggression

1836
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,560
and bombardment and so on

1837
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,430
and so forth, who had passive knowledge of Ukrainian,

1838
01:42:23,430 --> 01:42:25,808
but spoke all their life Russian.

1839
01:42:25,808 --> 01:42:28,230
And they would speak Ukrainian to me.

1840
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:30,799
And when I say, okay, why you doing that?

1841
01:42:30,799 --> 01:42:33,270
We know each other for decades

1842
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:34,290
and you used Russian?

1843
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:37,734
And he said, "Oh, I don't wanna have anything in common

1844
01:42:37,734 --> 01:42:40,773
with people who did that to us."

1845
01:42:40,773 --> 01:42:43,740
So there is a big, big push of course

1846
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:46,054
with this current war.

1847
01:42:46,054 --> 01:42:50,040
Now the question is whether this change is something

1848
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,706
that will stay or not, what is the future?

1849
01:42:52,706 --> 01:42:56,673
Linguistic practices are very, very conservative ones.

1850
01:42:56,673 --> 01:43:01,445
And we at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute have a

1851
01:43:01,445 --> 01:43:05,330
project called (speaks foreign language)

1852
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:06,163
digital atlas of Ukraine.

1853
01:43:06,163 --> 01:43:08,244
And we were documenting

1854
01:43:08,244 --> 01:43:11,760
and mapping different data in time.

1855
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:16,696
And what we noticed a spike in the people self reporting

1856
01:43:16,696 --> 01:43:18,828
of use of Ukrainian in 2014

1857
01:43:18,828 --> 01:43:23,099
and 2015, at the time of the start of the war, when

1858
01:43:23,099 --> 01:43:26,471
the threat was the most clear one,

1859
01:43:26,471 --> 01:43:28,835
this is self-reporting.

1860
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:31,383
That doesn't mean that people exactly do what,

1861
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:35,670
but they believe that that's what they're supposed to do

1862
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:39,150
and then return back to where it was

1863
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:40,503
by the year 2016 and 2017.

1864
01:43:42,867 --> 01:43:45,988
And so this dynamic can repeat itself,

1865
01:43:45,988 --> 01:43:49,863
but given the how long the war is going on,

1866
01:43:49,863 --> 01:43:53,550
how big the impact is, how big the stress is,

1867
01:43:53,550 --> 01:43:57,780
and that the wave of the future

1868
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:59,618
is probably associated with younger people

1869
01:43:59,618 --> 01:44:01,350
who are switching to Ukrainian.

1870
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:06,350
So my bet would be on

1871
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:10,923
Ukrainian language rising in prominence.

1872
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:14,993
- So as we get closer to February of 2022,

1873
01:44:14,993 --> 01:44:18,494
there's a few other key moments.

1874
01:44:18,494 --> 01:44:22,826
Maybe let's talk about in July, 2021,

1875
01:44:22,826 --> 01:44:26,970
Putin publishing an essay titled On The Historical Unity

1876
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:28,482
of Russians and Ukrainians.

1877
01:44:28,482 --> 01:44:33,482
Can you describe the ideas expressed in this essay?

1878
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:37,770
- The idea is very conveniently presented

1879
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:39,480
already in the first paragraph,

1880
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:42,764
in the first sentences really of the article

1881
01:44:42,764 --> 01:44:45,547
where Putin says that

1882
01:44:45,547 --> 01:44:47,563
"For a long time I was saying the Russians

1883
01:44:47,563 --> 01:44:50,670
and Ukrainians were one and the same people.

1884
01:44:50,670 --> 01:44:51,709
And here is the proof.

1885
01:44:51,709 --> 01:44:55,530
This is the historical,"

1886
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:58,140
he develops his historical argumentation apparently

1887
01:44:58,140 --> 01:45:03,140
with the help of a lot of people around him.

1888
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:07,080
And he started to talk about Russians

1889
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:10,440
and Ukrainians being one and the same people one year

1890
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:12,790
before the start of the war in 2014.

1891
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:17,670
So in 2013 he was together with Patriarch Kirill

1892
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:19,563
on visit to Kyiv,

1893
01:45:21,209 --> 01:45:22,145
and there was a conference specifically organized

1894
01:45:22,145 --> 01:45:24,960
for him in the Kyivan Monastery.

1895
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,684
And that's where he stated that

1896
01:45:27,684 --> 01:45:32,684
the fact that he was with Patriarch Kirill is very important

1897
01:45:33,559 --> 01:45:38,559
factor for understanding where the idea is coming from.

1898
01:45:38,781 --> 01:45:42,120
This is the idea

1899
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:46,317
that was dominant in the Russian empire of the 19th

1900
01:45:46,317 --> 01:45:48,540
and the beginning of the 20th century.

1901
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:50,670
That Russians, Ukrainians,

1902
01:45:50,670 --> 01:45:53,760
and Belarusians are really Russian, great Russians,

1903
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,460
little Russians and white Russians,

1904
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:00,051
and that they constitute one people.

1905
01:46:00,051 --> 01:46:05,051
Yes, there are some dialectical differences.

1906
01:46:05,212 --> 01:46:10,212
Yes, Ukrainians sing well, yes, they dance funny.

1907
01:46:10,997 --> 01:46:15,298
But overall that doesn't matter.

1908
01:46:15,298 --> 01:46:20,298
And that idea actually was

1909
01:46:20,471 --> 01:46:25,471
really destroyed, mostly destroyed by the revolution

1910
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:30,690
of 1917 because it wasn't just social revolution.

1911
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:31,795
That's how it is understood

1912
01:46:31,795 --> 01:46:35,610
in US, in good part of the world.

1913
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:37,945
It was also national revolution.

1914
01:46:37,945 --> 01:46:39,240
It was an empire, it was a revolution

1915
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:41,460
in the Russian Empire.

1916
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:44,730
And to bring this pieces

1917
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:47,490
of empire back within the Soviet Union,

1918
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:50,190
the Bolsheviks had to make concessions.

1919
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:54,180
And one of those concessions was to recognition

1920
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:57,027
of the existence of Ukrainians as a separate nation,

1921
01:46:57,027 --> 01:46:59,670
Belarusians as a separate nations, Russians

1922
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:01,175
as separate nations, endowing them

1923
01:47:01,175 --> 01:47:06,175
with their own territorial, with borders,

1924
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:09,870
with institutions and so on and so forth.

1925
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:14,542
But there was one institution that was not reformed,

1926
01:47:14,542 --> 01:47:18,273
that institution was called the Russian Orthodox Church.

1927
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,990
'Cause one of the ways that Bolsheviks dealt with it,

1928
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:24,594
they couldn't eradicate religion completely,

1929
01:47:24,594 --> 01:47:26,477
but they arrested the development

1930
01:47:26,477 --> 01:47:31,477
of the religion and thinking and theology on the level

1931
01:47:34,993 --> 01:47:39,510
as it existed before the revolution of 1917.

1932
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:43,925
So the Russian Orthodox Church of 1917 continued

1933
01:47:43,925 --> 01:47:46,350
to be the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991.

1934
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,195
And in 2013,

1935
01:47:50,195 --> 01:47:55,150
continuing the same imperial mantra of the existence

1936
01:47:55,150 --> 01:48:00,150
of one big Russian nation, one unified people.

1937
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:04,170
And when you see the formation

1938
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:07,620
of the ideas about nations,

1939
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:10,101
about foreign policy in the Russian empire

1940
01:48:10,101 --> 01:48:12,585
after 1991, they're going back to the

1941
01:48:12,585 --> 01:48:16,353
pre-Bolshevik times.

1942
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:19,350
Ukrainians do that as well.

1943
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:21,270
Estonians do that as well.

1944
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:24,783
The difference is that when Ukrainians go back,

1945
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:28,407
they go back to the pre 1917,

1946
01:48:28,407 --> 01:48:30,159
the intellectual fathers

1947
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:34,410
and writings of basically liberal nationalism

1948
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:37,950
or sometimes they go to the radical nationalism of Bandera,

1949
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:42,153
which would be not pre-1917, but pre-1945.

1950
01:48:44,273 --> 01:48:45,106
When the Russians go

1951
01:48:45,106 --> 01:48:49,200
to pre-Bolshevik past looking for the ideas, looking

1952
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,269
for inspiration, looking for the narratives,

1953
01:48:51,269 --> 01:48:52,985
what they find there is empire,

1954
01:48:52,985 --> 01:48:56,673
what they find there are imperial projects.

1955
01:48:57,870 --> 01:49:01,230
And that's certainly the story

1956
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:03,660
of the Putin's claim.

1957
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:05,190
That's the story of the argument.

1958
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:08,090
And to conclude the argument

1959
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:10,569
that he lays out there historical argument

1960
01:49:10,569 --> 01:49:13,715
comes also almost directly from the narratives

1961
01:49:13,715 --> 01:49:17,070
of the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.

1962
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:21,090
So it's not only the argument is coming from that era,

1963
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:22,086
but also the argumentation

1964
01:49:22,086 --> 01:49:24,840
is coming from that era as well.

1965
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,820
- But that those arguments are all

1966
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:29,160
in the flavor of empire.

1967
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,226
- It's empire on the one hand.

1968
01:49:31,226 --> 01:49:33,724
But also there is imperial understanding of

1969
01:49:33,724 --> 01:49:38,724
what Russian nation is that doesn't allow for independence

1970
01:49:40,094 --> 01:49:41,040
of its little Russian

1971
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,830
and white Russian branches, alleged branches.

1972
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:44,670
Right?

1973
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:48,070
So what what you see with the concept

1974
01:49:49,203 --> 01:49:50,036
of the big Russian nation,

1975
01:49:50,036 --> 01:49:51,671
that's late 19th beginning 20th century

1976
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:54,271
empire sees the writing on the wall,

1977
01:49:54,271 --> 01:49:56,651
that nationalism is on the rise

1978
01:49:56,651 --> 01:50:01,187
and it tries to survive by mobilizing

1979
01:50:01,187 --> 01:50:04,890
the nationalism of the largest group in the empire,

1980
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:06,290
which happens to be Russian.

1981
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:11,190
Stalin is a big promoter of some form

1982
01:50:11,190 --> 01:50:12,759
of Russian nationalism, especially

1983
01:50:12,759 --> 01:50:15,630
during the war and after war.

1984
01:50:15,630 --> 01:50:17,010
And he started his career

1985
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:21,213
as a very promising Georgian writer writing in Georgian.

1986
01:50:22,290 --> 01:50:23,430
So he's not doing that

1987
01:50:23,430 --> 01:50:26,426
for some personal affinity

1988
01:50:26,426 --> 01:50:31,211
or cultural intellectual roots within

1989
01:50:31,211 --> 01:50:34,942
Russian nation or Russian people.

1990
01:50:34,942 --> 01:50:39,942
He is doing that for the sake of the success

1991
01:50:39,961 --> 01:50:44,280
of his Soviet and communist project.

1992
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:48,371
And he has to get the largest ethnic group on board,

1993
01:50:48,371 --> 01:50:49,786
which are Russians.

1994
01:50:49,786 --> 01:50:52,950
But Stalin and Putin

1995
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:55,290
have different understanding who Russians are.

1996
01:50:55,290 --> 01:50:59,820
Stalin already accepted Ukrainians and Belorussians,

1997
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,260
they existed.

1998
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:05,100
Putin goes back to pre-Stalin times.

1999
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:06,600
- So if we step back from

2000
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:11,041
the historical context of this

2001
01:51:11,041 --> 01:51:15,576
and maybe the geopolitical purpose of writing such an essay

2002
01:51:15,576 --> 01:51:17,969
and forget about the essay altogether.

2003
01:51:17,969 --> 01:51:20,553
You know, I have family in Ukraine

2004
01:51:20,553 --> 01:51:23,400
and Russia, I know a lot of people in Ukraine

2005
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:27,960
and Russia, forget the war, forget all of this.

2006
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,983
There's a kind of, they all kind of sound the same.

2007
01:51:33,567 --> 01:51:38,460
Like if I go to France, they sound different

2008
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:40,230
then in Ukraine and Russia.

2009
01:51:40,230 --> 01:51:44,970
Like if you lay out this the cultural map

2010
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:48,030
of the world, there's just a different beat and music

2011
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:48,985
and flavor to a people.

2012
01:51:48,985 --> 01:51:52,350
I guess what I'm trying to say is there seems

2013
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:55,680
to be a closeness between the cultures of Ukraine or Russia.

2014
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:56,961
Like how do we describe that?

2015
01:51:56,961 --> 01:51:59,229
Do we acknowledge that

2016
01:51:59,229 --> 01:52:03,030
and how does that add tension

2017
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:04,923
with the national independence?

2018
01:52:06,043 --> 01:52:09,839
- First of all, especially when it comes to Eastern Ukraine

2019
01:52:09,839 --> 01:52:11,594
or to big cities,

2020
01:52:11,594 --> 01:52:16,050
many people in Ukraine spoke Russian, right?

2021
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:20,790
Generally it's the same language, on the top of that

2022
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:22,740
we started our discussion

2023
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:25,350
with talking about the Slavs, right?

2024
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:29,400
So both Ukrainian and Russian language are Slavic languages.

2025
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:33,150
So there is proximity there as well.

2026
01:52:33,150 --> 01:52:36,286
On the top of that, there is a history of existence in

2027
01:52:36,286 --> 01:52:39,720
the Soviet Union and before that

2028
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:42,138
in one empire for a long period of time.

2029
01:52:42,138 --> 01:52:44,063
So you see a lot of,

2030
01:52:44,063 --> 01:52:48,311
before the war, a lot of Ukrainian singers

2031
01:52:48,311 --> 01:52:52,587
and entertainers performing in Russia and vice versa.

2032
01:52:52,587 --> 01:52:55,164
And biography of President Zelenskyy certainly one of the,

2033
01:52:55,164 --> 01:53:00,164
fits that particular model

2034
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:06,210
as well, that all talks about similarities.

2035
01:53:06,210 --> 01:53:10,102
But this similarities also very often obscure

2036
01:53:10,102 --> 01:53:14,430
things that became

2037
01:53:14,430 --> 01:53:16,196
so important in the course of this war.

2038
01:53:16,196 --> 01:53:21,196
And I already mentioned the book titled

2039
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:23,790
by President Kushma of Ukraine,

2040
01:53:23,790 --> 01:53:25,530
Ukraine is not Russia.

2041
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:27,360
So that's the argument.

2042
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,968
Despite the fact that you think that we are the same,

2043
01:53:29,968 --> 01:53:32,455
we behave differently.

2044
01:53:32,455 --> 01:53:35,940
And it turned out that they behave differently.

2045
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:38,200
You have (speaks foreign language) in Moscow

2046
01:53:39,083 --> 01:53:41,141
and police violence and that's the end of it.

2047
01:53:41,141 --> 01:53:44,880
You have the (speaks foreign language) in Ukraine

2048
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,276
and you have police violence

2049
01:53:46,276 --> 01:53:50,310
and that's the beginning, that's not the end.

2050
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:53,829
History really matters in the way

2051
01:53:53,829 --> 01:53:58,482
why sometimes speak people speak in the same language

2052
01:53:58,482 --> 01:54:01,683
with different accents, behave very differently.

2053
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:07,290
Russia and Russian identity was formed around the state

2054
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:11,790
and has difficulty imagining itself outside of the state.

2055
01:54:11,790 --> 01:54:13,473
And that state happened to be imperial

2056
01:54:13,473 --> 01:54:15,900
for most of Russian history.

2057
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:18,224
Ukrainian project came into existence in

2058
01:54:18,224 --> 01:54:21,220
revolt against the state.

2059
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:25,740
Ukraine came into existence out of the parts

2060
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:27,000
of different empires,

2061
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,630
which means they left different cultural impact on them.

2062
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:34,560
And for Ukrainians to stay together, a theocratic regime,

2063
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,343
so far didn't work.

2064
01:54:36,343 --> 01:54:39,003
It's like the colonies of the United States.

2065
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:42,570
You you have to find common language.

2066
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:44,686
You have to talk to each other.

2067
01:54:44,686 --> 01:54:49,686
And that became part of the Ukrainian political DNA

2068
01:54:49,746 --> 01:54:54,232
and that became a huge factor in the war.

2069
01:54:54,232 --> 01:54:57,907
And very few people in Ukraine believed

2070
01:54:57,907 --> 01:55:01,350
what Vladimir Putin was saying that Russians

2071
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:03,509
and Ukrainians were one and the same people,

2072
01:55:03,509 --> 01:55:08,509
but the majority believed that there're certainly close

2073
01:55:09,030 --> 01:55:11,310
culturally and historically nations.

2074
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:14,340
And from that point of view, the bombardment

2075
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:17,760
of the Ukrainian cities became such a shock

2076
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,407
to the Ukrainians because deep down

2077
01:55:20,407 --> 01:55:24,570
they maybe looked at Syria, they looked at Chechnya

2078
01:55:24,570 --> 01:55:27,780
and were explaining that through the fact

2079
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:31,620
that there was basically such a big cultural gap

2080
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:32,721
and difference between Russians

2081
01:55:32,721 --> 01:55:36,358
and those countries and those nations.

2082
01:55:36,358 --> 01:55:40,232
But my understanding at least, most of them

2083
01:55:40,232 --> 01:55:45,210
had difficulty imagining the war of that proportion

2084
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:46,740
and that that sort of ferocity

2085
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:51,499
and that sort of war crimes, the bringing

2086
01:55:51,499 --> 01:55:55,320
that sort of war crimes and on that level.

2087
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:57,868
- So it's interesting that you say that in the DNA

2088
01:55:57,868 --> 01:55:59,819
of Ukraine versus Russia.

2089
01:55:59,819 --> 01:56:04,030
So maybe Russia is more

2090
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:07,939
conducive to authoritarian regimes

2091
01:56:07,939 --> 01:56:12,939
and Ukraine is more conducive to defining itself

2092
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:16,180
by rebelling against authoritarian regimes

2093
01:56:17,538 --> 01:56:18,930
- By rebellion.

2094
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:19,920
Absolutely.

2095
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:23,910
And that was the story pretty much before 1991.

2096
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:26,760
So what you see since 1991

2097
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:29,223
and what you see today is,

2098
01:56:30,378 --> 01:56:31,770
I would say new factor,

2099
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:34,260
certainly in Ukrainian modern history,

2100
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:37,683
'cause Ukrainians traditionally were very successful rebels.

2101
01:56:39,205 --> 01:56:41,947
The largest peasant army in the civil War in the Russian

2102
01:56:41,947 --> 01:56:46,190
Empire was the (speaks foreign language) army

2103
01:56:46,190 --> 01:56:47,442
in southern Ukraine.

2104
01:56:47,442 --> 01:56:51,480
And one revolt, Kasakh revolts

2105
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:54,360
and other revolts, one after another.

2106
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:57,640
But Ukrainians had historically difficulty actually

2107
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:01,473
maintaining the sort of freedom that they acquired,

2108
01:57:01,473 --> 01:57:05,428
had difficulty associating themself with the state.

2109
01:57:05,428 --> 01:57:10,428
And what we see, especially in the last two years,

2110
01:57:10,457 --> 01:57:14,850
it's a quite phenomenal development in Ukraine when

2111
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:17,491
Ukrainians associate themselves with the state

2112
01:57:17,491 --> 01:57:21,869
where Ukrainians see a state not just as a

2113
01:57:21,869 --> 01:57:26,070
foreigner, as historically, it was in Ukrainian history,

2114
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:29,132
not just someone who came to take,

2115
01:57:29,132 --> 01:57:32,866
but the state that is continuation of them, that helps

2116
01:57:32,866 --> 01:57:35,165
to provide security for them.

2117
01:57:35,165 --> 01:57:39,247
That the Ukrainian armed forces, even

2118
01:57:39,247 --> 01:57:42,122
before the start of this war had

2119
01:57:42,122 --> 01:57:47,122
the highest support and popularity in Ukraine.

2120
01:57:48,794 --> 01:57:50,835
The state today functions

2121
01:57:50,835 --> 01:57:55,109
unbelievably effectively under attacks and missile attacks,

2122
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:58,464
and again, city government and local government.

2123
01:57:58,464 --> 01:58:03,330
And we're witnessing when it comes

2124
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:05,539
to Ukraine, we're witnessing a very important historical

2125
01:58:05,539 --> 01:58:10,214
development where Ukrainians found their state

2126
01:58:10,214 --> 01:58:15,214
for the first time through most of their history

2127
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:20,450
and try to make a transition from successful rebels

2128
01:58:20,519 --> 01:58:25,519
to successful managers and state builders.

2129
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:29,720
- Yeah, I talked to John Mearsheimer recently,

2130
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:32,460
there's a lot of people that believe NATO had a big

2131
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:37,440
contribution to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

2132
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,593
So what role did NATO play in this full history

2133
01:58:41,593 --> 01:58:46,593
from Bucharest in 2008 to today?

2134
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:53,990
- NATO was a big part, certainly

2135
01:58:53,990 --> 01:58:58,468
of the Russian justification for the war.

2136
01:58:58,468 --> 01:59:01,530
That was the theme that was

2137
01:59:01,530 --> 01:59:05,457
up there in the months leading to the aggression.

2138
01:59:05,457 --> 01:59:08,660
The truth is that,

2139
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:12,402
and Vladimir Putin went on records saying

2140
01:59:12,402 --> 01:59:17,305
that the western leaders were telling him again

2141
01:59:17,305 --> 01:59:20,889
and again that there is no chance for Ukraine

2142
01:59:20,889 --> 01:59:25,090
to become member of NATO anytime soon.

2143
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:29,580
Russia was very effective back in the year 2008,

2144
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:32,700
in stopping Ukraine

2145
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:36,900
and Georgia on the path of joining NATO.

2146
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:39,012
There was a Bucharest Summit,

2147
01:59:39,012 --> 01:59:42,780
at which the US president at that time,

2148
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:46,034
George W Bush was pushing for the membership

2149
01:59:46,034 --> 01:59:50,580
and Putin convinced leaders of France

2150
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:54,600
and Germany to block that membership.

2151
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:58,448
And after that membership for Ukraine

2152
01:59:58,448 --> 02:00:03,402
and for Georgia, was really removed from the

2153
02:00:03,402 --> 02:00:06,873
realistic agenda for NATO.

2154
02:00:07,926 --> 02:00:08,759
And that's what the leaders

2155
02:00:08,759 --> 02:00:12,307
of the western world in the month leading to the

2156
02:00:12,307 --> 02:00:16,950
February, 2022 aggression were trying to convey

2157
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:18,243
to Vladimir Putin.

2158
02:00:19,530 --> 02:00:21,270
What he wanted,

2159
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:22,232
there was an ultimatum that really was there to,

2160
02:00:22,232 --> 02:00:27,232
not to start negotiations, but really to stop negotiations.

2161
02:00:30,090 --> 02:00:33,677
He demanded the withdrawal of NATO to the borders

2162
02:00:33,677 --> 02:00:37,007
of the 1997, if I'm not mistaken,

2163
02:00:37,007 --> 02:00:41,070
so completely something that neither leaders would accept

2164
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:43,503
nor the country's members of NATO would accept.

2165
02:00:43,503 --> 02:00:45,534
But for me, it's very clear that

2166
02:00:45,534 --> 02:00:50,392
that was an excuse, that that was a justification.

2167
02:00:50,392 --> 02:00:54,690
And what happened later in the year 2022

2168
02:00:54,690 --> 02:00:58,893
and 2023 certainly confirms me in that belief,

2169
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:03,540
Finland joined NATO

2170
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:06,333
and Sweden is on the way to join in NATO.

2171
02:01:07,170 --> 02:01:11,642
So Finland joined in NATO, increased

2172
02:01:11,642 --> 02:01:15,930
border between Russia and NATO, twofold,

2173
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:18,150
and probably more than that.

2174
02:01:18,150 --> 02:01:20,613
So if NATO is the real concern,

2175
02:01:21,870 --> 02:01:25,740
it would be probably not completely unreasonable to expect

2176
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:27,968
that if not every single soldier,

2177
02:01:27,968 --> 02:01:31,685
but at least half of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine

2178
02:01:31,685 --> 02:01:36,450
would be moved to protect the new border

2179
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:38,370
with NATO in Finland.

2180
02:01:38,370 --> 02:01:42,274
So I have no doubt that no one in Kremlin,

2181
02:01:42,274 --> 02:01:45,748
either in the past or today looks favorably

2182
02:01:45,748 --> 02:01:48,310
or is excited about

2183
02:01:49,996 --> 02:01:54,996
NATO moving or the countries of Eastern Europe joining NATO.

2184
02:01:56,040 --> 02:02:00,000
But I have very difficult time imagining that

2185
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,880
that was the primary cause of the war.

2186
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:07,572
And what we see also, we talked about Tucker's interview,

2187
02:02:07,572 --> 02:02:10,202
he was surprised,

2188
02:02:10,202 --> 02:02:14,070
but he believed that Putin was completely

2189
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:17,370
honest when the first 25 minutes of interview,

2190
02:02:17,370 --> 02:02:20,030
he was talking about relations between Russia and Ukraine.

2191
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:21,224
He was talking about history

2192
02:02:21,224 --> 02:02:26,224
and that was also the main focus of his essay.

2193
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:29,433
Essay was not on NATO and Russia,

2194
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:33,090
his essay was on Russia and Ukraine.

2195
02:02:33,090 --> 02:02:37,140
So that is where the real causes are.

2196
02:02:37,140 --> 02:02:40,170
The broader context is the fall of empire

2197
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:42,930
and process of disintegration of empire,

2198
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:45,390
not the story of NATO.

2199
02:02:45,390 --> 02:02:48,553
- What was, to clarify the reason Putin,

2200
02:02:48,553 --> 02:02:53,553
Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022?

2201
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:57,692
- The immediate goal in 2014 when the war started

2202
02:02:57,692 --> 02:03:02,400
was to stop the drift of Ukraine toward the West

2203
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:06,167
and outside of the Russian sphere of influence,

2204
02:03:06,167 --> 02:03:11,167
the invasion of 2022 perceived the same goals

2205
02:03:14,189 --> 02:03:19,189
keeping Ukraine in the Russian sphere of influence.

2206
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:22,380
Once we have the resistance,

2207
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:26,226
quite effective resistance on the part of Ukraine, the

2208
02:03:26,226 --> 02:03:31,226
Ramstein and international Coalition in support

2209
02:03:31,583 --> 02:03:35,580
of Ukraine, then we see the realization of plan B

2210
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:40,580
where parts of Ukrainian territory are being annexed

2211
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:44,580
and included in the Constitution of the Russian Federation.

2212
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:47,310
So the two scenarios don't exclude each other,

2213
02:03:47,310 --> 02:03:51,057
but if scenario number one doesn't work,

2214
02:03:51,057 --> 02:03:56,057
then scenario number two goes into play.

2215
02:03:57,210 --> 02:03:59,423
- In the gates of Kyiv chapter,

2216
02:03:59,423 --> 02:04:02,370
you write about Volodymyr Zelenskyy

2217
02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:04,068
in the early days of the war.

2218
02:04:04,068 --> 02:04:08,086
What are most important moments to you about this time?

2219
02:04:08,086 --> 02:04:13,020
The first hours and days of the invasion.

2220
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:15,240
- The first hours and the first days were the

2221
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:18,570
most difficult psychologically, the rest

2222
02:04:18,570 --> 02:04:21,390
of the world really didn't expect Kyiv to last

2223
02:04:21,390 --> 02:04:22,553
for more than few days.

2224
02:04:22,553 --> 02:04:26,492
Didn't expect Ukraine to last for more than few weeks.

2225
02:04:26,492 --> 02:04:31,492
And all the data suggested that that's what would happen.

2226
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:34,353
Ukraine would collapse, be taken over.

2227
02:04:36,150 --> 02:04:41,150
Putin called his war a special military operation,

2228
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:43,822
which suggests you also expectations about the scope,

2229
02:04:43,822 --> 02:04:46,124
expectations about the time.

2230
02:04:46,124 --> 02:04:51,124
So semi-military, semi-police operation.

2231
02:04:51,531 --> 02:04:55,678
So every reasonable person in the world believed that

2232
02:04:55,678 --> 02:04:57,407
that would would happen.

2233
02:04:57,407 --> 02:05:02,407
And it's the heroism of quote unquote unreasonable people

2234
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,140
like Zelenskyy, like the commander

2235
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:10,500
of Ukrainian armed forces like Zaluzhnyi,

2236
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:13,847
mayors of the cities, (speaks foreign language)

2237
02:05:13,847 --> 02:05:16,530
and others, I'm just naming names that are familiar

2238
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:18,990
to almost all of us now.

2239
02:05:18,990 --> 02:05:22,634
But there are thousands of those people, unreasonable people

2240
02:05:22,634 --> 02:05:25,494
who decided that it was unreasonable

2241
02:05:25,494 --> 02:05:27,252
to attack their country.

2242
02:05:27,252 --> 02:05:32,252
And that was the most difficult times and days.

2243
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:37,987
And speaking about Zelenskyy, every

2244
02:05:37,987 --> 02:05:42,450
I understand reasonable leader in the West was trying

2245
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:44,430
to convince him to leave Ukraine

2246
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:49,352
and to set a government in exile in Poland or in London.

2247
02:05:49,352 --> 02:05:52,998
And it was reasonable to accept his,

2248
02:05:52,998 --> 02:05:57,063
one of his predecessors, Mr. Yanukovych fled Kyiv.

2249
02:06:00,627 --> 02:06:01,800
A few months before that in Afghanistan,

2250
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:03,330
the president of Afghanistan

2251
02:06:03,330 --> 02:06:04,758
fled Afghanistan.

2252
02:06:04,758 --> 02:06:08,763
That was a reasonable thing to expect.

2253
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:13,629
And he turned out to be very,

2254
02:06:13,629 --> 02:06:17,386
very unreasonable in that sense, that comes

2255
02:06:17,386 --> 02:06:22,257
with the guts, his guts and guts people around him

2256
02:06:22,257 --> 02:06:23,970
and Ukrainians in general.

2257
02:06:23,970 --> 02:06:26,862
- Why do you think he stayed in Kyiv, this former comedian

2258
02:06:26,862 --> 02:06:31,683
who played a president on TV,

2259
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:36,288
when Kyiv is being invaded by the second most powerful

2260
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:38,640
military in the world?

2261
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:41,050
- Because I think he believes in things

2262
02:06:42,421 --> 02:06:47,421
and one of of those things was that if he

2263
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:52,215
president and he's in the presidential office,

2264
02:06:52,215 --> 02:06:56,073
he's there to play his role to the end.

2265
02:06:57,870 --> 02:07:01,350
And another thing, my personal, again,

2266
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:03,772
I never met Zelenskyy.

2267
02:07:03,772 --> 02:07:08,170
My personal understanding of him is that

2268
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:14,280
he has talent that helped him in his career

2269
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:17,400
before the presidency and then helps now.

2270
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:18,640
He feels the audience

2271
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:23,793
and then channel the attitude of the audience

2272
02:07:23,793 --> 02:07:26,302
and amplifies it.

2273
02:07:26,302 --> 02:07:31,302
And I think that another reason why he didn't leave Kyiv

2274
02:07:32,596 --> 02:07:36,124
was that he felt the audience,

2275
02:07:36,124 --> 02:07:40,563
the audience in that particular context were the Ukrainians.

2276
02:07:41,550 --> 02:07:44,400
- So he had a sense that the Ukrainians would unify

2277
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,200
because he was quite, if you look at the polls

2278
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:47,865
before the war, quite unpopular

2279
02:07:47,865 --> 02:07:52,865
and there was still divisions and factions,

2280
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:55,020
and the government is divided.

2281
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:57,150
I mean, there's the east and the west

2282
02:07:57,150 --> 02:07:58,393
and all this kind of stuff.

2283
02:07:58,393 --> 02:07:59,790
You think he had a sense

2284
02:07:59,790 --> 02:08:02,604
that this could unite people?

2285
02:08:02,604 --> 02:08:06,180
- The east and the west was not already such an issue

2286
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:11,180
after Crimea and part of Donbas being gone.

2287
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:17,271
So Ukraine was much more united than it was before.

2288
02:08:17,271 --> 02:08:22,260
He brought to power his

2289
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:25,500
before that really non-existent party of regions

2290
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:27,960
on his personal popularity.

2291
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:30,677
But the important thing is that he created

2292
02:08:30,677 --> 02:08:32,707
a majority in the parliament,

2293
02:08:32,707 --> 02:08:37,018
which really reflected the unity that existed

2294
02:08:37,018 --> 02:08:39,480
among Ukrainians that didn't, was not there

2295
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:43,623
before, he won with 73% of the population

2296
02:08:43,623 --> 02:08:48,623
of those who took part in the elections.

2297
02:08:49,410 --> 02:08:53,581
His predecessor Petro Oleksiyovych also carried

2298
02:08:53,581 --> 02:08:56,760
90% of the precincts.

2299
02:08:56,760 --> 02:08:58,440
And the same happened with Zelenskyy.

2300
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:59,509
So the country unified

2301
02:08:59,509 --> 02:09:04,509
after 2014 to a degree it was impossible

2302
02:09:04,683 --> 02:09:06,660
to imagine before.

2303
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:09,393
And Zelenskyy felt that, Zelenskyy knew that.

2304
02:09:10,290 --> 02:09:15,290
And that's where the talent of politician really matters.

2305
02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:21,570
And that that's something that you can see

2306
02:09:21,570 --> 02:09:23,611
beyond just data.

2307
02:09:23,611 --> 02:09:26,250
And you can feel that.

2308
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:28,803
Apparently Yeltsin had that ability.

2309
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:33,840
- Why did the peace talks fail?

2310
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,907
There was a lot of peace talks.

2311
02:09:35,907 --> 02:09:39,626
- Well, the main reason is that the conditions that

2312
02:09:39,626 --> 02:09:44,626
Russia was trying to impose on Ukraine were basically

2313
02:09:44,945 --> 02:09:47,399
unacceptable for Ukraine

2314
02:09:47,399 --> 02:09:50,428
because one of the conditions

2315
02:09:50,428 --> 02:09:55,428
apart from this strange thing called denazification,

2316
02:09:55,511 --> 02:09:58,740
was of course de facto loss of the territory.

2317
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:02,932
And for the future really staying

2318
02:10:02,932 --> 02:10:05,130
outside either of NATO

2319
02:10:05,130 --> 02:10:10,020
or any western support, which was very clear.

2320
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:12,740
You can buy a couple of weeks, you can buy a couple

2321
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:15,090
of months, but in the conditions like that,

2322
02:10:15,090 --> 02:10:17,520
Russia will come back tomorrow

2323
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,849
and will take over everything.

2324
02:10:18,849 --> 02:10:23,410
And once Ukrainians realized

2325
02:10:23,410 --> 02:10:25,503
that they can win on the battlefield,

2326
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:30,145
once the Russians were defeated

2327
02:10:30,145 --> 02:10:31,743
and withdrew from Kyiv,

2328
02:10:32,626 --> 02:10:37,626
the opportunity emerged to get out

2329
02:10:37,628 --> 02:10:42,420
of the negotiations, which was very clear, were leading

2330
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:44,580
if not today, then tomorrow

2331
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:47,430
to the complete destruction of Ukraine.

2332
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:49,854
And then of course, once the territories started

2333
02:10:49,854 --> 02:10:53,190
to be liberated, things like butcher

2334
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:57,240
and massacres of the civilian population came to the fore,

2335
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:00,750
which made also quite difficult, if not impossible,

2336
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:04,020
to conduct negotiations from this moral

2337
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:05,670
and emotional point of view.

2338
02:11:05,670 --> 02:11:07,140
- What about the claims that, you know,

2339
02:11:07,140 --> 02:11:11,500
Boris Johnson, the West, compromised the ability

2340
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:14,150
of these peace talks to be successful, basically kind

2341
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:17,970
of manipulated the talks?

2342
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:22,260
- I asked people who accompanied Boris Johnson

2343
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:23,913
to give that question.

2344
02:11:25,137 --> 02:11:26,373
The answer was no.

2345
02:11:26,373 --> 02:11:31,117
And I believe this answer, and I'll tell you why,

2346
02:11:31,117 --> 02:11:36,117
because it is very difficult for me to imagine

2347
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:42,935
President Zelenskyy to take orders

2348
02:11:42,935 --> 02:11:47,935
from anybody in the world, either Boris Johnson

2349
02:11:49,050 --> 02:11:51,840
or Joe Biden or anybody else.

2350
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:54,361
And basically doing things that

2351
02:11:54,361 --> 02:11:58,760
Zelenskyy believes are not in his interest

2352
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:01,230
or in the interest of his country.

2353
02:12:01,230 --> 02:12:05,239
I just can't imagine that anybody in the world

2354
02:12:05,239 --> 02:12:09,597
telling Zelenskyy what to do

2355
02:12:09,597 --> 02:12:12,702
and Zelenskyy actually following it against

2356
02:12:12,702 --> 02:12:15,498
his own wishes and desires, at least if

2357
02:12:15,498 --> 02:12:18,932
that is possible, what is in the public sphere

2358
02:12:18,932 --> 02:12:23,400
doesn't allow us to suggest that it is.

2359
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:25,860
- That said, Zelenskyy is a smart man

2360
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:30,390
and he knows that the war can only continue

2361
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:32,130
with the west support.

2362
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:35,400
- That is a different supposition to know

2363
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:38,010
that it can continue with the West support.

2364
02:12:38,010 --> 02:12:41,430
But if we're talking about withdrawing from the

2365
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:45,088
negotiations, that's not about the continuation

2366
02:12:45,088 --> 02:12:49,200
of the war, for that you don't need Western support.

2367
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:53,970
- Well, what I mean is if he started to sense

2368
02:12:53,970 --> 02:12:56,580
that the West will support no matter what,

2369
02:12:56,580 --> 02:12:57,810
then maybe the space

2370
02:12:57,810 --> 02:12:59,940
of decisions you're making is different.

2371
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:02,477
- We can interpret that that way.

2372
02:13:02,477 --> 02:13:06,520
But Boris Johnson represented

2373
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:11,520
at that point, Britain, not the United States,

2374
02:13:11,761 --> 02:13:16,500
and really what the war showed,

2375
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:19,564
and it was clear already at that time that

2376
02:13:19,564 --> 02:13:22,911
what was needed was massive support

2377
02:13:22,911 --> 02:13:25,590
from the West as a whole.

2378
02:13:25,590 --> 02:13:28,653
And the promise of that support came only

2379
02:13:28,653 --> 02:13:31,920
when the West realized that Ukraine can win,

2380
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:36,920
and came only in late April with the Ramstein.

2381
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:40,227
So at least a few weeks later.

2382
02:13:40,227 --> 02:13:43,950
So I dunno how much Boris Johnson could promise,

2383
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:46,362
he probably could promise to try to help

2384
02:13:46,362 --> 02:13:47,701
and try to convince

2385
02:13:47,701 --> 02:13:49,509
and try to work on that

2386
02:13:49,509 --> 02:13:53,070
if Zelenskyy acted on that promise.

2387
02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:54,687
He certainly was taking a risk.

2388
02:13:54,687 --> 02:13:57,827
But the key issue, again, I'm going back where I started

2389
02:13:57,827 --> 02:14:02,677
it's principle, an acceptance for Ukraine, the conditions

2390
02:14:02,677 --> 02:14:06,930
that were offered and Ukraine was,

2391
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:09,960
the moment they saw the possibility

2392
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:13,845
that they could fight back with Johnson support,

2393
02:14:13,845 --> 02:14:18,000
without Johnson support, they took the chance.

2394
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,883
- So what are the ways this war can end, do you think?

2395
02:14:21,870 --> 02:14:23,562
What are the different possible trajectories,

2396
02:14:23,562 --> 02:14:25,094
whether it's peace talks,

2397
02:14:25,094 --> 02:14:27,954
what does winning look like for either side?

2398
02:14:27,954 --> 02:14:30,270
What is the role of US?

2399
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:32,906
What trajectories do you see that are possible?

2400
02:14:32,906 --> 02:14:36,750
- It's a question on one level, very easy

2401
02:14:36,750 --> 02:14:39,564
to answer on the other very difficult,

2402
02:14:39,564 --> 02:14:42,319
the level on which it is very easy.

2403
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:45,971
It's a broad historical perspective.

2404
02:14:45,971 --> 02:14:48,156
If you really believe,

2405
02:14:48,156 --> 02:14:50,756
and I believe in that, that this is the war

2406
02:14:50,756 --> 02:14:52,806
of the Soviet succession.

2407
02:14:52,806 --> 02:14:56,842
That this is the war of the disintegration of empire.

2408
02:14:56,842 --> 02:14:58,890
We know how the story ends

2409
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:03,890
and they end with disintegration of empire.

2410
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:07,710
They end with the rise of the new states

2411
02:15:07,710 --> 02:15:10,953
and appearance of the new colored spots on the map.

2412
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:15,810
That's the story that started with the American revolution.

2413
02:15:15,810 --> 02:15:18,330
So that's long term perspective.

2414
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:21,570
The difficult part is of course what will happen tomorrow.

2415
02:15:21,570 --> 02:15:24,315
The difficult part is what they'll be

2416
02:15:24,315 --> 02:15:29,315
in two days and or even in two years.

2417
02:15:29,334 --> 02:15:31,541
And in very broad terms,

2418
02:15:31,541 --> 02:15:35,797
the war can end in one of three scenarios.

2419
02:15:35,797 --> 02:15:39,891
The victory of one side, the victory of another side,

2420
02:15:39,891 --> 02:15:42,240
and a sort of a stalemate

2421
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:44,099
and compromise, especially when it comes,

2422
02:15:44,099 --> 02:15:46,781
when it comes to the territories.

2423
02:15:46,781 --> 02:15:50,720
This war is already approaching the

2424
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:53,124
end of the second year.

2425
02:15:53,124 --> 02:15:57,240
I follow the news and look analysis.

2426
02:15:57,240 --> 02:16:00,570
I don't remember once single piece suggesting

2427
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:03,390
that the next year will bring peace

2428
02:16:03,390 --> 02:16:05,343
or will bring peace for sure.

2429
02:16:06,570 --> 02:16:11,570
And we are in a situation where

2430
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:14,772
the both sides still believe

2431
02:16:14,772 --> 02:16:17,490
that they can achieve something

2432
02:16:17,490 --> 02:16:19,816
or improve their position on the battlefield.

2433
02:16:19,816 --> 02:16:21,593
Certainly that was the expectations

2434
02:16:21,593 --> 02:16:24,981
of Ukrainian side back in the summer

2435
02:16:24,981 --> 02:16:29,981
and early fall of 2023.

2436
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:32,430
And from what I understand now,

2437
02:16:32,430 --> 02:16:33,523
this is certainly the expectations

2438
02:16:33,523 --> 02:16:35,282
of the Russian side today.

2439
02:16:36,777 --> 02:16:41,459
This is the largest war in Europe since World War II,

2440
02:16:41,459 --> 02:16:44,962
the largest war in the world since Korean War.

2441
02:16:44,962 --> 02:16:49,962
And we know that the Korean War ended in this

2442
02:16:54,750 --> 02:16:55,799
division of Korea.

2443
02:16:55,799 --> 02:17:00,059
But the negotiations were going on for more than two years.

2444
02:17:00,059 --> 02:17:02,160
While those negotiations were going on,

2445
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:04,932
both sides were trying to improve their position there.

2446
02:17:04,932 --> 02:17:09,932
And until there was a political change, death of Stalin,

2447
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:13,668
rival of Eisenhower in the United States,

2448
02:17:13,668 --> 02:17:17,850
and the realization that the chances

2449
02:17:17,850 --> 02:17:21,809
of succeeding on the battlefield are huge,

2450
02:17:21,809 --> 02:17:23,879
the peace talks didn't come.

2451
02:17:23,879 --> 02:17:28,290
So at this point, all three scenarios are possible.

2452
02:17:28,290 --> 02:17:30,995
I don't really discount any of them.

2453
02:17:30,995 --> 02:17:34,680
It's early to say what will happen.

2454
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:37,898
- So without any political change, let's try to imagine

2455
02:17:37,898 --> 02:17:41,823
what are the possibilities that the war ends this year?

2456
02:17:43,179 --> 02:17:47,000
Is it possible that it can end with compromise,

2457
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,889
basically at the place it started?

2458
02:17:49,889 --> 02:17:52,709
- Meaning back to the borders of 2022?

2459
02:17:52,709 --> 02:17:53,543
- Yeah.

2460
02:17:53,543 --> 02:17:54,376
Back to the borders of '22

2461
02:17:54,376 --> 02:17:59,376
with some security guarantees that aren't really guarantees,

2462
02:17:59,735 --> 02:18:01,980
but are hopeful guarantees.

2463
02:18:01,980 --> 02:18:05,549
- No, it's not just virtual impossibility.

2464
02:18:05,549 --> 02:18:09,000
It's impossible without political change in Moscow.

2465
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:14,000
The reason is that back in the fall of 2022,

2466
02:18:14,424 --> 02:18:19,424
Vladimir Putin included five of Ukrainian region sublists,

2467
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:23,147
even those that he didn't control

2468
02:18:23,147 --> 02:18:26,804
or didn't control fully into the Russian constitution,

2469
02:18:26,804 --> 02:18:29,438
which basically in simple language is

2470
02:18:29,438 --> 02:18:33,030
that the hands are tied up not only for Putin himself,

2471
02:18:33,030 --> 02:18:34,705
but also for his possible successors.

2472
02:18:34,705 --> 02:18:39,022
So that's means that no return to the borders

2473
02:18:39,022 --> 02:18:42,010
of 2022 without change,

2474
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:45,170
political change in Moscow are possible.

2475
02:18:45,170 --> 02:18:50,170
A few days after that decision in Moscow, Zelenskyy

2476
02:18:52,368 --> 02:18:57,368
issued a decree saying that no negotiations with Russia.

2477
02:18:57,638 --> 02:19:01,307
What that really meant in plain language is

2478
02:19:01,307 --> 02:19:03,270
that basically we're not prepared

2479
02:19:03,270 --> 02:19:08,269
to negotiate a stable agreement with five obstacles,

2480
02:19:08,269 --> 02:19:11,190
not just the next, but also included into

2481
02:19:11,190 --> 02:19:12,809
the Russian constitution.

2482
02:19:12,809 --> 02:19:14,309
So that's where we are.

2483
02:19:14,309 --> 02:19:18,750
So that scenario is again,

2484
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:21,059
everything is possible of course,

2485
02:19:21,059 --> 02:19:22,920
but it's highly, highly unlikely.

2486
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:25,709
- So the Russian constitution is a thing that's very,

2487
02:19:25,709 --> 02:19:27,719
that makes this all very difficult.

2488
02:19:27,719 --> 02:19:28,553
- Yes.

2489
02:19:28,553 --> 02:19:30,504
And not only as a negotiation tactic for Putin

2490
02:19:30,504 --> 02:19:34,440
or whoever would negotiate on the Russian side,

2491
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:37,290
but also as a legal issue.

2492
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:39,782
- So like the practical aspect of it even is difficult.

2493
02:19:39,782 --> 02:19:44,129
- Yes, you really have to change the constitution

2494
02:19:44,129 --> 02:19:46,860
before the peace agreement takes hold

2495
02:19:46,860 --> 02:19:48,285
or immediately after that.

2496
02:19:48,285 --> 02:19:52,385
And with the Minsk agreements, that was one of things that

2497
02:19:52,385 --> 02:19:55,789
Russia wanted from Ukraine, change of the Constitution,

2498
02:19:55,789 --> 02:19:58,770
and it turned out to be really impossible.

2499
02:19:58,770 --> 02:20:02,520
So that's one of the backstories

2500
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:05,430
of the Minsk and collapse of the Minsk agreements.

2501
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:08,100
- Is there something like Minsk agreements

2502
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:11,580
that are possible now to, maybe this is a legal question,

2503
02:20:11,580 --> 02:20:13,546
but to override the constitution to sort of

2504
02:20:13,546 --> 02:20:15,798
shake everything up.

2505
02:20:15,798 --> 02:20:18,421
So see the constitutional amendment

2506
02:20:18,421 --> 02:20:21,281
as just a negotiation tactic to come to the table,

2507
02:20:21,281 --> 02:20:25,140
to something like Minsk agreement.

2508
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:29,610
- Given how how fast those those amendments

2509
02:20:29,610 --> 02:20:34,440
to the constitution were adopted, that suggests

2510
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:36,008
that real executive power

2511
02:20:36,008 --> 02:20:38,426
in Russia has enormous power over

2512
02:20:38,426 --> 02:20:40,894
the legislative branch.

2513
02:20:40,894 --> 02:20:43,920
So it's, again, difficult to imagine,

2514
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,930
but technically this is possible again.

2515
02:20:45,930 --> 02:20:48,210
Yeah, but possible,

2516
02:20:48,210 --> 02:20:50,240
if there is a political change in Moscow,

2517
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:53,267
- I don't understand why assuming political change in Moscow

2518
02:20:53,267 --> 02:20:54,742
is not possible this year.

2519
02:20:54,742 --> 02:20:57,311
So I'm trying to see if there's a way

2520
02:20:57,311 --> 02:20:59,383
to end this war this year, right?

2521
02:20:59,383 --> 02:21:03,300
- There is a possibility of armistice, right?

2522
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:06,090
But armistice more along,

2523
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:07,827
like any armistice, along the lines

2524
02:21:07,827 --> 02:21:09,937
of the current front lines,

2525
02:21:09,937 --> 02:21:14,170
but withdrawal of the Russian troops to the borders

2526
02:21:14,170 --> 02:21:17,902
or 2022 at this point, whether it's reasonable

2527
02:21:17,902 --> 02:21:21,049
or unreasonable can be achieved only as the result

2528
02:21:21,049 --> 02:21:23,102
of the defeat of the Russian army.

2529
02:21:23,102 --> 02:21:25,290
Like it happened near Kiev.

2530
02:21:25,290 --> 02:21:26,123
Is it possible?

2531
02:21:26,123 --> 02:21:26,956
Possible.

2532
02:21:26,956 --> 02:21:30,136
Is it likely, especially given what is happening

2533
02:21:30,136 --> 02:21:35,136
with the Western support, military support for Ukraine?

2534
02:21:35,250 --> 02:21:36,360
Probably not.

2535
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:39,900
- But if Putin, the executive branch has a lot of power,

2536
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:43,058
why can't the United States president,

2537
02:21:43,058 --> 02:21:45,790
the Russian president, the Ukrainian president, come

2538
02:21:45,790 --> 02:21:50,100
to the table and draw up something like the Minsk agreements

2539
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:53,290
where, and then rapid constitutional changes made,

2540
02:21:53,290 --> 02:21:56,268
and you go back to the borders in 2022,

2541
02:21:56,268 --> 02:21:59,585
before 2022, like through agreements,

2542
02:21:59,585 --> 02:22:03,570
through compromise, impossible for you.

2543
02:22:03,570 --> 02:22:04,875
- Certainly not this year.

2544
02:22:04,875 --> 02:22:08,113
I look at this year as the time when

2545
02:22:08,113 --> 02:22:12,957
at least one side, Russian side, will try to get as much

2546
02:22:12,957 --> 02:22:17,040
as it can through military means.

2547
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:19,203
- But that's been happening last year too.

2548
02:22:21,109 --> 02:22:22,583
Has been a counteroffensive, there's been attempts-

2549
02:22:23,956 --> 02:22:25,996
- That doesn't mean

2550
02:22:25,996 --> 02:22:29,478
that New Year somehow is supposed to bring your tactics

2551
02:22:29,478 --> 02:22:34,315
that the last year was pretty much

2552
02:22:34,315 --> 02:22:37,668
a lot of fight and a lot of suffering.

2553
02:22:37,668 --> 02:22:41,558
Very little movement of the frontline.

2554
02:22:41,558 --> 02:22:42,939
The biggest change

2555
02:22:42,939 --> 02:22:45,591
of the last year was Ukraine victory

2556
02:22:45,591 --> 02:22:48,138
on the Black Sea, where they pushed

2557
02:22:48,138 --> 02:22:53,138
the Russian Navy into the western part of the pond

2558
02:22:54,258 --> 02:22:59,258
and restored the grain corridor

2559
02:22:59,806 --> 02:23:04,590
and export from Odessa apparently up to 75% of

2560
02:23:04,590 --> 02:23:06,060
what it used to be before the war.

2561
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:10,410
So that's the only major change.

2562
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:13,566
But again the price is enormous in terms of

2563
02:23:13,566 --> 02:23:17,970
wealth, in terms of, especially in terms of lives.

2564
02:23:17,970 --> 02:23:20,286
- So thinking about what 2024 brings,

2565
02:23:20,286 --> 02:23:24,667
Zelenskyy just fired Ukraine's head of the Army,

2566
02:23:24,667 --> 02:23:29,360
a man you've mentioned, general Valeri Zaluzhnyi.

2567
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:32,010
What do you make of this development?

2568
02:23:32,010 --> 02:23:33,156
- This is a very,

2569
02:23:33,156 --> 02:23:36,847
very dangerous moment in the war.

2570
02:23:36,847 --> 02:23:41,847
The reason for that is that Zaluzhnyi is someone

2571
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:44,337
who is very popular with the army

2572
02:23:44,337 --> 02:23:46,884
and with people in general.

2573
02:23:46,884 --> 02:23:51,884
So if you look at that through American prism,

2574
02:23:51,990 --> 02:23:54,870
that would be something analogous

2575
02:23:54,870 --> 02:23:59,870
to President Truman firing General MacArthur,

2576
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:06,990
given that stakes for US at that time, were very high,

2577
02:24:06,990 --> 02:24:11,073
but probably not as high as they're for Ukraine today.

2578
02:24:12,480 --> 02:24:13,710
In both cases,

2579
02:24:13,710 --> 02:24:17,130
what is at stake is certainly the idea

2580
02:24:17,130 --> 02:24:18,907
that the political leadership

2581
02:24:18,907 --> 02:24:21,922
and military leadership have to be on the same page.

2582
02:24:21,922 --> 02:24:26,922
And the question is whether on the part of Zelenskyy,

2583
02:24:27,295 --> 02:24:31,166
this is just the change of the leadership

2584
02:24:31,166 --> 02:24:35,523
or this is also the change of his approach to the war.

2585
02:24:36,390 --> 02:24:39,083
And then can mean many things.

2586
02:24:39,083 --> 02:24:42,675
One can mean him taking more active part in

2587
02:24:42,675 --> 02:24:44,909
planning operations.

2588
02:24:44,909 --> 02:24:49,909
It can mean also possible change of the tactic in the war,

2589
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:53,793
given that counter offensive didn't work out.

2590
02:24:55,410 --> 02:24:56,730
We don't know yet.

2591
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:58,370
I don't know whether the president Zelenskyy

2592
02:24:58,370 --> 02:25:03,030
at this point knows exactly what will come next.

2593
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:05,643
But this is the time when the change

2594
02:25:05,643 --> 02:25:07,358
of the leadership in the country

2595
02:25:07,358 --> 02:25:10,140
and in the army that is at war.

2596
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:13,170
It's one of the most trying,

2597
02:25:13,170 --> 02:25:14,880
most dangerous moments.

2598
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:17,880
- So the thing that President Zelenskyy expressed is

2599
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:20,800
that this is gonna be a change of tactics,

2600
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:23,192
making the approach more

2601
02:25:23,192 --> 02:25:26,920
technologically advanced, this kind of things.

2602
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:30,976
But as you said, I believe

2603
02:25:30,976 --> 02:25:35,976
he is less popular than the chief of the Army, Zaluzhnyi,

2604
02:25:37,137 --> 02:25:40,141
80% to 60%, depending on the polls.

2605
02:25:40,141 --> 02:25:43,198
Do you think it's possible

2606
02:25:43,198 --> 02:25:45,616
that Zelenskyy days are numbered as the president?

2607
02:25:45,616 --> 02:25:50,616
That somebody like Zaluzhnyi comes to power?

2608
02:25:52,050 --> 02:25:55,953
- What we know is that in this war,

2609
02:25:57,238 --> 02:26:00,400
Ukrainian people really united

2610
02:26:01,380 --> 02:26:03,220
around their president

2611
02:26:04,890 --> 02:26:07,890
and the armed forces were always, even

2612
02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:08,727
before the start of the war,

2613
02:26:08,727 --> 02:26:11,940
more popular than was the presidential office.

2614
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:16,830
So the change, if happened in that realm

2615
02:26:16,830 --> 02:26:19,259
was not so dramatic.

2616
02:26:19,259 --> 02:26:24,259
And from what I can see from social media in Ukraine,

2617
02:26:24,630 --> 02:26:27,991
there is a lot of unhappiness, a lot of questions.

2618
02:26:27,991 --> 02:26:32,490
But there is also realization

2619
02:26:32,490 --> 02:26:35,943
and very strong realization that country has to stay united.

2620
02:26:37,110 --> 02:26:40,176
And certainly the behavior of Zaluzhnyi himself

2621
02:26:40,176 --> 02:26:45,150
is there basically not suggesting any sort

2622
02:26:45,150 --> 02:26:49,050
of a pre-Georgian type of scenario.

2623
02:26:49,050 --> 02:26:53,878
That gives me some hope, actually a lot of hope.

2624
02:26:53,878 --> 02:26:58,290
And in terms of whether Zelenskyy's days are numbered

2625
02:26:58,290 --> 02:27:00,507
or not, I don't think they're numbered.

2626
02:27:00,507 --> 02:27:03,707
But if Ukraine stays a democracy

2627
02:27:03,707 --> 02:27:08,707
and I believe it'll stay, the what comes to my mind

2628
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:12,861
is the story of Churchill,

2629
02:27:12,861 --> 02:27:16,113
the story of De Gaulle,

2630
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:19,860
in Poland, the story of Pilsudski,

2631
02:27:19,860 --> 02:27:23,452
so once the war is over, really the electorate

2632
02:27:23,452 --> 02:27:27,402
in the democratic elections, they wanna change the

2633
02:27:27,402 --> 02:27:30,161
political leadership, they wanna move forward.

2634
02:27:30,161 --> 02:27:34,355
But Pilsudski came back to power

2635
02:27:34,355 --> 02:27:37,260
and De Gaulle came back to power,

2636
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:38,797
and Churchill came back to power.

2637
02:27:38,797 --> 02:27:43,103
So, no, whatever happens in the short run

2638
02:27:43,103 --> 02:27:47,205
or medium term run, I think that

2639
02:27:47,205 --> 02:27:50,853
Zelenskyy days in politics are not numbered.

2640
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:53,736
- So what to you is interesting,

2641
02:27:53,736 --> 02:27:56,550
for example, if I get a chance to interview Zelenskyy,

2642
02:27:56,550 --> 02:27:59,880
what to you is interesting about the person

2643
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:02,580
that would be good to ask about, to explore about

2644
02:28:02,580 --> 02:28:05,010
the state of his mind, his thinking his view of the world

2645
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:06,273
as it stands today?

2646
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:10,710
- Next month were supposed to take place

2647
02:28:10,710 --> 02:28:13,960
Ukrainian elections, they're not taking place

2648
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:18,960
because the majority of Ukrainians don't think this is

2649
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:21,930
the right thing to do, to change the president,

2650
02:28:21,930 --> 02:28:22,890
to have the elections

2651
02:28:22,890 --> 02:28:25,590
to have a political struggle in the middle of the war.

2652
02:28:26,580 --> 02:28:30,390
So Zelenskyy refused to call those elections

2653
02:28:30,390 --> 02:28:32,053
despite the fact that he is

2654
02:28:32,053 --> 02:28:37,053
and continues to be the most popular politician in Ukraine.

2655
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:39,840
So it would be to his benefit.

2656
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:41,297
But that's clearly not

2657
02:28:41,297 --> 02:28:44,271
what the Ukrainians want.

2658
02:28:44,271 --> 02:28:47,550
But the question of continuing as the president

2659
02:28:47,550 --> 02:28:50,678
beyond five years, also one way

2660
02:28:50,678 --> 02:28:54,289
or another would raise questions about the legitimacy

2661
02:28:54,289 --> 02:28:58,134
and certainly Russia will be playing this card

2662
02:28:58,134 --> 02:28:59,970
like there is no tomorrow.

2663
02:28:59,970 --> 02:29:04,970
And what I would be interested in asking Zelenskyy about,

2664
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:08,907
whether he sees that his second term,

2665
02:29:08,907 --> 02:29:11,560
which comes on those conditions

2666
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:16,560
would suggest different attitudes towards the opposition,

2667
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:19,336
maybe some form of the

2668
02:29:19,336 --> 02:29:24,336
coalition government, like it was the case in Britain

2669
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:27,878
with Churchill under different circumstances of course.

2670
02:29:27,878 --> 02:29:30,323
Or this is basically, in his opinion, something

2671
02:29:30,323 --> 02:29:32,310
that would be destructive

2672
02:29:32,310 --> 02:29:35,168
and something that would really be an impediment

2673
02:29:35,168 --> 02:29:39,811
for the issue, for the question of unity and war effort.

2674
02:29:39,811 --> 02:29:42,605
And I would ask this question, not

2675
02:29:42,605 --> 02:29:47,605
to basically suggest that that's the way to go,

2676
02:29:48,106 --> 02:29:51,560
but I would be very much interested to hear

2677
02:29:51,560 --> 02:29:54,450
what is his thinking about that is.

2678
02:29:54,450 --> 02:29:56,980
- Do you think there's a degree during war time

2679
02:29:58,290 --> 02:29:59,913
that the power that comes

2680
02:29:59,913 --> 02:30:03,656
with being a war president can corrupt the person, sort of

2681
02:30:03,656 --> 02:30:08,656
push you away from the democratic mindset

2682
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:13,680
towards an authoritarian one?

2683
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:17,160
- I think that there is a possibility of that, right?

2684
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:19,073
You, in the conditions of

2685
02:30:19,073 --> 02:30:24,073
any emergency, war in the case of the Soviet Union,

2686
02:30:25,034 --> 02:30:28,920
there was a Chernobyl disaster and so on and so forth.

2687
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:31,718
You make decisions much faster.

2688
02:30:31,718 --> 02:30:36,718
You create this vertical and then it's very easy to get

2689
02:30:38,736 --> 02:30:43,736
really used to that way, dealing with the issues

2690
02:30:44,002 --> 02:30:46,470
in the conditions of emergency, right?

2691
02:30:46,470 --> 02:30:48,565
And then they continue emergency (laughs)

2692
02:30:48,565 --> 02:30:53,565
or with no emergency, they're continuing the emergency mode.

2693
02:30:55,500 --> 02:31:00,500
I think again that that would be a very,

2694
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:03,810
very natural thing for any human being to do,

2695
02:31:03,810 --> 02:31:05,115
to make it easier.

2696
02:31:05,115 --> 02:31:09,900
Should I do that easier and in more effective way,

2697
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:11,578
or should I do the right way?

2698
02:31:11,578 --> 02:31:12,759
That's a challenge.

2699
02:31:12,759 --> 02:31:17,730
Sometimes it's difficult to answer this question.

2700
02:31:17,730 --> 02:31:20,070
- Lemme stay in power for just a little longer

2701
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:23,820
to do it the efficient way and then time flies away

2702
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:28,110
and all of a sudden you're going for the third term.

2703
02:31:28,110 --> 02:31:28,950
And the fourth term.

2704
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:30,660
- And suddenly it's easy to realize

2705
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:32,960
that actually you can't rule in any other way.

2706
02:31:33,995 --> 02:31:37,470
You just, whatever skills you had of people

2707
02:31:37,470 --> 02:31:40,050
around that can help, is that already gone?

2708
02:31:40,050 --> 02:31:40,883
- Exactly.

2709
02:31:40,883 --> 02:31:42,809
The people that surround you are not

2710
02:31:42,809 --> 02:31:46,920
providing the kind of critical feedback necessary

2711
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:48,096
for a democratic system.

2712
02:31:48,096 --> 02:31:51,000
One of the things that Tucker said

2713
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,110
after his interview with Putin,

2714
02:31:52,110 --> 02:31:56,106
he was just in this hotel just chatting on video,

2715
02:31:56,106 --> 02:32:01,106
and he said that he felt like

2716
02:32:01,596 --> 02:32:05,154
Putin was not very good at explaining himself,

2717
02:32:05,154 --> 02:32:10,154
like a coherent whole narrative

2718
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:12,060
of why the invasion happened.

2719
02:32:12,060 --> 02:32:13,830
It's just this big picture.

2720
02:32:13,830 --> 02:32:17,490
And he said that's not because he doesn't have one,

2721
02:32:17,490 --> 02:32:21,002
but it's been a long time since he's had somebody

2722
02:32:21,002 --> 02:32:24,745
around him who he has to explain himself to.

2723
02:32:24,745 --> 02:32:27,810
So he's out of practice, which is very interesting.

2724
02:32:27,810 --> 02:32:29,654
It's a very interesting point.

2725
02:32:29,654 --> 02:32:32,008
And that's what war

2726
02:32:32,008 --> 02:32:35,943
and being in power for a prolonged period of time can do.

2727
02:32:37,050 --> 02:32:39,870
So on that topic, if you had a chance to talk to Putin,

2728
02:32:39,870 --> 02:32:42,270
what kind of questions would you ask him?

2729
02:32:42,270 --> 02:32:44,100
What would you like to find out about the

2730
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:46,290
man as he stands today?

2731
02:32:46,290 --> 02:32:48,510
- As a historian, I have a lot of questions

2732
02:32:48,510 --> 02:32:53,370
and I have questions about when the decision was made

2733
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:57,330
to attack Ukraine and what went into this decision

2734
02:32:57,330 --> 02:33:00,030
because we're thinking about that.

2735
02:33:00,030 --> 02:33:00,863
We're trying.

2736
02:33:00,863 --> 02:33:04,667
So as a historian, I have this big question.

2737
02:33:04,667 --> 02:33:07,228
I have question about the Crimea when those decisions

2738
02:33:07,228 --> 02:33:09,360
were made.

2739
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:14,100
So that sort of questions, that interest me,

2740
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:16,778
but the rest either I think that I understand

2741
02:33:16,778 --> 02:33:18,740
what is going on with him

2742
02:33:18,740 --> 02:33:21,870
or I don't expect the answer that can help, for example,

2743
02:33:21,870 --> 02:33:25,620
a good question, whether you regret

2744
02:33:25,620 --> 02:33:29,386
or not, the start of the war in 2022,

2745
02:33:29,386 --> 02:33:34,386
given the enormous, enormous casualties on both sides.

2746
02:33:34,667 --> 02:33:38,569
But you can't expect from a politician

2747
02:33:38,569 --> 02:33:41,760
an honest answer to this question.

2748
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:42,593
Right?

2749
02:33:42,593 --> 02:33:44,757
So there are questions to which I know he can't

2750
02:33:44,757 --> 02:33:47,220
answer honestly,

2751
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:48,360
and then there are other questions

2752
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:49,560
to which I think he already

2753
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:52,190
provided all answers that he could.

2754
02:33:52,190 --> 02:33:55,320
So what what for me is

2755
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:59,010
of interest are basically questions for a historian

2756
02:33:59,010 --> 02:34:01,119
about the timing

2757
02:34:01,119 --> 02:34:04,860
and the logic of particular decisions.

2758
02:34:04,860 --> 02:34:06,532
- Well, I do wonder how different

2759
02:34:06,532 --> 02:34:11,010
what he says publicly is from what he thinks privately.

2760
02:34:11,010 --> 02:34:15,150
So a question about when the decision

2761
02:34:15,150 --> 02:34:18,112
to invade Ukraine happens is a very good question

2762
02:34:18,112 --> 02:34:22,830
to give insight to the difference between

2763
02:34:22,830 --> 02:34:24,105
how he thinks about the world privately versus

2764
02:34:24,105 --> 02:34:26,253
what he says publicly.

2765
02:34:28,710 --> 02:34:32,957
And same about other, you know, about empire, as if you ask

2766
02:34:32,957 --> 02:34:36,390
Putin, he will say he has no interest in empire

2767
02:34:36,390 --> 02:34:37,893
and he finds the notion silly,

2768
02:34:39,450 --> 02:34:41,043
but at the same time,

2769
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:45,951
perhaps privately there's a sense in which he does

2770
02:34:45,951 --> 02:34:50,951
seek the reunification of the Russian empire.

2771
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:54,892
- Not in the form of the Russian Empire, not in the form

2772
02:34:54,892 --> 02:34:58,050
of the Soviet Union, but certainly in some

2773
02:34:58,050 --> 02:34:59,910
form of the Russian control.

2774
02:34:59,910 --> 02:35:04,910
That's for me at least, it's quite clear.

2775
02:35:05,466 --> 02:35:07,660
Otherwise there would be no

2776
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:14,681
busts to the Russian emperors and Katherine

2777
02:35:14,681 --> 02:35:17,646
and Peter and others.

2778
02:35:17,646 --> 02:35:20,536
- You wrote in your book titled The Frontline,

2779
02:35:20,536 --> 02:35:23,848
Essays on Ukraine's Past and Present,

2780
02:35:23,848 --> 02:35:25,927
about the Russian question,

2781
02:35:25,927 --> 02:35:30,900
I guess articulated by Solzhenitsyn

2782
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:32,016
first in 1994.

2783
02:35:32,016 --> 02:35:36,930
Solzhenitsyn of course is the author of Gulag Archipelago.

2784
02:35:36,930 --> 02:35:38,504
He's half Ukrainian.

2785
02:35:38,504 --> 02:35:41,103
What is the Russian question?

2786
02:35:42,060 --> 02:35:45,535
- Solzhenitsyn clearly identifies himself as a Russian,

2787
02:35:45,535 --> 02:35:49,587
and his opposition to the communist regime

2788
02:35:49,587 --> 02:35:53,673
was a position of a Russian nationalist.

2789
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:59,900
So his argument was that communism was bad for Russia

2790
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:05,680
and for him, Russian question is about the

2791
02:36:06,008 --> 02:36:09,840
Russians, ethnic Russians,

2792
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:13,950
but also he was thinking about Russians

2793
02:36:13,950 --> 02:36:15,560
in Putin's terms,

2794
02:36:15,560 --> 02:36:20,490
or Putin thinks in Solzhenitsyn's terms about Ukrainians

2795
02:36:20,490 --> 02:36:23,160
and Belarusians constituting part of that.

2796
02:36:23,160 --> 02:36:25,710
So the Russian question is the biggest tragedy

2797
02:36:25,710 --> 02:36:28,644
of the 20th century, the division of the Russians,

2798
02:36:28,644 --> 02:36:30,540
the loss of the statehood

2799
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:31,830
and division of the Russians

2800
02:36:31,830 --> 02:36:34,285
between different states.

2801
02:36:34,285 --> 02:36:39,285
This is for Solzhenitsyn, Russian question.

2802
02:36:39,510 --> 02:36:43,110
And his original idea

2803
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:46,740
and plan was presented in the essay

2804
02:36:46,740 --> 02:36:48,450
that he published in 1990,

2805
02:36:48,450 --> 02:36:52,197
which was called How we Should Restructure Russia,

2806
02:36:52,197 --> 02:36:56,419
and restructure Russia meant getting rid of the Baltics,

2807
02:36:56,419 --> 02:37:01,366
central Asia and Caucasus and have Russians, Ukrainians

2808
02:37:01,366 --> 02:37:04,226
and Belarusians, including those

2809
02:37:04,226 --> 02:37:09,226
who live in northern Kazakhstan to create one nation state.

2810
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:11,610
So he was a Russian nationalist,

2811
02:37:11,610 --> 02:37:15,900
but he was thinking about Russian nation state as the state

2812
02:37:15,900 --> 02:37:17,922
of Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians.

2813
02:37:17,922 --> 02:37:21,810
And once the Soviet Union collapsed,

2814
02:37:21,810 --> 02:37:25,910
and his idea was not implemented in the 1990s,

2815
02:37:25,910 --> 02:37:30,910
he formulated plan B, taken over by Russia

2816
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:35,850
of Donbas, Crimea and Southern Ukraine, the areas

2817
02:37:35,850 --> 02:37:40,430
that now are included in the Russian Constitution.

2818
02:37:40,430 --> 02:37:43,380
So in historical terms

2819
02:37:43,380 --> 02:37:47,075
and intellectual terms, what is happening today

2820
02:37:47,075 --> 02:37:49,740
in the war between Russia

2821
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:53,131
and Ukraine is the vision

2822
02:37:53,131 --> 02:37:57,632
on one level or another level that was formulated

2823
02:37:57,632 --> 02:38:02,260
by the noble laureate, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

2824
02:38:03,677 --> 02:38:04,920
half Russian, half Ukrainian.

2825
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:06,300
- If there is such a thing,

2826
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:08,130
what would you say is the Ukrainian

2827
02:38:08,130 --> 02:38:10,800
question as we stand today?

2828
02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:13,290
- The Ukrainian question is very simple.

2829
02:38:13,290 --> 02:38:18,180
It's now, it's not anymore acquisition of the nation state,

2830
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:19,816
but actually a sovereign state.

2831
02:38:19,816 --> 02:38:23,130
But it's maintenance.

2832
02:38:23,130 --> 02:38:26,850
So the Ukrainian question is like dozens

2833
02:38:26,850 --> 02:38:27,777
of other questions in the 20th

2834
02:38:27,777 --> 02:38:32,730
and 21st century, the rise of the new state.

2835
02:38:32,730 --> 02:38:36,330
And that's what is the Ukrainian question,

2836
02:38:36,330 --> 02:38:40,141
whether, whether Ukraine will continue to its existence

2837
02:38:40,141 --> 02:38:42,900
as a nation, as an independent state

2838
02:38:42,900 --> 02:38:45,435
because that existence is being questioned

2839
02:38:45,435 --> 02:38:50,435
by stating that Russians and Ukrainians so on,

2840
02:38:50,460 --> 02:38:53,695
and the same people which de facto saying Ukraine is Russian

2841
02:38:53,695 --> 02:38:58,695
and also trying to to destroy the state.

2842
02:38:58,740 --> 02:39:01,710
- Is it possible that if the war in Ukraine continues

2843
02:39:01,710 --> 02:39:06,198
for many more years, that the next leader

2844
02:39:06,198 --> 02:39:08,916
that follows Zelenskyy would

2845
02:39:08,916 --> 02:39:12,270
take Ukraine away from a sort

2846
02:39:12,270 --> 02:39:14,829
of democratic western style nation

2847
02:39:14,829 --> 02:39:17,532
towards a more authoritarian one, maybe even

2848
02:39:17,532 --> 02:39:21,692
with a far right influence, this kind of direction

2849
02:39:21,692 --> 02:39:25,620
because of the war, the influence of war?

2850
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:27,240
- Everything is possible

2851
02:39:27,240 --> 02:39:30,570
and the longer the war continues,

2852
02:39:30,570 --> 02:39:33,816
the more likely scenario like that becomes,

2853
02:39:33,816 --> 02:39:37,416
but realization of that scenario

2854
02:39:37,416 --> 02:39:42,416
would go against the grain of largest part

2855
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:43,921
of Ukrainian history.

2856
02:39:43,921 --> 02:39:48,921
Where Ukraine really emerged

2857
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:53,093
as a pluralistic state on which the elements of democracy

2858
02:39:53,093 --> 02:39:58,093
were built in the last 30 years would go against the grain

2859
02:39:58,946 --> 02:40:01,950
of the Ukrainian society.

2860
02:40:01,950 --> 02:40:05,820
Where as one author formulated in the 1990s,

2861
02:40:05,820 --> 02:40:09,930
he wrote a book, Ukrainian Nationalism a Minority Faith,

2862
02:40:09,930 --> 02:40:12,540
where the nationalism was a minority faith

2863
02:40:12,540 --> 02:40:15,030
and radical nationalism continues

2864
02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:18,483
to be, or at least continue to be in 2019, a minority faith

2865
02:40:18,483 --> 02:40:20,223
during the last elections.

2866
02:40:20,223 --> 02:40:21,963
So possible,

2867
02:40:21,963 --> 02:40:25,305
but unlikely given the historical realities of the last

2868
02:40:25,305 --> 02:40:27,283
30 plus years.

2869
02:40:27,283 --> 02:40:29,456
- I could talk to you for many more hours (laughs)

2870
02:40:29,456 --> 02:40:34,456
on Chernobyl alone since you've written a book on

2871
02:40:35,910 --> 02:40:37,101
Chernobyl and nuclear disaster.

2872
02:40:37,101 --> 02:40:40,260
There's just a million possible conversations here.

2873
02:40:40,260 --> 02:40:43,087
But let me just jump around history a little bit.

2874
02:40:43,087 --> 02:40:48,087
Back before World War II, my grandmother lived

2875
02:40:48,266 --> 02:40:52,397
through Holodomor in World War II, Nazi occupied

2876
02:40:52,397 --> 02:40:57,390
Ukraine, Holodomor, what do you learn,

2877
02:40:57,390 --> 02:41:02,390
let's say about human nature and about governments

2878
02:41:03,570 --> 02:41:06,721
and nations from the fact that Holodomor happened,

2879
02:41:06,721 --> 02:41:11,430
and maybe you could say what it is and why it happened.

2880
02:41:11,430 --> 02:41:14,305
- Holodomor is a massive famine in Ukraine

2881
02:41:14,305 --> 02:41:18,692
between the years 1932 and 1934.

2882
02:41:18,692 --> 02:41:23,692
And it happened as the result

2883
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:28,690
of forceful collectivization of the agriculture

2884
02:41:29,970 --> 02:41:34,360
and a tamp on the part of Stalin also

2885
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:38,582
really roll Ukraine into the Soviet Union with

2886
02:41:38,582 --> 02:41:43,582
basically no potential opposition from Ukraine,

2887
02:41:45,008 --> 02:41:47,673
now national communists.

2888
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:51,313
So two things came together in December

2889
02:41:51,313 --> 02:41:55,740
of 1932 when in the same decree, Stalin

2890
02:41:55,740 --> 02:41:59,850
and Molotov signed a decree on the requisition of the grain,

2891
02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:03,360
which lead eventually to the mass starvation

2892
02:42:03,360 --> 02:42:06,738
and on the banning of Ukrainian language publications

2893
02:42:06,738 --> 02:42:11,610
and education out in other Soviet republics outside

2894
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:15,210
of Ukraine and introducing limitations on

2895
02:42:15,210 --> 02:42:19,020
the so-called Ukrainization policies.

2896
02:42:19,020 --> 02:42:24,020
So on the use of Ukrainian language in Ukraine itself.

2897
02:42:25,410 --> 02:42:29,257
And the numbers are debated.

2898
02:42:29,257 --> 02:42:32,404
The numbers that most

2899
02:42:32,404 --> 02:42:35,400
of the scholars work today are 4 million.

2900
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:38,010
But again, there are larger numbers as well

2901
02:42:38,010 --> 02:42:39,633
that circulate.

2902
02:42:39,633 --> 02:42:44,633
And this is, the famine

2903
02:42:45,060 --> 02:42:50,060
of '32, '33 was not exclusive Ukrainian phenomenon,

2904
02:42:50,186 --> 02:42:55,186
but most of Ukrainians in the Soviet Union died in Ukraine.

2905
02:42:55,470 --> 02:42:57,540
And Ukraine was the only place

2906
02:42:57,540 --> 02:43:02,400
where the policy on collecting grain were coming together

2907
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:04,470
with the policy of the cleansing

2908
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:07,680
of the political leadership sending people from Moscow

2909
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:11,740
to take over the leadership and attack on Ukrainian culture.

2910
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:16,740
So in terms of what I learn about human nature,

2911
02:43:17,762 --> 02:43:20,007
it's more me learning about

2912
02:43:20,007 --> 02:43:25,007
the ideologists of the 20th century

2913
02:43:25,230 --> 02:43:28,719
because it's not the only famine in the communist lands,

2914
02:43:28,719 --> 02:43:32,344
the famine in China, which was in terms of the numbers,

2915
02:43:32,344 --> 02:43:34,530
much more devastating than that.

2916
02:43:34,530 --> 02:43:37,680
It's in a different category and for a good reason,

2917
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:39,118
but you have holocaust.

2918
02:43:39,118 --> 02:43:44,118
What unites these things is the time, this is 20 century,

2919
02:43:48,993 --> 02:43:53,610
what unites them are the dominance in the societies

2920
02:43:53,610 --> 02:43:57,714
that are doing that, really ideologists

2921
02:43:57,714 --> 02:44:00,873
that not just devalued human life,

2922
02:44:02,040 --> 02:44:05,908
but considered that actually the way forward is

2923
02:44:05,908 --> 02:44:10,320
by destroying large group of populations defined ethnically,

2924
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:12,873
religiously, socially or otherwise,

2925
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:16,620
which tells about the time,

2926
02:44:16,620 --> 02:44:19,364
but tells also about humanity because for centuries

2927
02:44:19,364 --> 02:44:24,364
before that human life was valued, there were enemies,

2928
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:28,566
but the idea was that human life can put

2929
02:44:28,566 --> 02:44:32,730
and you can, at the end of the day, they can be slaves,

2930
02:44:32,730 --> 02:44:35,328
you can use them for productive force.

2931
02:44:35,328 --> 02:44:40,124
Countries in the 18th century with southern Ukraine,

2932
02:44:40,124 --> 02:44:42,490
they will looking for settlers, for people to bring

2933
02:44:42,490 --> 02:44:44,509
and live on land.

2934
02:44:44,509 --> 02:44:46,177
You move into the 20th century

2935
02:44:46,177 --> 02:44:50,393
and there is mass destruction of the population in the name

2936
02:44:50,393 --> 02:44:54,150
of ideologies, which basically are

2937
02:44:54,150 --> 02:44:57,139
by definition destroy human lives.

2938
02:44:57,139 --> 02:45:01,830
And that's what really so shocking and striking

2939
02:45:01,830 --> 02:45:05,550
because that's break with not just with issues

2940
02:45:05,550 --> 02:45:09,197
of morale, not just with issues of humanity,

2941
02:45:09,197 --> 02:45:14,197
with any common sense, what is happening.

2942
02:45:14,610 --> 02:45:19,234
And I'm absolutely convinced

2943
02:45:19,234 --> 02:45:21,090
that we didn't learn the lesson.

2944
02:45:21,090 --> 02:45:24,580
I'm absolutely convinced that we didn't learn the lesson

2945
02:45:25,470 --> 02:45:29,910
with turning our page on fascism and communism,

2946
02:45:29,910 --> 02:45:33,000
we somehow decided that we're free of that,

2947
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:36,480
that at least in those terms, history came to an end.

2948
02:45:36,480 --> 02:45:41,073
That what is ahead is in future, nothing of that sort,

2949
02:45:41,073 --> 02:45:44,047
what happened would take place to a degree

2950
02:45:44,047 --> 02:45:46,088
that people would get in trouble

2951
02:45:46,088 --> 02:45:49,290
for comparing any statements

2952
02:45:49,290 --> 02:45:52,295
or events that are happening today with

2953
02:45:52,295 --> 02:45:55,773
either the communism of fascism.

2954
02:45:57,221 --> 02:46:02,221
And so I feel responsibility of myself

2955
02:46:03,420 --> 02:46:07,590
and as a historian in particular for

2956
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:11,970
not doing a better job about telling people

2957
02:46:13,560 --> 02:46:18,210
that well, we are who we are

2958
02:46:19,470 --> 02:46:22,410
and we have as humans our dark side

2959
02:46:22,410 --> 02:46:25,680
and we have to be very careful.

2960
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:30,600
- So there is a human capacity to be captured

2961
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:33,245
by an idea, an ideology that claims

2962
02:46:33,245 --> 02:46:37,015
to bring up a better world as the Nazis did,

2963
02:46:37,015 --> 02:46:39,434
as Soviet Union did.

2964
02:46:39,434 --> 02:46:44,434
And on the path of doing that devaluing human life

2965
02:46:45,373 --> 02:46:47,494
that we will bring a better world.

2966
02:46:47,494 --> 02:46:50,250
And if millions of people have

2967
02:46:50,250 --> 02:46:54,750
to be tortured on the way to that, all right,

2968
02:46:54,750 --> 02:46:55,916
but at least we have a better world

2969
02:46:55,916 --> 02:46:58,138
and human beings are able to,

2970
02:46:58,138 --> 02:47:01,500
if not accept that, look the other way.

2971
02:47:01,500 --> 02:47:02,333
- Yes.

2972
02:47:02,333 --> 02:47:05,213
So, and in the name of a particular nation

2973
02:47:05,213 --> 02:47:07,980
or race, like, like with the Third Reich

2974
02:47:07,980 --> 02:47:11,998
or in in the name of the humanity of the future,

2975
02:47:11,998 --> 02:47:16,998
so not just devalue, human life destroy human life.

2976
02:47:17,700 --> 02:47:19,151
- Is there something fundamental about communism

2977
02:47:19,151 --> 02:47:21,780
and centralized planning

2978
02:47:21,780 --> 02:47:23,340
that's part of the problem here?

2979
02:47:23,340 --> 02:47:26,083
Maybe this also connects to just story of Chernobyl, where

2980
02:47:26,083 --> 02:47:31,083
that Chernobyl disaster is not just a story of failure

2981
02:47:32,282 --> 02:47:34,800
of a nuclear power plant,

2982
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:37,331
but it's an entire institution

2983
02:47:37,331 --> 02:47:40,500
of the scientific and nuclear institution.

2984
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:42,330
But the entirety of the government.

2985
02:47:42,330 --> 02:47:45,077
- There is, and there is a number of factors of political

2986
02:47:45,077 --> 02:47:50,077
and social character that produced Chernobyl.

2987
02:47:50,190 --> 02:47:54,219
And one of them is generally the

2988
02:47:54,219 --> 02:47:57,545
atmosphere of secrecy in the Soviet Union.

2989
02:47:57,545 --> 02:48:01,053
In the conditions of the Cold War,

2990
02:48:02,072 --> 02:48:05,850
Chernobyl reactor was a dual purpose reactor.

2991
02:48:05,850 --> 02:48:07,731
It could boil water today

2992
02:48:07,731 --> 02:48:11,070
and produce enriched uranium tomorrow, right?

2993
02:48:11,070 --> 02:48:12,960
So it was top secret.

2994
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:16,765
And if there were problems with that reactor,

2995
02:48:16,765 --> 02:48:20,991
those problems were kept secret even at people who operated.

2996
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:23,400
That's what happened.

2997
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:25,153
That's what happened in Chernobyl.

2998
02:48:25,153 --> 02:48:30,153
Another big, big part of the story, which is

2999
02:48:30,602 --> 02:48:35,370
specifically Soviet, that's the nature

3000
02:48:35,370 --> 02:48:37,046
of the managerial culture

3001
02:48:37,046 --> 02:48:42,046
and administrative culture in which people had no right

3002
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:43,440
to make their own decisions

3003
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:46,147
in their place, in their position.

3004
02:48:46,147 --> 02:48:50,530
A few years before that, Three Mile Island happened,

3005
02:48:50,530 --> 02:48:53,670
which was a big, big nuclear disaster.

3006
02:48:53,670 --> 02:48:55,593
But in terms of consequences,

3007
02:48:57,353 --> 02:48:58,500
nothing like Chernobyl.

3008
02:48:58,500 --> 02:49:02,547
And there in the context of the American legal culture

3009
02:49:02,547 --> 02:49:06,086
and managerial culture, people who were

3010
02:49:06,086 --> 02:49:10,557
operators who were in managerial positions,

3011
02:49:10,557 --> 02:49:15,030
that was their responsibility to take decisions.

3012
02:49:15,030 --> 02:49:16,620
President Carter came there,

3013
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:20,334
but he was not calling shots on none of those issues.

3014
02:49:20,334 --> 02:49:22,350
What you see with Chernobyl,

3015
02:49:22,350 --> 02:49:25,988
and people who saw HBO serious know that very well,

3016
02:49:25,988 --> 02:49:28,587
the moment the high official arrives,

3017
02:49:28,587 --> 02:49:31,920
everyone actually falls in line,

3018
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:33,870
is the official who calls the shot.

3019
02:49:33,870 --> 02:49:37,530
And to move population from the city of Pripyat,

3020
02:49:37,530 --> 02:49:41,472
you needed the okay coming from Moscow,

3021
02:49:41,472 --> 02:49:42,758
from the very top.

3022
02:49:42,758 --> 02:49:45,060
So that is Soviet story

3023
02:49:45,060 --> 02:49:49,444
and there is a global story of cutting corners

3024
02:49:49,444 --> 02:49:54,444
to meet either deadlines like it was with that test

3025
02:49:55,080 --> 02:49:56,776
that they were running at that time

3026
02:49:56,776 --> 02:50:00,810
or to meet production quarters.

3027
02:50:00,810 --> 02:50:03,497
This is not just socialist thing, you can

3028
02:50:03,497 --> 02:50:05,579
replace production quarters with

3029
02:50:05,579 --> 02:50:10,579
profit and you get the same story.

3030
02:50:13,935 --> 02:50:17,174
So some parts of in that story are generally

3031
02:50:17,174 --> 02:50:22,174
reflective of our, today's world in general.

3032
02:50:23,490 --> 02:50:26,596
Others are very specific for Soviet Union,

3033
02:50:26,596 --> 02:50:28,158
for Soviet experience.

3034
02:50:28,158 --> 02:50:32,184
And then the biggest probably Soviet

3035
02:50:32,184 --> 02:50:37,050
part of that story is that on the one hand,

3036
02:50:37,050 --> 02:50:37,883
the government in Moscow

3037
02:50:37,883 --> 02:50:41,338
and Kyiv, they mobilize all resources to deal with that,

3038
02:50:41,338 --> 02:50:45,900
but they keep information about what is happening

3039
02:50:45,900 --> 02:50:49,083
and the radiation clouds secret

3040
02:50:49,083 --> 02:50:52,350
from the rest of the population, something

3041
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:53,827
that completely would be impossible

3042
02:50:53,827 --> 02:50:56,580
and was impossible in US, in UK

3043
02:50:56,580 --> 02:50:58,920
where other accidents happened.

3044
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:01,350
And then guess what?

3045
02:51:01,350 --> 02:51:03,276
A few years later

3046
02:51:03,276 --> 02:51:07,449
the Soviet Union collapses very much also thanks

3047
02:51:07,449 --> 02:51:12,120
to the mobilization of people over the issue of Chernobyl

3048
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:17,010
and nuclear energy, and people

3049
02:51:17,010 --> 02:51:21,060
writing about that subject call it eco-nationalism,

3050
02:51:21,060 --> 02:51:26,060
ecological nationalism, which comes at least in part from

3051
02:51:26,239 --> 02:51:28,740
withholding information from people.

3052
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:32,603
And in Ukraine, mobilization didn't start over

3053
02:51:32,603 --> 02:51:34,623
the issues that led to independence,

3054
02:51:37,329 --> 02:51:38,162
didn't start over the issue of language

3055
02:51:38,162 --> 02:51:41,910
or didn't start over the issue of national autonomy.

3056
02:51:41,910 --> 02:51:43,327
It started under the slogans,

3057
02:51:43,327 --> 02:51:45,434
"Tell us the truth about Chernobyl."

3058
02:51:45,434 --> 02:51:50,313
We wanna know whether we live in contaminated areas or not.

3059
02:51:50,313 --> 02:51:55,110
And that was a very, very strong factor

3060
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:57,244
that crossed the,

3061
02:51:57,244 --> 02:52:00,287
not just ethnic religious linguistic lines,

3062
02:52:00,287 --> 02:52:02,640
lines between members of the party

3063
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:03,840
or not members of the party

3064
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:07,080
of the top leadership and not, and military and civilian,

3065
02:52:07,080 --> 02:52:08,760
because it turned out

3066
02:52:08,760 --> 02:52:13,740
that the party car didn't protect you from being affected

3067
02:52:13,740 --> 02:52:16,080
by radiation.

3068
02:52:16,080 --> 02:52:20,160
So the all national mobilization happens,

3069
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:23,280
the first mass manifestations are about Chernobyl,

3070
02:52:23,280 --> 02:52:24,810
not about anything else.

3071
02:52:24,810 --> 02:52:25,650
- That's fascinating.

3072
02:52:25,650 --> 02:52:26,790
I mean, for people

3073
02:52:26,790 --> 02:52:29,071
who might not know, Chernobyl is located in Ukraine.

3074
02:52:29,071 --> 02:52:30,954
So it would be, it's a fascinating view

3075
02:52:30,954 --> 02:52:34,128
that Chernobyl might be one of the critical sort

3076
02:52:34,128 --> 02:52:37,890
of threshold catalysts for the collapse of the Soviet Union.

3077
02:52:37,890 --> 02:52:39,325
That's very interesting.

3078
02:52:39,325 --> 02:52:41,368
Well, just as a small aside,

3079
02:52:41,368 --> 02:52:45,960
I guess this is a good moment to give some love

3080
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:46,813
to the HBO series.

3081
02:52:46,813 --> 02:52:48,827
It made me, even though it's British accents

3082
02:52:48,827 --> 02:52:52,140
and so on, it made me realize that some

3083
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:54,960
of these stories in Eastern Europe could be told very

3084
02:52:54,960 --> 02:52:58,860
effectively through film, through series.

3085
02:52:58,860 --> 02:53:02,884
It was quite a, I mean it was so incredibly well done

3086
02:53:02,884 --> 02:53:05,185
and it maybe I can ask you historically

3087
02:53:05,185 --> 02:53:08,163
speaking, were you impressed?

3088
02:53:09,420 --> 02:53:11,177
- I was, I was.

3089
02:53:11,177 --> 02:53:16,177
And I think that the miniseries, very truthful

3090
02:53:21,278 --> 02:53:22,512
on a number of levels

3091
02:53:22,512 --> 02:53:26,283
and very untruthful on some others.

3092
02:53:27,787 --> 02:53:29,487
(Lex laughs)

3093
02:53:29,487 --> 02:53:33,117
And they got excellent in a very well,

3094
02:53:34,767 --> 02:53:36,690
the macro and micro levels.

3095
02:53:36,690 --> 02:53:40,230
So the macro level is the issue of the big truth.

3096
02:53:40,230 --> 02:53:42,284
And the story there is very much built

3097
02:53:42,284 --> 02:53:45,780
around the theme that I just discussed.

3098
02:53:45,780 --> 02:53:48,567
Now it's about the cost of lies, right?

3099
02:53:48,567 --> 02:53:52,380
And the Soviet Union line to the people.

3100
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:55,920
And that's what the film explores.

3101
02:53:55,920 --> 02:53:59,975
So I call it a big truth about Chernobyl.

3102
02:53:59,975 --> 02:54:02,740
And they got a lot of

3103
02:54:03,990 --> 02:54:06,866
minor things really, really very well.

3104
02:54:06,866 --> 02:54:09,481
Like the curtains on the windows, like

3105
02:54:09,481 --> 02:54:13,590
how the houses looked from inside and outside.

3106
02:54:13,590 --> 02:54:16,573
I didn't see any post-Soviet film

3107
02:54:16,573 --> 02:54:18,840
or any western film that would be

3108
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:22,961
so good at captioning those everyday details.

3109
02:54:22,961 --> 02:54:27,574
But then there is a huge gray area (laughs)

3110
02:54:27,574 --> 02:54:29,310
in between big truth and small truth

3111
02:54:29,310 --> 02:54:32,700
is of the recreating the environment.

3112
02:54:32,700 --> 02:54:34,860
And that's how you get from one to another.

3113
02:54:34,860 --> 02:54:37,954
And then you see the KGB officers coming

3114
02:54:37,954 --> 02:54:40,710
and taking someone out of the meeting

3115
02:54:40,710 --> 02:54:43,520
and arresting, which was not necessary.

3116
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:46,920
You see the Soviet boss threatening someone

3117
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:49,104
to throw the person from the helicopter.

3118
02:54:49,104 --> 02:54:53,036
So you get this Hollywood sort of things despite the fact

3119
02:54:53,036 --> 02:54:55,783
that it's HBO series

3120
02:54:55,783 --> 02:55:00,000
and they're the best really in terms

3121
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:03,600
as a film in the fourth episode

3122
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:06,693
where they can completely decided just, to hell

3123
02:55:06,693 --> 02:55:11,623
with the reality (laughs) and let's make a film.

3124
02:55:11,623 --> 02:55:14,589
So they bring Legasov one of the key characters to the

3125
02:55:14,589 --> 02:55:18,810
this court meetings that they bring.

3126
02:55:18,810 --> 02:55:22,770
The key Soviet party, Boris Shcherbina, he wasn't there.

3127
02:55:22,770 --> 02:55:24,720
They created drama there.

3128
02:55:24,720 --> 02:55:29,720
So, but so they got the main thing, the big truth right.

3129
02:55:32,010 --> 02:55:35,910
And that's why I like this production.

3130
02:55:35,910 --> 02:55:39,990
- Sometimes you have to show

3131
02:55:39,990 --> 02:55:41,508
what something felt like, you have

3132
02:55:41,508 --> 02:55:43,564
to go bigger than it actually was.

3133
02:55:43,564 --> 02:55:47,503
I mean, if you, I don't know, if you experience heartbreak

3134
02:55:47,503 --> 02:55:51,103
and you want, and you see a film about it,

3135
02:55:51,103 --> 02:55:53,790
you want there to be explosions.

3136
02:55:53,790 --> 02:55:58,320
- You want to see this in images, visible, right?

3137
02:55:58,320 --> 02:56:02,130
So, but the question again,

3138
02:56:02,130 --> 02:56:04,410
I just mentioned KGB marching in

3139
02:56:04,410 --> 02:56:08,124
and so some party leader giving a speech,

3140
02:56:08,124 --> 02:56:12,527
they were not giving that speech, but the sense was there

3141
02:56:12,527 --> 02:56:14,130
and it was in the air.

3142
02:56:14,130 --> 02:56:18,840
And I, as people of my generation who were there, knew that

3143
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:19,673
and recognized that,

3144
02:56:19,673 --> 02:56:23,700
but for new generation, whether they are in Ukraine

3145
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:28,350
and Russia, in US, in Britain, in Zimbabwe, anywhere,

3146
02:56:28,350 --> 02:56:32,473
yeah, you have to do

3147
02:56:32,473 --> 02:56:37,473
this little and truth and introduce them and,

3148
02:56:37,544 --> 02:56:41,619
had a very interesting on air conversation

3149
02:56:41,619 --> 02:56:46,619
with the author of the script.

3150
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:50,198
Amazing.

3151
02:56:50,198 --> 02:56:52,032
And I asked him the question of, okay,

3152
02:56:52,032 --> 02:56:55,740
the film declared really the importance of the truth,

3153
02:56:55,740 --> 02:56:56,573
but how do you square that with, yeah,

3154
02:56:56,573 --> 02:56:58,321
(both laugh)

3155
02:56:58,321 --> 02:57:03,321
with the need in the film to really put it mildly

3156
02:57:03,644 --> 02:57:08,644
to go beyond the measures of truth,

3157
02:57:08,798 --> 02:57:11,880
whatever understanding of that term is?

3158
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:15,337
- Well, I suppose it is a bit terrifying that some

3159
02:57:15,337 --> 02:57:16,665
of the most dramatic moments in history are

3160
02:57:16,665 --> 02:57:20,280
probably quite mundane.

3161
02:57:20,280 --> 02:57:24,192
The decisions to begin wars, invasions,

3162
02:57:24,192 --> 02:57:29,030
they're probably something like a Zoom meeting

3163
02:57:29,030 --> 02:57:33,810
on a random Tuesday in today's workplace.

3164
02:57:33,810 --> 02:57:36,463
So it's not like there's dramatic music playing.

3165
02:57:36,463 --> 02:57:39,780
These are just human decisions and they command armies

3166
02:57:39,780 --> 02:57:41,583
and they command destruction.

3167
02:57:41,583 --> 02:57:44,122
I personally,

3168
02:57:44,122 --> 02:57:47,387
because of that, believe in the power of individuals

3169
02:57:47,387 --> 02:57:49,170
to be able to stop wars,

3170
02:57:49,170 --> 02:57:51,598
not just start wars, individual leaders.

3171
02:57:51,598 --> 02:57:54,570
So lemme just ask about nuclear safety

3172
02:57:54,570 --> 02:57:56,070
because there's an interesting point you make.

3173
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:58,567
You wrote in the book, in Atoms and Ashes,

3174
02:57:58,567 --> 02:58:00,900
a Global History of Nuclear Disaster.

3175
02:58:00,900 --> 02:58:05,400
So technically nuclear energy is extremely safe.

3176
02:58:05,400 --> 02:58:08,611
There's a number of people died per energy generated,

3177
02:58:08,611 --> 02:58:10,620
it's much safer than coal and oil,

3178
02:58:10,620 --> 02:58:13,110
for example, as far as I understand.

3179
02:58:13,110 --> 02:58:16,717
But the case you also make is you write quote,

3180
02:58:16,717 --> 02:58:18,720
"Many of the political, economic, social

3181
02:58:18,720 --> 02:58:21,218
and cultural factors that led to the accidents of the past

3182
02:58:21,218 --> 02:58:23,826
are still with us today,

3183
02:58:23,826 --> 02:58:25,908
making the nuclear industry vulnerable

3184
02:58:25,908 --> 02:58:29,430
to repeating old mistakes in new and unexpected ways,

3185
02:58:29,430 --> 02:58:31,383
and any new accidents are certain

3186
02:58:31,383 --> 02:58:34,258
to create new anti-nuclear mobilization.

3187
02:58:34,258 --> 02:58:36,840
And then you continue with,

3188
02:58:36,840 --> 02:58:39,750
this makes the nuclear industry not only risky

3189
02:58:39,750 --> 02:58:41,988
to operate, but also impossible to count on

3190
02:58:41,988 --> 02:58:45,813
as a long-term solution to an overwhelming problem.

3191
02:58:46,680 --> 02:58:48,282
So can you explain that perspective?

3192
02:58:48,282 --> 02:58:52,143
It's an interesting one, sort of speaking to the psychology

3193
02:58:52,143 --> 02:58:56,970
of when an accident does happen, it has a dramatic effect.

3194
02:58:56,970 --> 02:59:01,097
And also speaking to the fact

3195
02:59:01,097 --> 02:59:02,580
that accidents can happen

3196
02:59:02,580 --> 02:59:06,450
not because of the safety of the nuclear power plant,

3197
02:59:06,450 --> 02:59:11,130
but of the underlying structure

3198
02:59:11,130 --> 02:59:13,213
of government that oversees it.

3199
02:59:13,213 --> 02:59:17,400
- Yes, I wrote book on Chernobyl

3200
02:59:17,400 --> 02:59:20,850
and then tried to understand Chernobyl better,

3201
02:59:20,850 --> 02:59:24,317
but place in it in the context of other disasters

3202
02:59:24,317 --> 02:59:27,630
as a historian and was looking at the political factors

3203
02:59:27,630 --> 02:59:29,550
and social factors and cultural factors,

3204
02:59:29,550 --> 02:59:34,550
not the physics or engineering part of the story.

3205
02:59:35,936 --> 02:59:40,200
And the factors that are still with us

3206
02:59:40,200 --> 02:59:45,200
are like it was the case in Chernobyl

3207
02:59:45,570 --> 02:59:47,250
the authoritarian regimes, right?

3208
02:59:47,250 --> 02:59:49,508
And high centralization of the decision making

3209
02:59:49,508 --> 02:59:54,280
and desire to cut corners

3210
02:59:54,280 --> 02:59:57,660
and also the issues associated with secrecy.

3211
02:59:57,660 --> 03:00:00,840
So that is with us.

3212
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:05,370
If you look at where the future

3213
03:00:05,370 --> 03:00:09,570
of the nuclear industry is now at this point,

3214
03:00:09,570 --> 03:00:13,604
it's the regimes and parts in the Middle East.

3215
03:00:13,604 --> 03:00:16,002
That's a big new frontier.

3216
03:00:16,002 --> 03:00:18,615
The countries that are not particularly known

3217
03:00:18,615 --> 03:00:21,542
for the history of democratic existence,

3218
03:00:21,542 --> 03:00:26,542
where we also have the situation

3219
03:00:26,940 --> 03:00:28,733
that we had at Three Mile Island that we had

3220
03:00:28,733 --> 03:00:32,940
at Chernobyl.

3221
03:00:32,940 --> 03:00:35,730
This is the first generation engineers,

3222
03:00:35,730 --> 03:00:37,141
nuclear engineers, right?

3223
03:00:37,141 --> 03:00:41,400
So people who are, where the

3224
03:00:41,400 --> 03:00:43,850
country doesn't have a lot of experience in generations

3225
03:00:43,850 --> 03:00:45,759
after generations working in

3226
03:00:45,759 --> 03:00:49,020
that particular industry where it's all new.

3227
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:52,967
That is certainly additional risk.

3228
03:00:52,967 --> 03:00:57,480
What we've got now is this current war,

3229
03:00:57,480 --> 03:01:02,220
is something that, not that people completely didn't expect,

3230
03:01:02,220 --> 03:01:03,612
but didn't happen in the past.

3231
03:01:03,612 --> 03:01:07,188
You see the war coming to the nuclear sites,

3232
03:01:07,188 --> 03:01:09,734
Chernobyl was taken over by the Russian Army

3233
03:01:09,734 --> 03:01:14,734
or National Guard rather on the first day of the invasion.

3234
03:01:15,540 --> 03:01:17,220
Then there was Zaporizhzhia,

3235
03:01:17,220 --> 03:01:20,160
the largest nuclear power plant in Europe

3236
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:22,397
where the battle was waged on the territory

3237
03:01:22,397 --> 03:01:24,253
of the nuclear power plant.

3238
03:01:24,253 --> 03:01:29,253
The missiles being fired, buildings catching fire.

3239
03:01:29,294 --> 03:01:32,569
And the situation

3240
03:01:32,569 --> 03:01:37,289
that brought the Fukushima disaster was there at

3241
03:01:37,289 --> 03:01:42,289
Zaporizhzhia more than once, and Fukushima came

3242
03:01:42,540 --> 03:01:44,790
because the rectors were shut down

3243
03:01:44,790 --> 03:01:46,470
as they are at Zaporizhzhia,

3244
03:01:46,470 --> 03:01:50,520
but they still needed electricity to bring water

3245
03:01:50,520 --> 03:01:52,500
and to cool them down.

3246
03:01:52,500 --> 03:01:55,290
And in Fukushima case, it was the tsunami

3247
03:01:55,290 --> 03:01:57,450
that cut off the supply of electricity.

3248
03:01:57,450 --> 03:01:59,253
In the case of Zaporizhzhia, there was the war

3249
03:01:59,253 --> 03:02:01,804
that was happening in the area around Zaporizhzhia

3250
03:02:01,804 --> 03:02:06,030
that did the same effect.

3251
03:02:06,030 --> 03:02:10,362
So we have 440 reactors in the world today, plus, minus,

3252
03:02:10,362 --> 03:02:15,000
none of them was designed to withstand

3253
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:16,199
the direct missile attack

3254
03:02:16,199 --> 03:02:20,150
or to function in the conditions of the warfare.

3255
03:02:20,150 --> 03:02:22,320
If operators, they're human,

3256
03:02:22,320 --> 03:02:24,570
then they make mistakes like they did at

3257
03:02:24,570 --> 03:02:26,168
Three Mile Island or Chernobyl.

3258
03:02:26,168 --> 03:02:29,961
But think also if the war is happening around them,

3259
03:02:29,961 --> 03:02:31,980
if they're not sure what is happening

3260
03:02:31,980 --> 03:02:36,980
with their families, if they don't know whether they will be

3261
03:02:37,440 --> 03:02:40,195
next missile, whether we'll hit their room

3262
03:02:40,195 --> 03:02:43,230
where they, the control room

3263
03:02:43,230 --> 03:02:46,620
or not, that multiplies also.

3264
03:02:46,620 --> 03:02:49,801
So we are in a situation where

3265
03:02:49,801 --> 03:02:52,245
we are not done yet with

3266
03:02:52,245 --> 03:02:56,010
the nuclear accidents, new, each time,

3267
03:02:56,010 --> 03:02:59,103
it's not like we don't pay attention or we don't learn.

3268
03:03:00,270 --> 03:03:02,716
Smart people work on that.

3269
03:03:02,716 --> 03:03:05,395
And after every accident, try to figure the way how not

3270
03:03:05,395 --> 03:03:10,395
to step into the same trap.

3271
03:03:10,398 --> 03:03:15,300
But next accident would actually

3272
03:03:15,300 --> 03:03:18,360
expose a new vulnerability.

3273
03:03:18,360 --> 03:03:19,650
You deal with Chernobyl,

3274
03:03:19,650 --> 03:03:22,620
and then tsunami comes, you deal with tsunami

3275
03:03:22,620 --> 03:03:23,718
and then war comes.

3276
03:03:23,718 --> 03:03:27,920
And we really in that sense,

3277
03:03:27,920 --> 03:03:32,070
we have sometimes wild imagination,

3278
03:03:32,070 --> 03:03:33,704
but sometimes it's difficult to imagine

3279
03:03:33,704 --> 03:03:35,580
what can happen next.

3280
03:03:35,580 --> 03:03:36,539
So we are not done.

3281
03:03:36,539 --> 03:03:40,686
There will be nuclear accidents unfortunately in the future.

3282
03:03:40,686 --> 03:03:45,686
And that makes nuclear energy

3283
03:03:45,731 --> 03:03:49,260
so problematic when you count on it

3284
03:03:49,260 --> 03:03:51,477
to fight climate change.

3285
03:03:51,477 --> 03:03:53,640
I'll explain why.

3286
03:03:53,640 --> 03:03:55,320
You gave the figures

3287
03:03:55,320 --> 03:03:57,628
how many people die from burning coal, from

3288
03:03:57,628 --> 03:04:01,470
how many people die from radiation.

3289
03:04:01,470 --> 03:04:05,517
And it's a good argument.

3290
03:04:05,517 --> 03:04:07,091
Some people would question them

3291
03:04:07,091 --> 03:04:10,050
because it's also the issue of not just dying,

3292
03:04:10,050 --> 03:04:13,729
but impact of radiation on cancer,

3293
03:04:13,729 --> 03:04:17,070
on our health, which is not completely understood yet.

3294
03:04:17,070 --> 03:04:19,590
So it's still there, there is a lot of question marks,

3295
03:04:19,590 --> 03:04:21,540
but let's assume what you're saying.

3296
03:04:21,540 --> 03:04:22,373
That's the figures.

3297
03:04:22,373 --> 03:04:27,339
That's how it is, but we as people

3298
03:04:29,603 --> 03:04:32,103
we for whatever reason are not afraid of coal,

3299
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:35,640
but we're very much afraid of radiation.

3300
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:36,677
It's invisible.

3301
03:04:36,677 --> 03:04:40,605
It's Covid, it's everywhere,

3302
03:04:40,605 --> 03:04:42,508
and you can't see it.

3303
03:04:42,508 --> 03:04:45,960
And then you start having issues

3304
03:04:45,960 --> 03:04:49,630
and then you have problems.

3305
03:04:49,630 --> 03:04:52,890
And during the Covid,

3306
03:04:52,890 --> 03:04:54,993
the governments closed the borders.

3307
03:04:57,661 --> 03:05:00,875
Maybe a good idea, maybe not so good ideas.

3308
03:05:00,875 --> 03:05:02,340
Isolation.

3309
03:05:02,340 --> 03:05:05,864
So that was the way, governments started to fight

3310
03:05:05,864 --> 03:05:10,864
for access to Pfizer, to Moderna,

3311
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:14,983
to Sputnik, to whatever it is, to vaccine.

3312
03:05:14,983 --> 03:05:19,290
So now back to the radiation,

3313
03:05:19,290 --> 03:05:23,016
what is happening once Chernobyl happens,

3314
03:05:23,016 --> 03:05:27,420
that's the highest point in the development

3315
03:05:27,420 --> 03:05:29,683
of nuclear industry so far in terms of

3316
03:05:29,683 --> 03:05:33,660
how many new reactors were commissioned

3317
03:05:33,660 --> 03:05:35,831
or the licenses were issued.

3318
03:05:35,831 --> 03:05:40,831
The next reactor after Three Mile Island

3319
03:05:41,731 --> 03:05:46,731
in the US go ahead was given, it seems to me 10 years ago

3320
03:05:46,950 --> 03:05:49,500
or something like that, the Fukushima happens,

3321
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:51,810
the reaction is in China to that as well.

3322
03:05:51,810 --> 03:05:53,315
They're very much concerned.

3323
03:05:53,315 --> 03:05:56,010
So there is a saying in the field,

3324
03:05:56,010 --> 03:05:59,820
Chernobyl anywhere is Chernobyl everywhere.

3325
03:05:59,820 --> 03:06:04,080
After Fukushima, Germany decides to go nuclear free

3326
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:08,186
and gets there at the expense of burning coal.

3327
03:06:08,186 --> 03:06:10,560
So that's how we react.

3328
03:06:10,560 --> 03:06:15,257
And each major accident, that means global freeze

3329
03:06:15,257 --> 03:06:20,257
on the nuclear reactor production

3330
03:06:20,310 --> 03:06:21,860
for at least another 10 years.

3331
03:06:21,860 --> 03:06:25,554
So that's what I mean that nuclear industry, not just

3332
03:06:25,554 --> 03:06:30,554
in terms of technology

3333
03:06:31,170 --> 03:06:34,402
and not just in terms of radiation impact on health,

3334
03:06:34,402 --> 03:06:38,730
but also politically a very, very unreliable option.

3335
03:06:38,730 --> 03:06:42,839
- And to you, you suspect that's an irreparable aspect

3336
03:06:42,839 --> 03:06:45,544
of human nature in the human mind

3337
03:06:45,544 --> 03:06:47,280
that there's certain things

3338
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:49,173
that just create a kind of panic.

3339
03:06:51,012 --> 03:06:51,845
Invisible threats of this kind.

3340
03:06:53,697 --> 03:06:55,890
Whether it's a virus or radiation.

3341
03:06:55,890 --> 03:06:57,300
There's something about the mind.

3342
03:06:57,300 --> 03:07:00,786
If I get a stomach ache in the United States

3343
03:07:00,786 --> 03:07:04,620
after Fukushima, I kind of think it's probably radiation,

3344
03:07:04,620 --> 03:07:08,370
this kind of irrational type of thinking.

3345
03:07:08,370 --> 03:07:10,920
And that's not possible to repair?

3346
03:07:10,920 --> 03:07:13,248
- I think we can be trained, right? (laughs)

3347
03:07:13,248 --> 03:07:15,090
We can be trained.

3348
03:07:15,090 --> 03:07:17,400
- [Lex] Pretty smart, aren't we?

3349
03:07:17,400 --> 03:07:21,805
- But generally we're afraid of things that we see,

3350
03:07:21,805 --> 03:07:25,812
but even more we're afraid of things that we don't see

3351
03:07:25,812 --> 03:07:27,843
and radiation is one of those.

3352
03:07:28,920 --> 03:07:30,210
- Let's zoom out on the world.

3353
03:07:30,210 --> 03:07:31,661
We talked about the war in Ukraine.

3354
03:07:31,661 --> 03:07:36,510
How does the war in Ukraine change the world order?

3355
03:07:36,510 --> 03:07:39,810
Lemme just look at everything that's going on.

3356
03:07:39,810 --> 03:07:41,010
Zoom out a bit.

3357
03:07:41,010 --> 03:07:46,010
China, the Israel/Gaza War, the Middle East, India.

3358
03:07:50,550 --> 03:07:52,722
What is interesting to you, important

3359
03:07:52,722 --> 03:07:56,074
to think about in the coming years and decades?

3360
03:07:56,074 --> 03:07:59,107
- As a historian, and I'm trained that way,

3361
03:07:59,107 --> 03:08:04,107
I have a feeling of deja vu.

3362
03:08:05,280 --> 03:08:10,280
I see the Cold Wars coming back in many of its features.

3363
03:08:11,948 --> 03:08:15,960
And the war started

3364
03:08:15,960 --> 03:08:19,716
and we discussed that in 2014,

3365
03:08:19,716 --> 03:08:24,660
at least in my interpretation with Russia trying

3366
03:08:24,660 --> 03:08:29,660
to really reestablish its control

3367
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:31,950
over the post-Soviet space, and Ukraine

3368
03:08:33,214 --> 03:08:35,100
was crucial for that project.

3369
03:08:35,100 --> 03:08:39,115
And the more globally Russian vision since 1990s was that

3370
03:08:39,115 --> 03:08:44,115
they didn't like the American monopolar world.

3371
03:08:45,109 --> 03:08:48,958
They knew and realize that they couldn't go back

3372
03:08:48,958 --> 03:08:53,958
to the bipolar world of the Cold War era.

3373
03:08:54,960 --> 03:08:58,360
So the vision was multipolar world

3374
03:08:59,520 --> 03:09:02,730
in which again, it wasn't just academic exercise,

3375
03:09:02,730 --> 03:09:05,430
it was a political exercise in which Russia would be one

3376
03:09:05,430 --> 03:09:10,140
of the centers, one of the poles on par with China, on par

3377
03:09:10,140 --> 03:09:13,083
with European Union, on par with the United States.

3378
03:09:14,040 --> 03:09:17,160
That's very broadly speaking the context

3379
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:22,160
in which the war starts 2014, where we are now,

3380
03:09:24,390 --> 03:09:27,334
well we are now in Russia certainly trying

3381
03:09:27,334 --> 03:09:30,341
to regain its military strength,

3382
03:09:30,341 --> 03:09:35,020
but no one actually believes that Russia is the sort

3383
03:09:35,020 --> 03:09:39,303
of a superpower it was imagined before 2022.

3384
03:09:40,540 --> 03:09:45,540
We see certainly Russia finding the way

3385
03:09:46,320 --> 03:09:48,433
to deal with the sanctions,

3386
03:09:48,433 --> 03:09:52,230
but we don't see certainly Russia

3387
03:09:52,230 --> 03:09:57,230
as a economic power with any sort of a future.

3388
03:09:58,950 --> 03:10:01,890
So it's not an implosion

3389
03:10:01,890 --> 03:10:05,190
of the Russian military economic and political power,

3390
03:10:05,190 --> 03:10:07,983
but it's significantly actually, it's diminished.

3391
03:10:09,311 --> 03:10:11,760
So today, very difficult

3392
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:15,250
to imagine the Russia immersion as another pole

3393
03:10:15,250 --> 03:10:18,060
of the multipolar world.

3394
03:10:18,060 --> 03:10:21,227
Not impossible, but the war certainly made that

3395
03:10:21,227 --> 03:10:25,263
very problematic and much more difficult.

3396
03:10:26,250 --> 03:10:30,810
On the other hand, what the war did, it basically

3397
03:10:30,810 --> 03:10:34,424
awakened the West, the old West,

3398
03:10:34,424 --> 03:10:39,424
United States and Western Europe transatlantic alliance.

3399
03:10:39,795 --> 03:10:43,200
And on the top of that,

3400
03:10:43,200 --> 03:10:46,250
there are East European countries that are

3401
03:10:46,250 --> 03:10:49,775
even much stronger proponents of assistance

3402
03:10:49,775 --> 03:10:54,775
for Ukraine than is Germany or the United States of America.

3403
03:10:56,640 --> 03:11:00,150
So it is the replay of the Cold War story,

3404
03:11:00,150 --> 03:11:03,000
the return of the West, that one of the chapters in my

3405
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:06,540
book, The Russo-Ukrainian War, is called that way.

3406
03:11:06,540 --> 03:11:09,840
We also can see the elements of the rebuilding

3407
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:13,690
of the Beijing-Moscow alliance of the 1950s,

3408
03:11:13,690 --> 03:11:16,622
which was a very important part of the Cold War.

3409
03:11:16,622 --> 03:11:19,860
It was extremely important part of the Korean War

3410
03:11:19,860 --> 03:11:24,860
that in many ways launched also the Cold War globally.

3411
03:11:25,179 --> 03:11:28,715
So I see a lot of parallels of going back to the time

3412
03:11:28,715 --> 03:11:33,715
of the Cold War and the bipolar world that emerges.

3413
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:37,050
It's not anymore the world focused on Washington and Moscow.

3414
03:11:37,050 --> 03:11:41,850
It's more like world focused on Washington and Beijing.

3415
03:11:41,850 --> 03:11:43,729
And then there are countries in between,

3416
03:11:43,729 --> 03:11:45,720
there are countries in between

3417
03:11:45,720 --> 03:11:50,370
that join one block or another block that is emergent,

3418
03:11:50,370 --> 03:11:52,622
that is not fully formed.

3419
03:11:52,622 --> 03:11:57,622
This is, in my opinion, makes the task

3420
03:11:57,750 --> 03:12:02,460
of us historians to really go back

3421
03:12:02,460 --> 03:12:07,460
to the Cold War and look for through new perspective

3422
03:12:07,794 --> 03:12:09,630
on the history of that conflict.

3423
03:12:09,630 --> 03:12:12,485
Because there is a lot of things that we can learn.

3424
03:12:12,485 --> 03:12:17,485
- So in some ways history does repeat itself here.

3425
03:12:18,750 --> 03:12:20,520
So now it's a cold war with China

3426
03:12:20,520 --> 03:12:23,274
and the United States.

3427
03:12:23,274 --> 03:12:25,382
What's a hopeful trajectory for the 21st century?

3428
03:12:25,382 --> 03:12:27,903
For the rest of it?

3429
03:12:28,950 --> 03:12:33,950
- The hopeful trajectory is really trying to be as wise

3430
03:12:38,040 --> 03:12:39,771
and as lucky as our predecessors during the Cold War were.

3431
03:12:39,771 --> 03:12:42,188
(Lex laughs)

3432
03:12:45,780 --> 03:12:48,000
Because the dominant discourse

3433
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:50,994
so far about the Cold War was what a horrible thing

3434
03:12:50,994 --> 03:12:53,520
that Cold War was.

3435
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:54,660
What did we do wrong?

3436
03:12:54,660 --> 03:12:57,260
How did we end up in the Cold War?

3437
03:12:57,260 --> 03:13:01,315
And I think especially today,

3438
03:13:01,315 --> 03:13:03,183
this is a wrong question to ask.

3439
03:13:04,500 --> 03:13:09,240
The right question to ask is how did it happen?

3440
03:13:09,240 --> 03:13:10,317
What did we do so right?

3441
03:13:10,317 --> 03:13:15,317
That for now more than 70 years, we don't have a world war?

3442
03:13:19,170 --> 03:13:21,147
How come that after World War I,

3443
03:13:21,147 --> 03:13:26,130
world War II came within 20 years, how come that,

3444
03:13:26,130 --> 03:13:31,050
what helped us to keep the world on the brain,

3445
03:13:31,050 --> 03:13:35,820
but still away from the global war for such a long period

3446
03:13:35,820 --> 03:13:40,740
of time, how to keep the Cold War cold?

3447
03:13:40,740 --> 03:13:43,980
That's the biggest lesson that the history

3448
03:13:43,980 --> 03:13:45,270
of the Cold War can give us.

3449
03:13:45,270 --> 03:13:48,750
And I don't think we ask the question quite often

3450
03:13:48,750 --> 03:13:50,850
enough, ask the question that way.

3451
03:13:50,850 --> 03:13:52,560
And if you don't ask right questions,

3452
03:13:52,560 --> 03:13:53,940
we don't get right answers.

3453
03:13:53,940 --> 03:13:55,985
- Yeah, you've written a book,

3454
03:13:55,985 --> 03:13:57,845
a great book on the Cuban Missile Crisis,

3455
03:13:57,845 --> 03:14:02,845
and we came very close not

3456
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:06,956
to just another World War, but to, you know, a nuclear war

3457
03:14:06,956 --> 03:14:10,953
and the destruction of

3458
03:14:10,953 --> 03:14:14,289
human civilization as we know it.

3459
03:14:14,289 --> 03:14:19,289
So I guess it's a good question to ask,

3460
03:14:21,496 --> 03:14:22,329
what did we do so right?

3461
03:14:22,329 --> 03:14:25,641
And maybe one of the answers could be that we just got lucky

3462
03:14:25,641 --> 03:14:30,453
and the question is how do we keep getting lucky?

3463
03:14:32,430 --> 03:14:35,020
- Luck is clearly, clearly one of the factors in the

3464
03:14:35,020 --> 03:14:40,020
Cuban missile crisis because what happened there,

3465
03:14:42,270 --> 03:14:46,604
and there is one of the lessons is that eventually

3466
03:14:46,604 --> 03:14:50,160
the commanders at the top, they believe

3467
03:14:50,160 --> 03:14:52,110
that they have all the cards,

3468
03:14:52,110 --> 03:14:53,523
they negotiate with each other.

3469
03:14:53,523 --> 03:14:58,523
They try to see who blinks first

3470
03:14:58,617 --> 03:15:01,860
in the game of nuclear brinkmanship.

3471
03:15:01,860 --> 03:15:06,860
The trick is that they don't control

3472
03:15:07,080 --> 03:15:09,359
fully people on the ground.

3473
03:15:09,359 --> 03:15:11,940
The most dangerous moment,

3474
03:15:11,940 --> 03:15:13,490
or one of the most dangerous moment

3475
03:15:13,490 --> 03:15:15,298
of the Cuban missile crisis was the

3476
03:15:15,298 --> 03:15:20,298
Soviet missile shooting down the American airplane,

3477
03:15:20,577 --> 03:15:24,360
killing the pilot, an act of war, right?

3478
03:15:24,360 --> 03:15:26,958
So technically we're already in the war,

3479
03:15:26,958 --> 03:15:31,958
and the order to shoot the missile was given

3480
03:15:33,540 --> 03:15:36,630
with Moscow having no clue what was going on the ground.

3481
03:15:36,630 --> 03:15:39,138
Moscow never gave approval for that.

3482
03:15:39,138 --> 03:15:42,050
And again, I described

3483
03:15:42,050 --> 03:15:46,160
that in book many times about Kennedy bringing back his

3484
03:15:46,160 --> 03:15:48,690
wisdom from World War II years.

3485
03:15:48,690 --> 03:15:52,860
There there always will be SOB who didn't get the order

3486
03:15:52,860 --> 03:15:55,470
or miss things.

3487
03:15:55,470 --> 03:15:58,423
And that was happening on the American side as well.

3488
03:15:58,423 --> 03:16:00,992
So people who believe

3489
03:16:00,992 --> 03:16:04,050
that they're in control really are not in control,

3490
03:16:04,050 --> 03:16:07,105
and that can escalate whether they were

3491
03:16:07,105 --> 03:16:11,010
very often against, against their issues.

3492
03:16:11,010 --> 03:16:12,510
So that is one lesson,

3493
03:16:12,510 --> 03:16:16,422
but going back to why we are still here

3494
03:16:16,422 --> 03:16:18,840
and why the world

3495
03:16:18,840 --> 03:16:22,522
didn't end up in 1962, is that

3496
03:16:22,522 --> 03:16:26,910
the leadership, and that's, I come to the issue

3497
03:16:26,910 --> 03:16:30,270
that you strongly believing that people,

3498
03:16:30,270 --> 03:16:33,208
personalities matter, leaders matter.

3499
03:16:33,208 --> 03:16:37,713
They were very different, right?

3500
03:16:39,661 --> 03:16:43,650
Age, education, political careers, understanding

3501
03:16:43,650 --> 03:16:45,780
what politics are and so on and so forth.

3502
03:16:45,780 --> 03:16:47,778
- You mean Kryuchkov-

3503
03:16:47,778 --> 03:16:49,029
- Kryuchkov and Kennedy, yes.

3504
03:16:49,029 --> 03:16:53,840
But they had one thing in common that in one way they belong

3505
03:16:53,840 --> 03:16:57,840
to the same generation, that was generation

3506
03:16:57,840 --> 03:17:00,570
of the beginning of it all.

3507
03:17:00,570 --> 03:17:04,980
That was the generation of the hydrogen bomb, the bomb

3508
03:17:04,980 --> 03:17:06,946
that unlike the atomic bomb,

3509
03:17:06,946 --> 03:17:10,323
they knew could destroy the world.

3510
03:17:10,323 --> 03:17:13,964
And they were scared, they were scared

3511
03:17:13,964 --> 03:17:16,593
of the nuclear weapons,

3512
03:17:17,580 --> 03:17:21,420
and they tried to do whatever they could

3513
03:17:21,420 --> 03:17:23,307
pushing against the advisors

3514
03:17:23,307 --> 03:17:28,307
or were trying to deal with their anxieties.

3515
03:17:30,091 --> 03:17:32,853
The first is true for Kennedy.

3516
03:17:34,449 --> 03:17:37,380
Then later maybe for Kryuchkov to make sure

3517
03:17:37,380 --> 03:17:40,686
that this, that the war between the United States

3518
03:17:40,686 --> 03:17:43,936
and the Soviet Union doesn't start

3519
03:17:43,936 --> 03:17:47,550
because they knew that that war

3520
03:17:47,550 --> 03:17:49,463
would be a nuclear war.

3521
03:17:49,463 --> 03:17:54,463
So we have a very, very paradoxical sort of situation.

3522
03:17:55,686 --> 03:17:59,340
The crisis occurred because of the nuclear weapons,

3523
03:17:59,340 --> 03:18:01,470
because Kryuchkov put them on Cuba,

3524
03:18:01,470 --> 03:18:03,720
but the crisis was resolved

3525
03:18:03,720 --> 03:18:06,120
and we didn't end in the third World War

3526
03:18:06,120 --> 03:18:07,680
because of the nuclear weapons,

3527
03:18:07,680 --> 03:18:10,557
because people,

3528
03:18:10,557 --> 03:18:13,323
leaders were afraid of them.

3529
03:18:14,370 --> 03:18:16,800
And that's where I wanna put emphasis.

3530
03:18:16,800 --> 03:18:20,430
It's not that the nuclear weapons created crisis

3531
03:18:20,430 --> 03:18:24,240
or solved the crisis, is basically our perception of them.

3532
03:18:24,240 --> 03:18:27,420
And we are now in the age

3533
03:18:27,420 --> 03:18:31,710
after the Cold War era is the new generation of voters,

3534
03:18:31,710 --> 03:18:33,369
is the new generation of politicians.

3535
03:18:33,369 --> 03:18:37,410
We don't belong to the generation of beginning at all.

3536
03:18:37,410 --> 03:18:39,330
We may be not what beginning is,

3537
03:18:39,330 --> 03:18:40,927
but we think that this is-

3538
03:18:42,383 --> 03:18:43,216
- It's a different thing.

3539
03:18:43,216 --> 03:18:44,049
- That this is something else.

3540
03:18:44,049 --> 03:18:46,353
And it's very important.

3541
03:18:46,353 --> 03:18:47,490
- It's so fascinating

3542
03:18:47,490 --> 03:18:50,458
how that fades into memory that the power

3543
03:18:50,458 --> 03:18:53,031
and the respect and fear of the power

3544
03:18:53,031 --> 03:18:55,262
of nuclear weapons just fades into memory

3545
03:18:55,262 --> 03:18:59,040
and that we may very well make the same mistakes again.

3546
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:00,713
- Yes, we can.

3547
03:19:00,713 --> 03:19:03,450
- (laughs) Another leader said that, I believe,

3548
03:19:03,450 --> 03:19:05,181
but about a totally different topic.

3549
03:19:05,181 --> 03:19:09,717
Well, like you said, I'm also glad that we're here more

3550
03:19:09,717 --> 03:19:14,010
as a civilization that we still seem to be going on.

3551
03:19:14,010 --> 03:19:15,510
There's several billion of us

3552
03:19:15,510 --> 03:19:17,648
and I'm also glad that the two of us are here.

3553
03:19:17,648 --> 03:19:19,856
I've read a lot of your books, I've been recommending it.

3554
03:19:19,856 --> 03:19:21,432
Please keep writing.

3555
03:19:21,432 --> 03:19:23,010
Thank you for talking today.

3556
03:19:23,010 --> 03:19:23,970
This was an honor.

3557
03:19:23,970 --> 03:19:24,900
- Thank you very much, Lex.

3558
03:19:24,900 --> 03:19:26,253
It was a pleasure.

3559
03:19:27,210 --> 03:19:28,860
- Thanks for listening to this conversation

3560
03:19:28,860 --> 03:19:29,805
with Serhii Plokhy.

3561
03:19:29,805 --> 03:19:30,733

And now let me leave you

3564
03:19:36,759 --> 03:19:38,677
with some words from Earnest Hemingway.

3565
03:19:38,677 --> 03:19:42,502
"Never think that war, no matter how necessary

3566
03:19:42,502 --> 03:19:47,007
nor how justified, is not a crime."

3567
03:19:48,060 --> 03:19:50,943
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
