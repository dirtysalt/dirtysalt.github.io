00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
the following is a conversation with jim keller his second time in the podcast

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
 jim is a legendary microprocessor

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,639
 architect and is widely seen as one of the greatest engineering minds of the computing age

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,800
 in a peculiar twist of space-time in our simulation

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,080
 jim is also a brother-in-law of jordan peterson

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,800
 we talk about this and about computing artificial intelligence

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,760
 consciousness

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,119
 and life

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,640
 quick mention of our sponsors athletic greens all-in-one nutrition drink brooklyn and sheetz expressvpn

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,079
 and belcampo

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,920
 as a side note let me say that jim is someone who on a personal level

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,079
 inspired me to be myself

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,199
 there was something in his words on and off the mic

15
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,520
 or perhaps that he even paid attention to me at all that almost told me

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,039
 you're all right kid

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,960
 a kind of pat on the back that can

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,760
 make the difference

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,520
 between a mind that flourishes

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,080
 and a mind that is broken down by the cynicism of the world

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,680
 so i guess that's just my brief few words of thank you to jim

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,720
 and in general

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,640
 gratitude for the people who have given me a chance on this podcast

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,880
 in my work and in life

 and now here's my conversation

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,280
 with jim keller

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,680
 what's the value and effectiveness of theory versus engineering this dichotomy in building

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
 good software or hardware systems

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,320
 well it's good designs both

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,560
 i guess that's pretty obvious

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
 but engineering do you mean you know reduction of practice of known methods

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,680
 and then science is the pursuit of discovering things that people don't understand

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,399
 or solving unknown problems

36
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,680
 definitions are interesting here but i was thinking more in theory constructing models

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,479
 that kind of generalize about how things work

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,639
 and engineering is

39
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,920
 like actually

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,000
 building stuff the pragmatic like okay we have these nice models

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,879
 but how do we actually get things to work maybe

42
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,520
 economics

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
 is a nice example

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,879
 like economists have all these models of how the economy works and how different

45
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,560
 policies will have an effect

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
 but then there's the actual

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,120
 okay let's call it engineering of like actually deploying the policies

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
 so computer design is almost all engineering

49
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,000
 and reduction of practice is known message now

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,440
 because of the complexity of the computers we built

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,480
 you know you could think you're well we'll just go write some code

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,440
 and then we'll verify

53
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
 it and we'll put it together

54
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,120
 and then you find out that the combination of all that stuff is complicated

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
 and then you have to be inventive to figure out how to do it

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
 right so that's that's definitely happens a lot

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,519
 and then

58
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,319
 every so often some big idea happens

59
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
 but it might be one person

60
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,760
 and that idea is in what in the space of engineering or is it

61
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,319
 in the space

62
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,200
 well i'll give you an example

63
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,000
 so one of the limits

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,480
 of computer

65
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,040
 performance

66
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,800
 is branch predictions

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,840
 so

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,360
 and there's there's a whole bunch of ideas about how good you could predict the branch

69
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,319
 and people said there's a limit to it it's an asthmatic

70
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,360
 curve

71
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,239
 and somebody came up with a better way to do branch prediction

72
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,080
 it was a lot better

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,720
 and he published a paper on it and every computer in the world now uses it

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
 and it was one idea

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
 so the the engineers who build branch prediction hardware

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,319
 were happy to drop the one kind of training array and put it in another one

77
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,720
 so it was it was a real idea

78
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,440
 and branch prediction is is one of the key problems underlying

79
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
 all of sort of the lowest level of software it boils down to branch prediction

80
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,799
 boils down to uncertainty

81
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,280
 computers

82
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
 are limited by you know single thread computers limited by two things

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,599
 the

84
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,360
 predictability of the path of the branches and the predictability of the locality

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
 of data

86
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,799
 so we have predictors that now predict both of those pretty well

87
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,760
 yeah so memory is you know a couple hundred cycles away

88
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,400
 local cache is couple cycles away

89
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,880
 when you're executing fast virtually all the data has to be in the local cache

90
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,959
 so a simple program says

91
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
 you know add one to every element in array

92
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,479
 it's really easy to see what the stream of data will be

93
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,000
 but you might have a more complicated

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,759
 program that you know says get a get an element of this array look at something

95
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,639
 make a decision

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,040
 go get another element it's kind of random

97
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,600
 and you can think that's really unpredictable

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,040
 and then you make this big predictor

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,280
 that looks at this kind of pattern and you realize

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,320
 well if you get this data in this data then you probably want that one

101
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,880
 and if you get this one and this one and this one you probably

102
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,840
 want that one and is that theory or is that engineering

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,120
 like the paper that was written was it well it was asymptotic

104
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,520
 kind of kind of discussion or is it more like here's a hack that works well

105
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
 um it's a little bit of both

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,759
 like there's information theory in it i think somewhere okay

107
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,400
 so

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,320
 that's actually trying to prove yeah but once once you know the method

109
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,440
 implementing it is an engineering problem

110
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,680
 now there's a flip side of this which is

111
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
 in a big design team what percentage of people think their

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
 their their

113
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,360
 their their plan or their life's work is engineering versus design inventing things

114
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
 so lots of companies will reward you for filing patents

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,440
 yes

116
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,720
 some many big companies

117
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
 get stuck because to get promoted

118
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,600
 you have to come up with something

119
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
 new

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,280
 and then what happens is everybody's trying to do some random new thing 99

121
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,039
 which doesn't matter

122
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
 and the basics get neglected

123
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,919
 and or

124
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,440
 they get to there's a dichotomy

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,520
 they think like the cell library

126
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
 and the basic cad tools

127
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
 you know or basic

128
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
 you know software validation

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
 methods

130
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
 that's simple stuff you know they want to work on the exciting stuff

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,560
 and then they they spend lots of time trying to figure out how to patent something

132
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,479
 and that's mostly useless but the breakthroughs are on the simple stuff

133
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,720
 no no you no you have to do the simple stuff really well

134
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
 if you're brilliant building a building out of bricks

135
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,039
 you want great bricks

136
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,919
 so you go to two places to sell bricks so one guy says

137
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,880
 yeah they're over there in an ugly pile and the other guy is like

138
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,360
 lovingly

139
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,400
 tells you about the 50

140
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,720
 kinds

141
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,199
 of bricks

142
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,759
 and how hard

143
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,720
 they are and how beautiful

144
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,840
 they are and

145
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,000
 how square they are and you know which one you can buy bricks from

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,240
 which is going to make a better house

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,039
 so you're talking about the craftsman the person who understands

148
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,000
 bricks who loves bricks who loves their varieties that's a good word

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
 you know good engineering

150
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
 is great craftsmanship

151
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
 and when you start

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
 thinking engineering is about invention

153
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,560
 and set up a system that rewards invention the craftsmanship gets neglected

154
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,039
 okay so maybe one perspective is the theory the science

155
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,599
 over emphasizes invention

156
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,280
 and engineering emphasizes craftsmanship and therefore

157
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,919
 like

158
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,720
 so if you it doesn't matter what you do in theory well everybody

159
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
 knows like read the tech rags they're always talking about some breakthrough

160
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,720
 or intervention

161
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
 innovation and everybody thinks that's the most important thing

162
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,840
 but the number of innovative ideas is actually relatively low

163
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,680
 we need them right and innovation creates a whole new opportunity

164
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,720
 like when when some guy invented the internet

165
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
 right

166
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,759
 like that was a big thing

167
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,960
 the million people that wrote software against that were mostly doing engineering software writing

168
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,160
 so the elaboration of that idea was huge

169
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,800
 i don't know if you know brendan ike he wrote javascript

170
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,280
 in 10 days and that's an interesting story it makes me wonder

171
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
 and it was you know famously

172
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,599
 for many years considered to be a pretty crappy programming language

173
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,120
 still is perhaps it's been improving sort of consistently

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,440
 but the interesting thing about that guy is

175
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,400
 you know he doesn't get any awards

176
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,039
 you don't get a nobel prize or a field medal or

177
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,160
 a crappy

178
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,720
 piece of you know that software code

179
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,080
 that is currently the number one programming language in the world that runs

180
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
 now is cons

181
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,840
 increasingly running the backhand of the internet what does he end up does he know why

182
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
 everybody uses it

183
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,319
 like that would be an interesting thing was it

184
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,919
 the right thing at the right time because like when stuff like javascript

185
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,879
 came out like there's a move from you know writing c programs and c plus plus

186
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,240
 to let's call what they call managed code frameworks

187
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,958
 where

188
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,559
 you write simple code it might be interpreted it has lots of libraries

189
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,440
 productivity is high and you don't have to be an expert

190
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,679
 so you know java was supposed to solve all the world's problems it was complicated

191
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,440
 javascript came out you know after a bunch of other scripting languages

192
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,120
 i'm not an expert on it but

193
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
 yeah but was it the right thing at the right time

194
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
 or was there something

195
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,160
 you know clever because he wasn't the only one

196
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
 there's a few elements

197
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
 maybe if he figured out what it was

198
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,920
 no then he'd get a prize

199
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
 like that destructive theory yeah

200
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,440
 you know babies probably he hasn't defined this or he this needs a good promoter

201
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,680
 well i think there was a bunch of blog posts written about it which is like

202
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,240
 wrong is right which is

203
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,279
 like doing the crappy thing fast

204
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,200
 just like hacking together the thing that answers some of the needs

205
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,240
 and then iterating

206
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,000
 over time listening to developers

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,240
 like listening to people who actually use the thing

208
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,519
 this is something you can do more in software

209
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,040
 but the right time like you have to sense you have to have a good instinct

210
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
 of when is the right time for the right tool

211
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,160
 and make it super simple

212
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,440
 and just

213
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,040
 get it out there the problem is this is true with hardware

214
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,320
 this is less true with software is this backward compatibility

215
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
 that just drags behind you as

216
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,600
 you know

217
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,680
 as you try to fix all the mistakes of the past but the the timing

218
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
 was good there's something about that it wasn't accidental

219
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,000
 you have to like

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,480
 give yourself over to the

221
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,440
 you have to have this like broad sense of what's needed now

222
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,560
 and both scientifically and like the community and just like this it was obvious that

223
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,920
 there was no the interesting thing about javascript

224
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,800
 is everything that ran in the browser at the time like java and

225
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,920
 and i think other like scheme other programming languages

226
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
 they were all

227
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
 in a separate external container

228
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,600
 and then javascript

229
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 was literally just injected

230
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,399
 into the web page it was the dumbest possible thing

231
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,279
 running in the same thread as everything else

232
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,040
 and like

233
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,760
 it was inserted as a comment so javascript code is inserted as a comment

234
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
 in the html code and it was i mean it's there's

235
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,399
 it's either genius or super dumb but it's like right so it has no apparatus

236
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,640
 for like a virtual machine and container

237
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,680
 it just executed

238
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,920
 in the framework the program is already running and it was that's cool and then

239
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,079
 because something about that accessibility

240
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,279
 the ease of its use

241
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,440
 resulted in then developers

242
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,040
 innovating on how to actually use it i mean i don't even know what to

243
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,720
 make of that but

244
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,240
 it does seem to echo across different software

245
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,800
 like stories of different software php has the same story really crappy language

246
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
 they just took over the world

247
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,160
 i always have a joke that the random length instructions

248
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,560
 that variable length instructions that's always one

249
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,959
 even though they're obviously worse

250
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,600
 like nobody knows why x86 is arguably the worst architecture

251
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,320
 you know on the planet is one of the most popular ones

252
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,600
 well i mean isn't isn't that also the story of risk versus

253
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,079
 i mean is that simplicity

254
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,959
 there's something about simplicity that

255
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,160
 us in this evolutionary process

256
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
 is valued

257
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
 if it's simple

258
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,519
 it's

259
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,480
 gets it spreads faster it seems like

260
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
 yeah or is that not always true that's always true

261
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
 yeah it could be simple is good but too simple is bad

262
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,560
 so why did risk win you think so far did risk win

263
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,000
 in the long arc of history

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,480
 maybe

265
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,279
 we don't know

266
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,639
 so who who's going to win

267
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,760
 what what's risk what's cisco who's going to win in that space

268
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,800
 in these instruction

269
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,440
 sets

270
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
 a ice offers going to win but

271
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,880
 they'll be little computers that run little programs like normal all over the place

272
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,680
 but but we're we're going through another transformation

273
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,399
 so

274
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,240
 but you think instruction sets underneath it all will change

275
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,760
 yeah they evolve slowly

276
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,279
 they don't matter very much

277
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
 they don't matter very much okay i mean the limits of performance

278
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,279
 are

279
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,279
 you know predictability of instructions and data i mean that's the big thing

280
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,320
 and then

281
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,920
 the usability of it is some you know

282
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,839
 quality of design quality of tools

283
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,000
 availability

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,279
 like right now

285
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,959
 x86 is proprietary

286
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,360
 with intel and amd but they can change it any way they want independently

287
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
 right arm is proprietary

288
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,600
 to arm and they won't let anybody else change it so it's like a sole point

289
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,480
 and risk 5 is open source so anybody can change it which is super cool

290
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,279
 but that also

291
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:11,760
 might mean

292
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
 it gets changed in too many random

293
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,440
 ways

294
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,279
 that there's no common

295
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,600
 sub subset of it that people can use

296
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,639
 do you like open

297
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,760
 or do you like clothes

298
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,440
 like if you were to bet all your money

299
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
 on one or the other risk

300
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,200
 five versus

301
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,000
 no idea

302
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,680
 it's case dependent well x86

303
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,959
 oddly enough when intel first started developing it they licensed

304
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,160
 like seven people

305
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,959
 so it was the open architecture

306
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,360
 and then they move faster than others and also bought one or two of them

307
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,160
 but there were seven different people making x86

308
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,120
 because at the time there was

309
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,279
 6502

310
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,880
 and z80s and you know 8086

311
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,320
 and you could argue everybody thought z80 was the better instruction set but that was propriety

312
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,000
 proprietary to one place oh and the 6800

313
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,360
 so there's like five or four or five different microprocessors

314
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
 intel went open

315
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,000
 got the market

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,760
 share because people felt like they had multiple

317
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,160
 sources

318
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
 from it and then over time it narrowed down the two

319
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,519
 players

320
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,320
 so why you as a historian

321
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,399
 well why did intel win for so long

322
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,000
 with the

323
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,120
 with their processors

324
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,720
 i mean they were great

325
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
 their process development was great

326
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,920
 oh so it's

327
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,959
 just looking back to javascript and brand nike is

328
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,680
 microsoft

329
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,880
 and netscape and all these internet browsers

330
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,920
 microsoft won the browser game because they aggressively stole other people's ideas

331
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,959
 like right after they did it you know i i don't know

332
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:39,680
 if intel

333
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,240
 was stealing

334
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,040
 other people's ideas they started making a

335
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,079
 just good way they started making rams

336
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,160
 random access memories

337
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,680
 and then

338
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,800
 at the time when the japanese manufacturers came up

339
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,480
 you know they were getting out competed on that and they pivoted the microprocessors

340
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,279
 and they made the first you know integrated microprocessor

341
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,240
 programs

342
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,040
 4004

343
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,720
 or something who was behind that pivot that's a hell of a pivot andy grove

344
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,639
 and he was great

345
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,320
 that's a hell of a pivot and then they led

346
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
 semiconductor

347
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,760
 industry

348
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,920
 like they were just a little company ibm

349
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,880
 all kinds of big companies had both loads of money

350
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
 and they out innovated everybody

351
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,160
 auto innovated okay yeah yeah so it's not like marketing it's not yeah

352
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,399
 their processor designs were pretty good

353
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,959
 um i think the

354
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,000
 you know core 2 was probably the first one i thought was great

355
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,399
 it was a really fast processor and then haswell was great

356
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,600
 what makes a great processor

357
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,759
 in that delay oh if you just look at it's performance

358
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,160
 versus

359
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,639
 everybody

360
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,519
 else

361
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
 it's you know the size of it the you know usability

362
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
 of it so it's not specific

363
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,040
 some kind of element that makes it beautiful it's just like literally just raw performance

364
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,600
 is that how you think about processors it's just like raw performance

365
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,120
 of course

366
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,519
 it's like a horse race the fastest one wins now you don't care how [laughter]

367
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
 just as long as it was well there's the fastest in the environment

368
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:10,959
 like

369
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,399
 right you know for years you made the fastest

370
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,800
 one you could and then people started to have power limits

371
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,600
 so then you made the fastest at the right power point

372
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,399
 and then and then when we started doing multiprocessors

373
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,440
 like

374
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,519
 if you could scale your processors

375
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,199
 more than the other guy you could be 10

376
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,320
 faster on like a single thread but you have more threads

377
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,000
 so there's lots of variability

378
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,959
 and then

379
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,959
 arm

380
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,399
 really explored

381
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,800
 like you know they have the a series and the r series and the m series

382
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,120
 like a family of processors for all these different design points from like unbelievably

383
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
 small and simple

384
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,399
 and so then when you're doing the design

385
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,279
 it's sort of like this big palette of cpus

386
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,040
 like they're the only ones with a credible you know top to bottom palette and

387
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,320
 what do you mean incredible

388
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
 top to bottom well there's people who make microcontrollers

389
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,920
 that are small but they don't have a fast one there's people make fast processors

390
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,799
 but don't have a little a medium one or a small one

391
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,919
 is it hard to do

392
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:06,959
 that full palette

393
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,199
 that's that seems like a it's a lot of different

394
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,640
 so what's the difference in

395
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,280
 the arm folks and intel

396
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,359
 in terms of the way they're approaching this problem well intel

397
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,799
 almost all their processor designs were you know very custom

398
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,760
 high end you know for the last 15 20 years the fastest force possible yeah

399
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,439
 in one horseshoe

400
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,240
 yeah and then architecture they're really good but the company itself was

401
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,280
 fairly insular

402
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,160
 to what's going on in the industry with cad tools and stuff

403
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,679
 and there's this debate about custom design versus synthesis

404
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,200
 and how do you approach that

405
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,320
 i'd say intel was slow on the getting to synthesize

406
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,600
 processors

407
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,640
 arm

408
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,720
 came in from the bottom and they generated ip which went to all kinds of customers

409
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,880
 so they had very little say how the customer implemented their ip

410
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,280
 so arm is super friendly to the synthesis ip environment

411
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,600
 whereas intel said we're going to make this great

412
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,360
 client chip server chip with our own cad tools with our own process

413
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,320
 with our own

414
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,679
 you know other supporting

415
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,280
 ip and everything only works with our stuff

416
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,200
 so is that

417
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,280
 is arm winning the mobile platform space in terms of processors and so

418
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,720
 in that and

419
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,679
 what you're describing

420
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,240
 is why they're winning well they had lots of people doing lots of different experiments

421
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,280
 so they controlled the processor architecture and ip

422
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,840
 but they let people put in lots of different chips

423
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,280
 and there was a lot of variability

424
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,039
 in what happened there

425
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:35,520
 whereas

426
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,960
 intel when they made their mobile

427
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,760
 their foray

428
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,919
 into mobile they had one team doing one

429
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,280
 part

430
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,000
 right so it wasn't 10 experiments and then their mindset was pc mindset microsoft software mindset

431
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,240
 and that brought a whole bunch of things along that

432
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,240
 the mobile world embedded world don't do do you think it was possible for intel

433
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,360
 to pivot hard and win the mobile

434
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,160
 market

435
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
 that's a hell of a difficult thing to do right for a huge company

436
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,200
 to just pivot

437
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,200
 i mean it's so interesting to because we'll talk about your current work it's like

438
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,240
 it's clear that pcs were dominating for several decades like desktop computers and then mobile

439
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,919
 it's unclear

440
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,160
 it's a leadership question

441
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,520
 like like apple under steve jobs when he came back they pivoted multiple times

442
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,440
 you know they built ipads and itunes

443
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,039
 and phones and tablets

444
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,200
 and great macs like like who knew computers should be made out of aluminum

445
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,120
 nobody knew that

446
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,400
 that they're great it's

447
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,760
 super fun that was steve

448
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
 yeah steve jobs like they pivoted

449
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,919
 multiple

450
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,360
 times

451
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,679
 and you know the old intel they they did that multiple times

452
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,919
 they made drams and processors and processes and

453
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,320
 i got to ask this what was it like working with steve

454
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,880
 jobs

455
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,240
 i didn't work with him

456
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,200
 did you interact with him twice

457
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,679
 i said hi to him twice in the cafeteria

458
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,159
 what did he say hi he said hey fellas

459
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,760
 he was friendly

460
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,960
 he was wandering around and with somebody he couldn't find the table because the cafeteria was

461
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,159
 was packed

462
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,520
 and i gave my table

463
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,919
 but i worked for mike colbert who talked to

464
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,679
 like mike was the unofficial

465
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,120
 cto of apple

466
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,360
 and a brilliant guy and he worked for steve for 25 years maybe more

467
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,559
 and he talked to steve multiple times a day

468
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:26,960
 and

469
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
 he was one of the people who could

470
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,080
 put up with steve's let's say brilliance

471
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,679
 and intensity

472
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,120
 and and steve really liked him and steve trusted mike to translate

473
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,960
 the he thought up

474
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,919
 into engineering

475
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,039
 products at work and then mike ran a group called platform architecture

476
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,640
 and i was in that group

477
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
 so many times i'd be sitting with mike and the phone would ring

478
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,559
 it'd be steve

479
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,720
 and mike would hold the phone like this because steve

480
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
 would be yelling about something

481
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,320
 or other

482
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,960
 yeah

483
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,799
 and he would translate it and he translated

484
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,840
 and then he would say

485
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,240
 steve wants us to do this

486
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
 so

487
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,240
 was steve a good engineer or no i don't know

488
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,440
 he was a great idea guy idea person he's a really good selector for talent

489
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,640
 yeah so that seems to be one of the key elements of leadership right

490
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,320
 and then he was a really good first principals

491
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,360
 guy like

492
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,799
 like somebody say something couldn't be done and he would just think

493
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,679
 that's obviously wrong

494
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,919
 right but you know

495
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,919
 maybe it's hard to do maybe it's expensive

496
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,760
 to do maybe we need different people

497
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,080
 you know there's like a whole bunch of you know if you want to do something

498
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
 hard

499
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,440
 you know maybe it takes time maybe you have to iterate

500
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,600
 there's a whole bunch of things you could think about

501
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
 but saying it can't be done is stupid

502
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
 how would you compare

503
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,919
 so it seems like elon musk is more engineering

504
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,720
 centric

505
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,200
 but it's also i think he considers himself a designer

506
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,880
 too he has a design mind

507
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,760
 steve jobs

508
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,400
 feels like he is much more idea space design space versus engineering

509
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,840
 yeah just make it happen

510
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
 like the world should be this way

511
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,640
 just figure it out but but he used computers

512
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,679
 you know he had computer people talk to him all the time

513
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,240
 like mike was a really good computer guy he knew what computers

514
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,720
 could do computer meaning computer hardware like

515
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,679
 hardware software

516
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,799
 all of pieces the whole thing and then he would

517
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,400
 you know have an idea about what could we do with this next

518
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,760
 that was grounded in reality it wasn't like he was you know just

519
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,480
 finger painting on the wall and wishing somebody would interpret

520
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,360
 it like

521
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,720
 so he had this interesting

522
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,360
 connection

523
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,120
 because

524
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,159
 no he wasn't a computer architect or a designer

525
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,720
 but he had an intuition from the computers we had to what could happen

526
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,679
 and

527
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,919
 essentially you say intuition because it seems like he was pissing off a lot of engineers

528
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,679
 in his intuition about what canada can't be done those like the

529
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,720
 what is all these stories

530
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,600
 about like floppy

531
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:47,919
 disks

532
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,919
 and all that kind of stuff like yeah so

533
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,159
 in in steve the first round like he'd go into a lab

534
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,080
 and look at what's going on and hate it and and

535
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,760
 fire people or or ask somebody in the elevator what they're doing for apple

536
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,679
 and you know not be happy

537
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,400
 when he came back my impression was

538
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,880
 is he surrounded himself with this relatively

539
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,919
 small group of people yes and didn't really interact

540
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,760
 outside of that as much

541
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,880
 and then the joke was you'd see like somebody moving a prototype

542
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,679
 through the

543
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,640
 quad with a with a black blanket over it

544
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,799
 and that was because it was secret

545
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,440
 you know partly

546
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,000
 from steve

547
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,720
 because they didn't want

548
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,039
 steve

549
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,799
 to see it until it was ready

550
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,400
 yeah the dynamic with johnny ive and steve

551
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,320
 is interesting it's like you don't wanna

552
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,320
 he ruins as many ideas as he generates yeah

553
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
 yeah it's a dangerous kind of

554
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,000
 line to walk

555
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
 if you have a lot of ideas like

556
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,559
 like gordon bell was famous for ideas

557
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,360
 right and it wasn't that the percentage of good ideas was way higher than anybody else

558
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,039
 it was he had so many ideas

559
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,960
 and and he was also good at talking people about it and and getting the filters

560
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,080
 right

561
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,960
 and you know seeing through stuff

562
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,320
 whereas elon was like hey i want to build rockets so

563
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,480
 steve would hire a bunch of rocket guys and elon would go read rocket manuals

564
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,440
 so ian is a better engineer a sense like or like more

565
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,120
 like a love and passion for the manuals yeah and the details the details

566
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,159
 the craftsmanship too right well i guess you had craftsmanship too but of a different kind

567
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,080
 what do you make of the

568
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,880
 just the standard

569
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,840
 for just a little longer

570
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,120
 what do you make of like the anger

571
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,840
 and the passion

572
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,520
 and all that the the firing

573
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,159
 and the

574
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,279
 mood swings

575
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,159
 and

576
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,600
 the madness the

577
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
 um you know being emotional

578
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,880
 and all that that's

579
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,320
 steve and i i guess elon

580
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,840
 too so what is that a

581
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,520
 is that a bugger feature

582
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
 it's a feature

583
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,840
 so there's a graph which is

584
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,480
 y-axis productivity yeah x-axis at zero it's chaos

585
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,400
 yeah and infinity is complete order yeah right so as you go from

586
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,799
 the you know the origin

587
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,440
 as you improve order you improve productivity

588
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,240
 yeah and at some point productivity peaks

589
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,320
 and then it goes back down again yeah too much order nothing can happen yes

590
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,919
 but the question is is

591
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,200
 how close to the chaos

592
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,960
 is that no no no here's the thing

593
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
 is once you start moving the directional

594
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,960
 order the force vector to drive you towards order

595
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
 is unstoppable

596
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,200
 oh this is the same every organization

597
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,919
 will

598
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,080
 move to the place where their productivity is stymied by order so you need

599
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,120
 so the question is who's the counter force

600
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,720
 like because it also feels really good as you get more organized

601
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
 then productivity goes up the organization

602
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,960
 feels it they orient it towards it right to hire more people

603
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
 they get more guys who can run process you get bigger

604
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,679
 right and then inevitably inevitably

605
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,520
 the organization gets captured by the bureaucracy that manages all the processes

606
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,440
 right and then humans really like that and so if you just walk into a room

607
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,799
 and say guys

608
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,880
 love what you're doing

609
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,880
 but i need you to have less order

610
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,640
 if you don't have some force behind that nothing will happen

611
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,320
 i i can't tell you on how many levels that's profound so

612
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,000
 so that's why i'd say it's a feature

613
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,039
 now

614
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,960
 could you be nicer about it

615
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,279
 i don't know i don't know any good examples of being nicer about it

616
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:21,679
 well

617
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,159
 the funny

618
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,120
 thing is to get stuff

619
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,720
 done you need people who can manage

620
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,039
 stuff

621
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:25,520
 and manage

622
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,240
 people because humans

623
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,799
 are complicated

624
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,080
 they need lots of care and feeding

625
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,120
 and you need to tell them

626
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,159
 they look nice and they're doing good stuff and pat them on the back

627
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:32,960
 right

628
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,840
 i don't know

629
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,080
 do you tell me is that is that needed

630
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,520
 humans need that i had a friend he started to manage the group and he said

631
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,279
 i figured it out you have to praise them before they do anything

632
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,039
 i was waiting until they were done

633
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,080
 and they're always mad at me now i tell them what a great job they're doing

634
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,200
 while they're doing it

635
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,240
 but then you get stuck

636
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,880
 in that trap

637
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,720
 because then when they're not doing something how do you confront

638
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,919
 these people

639
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,120
 i think a lot of people that had trauma in their childhood who disagree

640
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,080
 with you successful

641
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,159
 people that you just first do the rough stuff and then be nice later

642
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,039
 i don't know

643
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,600
 okay but

644
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,640
 you know nice engineering

645
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:04,960
 companies

646
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,760
 are full of adults

647
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,000
 who had all kinds of range of childhoods

648
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,279
 you know most people had okay childhoods

649
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,559
 well i don't know if and lots of people only work for praise

650
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,480
 which is weird you mean like everybody

651
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,480
 i'm not that interested in this but well you you're you're probably looking for somebody's approval

652
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,000
 um

653
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
 even still

654
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,360
 yeah maybe i should think about that

655
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,039
 maybe somebody who's no longer with this kind of thing

656
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:33,919
 i don't know

657
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,960
 i used to call it my dad

658
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,919
 and tell him what i was doing

659
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,640
 he was he was

660
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,120
 very excited

661
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,840
 about engineering

662
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,480
 and stuff

663
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
 you got his approval

664
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,919
 yeah a lot

665
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,279
 i was lucky

666
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,679
 like he he decided i was

667
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,080
 smart and unusual as a kid and that was okay when i was really young

668
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,480
 so when i like did poorly in school i was dyslexic

669
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,120
 i didn't read until i was third or fourth grade and

670
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,360
 they didn't care my parents were like

671
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,679
 oh he'll be fine

672
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:07,440
 so that was funny that was cool is he still with us you miss him

673
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,880
 sure yeah he had parkinson's and then cancer his last 10 years were tough

674
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,559
 and i killed him killing a man like that's hard the mind well it's pretty good

675
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:28,960
 um parkinson's causes slow dementia and the chemotherapy i think accelerated it

676
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,440
 but it was like hallucinogenic dementia so he was clever and funny and interesting and

677
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,760
 was it was pretty unusual

678
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,919
 do you remember conversations

679
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,200
 of course from that time like where do you have fond memories

680
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,840
 of the guy yeah oh yeah anything come to mind

681
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,480
 a friend

682
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,760
 told me one time i could draw

683
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,240
 a computer

684
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,799
 on the whiteboard

685
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,120
 faster

686
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,600
 than anybody

687
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,320
 you'd ever met

688
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,720
 and i said you should meet my dad

689
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
 like when i was a kid he'd come home and say

690
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,279
 i was driving

691
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:57,919
 by this bridge

692
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,399
 and i was thinking

693
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,679
 about it and he pulled out a piece of paper

694
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,159
 and he'd draw

695
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:00,480
 the whole

696
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,360
 bridge

697
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
 he was a mechanical engineer

698
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,440
 yeah

699
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,399
 and he would just draw

700
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:04,880
 the whole thing

701
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,440
 and then he would

702
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,000
 tell me about

703
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,399
 it and

704
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:06,880
 tell me how

705
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,600
 you would have changed

706
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,559
 it

707
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,279
 and he had this you know idea that he could understand and conceive anything

708
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,399
 and i i just grew up with that so that was natural

709
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:16,880
 so if

710
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,360
 you know

711
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,760
 like

712
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,399
 when i interview

713
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,159
 people i ask them to draw a picture of something

714
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,600
 they did on a whiteboard

715
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,360
 and it's really interesting like some people draw a little box

716
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,080
 you know and then they'll say and then this talks to this and

717
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,840
 yeah i'd be like this is frustrating

718
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,480
 and i had this other guy come in one time he says

719
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,799
 well

720
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,279
 i designed

721
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:33,760
 a floating

722
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,399
 point in this chip

723
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:34,880
 but i'd really

724
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,919
 like to tell you how the whole thing

725
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,159
 works

726
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,200
 and then tell you how the floating

727
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,520
 point works inside of it do you mind if i do that he covered

728
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,320
 two whiteboards

729
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,840
 yeah like 30 minutes

730
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,399
 and i hired him like yeah he was great

731
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,000
 this is craftsman i mean that's the craftsmanship to that yeah but also

732
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,200
 the the mental agility to understand the whole thing

733
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,440
 right put the pieces in contacts

734
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,559
 like you know real view of the balance of how the design worked

735
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,279
 because

736
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,240
 if you don't understand

737
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,880
 it properly

738
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,559
 when you start to draw it you'll

739
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,000
 fill up half the white board with like a little piece of it and you know

740
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,559
 like

741
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,880
 your ability to lay it out in an understandable

742
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,480
 way it takes a lot of understanding

743
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,360
 so

744
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,880
 and be able to zoom into the detail and then zoom out to the zoom

745
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,240
 really fast

746
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,279
 what about the impossible thing you see your dad

747
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,799
 believed that you could do anything

748
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,360
 that's a weird feature for a craftsman

749
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,640
 yeah it seems that that

750
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
 echoes in your own behavior

751
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,080
 like that's that's the well it's not that anybody can do anything right now

752
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,960
 right it's

753
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,840
 that if you work

754
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,960
 at it you can get better

755
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,520
 at it

756
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,720
 and there might not be a limit

757
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,399
 and they did funny things like

758
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,600
 like he always wanted to play

759
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,000
 piano

760
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,240
 so at the end of his life he started playing the piano

761
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,679
 when he had parkinson's

762
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,440
 and he was terrible

763
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,720
 but he thought if he really worked

764
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,679
 out in this life maybe

765
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,240
 the next life he'd be better at it

766
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,440
 he might be onto something yeah

767
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,919
 he enjoyed doing it yeah so that's pretty funny

768
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,000
 do you think the perfect is the enemy of the good in hardware and software engineering

769
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,200
 it's like we were talking about javascript a little bit and the messiness of the 10-day

770
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,799
 building process

771
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,960
 yeah it's you know creative tension right

772
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,760
 the creative tension is you have two different ideas that you can't do both

773
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,600
 right right and then but the fact that you want to do both

774
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,000
 causes you to go try to solve that problem that's the creative part

775
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,960
 so if you're building computers

776
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
 like some people say we have the schedule

777
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,080
 and anything that doesn't fit in the schedule we can't do

778
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,159
 right so they throw out the perfect because they have a schedule

779
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,480
 i hate that

780
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,480
 then there's other people who say we need to get this perfectly right

781
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,360
 and no matter what you know more people more money right

782
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,039
 and there's a really clear idea about what you want some people are going to articulate

783
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,559
 in it right

784
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,120
 so let's call that the perfect yeah yeah

785
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,279
 all right but that's also terrible because they never ship anything you never hit any goals

786
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,840
 so now you have that now you have your framework

787
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,559
 yes you can't

788
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:10,880
 throw

789
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,840
 out stuff because you can't get it done today because maybe you get it done tomorrow

790
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,200
 or the next project

791
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,799
 right you can't

792
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,080
 so you have to

793
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,399
 i work with a guy that i really like working with

794
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,600
 but he over filters

795
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,039
 his ideas

796
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,640
 over filters

797
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,480
 he'd start thinking about something

798
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,760
 and as soon as he figure out what's wrong with it you'd throw it out

799
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,240
 and then

800
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,559
 i start thinking about it like you know you come up with an idea

801
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,880
 and then you find out what's wrong with it

802
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,360
 and then you give it a little time to set because sometimes

803
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,840
 you know you figure out how to tweak it or maybe that idea helps some other

804
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,399
 idea

805
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,880
 so idea generation is really funny

806
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,600
 so you have to give your ideas space like spaciousness of mind is key

807
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,200
 but you also have to execute programs and get  done

808
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,919
 and then it turns

809
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:54,240
 out

810
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,640
 computer

811
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,039
 engineering

812
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,559
 is fun because it takes you know 100

813
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,159
 people to build a computer

814
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,360
 200 to 300 whatever the number is and people are so variable about

815
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,600
 you know temperament and you know skill sets and stuff

816
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
 that you know in a big organization

817
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,080
 you find that

818
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,760
 the people who love the perfect ideas

819
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,679
 and the people that want to get stuff done yesterday

820
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,320
 and

821
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,840
 people like to come up with ideas and people like to

822
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,200
 let's say shoot down ideas and it takes the whole

823
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
 it takes a large group of people

824
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,440
 some are good at generating ideas some are good at filtering ideas and then all

825
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,880
 in that giant mess you somehow

826
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,880
 i guess the goal is for that giant mess of people to

827
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,320
 find the perfect path through the attention the creative tension

828
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,880
 but like how do you know when

829
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,799
 you said there's some people good at articulating

830
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,000
 what perfect looks like what a good design is like if you're sitting in a

831
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 in a room

832
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,080
 and you have a set of ideas about like how to design

833
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,559
 a better processor how do you know

834
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,080
 this is this is something

835
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,679
 special here this is a good idea

836
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,640
 let's try this

837
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,840
 so have you ever brainstormed

838
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,399
 idea with a couple people that were really smart

839
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,200
 and you kind of go into it and you you don't quite understand

840
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,599
 it and you're working on it

841
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,918
 and then you start you know talking about it putting it on the whiteboard

842
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,000
 maybe it takes days or weeks

843
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,399
 and then your brain start to kind of synchronize it's really weird

844
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,719
 and like you start to see what each other is thinking

845
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,320
 and yeah and it starts to work

846
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,679
 like you can see work like my talent in computer design is i can

847
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,159
 i can see how computers work in my head

848
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,199
 like really well and i know other people can do that too

849
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,320
 and when you're working with people that can do that

850
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,199
 like it is kind of a an amazing experience

851
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,320
 and then

852
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,199
 and every once in a while

853
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,280
 you get to that place and then you find the flaw

854
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,119
 which is kind of funny because you you can you can fool yourself in

855
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,918
 but the two of you kind of drifted along

856
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,000
 yeah into the direction that was useless

857
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,880
 yeah that happens too like you have to

858
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,720
 because you know

859
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,440
 well the nice thing about computer design there's always reduction in practice

860
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,920
 like you come up with your good ideas

861
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,960
 and i know some architects who really love ideas

862
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,680
 and then they work

863
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,240
 on them and they

864
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,880
 put it on the shelf

865
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,839
 they go work on the next

866
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,079
 idea

867
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:14,720
 and put on the shelf

868
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,119
 they never

869
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:15,599
 reduce

870
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,640
 the practice

871
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,920
 so they find out what's good and bad because most

872
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,320
 every time i've done something really new by the time it's done

873
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,520
 like the good parts are good but i know all the flaws like

874
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,000
 yeah would you say your career

875
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,119
 just your own experience is your career defined by mostly by flaws or by successes

876
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,920
 like if again there's great tension between those

877
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,000
 if you haven't

878
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,520
 tried hard yeah right and done something new

879
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,240
 right

880
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,760
 then you're not going to be facing

881
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,400
 the challenges

882
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,839
 when you build it then you find out all the problems with it

883
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,440
 and but when you look back you see problems

884
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
 okay oh when i look back

885
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
 um what do you think earlier in my career

886
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,200
 yeah like eb5

887
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
 was the second alpha chip

888
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,480
 i was so embarrassed about the mistake so i could barely talk about it

889
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,440
 and it was in the guinness book of worlds records and it was the fastest processor

890
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,320
 on the planet

891
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,599
 yeah

892
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,520
 so it was and at some point i realized that was really a bad

893
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,400
 mental framework

894
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,040
 to deal with like doing something new we did a bunch of new things

895
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,680
 and some worked

896
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
 out great and some were bad

897
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,160
 and we learned a lot from it and then

898
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,640
 the next one we learned a lot that also ev6 also had some

899
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,960
 really cool things in it i think the proportion of good stuff went up but

900
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,760
 it had a couple of fatal flaws in it that were

901
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,520
 painful

902
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,880
 and then

903
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,599
 yeah you learn to channel the pain into like pride not pride really you know just

904
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,400
 realization

905
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,640
 about how the world works okay or how

906
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,480
 that kind of ideas that works life is suffering that's the reality

907
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,960
 what no it's not

908
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
 well i know the buddha said that and a couple other people

909
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
 are stuck on it no

910
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,680
 it's you know there's this kind of weird combination

911
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,599
 of good and bad

912
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,079
 you know light and darkness that you have to tolerate and you know deal with

913
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,480
 yeah there's definitely lots of suffering in the world

914
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,000
 depends on the perspective it seems like there's way more darkness but

915
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,560
 that makes the light part really nice

916
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,040
 what computing

917
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,960
 hardware

918
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,280
 or just any kind of even software design are you

919
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,040
 do you find beautiful from your own work from

920
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,000
 other people's work that you're just

921
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,240
 we were just talking about the

922
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,960
 the battleground of flaws and mistakes and errors but things that were just

923
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:47,839
 beautifully done is there something that pops to mind well when things are beautifully done

924
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,440
 usually

925
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,599
 there's a well thought out set of abstraction layers

926
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,280
 so the whole thing works in unison nicely yes

927
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,359
 and and when i say abstraction layer that means two different components when they work together

928
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,599
 they work independently they don't have to know what the other one is doing

929
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,640
 so that decoupling

930
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,960
 yeah so the famous one was the the network stack like there's a seven layer network

931
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,240
 you know data transport and protocol and all the layers

932
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,839
 and the innovation was is when they really wrote got that right

933
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:26,079
 because networks before that didn't define those very well the layers could innovate independently

934
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,880
 and occasionally the layer boundary would you know the interface would be upgraded

935
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,599
 and that that let you know the the design space breathe and

936
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,079
 you could

937
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:36,640
 do something

938
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,359
 new in layer

939
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:37,680
 seven

940
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,000
 without

941
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,200
 having to worry about how layer

942
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,520
 four

943
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,079
 worked

944
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,359
 right and

945
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,040
 so good design does that and you see it in processor designs

946
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,480
 when we did the zen design at amd

947
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,839
 we made several components very modular

948
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,760
 and you know my insistence

949
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,000
 at the top was i wanted all the interfaces

950
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,119
 to find before we wrote the rtl for the pieces

951
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,240
 one of the verification

952
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,599
 leads said if we do this right i can test the pieces

953
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,320
 so well independently when we put it together

954
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,560
 we won't find all these interaction bugs because the floating point knows how the cache works

955
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,079
 and i was a little skeptical but he was mostly right

956
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,880
 that the modularity design greatly improved the quality

957
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,720
 is that universally true in general would you say about good designs the modularity

958
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,359
 is

959
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,160
 like usually

960
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,880
 talked about this before humans are only so smart like

961
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
 and we're not getting any smarter

962
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,680
 right but the complexity of things is going up yeah so

963
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,920
 you know a beautiful design can't be bigger than the person doing it

964
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,560
 it's just

965
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,920
 you know their piece of it

966
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,400
 like

967
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,000
 the odds of you doing a really beautiful

968
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,200
 design of something that's way too hard for you is slow

969
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,480
 right

970
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,960
 if it's way too simple for you it's not that interesting

971
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,800
 it's like well anybody could do that but when you get the right match of

972
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,680
 your

973
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,560
 your expertise and you know mental power

974
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
 to the right design size

975
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,119
 that's cool but that's not big enough to make a meaningful

976
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,160
 impact in the world

977
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,920
 so now you have to have

978
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,800
 some framework to design the pieces

979
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,839
 so that the whole thing is big and harmonious but

980
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,119
 you know when you put it together it's you know sufficiently

981
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:15,920
 sufficiently

982
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,720
 interesting to to be used

983
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,040
 and you know so that's like a beautiful design is

984
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,920
 matching the limits of that human cognitive capacity

985
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,040
 to to the module you can create and creating a nice interface between those modules

986
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
 and thereby do you think there's a limit to the kind of

987
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,920
 beautiful complex systems we can build with this kind of modular

988
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,200
 design it's like

989
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,440
 you know if we build increasingly more complicated you can think of like the internet

990
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,720
 okay let's scale it up you can think of like social network like twitter as one

991
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,280
 computing system

992
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,640
 and but those are little modules yeah right

993
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,920
 but it's built on it's built on so many components nobody at twitter even understands

994
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,800
 right so

995
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,119
 so so if an alien showed up and looked at twitter

996
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,119
 he wouldn't just see twitter as a beautiful

997
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,400
 simple thing that everybody

998
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,960
 uses

999
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
 which is really big

1000
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
 you would see

1001
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,400
 the network

1002
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,040
 it runs on the fiber optics the data is transported

1003
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,920
 the computers the whole thing is so bloody complicated

1004
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,200
 nobody twitter understands it and so i think that's what the alienware

1005
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,640
 sees so yeah if an alien showed up and looked at twitter

1006
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,720
 or looked at the various different

1007
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,520
 networked systems that you can see on earth

1008
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,560
 so imagine they were really smart they could comprehend the whole thing

1009
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,400
 and then they sort of

1010
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,520
 you know evaluated

1011
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,359
 the human and thought this is really interesting no human on this planet comprehends

1012
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,440
 the system they built

1013
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,079
 no individual

1014
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,680
 or well would they even see individual

1015
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,720
 humans that's the interest

1016
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,520
 like we humans

1017
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,040
 are very human-centric

1018
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,640
 entity-centric

1019
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,319
 and so we think

1020
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,680
 of us as the organ as the central organism and the networks

1021
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
 as just the connection of organisms

1022
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,920
 but from a perspective of

1023
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,160
 an alien from an outside perspective it seems like yeah

1024
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,880
 yeah i get it where the ants and they'd see the ant colony

1025
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,319
 the ant colony yeah

1026
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,280
 or the result the production of the ant colony which is like cities and

1027
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,680
 it's it's

1028
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,920
 yeah in that sense humans are pretty impressive the modularity that we're able to

1029
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,040
 and the

1030
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,839
 and how robust we are to noise and mutation

1031
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,200
 all that kind of stuff well that's because it's stress tested all the time yeah

1032
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,200
 you know you build all these cities with buildings and you get earthquakes occasionally and

1033
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,440
 you know some you know wars earthquakes

1034
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
 viruses every once in a while

1035
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,240
 you know changes in business plans for you know like shipping or something like

1036
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,960
 like

1037
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,599
 as long as it's all stress tested then

1038
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,839
 it keeps adapting to the the situation so the

1039
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,480
 that's that's a curious phenomena

1040
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,720
 well let's go let's talk about moore's law a little bit

1041
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,200
 at the broad view of moore's law was just exponential improvement of

1042
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:10,720
 computing capability like openai for example recently published this kind of

1043
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,880
 papers looking at the exponential improvement in the training efficiency of neural networks

1044
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,920
 for like image net and all that kind of stuff we just got better on

1045
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,240
 this is purely software aside

1046
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,040
 just figuring out better tricks and algorithms for training neural networks

1047
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,440
 and that seems to be improving

1048
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,240
 significantly faster than the moore's law prediction

1049
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,119
 you know

1050
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,520
 so that's in the software space like what do you think

1051
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,960
 if moore's law continues or if the general

1052
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,800
 version of moore's law continues

1053
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,400
 do you think that comes mostly

1054
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,520
 from the hardware from the software some mix of the two

1055
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,920
 some interesting totally

1056
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,720
 so not the reduction of the size of the transistor

1057
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,920
 kind of thing but more in the

1058
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,119
 in the totally interesting kinds of innovations in the hardware space all that kind of stuff

1059
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,000
 well

1060
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,440
 there's like a half a dozen things going on in that graph

1061
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,720
 so one is

1062
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,599
 there's initial innovations that had a lot of had room to be exploited

1063
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,839
 so you know the efficiency of the networks has improved dramatically

1064
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:16,960
 and then

1065
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,079
 the decomposability

1066
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,280
 of those and the use go you know they started running on one computer

1067
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,319
 then multiple computers

1068
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,520
 and multiple gpus

1069
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,960
 and then arrays of gpus

1070
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,599
 and

1071
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,960
 they're up to thousands

1072
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,800
 and at some point

1073
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,359
 so

1074
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,440
 so it's sort of like they were consumed

1075
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,680
 they were going from like a single computer application

1076
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,560
 to a thousand

1077
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,160
 computer application

1078
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,040
 so that's not really a moore's law thing that's an independent

1079
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,160
 vector how many computers can i put on this problem

1080
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,839
 because the computers themselves are getting better on like a moore's law rate

1081
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,359
 but their ability to go from one to ten to a hundred to a thousand

1082
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,319
 yeah you know was something and then multiplied

1083
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:52,800
 by

1084
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,160
 you know the amount of computes

1085
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,760
 it took to resolve like alex

1086
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,720
 net to resnet

1087
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,680
 the transformers

1088
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,760
 it's it's been quite

1089
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,520
 you know steady improvements

1090
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,720
 but those are like s cars

1091
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,920
 aren't they yeah that's the exactly

1092
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,400
 kind of

1093
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:04,800
 s-curves

1094
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,520
 that are underlying

1095
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
 moore's law from the very beginning

1096
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,520
 so so what what's the biggest what's the most

1097
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,359
 productive

1098
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,960
 rich source of s-curves

1099
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,640
 in in the future do you think

1100
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,520
 is it hardware

1101
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,319
 is it software

1102
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,440
 or is it so hardware

1103
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,520
 is going to move along

1104
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,440
 relatively slowly

1105
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,160
 like you know double performance every two years there are there's still

1106
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,200
 i like how you call that slow yeah that's the slow version

1107
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,440
 the snail's pace of moore's law maybe we should we should

1108
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,960
 we should trademark that one

1109
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,359
 whereas the scaling by number of computers

1110
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,280
 you know can go much faster

1111
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,920
 you know i'm sure at some point google had a

1112
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,680
 you know their initial search engine was running on a laptop you know like

1113
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,000
 yeah and at some point they really worked on scaling that and then they factored

1114
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,119
 the indexer

1115
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:55,440
 from

1116
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,160
 you know this piece and this piece and this piece and they spread the data

1117
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,800
 on more

1118
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,839
 things and

1119
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,640
 you know they did a dozen innovations

1120
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,319
 but as they scaled up the number of computers on that it kept breaking

1121
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,599
 finding new bottlenecks in their software and their schedulers and and made them rethink

1122
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,839
 like it seems insane to do a scheduler

1123
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,440
 across a thousand computers

1124
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,800
 to schedule parts of it and then send the results to one computer

1125
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,200
 but if you want to schedule a million searches

1126
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,119
 that makes perfect sense

1127
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:30,079
 so so there's the the scaling by just quantity is probably the richest thing but then

1128
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,920
 as you scale quantity

1129
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,560
 like a network that was great on 100 computers

1130
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,440
 may be completely the wrong one you may pick a network that's 10 times slower

1131
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,319
 on 10 000 computers like per computer

1132
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,599
 but if you go from a hundred to ten thousand that's a hundred times

1133
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,520
 so that's one of the things that happened when we did internet scaling is the efficiency

1134
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,760
 went down

1135
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,400
 not up the future of computing is inefficiency

1136
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,359
 not efficiency

1137
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,319
 but scales

1138
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,480
 in efficient scale it's it's scaling faster than inefficiency

1139
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,680
 bites you

1140
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,599
 and as long as there's you know dollar value there like scaling costs lots of money

1141
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,720
 yeah but google showed

1142
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,760
 facebook showed everybody

1143
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,480
 showed that

1144
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,640
 the scale was where the money was at

1145
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,800
 it was and so it was

1146
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,040
 worth it financially do you think

1147
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,680
 is it possible that like basically the entirety of earth will be like a computing surface

1148
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,240
 like this table will be doing computing

1149
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,119
 this hedgehog will be doing computing like everything

1150
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,680
 really inefficient dumb computing would be fiction books they call it computronium

1151
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,480
 computing we turn everything into computing

1152
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,839
 well most of the elements aren't very good for anything

1153
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:41,920
 like you're not going to make a computer out of iron like you know silicon and

1154
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,880
 carbon have like nice structures

1155
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,480
 you know we'll we'll see what what you can do with the rest of it

1156
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,200
 people talk about well maybe we can turn the sun into computer but it's it's hydrogen

1157
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,920
 and a little bit of helium so

1158
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,760
 what i mean is more like actually just adding computers to everything

1159
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,160
 oh okay so you're just converting all the mass of the universe into a computer

1160
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,400
 no no so not using to be ironic from the simulation point of view is like

1161
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
 the simulator build mass to simulate

1162
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,920
 like

1163
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,200
 yeah i mean yeah so

1164
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,000
 i mean ultimately

1165
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,559
 this is all heading towards the simulation yeah well

1166
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,079
 i i think i might have told you the story a tesla they were deciding

1167
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,240
 so they want to measure the current coming out of the battery

1168
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,319
 and they decide between putting the resistor

1169
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,760
 in there

1170
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,520
 and putting a computer

1171
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,359
 with a sensor in there

1172
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,000
 and the computer was faster than the computer i worked on in 1982.

1173
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,559
 and we chose the computer because it was cheaper than the resistor

1174
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,160
 so so sure this hedgehog you know it costs 13

1175
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,599
 and we can put a you know

1176
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,839
 an ai that's the smartest you in there for five bucks it'll have

1177
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,079
 one

1178
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,599
 you know so computers will be you know he'd be everywhere

1179
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,400
 i was hoping it wouldn't be smarter than me because

1180
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,480
 well everything's going to be smarter than you

1181
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,920
 but you were saying it's inefficient

1182
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,160
 i thought it was better to have a lot of doubt well

1183
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,079
 well moore's law will slowly compact

1184
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:02,640
 that stuff

1185
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,160
 so even the dump things will be smarter

1186
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,720
 than us

1187
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,800
 the dump things are going to be smart or they're going to be smart

1188
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,920
 enough to talk to something

1189
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,400
 that's really

1190
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,000
 smart

1191
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,400
 you know it's like

1192
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,520
 well just remember

1193
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,640
 like a big computer

1194
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,119
 chip

1195
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:15,599
 yeah

1196
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,520
 you know it's like an inch by an inch

1197
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,640
 and you know

1198
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,800
 40 microns thick

1199
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,960
 it doesn't take very much very many atoms to make a high power computer

1200
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,880
 yeah and 10 000 of them can fit in the shoe box

1201
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,480
 but you know you have the the cooling

1202
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,359
 and power problems

1203
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,000
 but you know

1204
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,440
 people are working on that

1205
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,680
 but they still can't write

1206
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,880
 compelling poetry or music or

1207
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,680
 understand what love is or have a fear of mortality

1208
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,000
 so so we're still winning neither can most of humanity so

1209
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,480
 well they can write books about it so [laughter]

1210
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,040
 but but speaking about this

1211
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,000
 you know this walk along the path of innovation towards

1212
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,760
 the dumb things being smarter than humans you are now the cto

1213
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:13,680
 of tens torrent as of two months ago they build hardware for deep learning

1214
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,880
 how do you build scalable

1215
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,119
 and efficient deep learning this is such a fascinating

1216
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,720
 space yeah yeah so it's interesting

1217
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,839
 so um

1218
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,000
 up until recently i thought there was two kinds of computers there are serial computers

1219
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,040
 that run like c programs and then there's parallel computers

1220
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,839
 so the way i think about it is you know parallel computers you have given parallelism

1221
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,640
 like gpus are great because you have a million pixels

1222
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,319
 and modern gpus run a program on every pixel they call the shader program right so

1223
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:40,720
 or

1224
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,520
 like finite

1225
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,319
 element analysis

1226
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:42,720
 you

1227
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,599
 you build something

1228
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,119
 you know you make this into little tiny

1229
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,440
 chunks

1230
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,960
 you give each chunk to a computer

1231
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,000
 so you're giving all these chunks a parallel something like that

1232
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,440
 but most c programs you write this linear narrative

1233
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,359
 and you have to make it go fast

1234
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,599
 to make it go fast you predict all the branches

1235
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,160
 all the data fetches and you run that more in parallel

1236
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,680
 but that's found parallelism

1237
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,680
 ai is

1238
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,720
 i'm still trying to decide how fundamental this is it's a given parallelism problem

1239
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,640
 but the way people describe the neural networks

1240
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,760
 and then how they write them in pi torch it makes graphs

1241
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,040
 yeah that might be fundamentally different than the gpu

1242
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,400
 kind of parallelism yeah it might be because the

1243
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,400
 when you run the gpu program on all the pixels you're running

1244
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,800
 like you know depends you know this group of pixels

1245
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,640
 say it's background blue and that runs a really simple program this pixel

1246
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,200
 is

1247
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,920
 you know some patch of your face so you have some

1248
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,520
 really interesting shader program to give you impression of translucency

1249
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,920
 but the pixels themselves don't talk to each other there's no graph

1250
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,480
 right

1251
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,079
 so you you do the image

1252
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,200
 and then you do the next image and you do the next image

1253
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,559
 and you run

1254
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,680
 8 million pixels 8 million programs every time and modern gpus have like 6 000

1255
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,520
 thread engines in them

1256
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,559
 so you know

1257
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,720
 to get 8 million pixels each one runs a program on you know 10 or 20

1258
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,000
 pixels

1259
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,280
 and that's how that's how they work but there's no graph

1260
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,480
 but you think graph might be a totally

1261
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,359
 new

1262
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:18,000
 way to think about hardware so raja gadori and i've been having this good conversation

1263
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,480
 about giving versus found parallelism

1264
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,440
 and then

1265
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,760
 the kind of walk cause we got more transistors

1266
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,599
 like you know computers way back when did stuff on scalar data

1267
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,559
 then we did it on vector data famous vector machines

1268
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,160
 now we're making computers that operate on matrices

1269
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,720
 right and then the the category we we said that was next was spatial

1270
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,280
 like imagine you have so much data that

1271
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,800
 you know you want to do the compute on this data and then when it's done

1272
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,839
 it says

1273
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,119
 send the result to this pile of data run some software on that

1274
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,359
 and it's better to

1275
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,680
 to think about it spatially than

1276
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,440
 to move all the data to a central processor and do all the work

1277
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,720
 so especially

1278
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,319
 i mean moving in the space of data as opposed to moving the data

1279
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:05,200
 yeah you have a you have a petabyte data space

1280
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,480
 spread across some huge array of computers

1281
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,079
 and when you do a computation

1282
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,160
 somewhere you send the result of that computation

1283
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,480
 or maybe a pointer to the next program some other piece of data and do it

1284
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,720
 but i think a better word might be graph

1285
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,520
 and all the ai neural networks are graphs

1286
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,559
 do some computations

1287
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,040
 send the result here do another computation

1288
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,240
 do a data transformation

1289
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,240
 do a merging do a pooling

1290
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,240
 do another computation

1291
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,760
 is it possible to compress and say how we make this thing

1292
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,400
 efficient

1293
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,119
 this whole process efficient that's different

1294
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,119
 so first

1295
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,160
 the fundamental elements in the graphs are things like matrix multiplies convolutions data manipulations

1296
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,000
 and data movements

1297
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,119
 so gpus

1298
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,960
 emulate those things with their little singles you know basically running a single threaded program

1299
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,599
 and then

1300
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,800
 there's a you know nvidia calls it a work where they group a bunch of programs

1301
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,240
 that are similar together

1302
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,440
 so for efficiency and instruction use

1303
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,839
 and then at a higher level you kind of

1304
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,040
 you take this graph and you say this part of the graph is a matrix multiplier

1305
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,559
 which runs on these 32

1306
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:09,680
 threads

1307
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,079
 but the model at the bottom was built for

1308
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,880
 running programs on pixels not executing graphs so it's emulation

1309
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,960
 yes so is it possible to build something that natively runs graphs

1310
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,160
 yes so that's what ten storm did

1311
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,880
 so

1312
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,240
 where are we on that

1313
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,720
 how like in the history of that effort

1314
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,240
 are we in the early days yeah i think so tense torrance

1315
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,440
 started by a friend of mine labisha bajak and i

1316
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,960
 i was his first investor so i've been you know kind of

1317
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,640
 following him and talking to him about it for years and

1318
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,760
 in the fall when i was considering things to do

1319
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,440
 i decided you know the

1320
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,480
 we we

1321
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,920
 held a conference last year with a friend organized it and

1322
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,040
 and we we wanted to bring in thinkers and two of the people were andre carpassi

1323
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,359
 and chris lattner and

1324
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:05,040
 andre gave this talk on youtube called software 2.0

1325
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,720
 which i think is great

1326
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:13,680
 which is we went from programmed computers where you write programs to data program computers

1327
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,200
 you know like the futures you know of software as data programs the the networks

1328
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,280
 and i think that's true

1329
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,880
 and then

1330
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,119
 chris has been work he worked on llvm

1331
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,960
 the low-level virtual machine which became the intermediate representation

1332
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,200
 for all compilers

1333
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:38,079
 and now he's working on another project called mlir which is mid-level intermediate representation which is

1334
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,839
 essentially under the graph

1335
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,720
 about how do you represent that kind of computation

1336
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,839
 and then coordinate large numbers of potentially heterogeneous

1337
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,680
 computers

1338
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,359
 and and i would say technically tense torrents

1339
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:58,160
 you know two pillars are those those those two ideas software 2.0 and mid-level representation

1340
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,680
 but it's in service of executing graph programs

1341
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,240
 the hardware is designed to do that so it's including the hardware piece yeah

1342
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,319
 and then the other cool thing is

1343
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:13,200
 for a relatively small amount of money they did a test chip and two production chips

1344
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,480
 so it's like a super effective teams and

1345
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,079
 and unlike some ai startups where if you don't build the hardware

1346
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,720
 to run the software that they really want to do

1347
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,920
 then you have to fix it by writing lots more software

1348
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,760
 so the hardware naturally does matrix multiply convolution the data manipulations

1349
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:38,640
 and the data movement between processing elements that that you can see in the graph

1350
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,559
 which i think is all pretty clever and

1351
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,000
 that's that's what i'm i'm working on now so

1352
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,760
 the i think it's called the grace call processor

1353
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,000
 introduced last year it's

1354
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,599
 you know there's a bunch of measures of performance we're talking about horses

1355
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,400
 it seems to outperform

1356
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,400
 368

1357
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,119
 trillion operations per second seems to outperform nvidia's tesla t4 system

1358
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,640
 so these are just numbers

1359
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,119
 what do they actually mean in real world perform like what are the

1360
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,680
 metrics

1361
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,040
 for you that you're chasing

1362
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,680
 in in your horse race like what do you care about

1363
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,520
 well first so the the native language of

1364
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,240
 you know people who write ai network programs

1365
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,400
 is pie torch now by torch tensorflow

1366
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,920
 there's a couple others

1367
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,000
 the pi torch is one over tensor flows it's just i'm not an expert on that

1368
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,280
 i i know many people have switched from tensorflow to pi torch

1369
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,839
 yeah and there's technical reasons for it and

1370
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,040
 i use both both are still awesome both are still awesome

1371
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,160
 but the deepest

1372
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,359
 love is for pytorch

1373
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:39,839
 currently

1374
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,240
 yeah

1375
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,480
 there's more love for that and that that may change

1376
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,240
 so the first thing is

1377
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,559
 when they write their programs

1378
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,319
 can the hardware execute it pretty much as it was written

1379
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:53,119
 right so pi torch turns into a graph

1380
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,240
 we have a graph compiler

1381
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,440
 that makes that graph

1382
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:55,920
 then

1383
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,640
 it fractions

1384
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,240
 the graph down so if you have a big matrix

1385
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:58,720
 multiply

1386
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,760
 we turn it into right-sized

1387
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,040
 chunks that run on the processing

1388
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,000
 elements

1389
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,960
 it hooks all the graph up it lays out all the data

1390
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,359
 there's a couple mid-level representations of it that are also simulatable

1391
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,400
 so that

1392
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,880
 if you're writing the code you can see how it's going to go through the machine

1393
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,720
 which is pretty cool and then at the bottom it schedules kernels like

1394
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:24,000
 math data manipulation data movement kernels which do this stuff so

1395
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,720
 we don't have to run write a little program to do matrix

1396
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,200
 multiply

1397
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,880
 because we have a big matrix multiplier

1398
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,160
 like there's no cmd program for that

1399
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,119
 but there is scheduling for that

1400
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,880
 right so the the one of the goals is if you write

1401
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,839
 a piece of pytorch

1402
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,040
 code that looks pretty reasonable

1403
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,839
 you should be able to compile

1404
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,280
 it run it on the hardware

1405
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,920
 without having to tweak it and and do all kinds of crazy things to get performance

1406
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,280
 there's not a lot of intermediate

1407
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:49,760
 steps

1408
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,079
 right it's running directly as right like on a gpu

1409
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,200
 if you write a large matrix

1410
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,839
 multiply

1411
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:54,480
 naively

1412
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,559
 you'll get five to ten percent of the peak performance of the gpu

1413
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,200
 right and then there's a bunch there's a bunch of people publish papers

1414
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,640
 on this and i read them about

1415
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,359
 what steps do you have to do and it goes from

1416
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,640
 pretty reasonable

1417
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,720
 well transpose one of the matrices so you wrote or not column ordered

1418
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,599
 you know

1419
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,520
 block it so that you can put a block of the matrix on different

1420
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,200
 sms you know groups of threads

1421
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,040
 but some of it gets into little details

1422
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,760
 like you have to schedule it just so so you don't have registered

1423
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,880
 conflicts

1424
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,920
 so the the the they call them cuda ninjas

1425
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:34,280
 i love it to get to the optimal point you either write a pre use a

1426
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,359
 pre-written

1427
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:35,920
 library

1428
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,040
 which is a good strategy

1429
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,520
 for some things or you have to be an expert

1430
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,799
 in micro architecture

1431
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,079
 to program it

1432
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,119
 right so the optimization

1433
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,720
 step is way more complicated with the gpa so our our goal is

1434
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,040
 if you write pi torch that's good pi torch you can do it now there's

1435
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:56,319
 as the networks are evolving you know they've changed from convolutional to matrix multiply

1436
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:01,520
 people are talking about conditional graphs you're talking about very large matrices they're talking about sparsity

1437
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:08,880
 you're talking about problems that scale across many many chips so the the native

1438
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,359
 you know data item is a as a packet

1439
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,400
 like so you send a packet to a processor it gets processed

1440
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,520
 it does a bunch of work and then it may send packets to other processors

1441
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,000
 and and they execute like a data flow graph kind of methodology

1442
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,440
 got it we have a big network on chip and then 16

1443
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,359
 the next second chip has 16 ethernet ports they hook lots of them together

1444
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,240
 and it's the same graph compiler across multiple chips

1445
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,119
 so that's where the scale comes in so it's built to scale naturally

1446
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:35,920
 now

1447
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,640
 my experience with scaling is as you scale you run into lots of interesting problems

1448
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,119
 so scaling is the mountain to climb

1449
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,839
 yeah so the hardware is built to do this and then

1450
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,520
 we're in the process of

1451
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,520
 is there a software part to this with ethernet and all that

1452
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,880
 well the

1453
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,480
 you know the protocol at the bottom you know we send you know it's an ethernet

1454
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,520
 phi

1455
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,680
 but the protocol basically says

1456
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,960
 send a packet from here to there it's all point to point

1457
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,520
 the header bit says which processor to send it to and we basically

1458
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,440
 take a packet off our on-chip network

1459
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,880
 put an ethernet header on it send it to the other end

1460
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,000
 to strip the header off and send it to the local thing it's pretty straightforward

1461
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,920
 human human interaction is pretty straightforward

1462
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,440
 too but when you get a million of us we could do some crazy stuff together

1463
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,280
 it could be fun

1464
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,760
 so is that the goal is scale

1465
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,319
 so like for example i've been recently

1466
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:32,240
 doing a bunch of robots at home for my own personal pleasure

1467
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,680
 am i going to ever use 10 story or is this more for

1468
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,119
 there's all kinds of problems

1469
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,359
 like they're small inference problems or small training problems there's big training problems

1470
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,319
 what's the big goal is it the big difference

1471
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,480
 training problems or the small training problems

1472
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,280
 well one of the goals is to scale from 100 milliwatts to a to a megawatt

1473
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,400
 you know so

1474
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,799
 like really have some range on the problems

1475
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:55,359
 and

1476
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,200
 the same kind of ai programs work at all different levels

1477
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,480
 so that's cool

1478
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,240
 the natural since the natural

1479
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,200
 data item is a packet that we can move around

1480
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,520
 it's built to scale

1481
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,440
 but so many people have you know small problems

1482
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,039
 right right but but

1483
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,200
 you know like inside that phone is a small problem to solve so

1484
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,640
 do you see that storm potentially being inside a phone well

1485
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,680
 the power efficiency of local memory local computation

1486
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,240
 and the way we built it is pretty good

1487
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,359
 and then there's a lot of efficiency on being able to do conditional graphs and sparsity

1488
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:32,880
 i think it

1489
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,680
 for complicated networks i want to go in a small factor it's been quite good

1490
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,920
 um but we have to prove that that's a

1491
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,559
 that's a fun problem and that's the early days of the company right it's a couple

1492
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,640
 years you said

1493
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,839
 but you think you invested you think they're legit yeah as you join yeah well that's

1494
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:53,119
 well it's also it's a really interesting place to be

1495
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,960
 like the ai world is exploding you know and

1496
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,119
 i looked at some other opportunities like build a faster processor which people want

1497
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,799
 yes but that's more on incremental path than

1498
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,839
 what's going to happen in ai in the next 10 years

1499
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,680
 so this is kind of

1500
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,240
 you know an exciting place to be part of

1501
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,200
 the revolutions

1502
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,119
 will be happening in the very space

1503
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,599
 and then lots of people are working on it but there's lots of technical

1504
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,000
 reasons

1505
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,440
 why some of them you know aren't going to work out that well and

1506
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,359
 and you know that's that's interesting and there's also the same

1507
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:30,000
 problem about getting the basics right like we've talked to customers about exciting features

1508
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,760
 and at some point we realized that each unit was realizing

1509
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:39,039
 they want to hear first about memory bandwidth local bandwidth compute intensity programmability

1510
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,839
 they want to know the basics power management

1511
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:45,920
 how the network ports work what are the basics do all the basics work

1512
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,960
 because it's easy to say we got this great idea that you know the crack gbt3

1513
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,839
 but

1514
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,000
 the the people we talked to want to say

1515
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,359
 if i buy that so we have a pc express card

1516
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,520
 with our chip on it if you buy the card

1517
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,760
 you plug it in your machine you download the driver

1518
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,960
 how long does it take me to get my network to run

1519
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,240
 right right you know that's a real question it's a very basic question

1520
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:08,880
 so

1521
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,200
 yeah

1522
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,160
 is there an answer to that yet or is it trying to our goal is like

1523
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,280
 an hour

1524
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,720
 okay when can i buy a tesla

1525
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,039
 pretty soon for my for the small case training yeah pretty soon

1526
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:26,000
 months good i love the idea of you inside the room with the

1527
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,079
 carpathi andre kapathi and chris ladner

1528
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:32,480
 very

1529
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,599
 um

1530
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:34,559
 very interesting

1531
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,440
 very brilliant

1532
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,839
 people very out of the box thinkers but also like first principles thinkers

1533
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,039
 well they both

1534
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,480
 get stuff done

1535
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,480
 they only get stuff done to get their own projects

1536
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,200
 done they

1537
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:45,680
 they

1538
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,880
 talk about it clearly

1539
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,599
 they educate

1540
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,359
 large numbers of people and they've created

1541
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:49,839
 platforms

1542
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,000
 for other people to go do their stuff on

1543
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,359
 yeah the the clear

1544
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:53,920
 thinking

1545
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,440
 that's able to be communicated

1546
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,039
 is kind of impressive

1547
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,359
 it's kind of remarkable to

1548
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,640
 yeah i'm a fan

1549
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:06,160
 well let me ask because i talked to chris actually a lot these days he's been

1550
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:12,240
 one of the cool just to give him a shout out and he's been so

1551
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,200
 supportive as a human being so everybody's

1552
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:20,640
 quite different like great engineers are different but he's been like sensitive to the human element

1553
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,720
 in a way that's been fascinating like he was one of the early people on this

1554
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,920
 stupid podcast that i do to say like

1555
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,039
 don't quit this thing and also

1556
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,079
 talk to whoever the hell you want to talk to

1557
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,240
 that kind of from a legit engineer

1558
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,359
 to get like

1559
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:39,839
 props and be like you can do this

1560
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,440
 that was i mean that's what a good leader does right they just kind of

1561
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,319
 let a little kid

1562
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,039
 do his thing

1563
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:45,599
 like go

1564
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,640
 go do it let's see

1565
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,200
 let's see

1566
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:47,920
 see what turns

1567
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,640
 out

1568
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,920
 that that's a that's a pretty powerful thing but what do you

1569
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,119
 um

1570
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,440
 what's your sense about he used to be

1571
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,200
 he no i think stepped away from google

1572
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,720
 right

1573
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,839
 he said sci-fi i think

1574
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:02,319
 what

1575
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:03,440
 what's really impressive

1576
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,240
 to you about

1577
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,720
 the things that chris has worked on because it's that we mentioned

1578
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,240
 the optimization

1579
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,839
 the compiled design stuff the llvm

1580
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:16,400
 then there's he's also a google work that the tpu stuff

1581
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,200
 he's obviously worked on swift

1582
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,280
 so the programming language side

1583
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,280
 talking about people that work in the entirety of the stack yeah

1584
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:25,920
 what

1585
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,760
 from your time interacting with chris

1586
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,960
 and knowing the guy

1587
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,640
 what's really impressive to you it just inspires you well

1588
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,000
 well

1589
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,039
 like llvm became

1590
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:43,680
 you know the platform the de facto platform for you know compilers like it's it's amazing

1591
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,760
 and you know it was good code quality good design

1592
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,240
 choices

1593
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,640
 he hit the right level of abstraction

1594
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,920
 there's a little bit of the right time in the right place

1595
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,359
 and then he built a new programming language called swift

1596
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:01,039
 which you know after you know let's say some adoption resistance became very successful

1597
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,799
 i don't know that much about his work at google although i know that

1598
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:07,039
 you know that was the typical

1599
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,079
 they started

1600
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:08,720
 tensorflow

1601
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,440
 stuff and they you know it was new is you know

1602
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,720
 they wrote a lot of code

1603
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,280
 and then at some point it needed to be refactored

1604
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,799
 to be

1605
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,520
 you know because it its development slowed down why

1606
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,079
 pytorch

1607
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,240
 started a little later and then passed it

1608
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,920
 so he did a lot of work on that and then his idea about mlir

1609
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,880
 which is

1610
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,960
 what people started to realize is the complexity

1611
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,480
 of the software stack above

1612
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,440
 the low level

1613
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,559
 ir

1614
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,160
 was getting so high that forcing

1615
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:34,799
 the features

1616
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,160
 of that into a level

1617
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,400
 was was putting too much of a burden on it so he's splitting that into multiple

1618
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,440
 pieces

1619
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,720
 and that was one of the inspirations for our software stack where we have

1620
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,559
 several intermediate representations

1621
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,640
 that are all executable

1622
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,839
 and you can look at them and do transformations on them before you lower the level

1623
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:58,160
 so that was i think we started before moir

1624
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,520
 really got you know far enough along to use

1625
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,640
 but we're interested in that he's really excited about that malaya

1626
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,799
 he's that's that's his like little baby so he you know and

1627
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,079
 there seems to be some profound

1628
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:14,880
 ideas on that that are really useful so so each one of those things has been

1629
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,679
 as the world of software gets more and more complicated

1630
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,600
 how do we create the right abstraction

1631
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,279
 levels to simplify it in a way that people can now work independently

1632
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,960
 on different levels of it

1633
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,479
 so i would say all all three of those projects allovm

1634
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,158
 swift and mlir

1635
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:31,439
 did that successfully

1636
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,158
 so i'm interested

1637
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:32,479
 what's

1638
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,520
 what he's going to do next

1639
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,719
 in the same kind of way

1640
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:35,520
 yes

1641
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:41,839
 so on either the tpu or maybe the nvidia gpu side

1642
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:46,960
 how does 10 story you think or the ideas underlying it doesn't have to be testosterone

1643
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,520
 just this kind of graph focused

1644
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,719
 graph centric hardware

1645
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,120
 deep learning-centric hardware beat nvidia's

1646
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,439
 do you think it's possible for it to basically overtake nvidia sure

1647
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,399
 what's what's that process look like what's that

1648
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:08,719
 a journey look like you think well

1649
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,319
 gpus were built around shader programs on millions of pixels

1650
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,759
 not to run graphs

1651
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,920
 yes so there's a hypothesis

1652
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,198
 that says

1653
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,238
 the way the graphs you know are built

1654
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,799
 is going to be really interesting to be inefficient

1655
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,920
 on computing this and then the the primitives

1656
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,000
 is not a cmd program it's matrix multiply convolution

1657
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,439
 and then the data manipulations

1658
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,600
 are fairly extensive about

1659
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,198
 like how do you do a fast transpose

1660
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,238
 with a program

1661
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,640
 i don't know if you've ever written the transpose program

1662
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,920
 they're ugly and slow but in hardware you can do really well

1663
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,319
 like i'll give you an example so

1664
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,679
 when gpu accelerators first started doing triangles

1665
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,040
 like so you have a triangle which maps on the set of pixels

1666
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,120
 so you build it's very easy straightforward

1667
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,679
 to build a hardware engine that will find all those pixels

1668
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,120
 and it's kind of weird because you walk along the triangle to get to the edge

1669
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,800
 and then you have to go back down to the next

1670
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,120
 row

1671
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:01,920
 and walk along

1672
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:02,880
 and then you have to decide

1673
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,000
 on the edge

1674
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,920
 if the line of the triangle is like half on the pixel

1675
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,239
 what's

1676
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:08,719
 the pixel

1677
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:09,040
 color

1678
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,159
 because it's half of this pixel

1679
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,960
 and half the next one that's called rasterization

1680
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,280
 because you're saying that could be done in

1681
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,080
 in hardware now that's an example of

1682
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,280
 that operation

1683
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,320
 as a software program is really bad i've written a program that did rasterization

1684
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,360
 the hardware that does it has actually less code than

1685
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,520
 the software program that does it and it's way faster

1686
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:37,679
 right so there are certain times when the abstraction you have rasterize a triangle

1687
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,120
 you know execute a graph you know components of a graph

1688
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,120
 the right thing to do in the hardware software boundary is for the hardware to naturally

1689
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,880
 do it and so the gpu

1690
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,840
 is really optimized

1691
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,960
 for the rasterization

1692
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,000
 of triangles

1693
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,560
 well no that's just well like in a modern you know

1694
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,880
 that's a small piece of modern gpus

1695
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,080
 what they did is

1696
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,280
 that they still rasterize

1697
01:10:59,280 --> 01:10:59,840
 triangles

1698
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,400
 when you're running the game but for the most part

1699
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,760
 most of the computation in the area the gpu is running shader programs

1700
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,760
 but they're single threaded programs

1701
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,440
 on pixels not graphs

1702
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,159
 let's be honest to say i don't actually know the the math behind shader

1703
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:17,600
 shading and lighting and all that kind of stuff i don't know what

1704
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,880
 they look like little simple floating point programs or complicated

1705
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,600
 ones you can have 8 000 instructions in a shader program

1706
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,960
 but i i don't have a good intuition why it could be parallelized

1707
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,840
 so easily

1708
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,480
 no it's because you have 8 million pixels in every single

1709
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,840
 so when you have a light

1710
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,560
 right yeah that comes down

1711
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,800
 the angle you know the amount of light

1712
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,400
 like like say this is a line of pixels across this table

1713
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,600
 right the amount of light on each pixel is subtly different

1714
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,040
 and each pixel is responsible

1715
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:45,520
 for figuring

1716
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,280
 out what figure it out so that pixel

1717
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:47,600
 says

1718
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,480
 on this pixel

1719
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,280
 i know the angle

1720
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:49,840
 of the light

1721
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,719
 i know the occlusion

1722
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,239
 i know the color i am

1723
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:52,960
 like every single

1724
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,280
 pixel

1725
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,320
 here is a different color

1726
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:54,800
 every single

1727
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,120
 pixel

1728
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:55,679
 gets a different

1729
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,040
 amount of light

1730
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,400
 every single pixel has a subtly different translucency

1731
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,000
 so to make it look realistic

1732
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,640
 the solution

1733
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,159
 was you run a separate program

1734
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,040
 on every pixel

1735
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,640
 see but i thought there's a reflection

1736
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:07,600
 from all over the place

1737
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:07,920
 is

1738
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,480
 every picture

1739
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,199
 yeah but there is

1740
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:09,520
 so

1741
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,640
 so you build a reflection

1742
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,159
 map which also

1743
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,280
 has some pixelated

1744
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,000
 thing

1745
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
 and then when the pixel is looking at the reflection

1746
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,040
 map it has to calculate

1747
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,040
 what the normal of the surface is

1748
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,719
 and it does it per pixel

1749
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,320
 by the way there's both loads of hacks

1750
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,719
 on that you're like you may have a lower resolution

1751
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,040
 light map reflection map there's all these you know attacks they do

1752
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,800
 but at the end of the day it's per pixel computation

1753
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,520
 and it so happened that you can map

1754
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,040
 graph like computation

1755
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:42,080
 onto the this pixel essentially you could do floating point programs on convolutions

1756
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,280
 and matrices

1757
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,080
 and nvidia invested for years in cuda

1758
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,280
 first for hpc and then they got lucky with the ai

1759
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,000
 trend

1760
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,239
 but do you think they're going to essentially

1761
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:57,199
 not be able to hardcore pivot out of their we'll see

1762
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:03,679
 that's always interesting how often do big companies hardcore pivot occasionally

1763
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,239
 how much do you know about nvidia folks

1764
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:06,880
 so

1765
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,000
 some yeah

1766
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,640
 well i'm i'm curious as well who's ultimately

1767
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,280
 as a

1768
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:11,679
 well

1769
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,000
 they've

1770
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,400
 innovated

1771
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:12,800
 several

1772
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,199
 times

1773
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:13,920
 but they've also

1774
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,040
 worked really hard on mobile

1775
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,199
 they worked really hard on radios

1776
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:20,480
 you know you know they're fundamentally a gpu company

1777
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,640
 well they tried to pivot it's an interesting little

1778
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,000
 game and play

1779
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,320
 in autonomous vehicles right with

1780
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,600
 or semi-autonomous

1781
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,120
 like playing with tesla and so on and seeing that's a

1782
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,520
 dipping a toe into that kind of pivot

1783
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,719
 they came out with this platform which is interesting technically

1784
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,520
 yeah but it was like a three thousand watt

1785
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,000
 you know you know thousand watt three three thousand dollar you know gpu platform

1786
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,800
 i don't know if it's interesting technically it's interesting philosophically

1787
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,840
 i i

1788
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,400
 technically i don't know if it's the execution that craftsmanship was there i'm not sure

1789
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,320
 but that i didn't get a sense they were

1790
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,040
 repurposing

1791
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,960
 gpus for an automotive solution

1792
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,960
 right it's not a real pivot they didn't they didn't build a ground-up solution

1793
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,679
 right

1794
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:04,400
 like the

1795
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,920
 like the chips inside tesla are pretty cheap like mobile eye has been doing this

1796
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,719
 they're they're doing the classic work from the simplest thing

1797
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,280
 yeah you know they were building 40 mil square millimeter

1798
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,080
 chips

1799
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:19,840
 and nvidia their solution had two 800 millimeter chips and two 200 millimeter chips and

1800
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,679
 you know like boatloads are really expensive drams and

1801
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,960
 and you know it's a really different approach

1802
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,120
 the mobilelite fit the let's say automotive cost and form factor

1803
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,440
 and then they added features as it was economically

1804
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:38,640
 viable and nvidia said take the biggest thing and we're gonna go make it work

1805
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,199
 you know and and that's also influenced like waymo

1806
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,040
 there's a whole bunch of autonomous

1807
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,719
 startups where they have a 5000 watt server in their trunk

1808
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,640
 right and but that's

1809
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,679
 that's because they think well 5000 watts and you know 10 000

1810
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,560
 is okay because it's replacing the driver

1811
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,920
 elon's approach was that port has to be cheap enough

1812
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,159
 to put it in every single tesla whether they turn on it autonomous driving or not

1813
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:02,800
 which

1814
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,640
 and mobileye was like

1815
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,520
 we need to fit in the bomb and you know cost structure

1816
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,080
 that

1817
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:08,880
 car companies

1818
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,520
 do so they may sell you a gps for 1500

1819
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,239
 bucks

1820
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:16,320
 but the bond for that's like 25

1821
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,600
 well and

1822
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,239
 for mobile eye it seems like neural networks

1823
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,920
 were not first-class citizens

1824
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,880
 like the computation

1825
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,960
 they didn't start out as a yeah it was a cv problem yeah

1826
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:27,840
 and did classic

1827
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,239
 cv

1828
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:28,960
 and found stop

1829
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,280
 lights

1830
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:29,679
 and lines

1831
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,120
 and they were really good at it

1832
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,480
 yeah and they never

1833
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,800
 i mean i don't know what's happening now but they never

1834
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,679
 fully pivoted

1835
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:37,120
 i mean it's like it's the nvidia

1836
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:37,840
 thing

1837
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,880
 and then

1838
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,920
 as opposed to so if you look at the new tesla work

1839
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,360
 it's like neural networks from the ground up yeah right

1840
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,560
 yeah and even tesla started with a lot of cv stuff in it and andre's

1841
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,000
 basically been eliminating

1842
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,760
 it

1843
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,239
 move it move everything into the network

1844
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,199
 so

1845
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,159
 without

1846
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:01,520
 this isn't like confidential stuff but you sitting on a porch looking over the world

1847
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,320
 looking at the work that andre is doing that elon's doing with tesla autopilot

1848
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,600
 do you like the trajectory

1849
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,800
 of where things are going on the floor they're making serious progress

1850
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,400
 i like the videos of people

1851
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,920
 driving the beta stuff

1852
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,760
 like it's taking some pretty complicated

1853
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,640
 intersections and all that but it's it's still an intervention for drive

1854
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,640
 i mean i i have autopilot the current autopilot

1855
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,520
 my my tesla i use it every day do you have full self-driving

1856
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,719
 beta or no no

1857
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,640
 so you you like where this is going

1858
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,159
 we're making progress it's taking longer than anybody thought

1859
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,520
 you know my wonder was

1860
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,960
 is you know hardware three is it enough computing

1861
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,960
 off by two off by five off by ten off by a hundred yeah

1862
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,679
 and

1863
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:47,040
 and i i thought it probably wasn't enough

1864
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:52,080
 but they're doing pretty well with it now yeah and one thing is

1865
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,880
 the data set gets bigger the training gets better

1866
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,199
 and then there's this interesting thing is

1867
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:01,199
 you sort of train and build an arbitrary size network that solves the problem

1868
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,719
 and then you refactor the network down to the thing that you can afford

1869
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,159
 to ship

1870
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:07,520
 right so the

1871
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,920
 the goal isn't to build the network that fits in the phone it's to build

1872
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,719
 something that actually works

1873
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:19,679
 and then then how do you make that most effective on the hardware you have

1874
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,360
 and they seem to be doing that much better than a couple years ago

1875
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:23,840
 well

1876
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,679
 the one really important thing is also

1877
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,560
 what they're doing well is how to iterate that quickly

1878
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,679
 which means like it's not just about one time deployment

1879
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,080
 one building is constantly entering the network

1880
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,440
 and trying to automate as many steps as possible right

1881
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,600
 and that's actually the

1882
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,440
 principles of the software 2.0 like you mentioned with andre

1883
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,360
 is

1884
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,800
 it's not just

1885
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,000
 i mean i don't know what the actual his description of software 2.0

1886
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,800
 is

1887
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,920
 if it's just high-level philosophical or their specifics but the interesting thing about

1888
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,719
 what that actually looks in the real world is it's that

1889
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,000
 what i think andre calls the data engine it's like

1890
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,199
 it's the iterative improvement of the thing you have a neural network that

1891
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,480
 does stuff

1892
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,840
 fails on a bunch of things

1893
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,719
 and learns from it over and over and over so you're constantly discovering

1894
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:15,840
 edge cases

1895
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,640
 so it's very much about

1896
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,840
 like data engineering

1897
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,360
 like figuring out

1898
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,600
 it's it's kind of what you were talking about with testosterone

1899
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,600
 is you have the data landscape

1900
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,120
 they have to walk along that data landscape in a way that

1901
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,199
 that's constantly improving the

1902
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:31,679
 the

1903
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,560
 the neural network and that that feels like that's the central

1904
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,760
 piece of it yeah itself

1905
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,640
 and there's two pieces

1906
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,040
 of it like

1907
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:39,679
 you you find

1908
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:40,239
 edge cases

1909
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:41,520
 that don't work and then you define

1910
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:41,840
 something

1911
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,080
 that goes get your data for that

1912
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,280
 but then the other constraint

1913
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,800
 is whether you have to label it or not

1914
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,440
 like the

1915
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,000
 the amazing

1916
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,440
 thing about like the gpt3

1917
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,360
 stuff is it's unsupervised

1918
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,760
 so there's essentially infinite amount of data now there's obviously infinite amount of data

1919
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,120
 available from cars of people successfully driving

1920
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,159
 but you know the

1921
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:04,480
 the current pipelines are mostly running on labeled data which is human limited

1922
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,840
 so when that becomes

1923
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,560
 unsupervised

1924
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,199
 right it it'll create

1925
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,080
 unlimited amount of data which then they'll scale

1926
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,080
 now the networks that may use that data might be way too big for cars

1927
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,520
 but then there'll be the transformation

1928
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,239
 from now we have unlimited data i know exactly what i want

1929
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:25,679
 now can i turn that into something that fits in the car

1930
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:29,120
 and that pro that process is going to happen all over the place

1931
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,080
 every time you get to the place where you have unlimited data

1932
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:37,920
 and that's what software 2.0 is about unlimited data training networks to do stuff

1933
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,640
 without humans writing code to do it

1934
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:45,840
 and ultimately also trying to discover like you're saying the self-supervised

1935
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,239
 formulation of the problem so the unsupervised

1936
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,320
 formulation of the problem like

1937
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,120
 you know in driving there's this really interesting

1938
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,440
 thing which is

1939
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:00,239
 you look at a scene that's before you and you have data about what a successful

1940
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:01,840
 human driver did

1941
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,320
 in that scene you know one second later

1942
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,840
 it's a little piece of data that you can use just like with gpt-3

1943
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,360
 as training

1944
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:14,480
 currently even even though tesla says they're using that it's an open question to me

1945
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,360
 how much how far can you can you sell all of the driving

1946
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,080
 with just

1947
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:18,520
 that

1948
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,520
 self-supervised

1949
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,120
 piece of data

1950
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,480
 and

1951
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,440
 like i i think that's what comedy is doing

1952
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,960
 that's what common ai is doing but the question is how

1953
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,239
 how much data so what comedy ai doesn't have

1954
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:32,719
 is

1955
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:33,199
 as

1956
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,040
 good of a data engine for example

1957
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,719
 as tesla does that's where the

1958
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:37,760
 like the organization

1959
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,679
 of the data

1960
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,840
 i mean as far as i know i haven't talked to george

1961
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,480
 but they do have the data

1962
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,760
 the question is how much data is needed

1963
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,719
 because we say infinite very loosely here

1964
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,239
 it's it's and then the other question which you said

1965
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,520
 i don't know if you think it's still an open question is

1966
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,920
 are we in the right order of magnitude for the compute necessary

1967
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,639
 that

1968
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:05,440
 is is this is it like what elon said this

1969
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,480
 chip that's in there now is enough to do full self-driving

1970
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,639
 or do we need another order of magnitude

1971
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:13,199
 i think nobody actually knows the answer to that question

1972
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,159
 i like the confidence that elon has but

1973
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,440
 yeah we'll see

1974
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:22,159
 and there's another funny thing is you don't learn to drive with infinite amounts of data

1975
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:28,000
 you learn to drive with an intellectual framework that understands physics and color and horizontal surfaces

1976
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,400
 and laws and roads and you know all your

1977
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,639
 your experience from manipulating your environment

1978
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:41,440
 like look there's so many factors go into that so then when you learn to drive

1979
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,760
 like driving is a subset of this conceptual framework that you have

1980
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:51,520
 right and so with self-driving cars right now we're teaching them to drive with driving data

1981
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,440
 you never teach a human to do that

1982
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,560
 you teach a human all kinds of interesting things like

1983
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,040
 language

1984
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,639
 like don't do that you know watch

1985
01:21:58,639 --> 01:21:58,960
 out

1986
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,800
 you know there's all kinds of stuff going on

1987
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,320
 well this is where you i think previous

1988
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,280
 time with we talked

1989
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,159
 about

1990
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:06,560
 where you poetically

1991
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:12,400
 disagreed with my naive notion about humans i just think that

1992
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,760
 humans will will make this whole driving thing really difficult

1993
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,800
 yeah all right

1994
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,280
 like i said humans don't move that slow

1995
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,639
 it's a ballistics problem

1996
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:21,360
 it's a ballistic

1997
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,320
 human zero ballistics

1998
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,440
 problem which is like poetry

1999
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,000
 to me

2000
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:24,480
 it's very

2001
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,360
 it's very possible

2002
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,080
 that in driving

2003
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:26,800
 they're indeed

2004
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,760
 purely a ballistics

2005
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,560
 problem i

2006
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,600
 and i think that's probably the right way to think about it but

2007
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,800
 i still

2008
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,800
 they still continue to surprise me those and damn pedestrians the cyclists

2009
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,719
 other humans and other cars

2010
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,560
 and yeah but it's going to be one of these compensating things so

2011
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,920
 like when you're driving

2012
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,360
 you have an intuition

2013
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,840
 about what humans are going to do but you don't have 360

2014
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,800
 cameras

2015
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,520
 and radars

2016
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,679
 and you have an attention problem so yeah

2017
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,040
 so so the self-driving

2018
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,600
 car comes in with no attention problems 360

2019
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,040
 cameras right you know

2020
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,400
 a bunch of other features

2021
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,600
 yeah so they'll wipe out a whole class of accidents

2022
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,360
 right and you know

2023
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,480
 you know emergency

2024
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,800
 braking with radar and especially as it gets you know ai enhanced will eliminate

2025
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,080
 collisions

2026
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:10,719
 right

2027
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,880
 but then you have the other problems of these unexpected

2028
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,040
 things where you know you think your human intuition

2029
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,760
 is helping but then the cars also have

2030
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,360
 you know a set of hardware features that you're not even close to

2031
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,840
 and the key thing of course is

2032
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,199
 if you wipe out

2033
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,880
 a huge number of kind of accidents

2034
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,120
 then it might be just way safer than the human driver even though

2035
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,560
 even if humans are still a problem that's hard to figure out

2036
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,040
 yeah

2037
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,080
 that's probably what happens

2038
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:36,560
 autonomous

2039
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,600
 cars will have

2040
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,840
 a small number of accidents humans would have avoided

2041
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,880
 but they'll wipe

2042
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,000
 they'll get rid of

2043
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,679
 the bulk of them

2044
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,639
 what do you think about

2045
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,560
 like tesla's dojo efforts

2046
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,040
 or it can be bigger than tesla in general

2047
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,320
 it's kind of like the tense torrent

2048
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,280
 trying to innovate like this is the dichotomy like

2049
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:02,080
 should a company try to from scratch build its own neural network training

2050
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:02,960
 hardware

2051
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,480
 well first i think it's great so we need lots of experiments

2052
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:11,360
 right and there's lots of startups working on this and they're pursuing different things

2053
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,280
 you know i was there when we started dojo

2054
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,719
 and it was sort of like what's the unconstrained

2055
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:21,600
 computer solution to go do very large training problems

2056
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,280
 and then there's fun stuff like

2057
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,320
 you know we said

2058
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,040
 well we have this 10 000 watt board to cool

2059
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,960
 well you go talk to guys at spacex

2060
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,639
 and they think 10 000 watts is a really small number not a big number yeah

2061
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:33,520
 and

2062
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,120
 and there's brilliant people working on it i'm curious to see how it'll come out i

2063
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,080
 i couldn't tell you

2064
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,880
 you know

2065
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,639
 i know it pivoted a few times since i left so so the

2066
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,840
 cooling does seem to be a big problem i do like what

2067
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,560
 elon said about it which is like we don't want to do

2068
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,199
 the thing

2069
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:49,600
 unless

2070
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,199
 it's way better than the alternative

2071
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,320
 whatever the alternative

2072
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,840
 is so it has to be way better than like

2073
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,520
 racks of gpus

2074
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,120
 yeah and the other thing is just like you know

2075
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,760
 you know the tesla autonomous driving hardware

2076
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,400
 it was only serving one software stack

2077
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,679
 and the hardware team and the software team were tightly coupled

2078
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:10,560
 you know if you're building

2079
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,000
 a general purpose ai solution

2080
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,080
 then you know there's so many different customers

2081
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,320
 with so many different needs

2082
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:23,920
 now something andre said is i think this is amazing 10 years ago like vision recommendation

2083
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,040
 language were completely different disciplines

2084
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,800
 we said the people literally couldn't talk to each other and three years ago

2085
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,400
 it was all neural networks

2086
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,639
 but the very different neural networks

2087
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,520
 and recently it's converging on one set of networks

2088
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,920
 they vary a lot in size obviously they vary in data varying outputs

2089
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,960
 but the technology

2090
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,800
 has converged a good bit

2091
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,280
 yeah these transformers behind gbt3

2092
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,400
 it seems like they could be applied

2093
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,480
 to video they could be applied to a lot of yeah

2094
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,400
 and it's like and they're all really

2095
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,760
 it was like to literally replace letters with pixels

2096
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,719
 yeah it does vision it's amazing

2097
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:01,920
 so and then size actually improves the thing

2098
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,600
 so the bigger it gets the more compute you throw at it the better it gets

2099
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,239
 the more data you have the better it gets

2100
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:09,280
 so

2101
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,080
 so so then you start to wonder well is that a fundamental

2102
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,000
 thing or is is this

2103
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,639
 just another step to some fundamental understanding about this kind of computation

2104
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,080
 which is really interesting

2105
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,199
 us humans don't want to believe that that kind of thing will achieve conceptual

2106
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:26,880
 understandings you were saying like you'll figure out physics but maybe it will

2107
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,280
 maybe probably will

2108
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,960
 well it's worse than that

2109
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,600
 it'll understand physics in ways that we can't understand

2110
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,440
 i like to hear stephen will from

2111
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,800
 talk where he said you know there's three generations of physics there was

2112
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,920
 physics by reasoning well big things should false faster than small things right that's reasoning

2113
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,880
 and then there's

2114
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,800
 physics by equations

2115
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,080
 like you know

2116
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,600
 but the number of programs in the world that are solved with the single equations relatively

2117
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,520
 low almost all programs have you know

2118
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,639
 more than one line of code maybe 100 million lines of code

2119
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,560
 so you said that now we're going to

2120
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,400
 physics by equation which is his project which is cool

2121
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:08,800
 i might point out that there was there was two two generations of physics before reasoning

2122
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,080
 habit

2123
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:14,080
 like all animals you know know things fall and you know birds fly and

2124
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:18,880
 you know predators know how to you know solve a differential equation to cut off a

2125
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,199
 accelerating you know

2126
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:26,960
 curving animal path yep and then there was you know the gods did it

2127
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,320
 right

2128
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:33,120
 so yeah right so you know there's five generations now

2129
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:38,239
 software 2.0 says programming things is not the last step

2130
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:47,040
 data so there's going to be a physics past stephen's wolfram's com that's not explainable

2131
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,199
 and and actually

2132
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:53,120
 there's no reason that i can see while that even that's the limit

2133
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,440
 like there's something beyond that

2134
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,760
 i mean they're usually like usually when you have this hierarchy

2135
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:58,639
 it's not like

2136
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,760
 well if you have this step in this step in this step and they're all qualitatively

2137
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,880
 different

2138
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,600
 and conceptually

2139
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,000
 different

2140
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,639
 it's not obvious

2141
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:04,960
 why

2142
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:05,600
 you know six

2143
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,880
 is the right hand number of hierarchy

2144
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:07,280
 steps

2145
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,080
 in not seven

2146
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,040
 or eight or

2147
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,080
 well then it's

2148
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,040
 probably impossible

2149
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,000
 for us to

2150
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,679
 to comprehend

2151
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:18,159
 something that's beyond the thing that's not explainable

2152
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:22,560
 yeah because i think but the thing that you know understands the thing that's unexplainable

2153
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,360
 to us

2154
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,159
 we'll conceive the next one and

2155
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:30,960
 like i'm not sure why there's a limit to it

2156
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,920
 your brain hurts that's the sad story

2157
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:41,120
 if if we look at our own brain which is an interesting illustrative example

2158
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:46,080
 in your work with testor and trying to design deep learning architectures

2159
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:51,600
 do you do you think about the brain at all maybe from a

2160
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,360
 hardware designer perspective

2161
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,560
 if you could

2162
01:28:54,560 --> 01:29:00,000
 change something about the brain what would you change or do funny question

2163
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,320
 like how would you so your brain is really weird

2164
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,920
 like you know your cereal cortex where we think we do most of our thinking

2165
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,560
 is what like six or seven neurons thick

2166
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:13,040
 yeah like that's weird like all the big networks are way bigger than that

2167
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,080
 like way deeper so that seems odd

2168
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:16,960
 and then

2169
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,040
 you know when you're thinking if it's if

2170
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,159
 if the input

2171
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:20,639
 generates

2172
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:23,920
 a result you can lose it goes really fast but if it can't

2173
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:28,320
 that generates an output that's interesting which turns into an input and then your brain

2174
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,760
 to the point where you mold things

2175
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:30,560
 over for days

2176
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,120
 and how many

2177
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:31,440
 trips

2178
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,159
 through your brain

2179
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:32,560
 is that

2180
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,280
 right

2181
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,639
 like it's you know

2182
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:39,679
 300 milliseconds or something to get through seven levels of neurons i forget the number exactly

2183
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:43,280
 but then it does it over and over and over as it searches

2184
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,639
 and the brain clearly

2185
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:47,040
 is looks like some kind of graph because you have a neuron

2186
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,840
 with you know connections and it talks to other ones and

2187
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,760
 it's locally very computationally

2188
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,920
 intense but it's also

2189
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,679
 does sparse computations across a pretty big area

2190
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:02,159
 there's a lot of messy biological type of things and it's it's

2191
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:03,199
 meaning like

2192
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:07,440
 first of all there's mechanical chemical and electrical signals that's all that's going on

2193
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,120
 then the there's a the asynchronicity

2194
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,400
 of signals

2195
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,760
 and there's like there's just a lot of variability that seems continuous

2196
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,560
 and messy and just a mess of biology

2197
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:25,360
 and it's unclear whether that's a good thing yeah or it's a bad thing because if

2198
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:29,199
 if it's a good thing that we need to run the entirety of the evolution

2199
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:33,920
 well we're going to have to start with basic bacteria to create some imaging we could

2200
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,280
 you could build a brain with 10 layers would that be better or worse

2201
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,760
 or more more connections or less connections

2202
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:44,080
 or you know we don't know to what level our brains are optimized

2203
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,040
 but if i was changing

2204
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,920
 things like

2205
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,080
 yeah like you know you can only hold like seven numbers

2206
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,040
 in your head

2207
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,760
 yeah like why not 100 or a million

2208
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,360
 never thought of that

2209
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,719
 like and why can't like why can't we have like a floating point processor

2210
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,199
 that can compute anything we want

2211
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,960
 like and see it all properly like that would be kind of fun

2212
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,560
 and why can't we we see in four or eight dimensions

2213
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,840
 like because you know 3d is kind of a drag

2214
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,760
 like all the hard mass transforms are up in multiple dimensions

2215
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,760
 so there's that you know you could imagine a brain architecture that

2216
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,199
 you know you could

2217
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:22,159
 enhance with a whole bunch of features that would be

2218
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:25,840
 you know really useful for thinking about things it's possible that the limitations

2219
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,679
 you're describing are actually

2220
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:28,400
 essential

2221
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,000
 for like the constraints are essential for creating

2222
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,600
 like the depth of intelligence like that

2223
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,679
 the ability to reason

2224
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:42,880
 you know it's hard to say because like your brain is clearly a parallel processor

2225
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,239
 you know you know

2226
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:46,800
 10 billion neurons talking to each other at a relatively

2227
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,320
 low clock rate

2228
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:48,880
 but

2229
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,920
 it produces

2230
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,600
 something that looks like a serial

2231
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,480
 thought process

2232
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,480
 it's a serial narrative in your head

2233
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,960
 that's true right but then there are people famously who are visual thinkers

2234
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,840
 like

2235
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,080
 i think i'm a relatively visual thinker

2236
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:06,239
 i can imagine any object and rotate it in my head and look at it

2237
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:09,440
 and there are people who say they don't think that way at all

2238
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,000
 and recently i read an article about people

2239
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,080
 people who say they don't have a they don't have a voice in their heads

2240
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,400
 they can talk

2241
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,960
 but when they you know it's like well what are you thinking

2242
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,239
 they'll they'll describe something that's visual

2243
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:27,840
 so that's curious

2244
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,440
 now

2245
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,679
 if if you're saying

2246
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,040
 if we dedicated

2247
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,880
 more hardware to holding information

2248
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,840
 like you know 10 numbers or a million numbers

2249
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,600
 like would that

2250
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:44,080
 just distract us from our ability to form this kind of singular

2251
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,679
 identity like it dissipates

2252
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:46,880
 somehow right

2253
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,159
 but but maybe

2254
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,560
 you know future humans will have many identities

2255
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,280
 that

2256
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:55,440
 have some higher level organization but can actually do lots more things in parallel

2257
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:00,159
 yeah there's no reason if we're thinking modularly there's no reason we can't have multiple consciousnesses

2258
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:05,520
 in one brain yeah and maybe there's some way to make it faster so that the

2259
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:10,080
 you know the the area the computation could

2260
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:12,080
 could still have a unified

2261
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,280
 feel to it

2262
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,600
 but while still having way more ability

2263
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,440
 to do parallel stuff at the same time

2264
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,880
 could definitely be improved

2265
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,000
 it could be improved

2266
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,440
 okay well

2267
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:21,920
 it's it's

2268
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,280
 pretty good right now actually

2269
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,719
 people don't give it enough credit the thing is pretty nice the

2270
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,800
 the you know the the fact that the right ends seem to be

2271
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,480
 on give a nice like spark

2272
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,400
 of

2273
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,840
 beauty to the whole experience

2274
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,159
 i don't know i don't know if it can be improved easily

2275
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:42,400
 it could be more beautiful

2276
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,040
 i don't know how yeah what do you mean

2277
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,159
 what do you mean how

2278
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,159
 all the ways you can't imagine

2279
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:49,440
 no but that's the whole point

2280
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,960
 i wouldn't be able to i'm at

2281
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,080
 the fact that i can imagine

2282
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:52,400
 ways

2283
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:52,719
 in

2284
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:53,120
 in

2285
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,440
 in which it could be more beautiful

2286
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:01,840
 means so do you know you know ian banks his stories so the the super smart

2287
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:07,360
 ais there live mostly live in the world of what they call infinite fun

2288
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:12,159
 because they can create arbitrary worlds

2289
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:12,880
 so they interact

2290
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,000
 and you know the story

2291
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:14,880
 has it they interact

2292
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,440
 in the normal

2293
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,560
 world and they're very smart

2294
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,480
 and they can do all kinds of stuff

2295
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:18,880
 and

2296
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,520
 you know a given

2297
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,080
 mind can

2298
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:20,960
 you know talk to a million

2299
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:21,280
 humans

2300
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,639
 at the same time because we're very

2301
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:23,040
 slow

2302
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:23,840
 and

2303
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,239
 for reasons you know artificial the story

2304
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:30,880
 they're interested in people and doing stuff but they mostly live in this

2305
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,480
 this other land of thinking my

2306
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,920
 inclination is to think that the ability to create infinite fun will

2307
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,960
 um will not be so fun

2308
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,560
 that's sad

2309
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,080
 there are so many things to do imagine be able to make a star

2310
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,520
 move planets around

2311
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,080
 yeah

2312
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,560
 yeah but because we can imagine that as wildlife

2313
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,199
 is fun

2314
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:54,960
 if we can if we actually were able to do it it'd be a slippery slope

2315
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:58,960
 where fun wouldn't even have a meaning because we just consistently

2316
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,920
 desensitize ourselves by the infinite amounts of fun we're having

2317
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:09,040
 and the sadness the the dark stuff is what makes it fun i think i

2318
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,320
 mean that could be the russian

2319
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,520
 it could be the could be the fun makes it fun and the sadnesses

2320
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,400
 makes it bittersweet

2321
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,320
 yeah that's true fun could be the thing that makes it fun

2322
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,480
 so what do you think about the expansion

2323
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:27,199
 not through the biology side but through the bci the brain computer interfaces

2324
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:31,440
 yeah you got a chance to check out the neural link stuff it's super interesting

2325
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,159
 like like humans like

2326
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:37,440
 like our thoughts to manifest as action

2327
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,560
 you know like

2328
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,600
 like as a kid you know like shooting a rifle was super fun

2329
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,119
 driving a mini bike

2330
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,159
 doing things

2331
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:48,880
 and then computer games i think for a lot of kids became the thing where they

2332
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,719
 you know they can do what they want they can fly

2333
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:51,360
 a plane

2334
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,719
 they can do this they can do this

2335
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:53,440
 right

2336
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:57,520
 but you have to have this physical interaction now imagine

2337
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:02,159
 you know you could just imagine stuff and it happens

2338
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:03,199
 right

2339
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,360
 like really richly

2340
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,480
 and interestingly

2341
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:10,080
 like we kind of do that when we dream like dream dreams are funny because

2342
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:14,239
 like if you have some control or awareness in your dreams

2343
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,320
 like it's very realistic looking

2344
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,760
 or not realistic

2345
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,199
 it depends on the dream

2346
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:22,320
 but you can also manipulate that

2347
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,199
 and you know what what's possible there is

2348
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:29,040
 is is odd and the fact that nobody understands it's hilarious but

2349
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:35,199
 um do you think it's possible to expand that capability through computing sure

2350
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:39,600
 is there some interesting so from a hardware designer perspective is there

2351
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,360
 do you think you'll present totally new challenges and the kind of hardware that required

2352
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,760
 that like so this hardware isn't

2353
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,040
 standalone

2354
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,440
 computing well this just knows

2355
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,719
 today computer games are rendered by gpus

2356
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:57,679
 right right so but you've seen the gans stuff yep right where

2357
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,199
 trained neural networks

2358
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:02,719
 render realistic images but there's no pixels no triangles

2359
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:05,280
 no shaders no light maps no nothing

2360
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,280
 so the future of graphics is probably ai

2361
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:14,480
 right yes now that ai is heavily trained by lots of real data

2362
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:19,679
 right so if you have an interface with a aai renderer

2363
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:22,639
 right so if you say render a cat

2364
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:23,040
 it won't

2365
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:23,280
 say

2366
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:23,520
 well

2367
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:23,760
 how

2368
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,679
 tall is the cat and how big it you know it'll render

2369
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:26,080
 a cat

2370
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,080
 and you might say well a little bigger a little smaller

2371
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,119
 you know

2372
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,320
 make it a tabby

2373
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,800
 shorter hair you know like you could tweak it

2374
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,920
 like the the amount of data you'll have to

2375
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:42,960
 send to interact with a very powerful ai renderer could be low but the question is

2376
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,920
 for brain computer interfaces would need to

2377
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:50,239
 render not onto a screen but render onto the brain

2378
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,119
 and

2379
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:51,840
 like directly

2380
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:52,800
 so that there's a bandwidth

2381
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,760
 you could do it both ways

2382
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,840
 i mean our eyes are really good sensors

2383
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,480
 it could render onto a screen

2384
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,560
 and we could feel like we're participating

2385
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,080
 in it you know they're gonna

2386
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,000
 they're gonna have you know like the oculus

2387
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,719
 kind of stuff

2388
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:06,320
 it's gonna be so good when a projection

2389
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,880
 to your eyes you think it's real

2390
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,400
 you know they're slowly solving those problems

2391
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,320
 and i suspect

2392
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:20,400
 when the renderer of that information into your head is also ai mediated

2393
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,000
 you know they'll be able to give you

2394
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,639
 the cues

2395
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:23,040
 that

2396
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:27,119
 you know you really want for depth and all kinds of stuff

2397
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:27,520
 like

2398
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,119
 your your brain is probably faking

2399
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,800
 your your visual field right

2400
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,159
 like your eyes are twitching around but you don't notice that occasionally

2401
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,320
 they blank you don't notice that

2402
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,679
 you know there's all kinds of things

2403
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,840
 like you think you see over here but you don't really

2404
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:40,400
 see there

2405
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:40,719
 yeah

2406
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,080
 it's all fabricated

2407
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:45,440
 yeah so yeah peripheral vision is fascinating

2408
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:51,600
 so if you have an ai renderer that's trained to understand exactly how you see

2409
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,000
 and the kind of things that enhance the realism of the experience

2410
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,840
 it could be super real actually

2411
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,440
 so i don't know what the limits that are

2412
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:04,800
 but obviously

2413
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,159
 if if we have a brain interface that goes in

2414
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:08,719
 inside

2415
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:09,280
 your

2416
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:13,280
 you know visual cortex in a better way than your eyes do which is possible

2417
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,280
 it's a lot neurons

2418
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:15,600
 yeah

2419
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,880
 um

2420
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,600
 maybe that will be even cooler

2421
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,000
 well the really cool thing is it has to do with the

2422
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:22,560
 the infinite

2423
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,520
 fun that you're referring

2424
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,080
 to

2425
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:24,880
 which is

2426
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,560
 our brains seem to be very limited

2427
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,159
 and like you said computational

2428
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:29,840
 so very plastic

2429
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,239
 very plastic yeah yeah so it's a it's a com interesting combination

2430
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:40,239
 now the the interesting open question is the limits of that neuroplasticity like how

2431
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:41,440
 how flexible

2432
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,719
 is that thing because we don't we haven't really tested it

2433
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:48,960
 we know about that experiments where they they put like a pressure pad on somebody's head

2434
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,639
 and had a visual transducer

2435
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:55,760
 pressurize it and somebody slowly learned to see yep that's like it's

2436
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:56,159
 especially

2437
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:56,960
 at a young age

2438
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:57,600
 if you throw

2439
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:58,639
 a lot at it

2440
01:39:58,639 --> 01:39:58,960
 like

2441
01:39:58,960 --> 01:39:59,280
 what

2442
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,639
 what can it

2443
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:07,520
 can it completely so can you like arbitrarily expand it with computing power so

2444
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,840
 connected to the internet directly somehow yeah the answer's probably yes

2445
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,119
 so the problem with biology

2446
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:18,159
 and ethics is like there's a mess there like us humans are

2447
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:20,800
 perhaps unwilling to take

2448
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,960
 risks in

2449
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,440
 into directions that are full of uncertainty

2450
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,880
 so that's like 90

2451
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,600
 of the population is unwilling to take risks the other 10

2452
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,199
 is rushing into the risks

2453
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:34,080
 unaided by any infrastructure whatsoever

2454
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:34,800
 and

2455
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,800
 you know and that that's where all the fun happens in you know society

2456
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,560
 there's been huge transformations

2457
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:43,440
 yeah in the last you know a couple thousand years

2458
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,119
 yeah it's funny i mean i got a chance to interact with

2459
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:52,480
 this is matthew johnson from johns hopkins he's doing this large-scale study of psychedelics

2460
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,360
 it's it's becoming

2461
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,000
 more and more

2462
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,040
 i've gotten a chance to interact

2463
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:55,679
 with that community

2464
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:56,320
 of scientists

2465
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,679
 working on psychedelics

2466
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:00,960
 but because of that that opened the door to me to

2467
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,000
 all these

2468
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,600
 what are they called psychonauts

2469
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,199
 the people who like you said the ten percent who like

2470
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:11,119
 i don't care i don't know if there's a science behind this i'm taking the spaceship

2471
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:11,920
 to

2472
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,719
 if i'm being the first on mars i'll be

2473
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:18,400
 the you know you know psychedelic's interesting in the sense that

2474
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,480
 in another dimension

2475
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,600
 like you said it's a way to explore the

2476
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,159
 with the limits of the human mind like

2477
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:28,080
 what is this thing capable of doing

2478
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,480
 because you kind of like when you dream

2479
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:35,920
 you detach it i don't know exactly in your science of it but you detach your

2480
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,080
 like reality from

2481
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:38,880
 what your mind

2482
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,360
 the images

2483
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,480
 your mind is able to conjure

2484
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,080
 up and your mind goes into weird

2485
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:42,960
 places

2486
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,760
 and like entities appear

2487
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,760
 freudian type of

2488
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:52,000
 like trauma is probably connected in there somehow but you start to have like these

2489
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,239
 weird vivid worlds that like so do you actively dream

2490
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:58,880
 do you why not

2491
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,960
 i had like six six hours of dreams and i it's like really useful time

2492
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,960
 i know i do i haven't

2493
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:08,480
 i don't for some reason i just knock out and

2494
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:14,560
 i have sometimes like anxiety inducing kind of like very pragmatic

2495
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:20,480
 like nightmare type of dreams but not nothing fun nothing nothing fun nothing fun

2496
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:24,639
 i i try i unfortunately have mostly have fun

2497
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:29,840
 in the waking world which is very limited in the amount of fun you can have

2498
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,960
 it's not that limited either yeah that's what we'll have to talk

2499
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:40,800
 yeah i need instructions yeah there's like a manual for that you might wanna

2500
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:44,560
 i looked it up i'll ask elon what what did you dream

2501
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,400
 you know years ago and i i read about you know

2502
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,800
 like you know a book about how to have

2503
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,960
 you know become aware of your dreams

2504
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:55,520
 i worked on it for a while like there's this trick about

2505
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:58,960
 you know imagine you can see your hands and look out and

2506
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,440
 and i got somewhat good at it like

2507
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,119
 but my mostly

2508
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:06,800
 when i'm thinking about things or working on problems i i

2509
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:12,239
 i prep myself before i go to sleep it's like i i pull into my

2510
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:15,360
 mind all the things i want to work on or think about

2511
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,360
 and then

2512
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:23,280
 that let's say greatly improves the chances that i'll i'll work on that while i'm sleeping

2513
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:30,080
 and then and then i also you know basically asked to remember it

2514
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,159
 and i often remember

2515
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,119
 very detailed

2516
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,840
 within the dream yeah or outside the dream well

2517
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,760
 to bring it up in in my dreaming

2518
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,800
 and then remember it when i wake up

2519
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,480
 it's just it's more of a meditative practice you say

2520
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:47,040
 you know to prepare yourself to

2521
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,719
 do that

2522
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:51,040
 like if you go to you know the sleep still

2523
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,840
 gnashing your teeth about some random thing that happened

2524
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:57,760
 that you're not that really interested in you'll dream about it

2525
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,000
 that's really interesting maybe but but you can direct your dreams

2526
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,239
 somewhat by prepping

2527
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:06,320
 you know i'm going to try that it's really interesting

2528
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:10,000
 like the most important the interesting not like

2529
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,520
 what what did this guy send

2530
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,440
 in an email kind of like stupid

2531
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,800
 worry stuff but like fundamental

2532
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,480
 problems you're actually concerned about

2533
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,800
 prepping and interesting things you're worried about or just

2534
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,880
 you're reading or you know some great conversation

2535
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,159
 you had or something

2536
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:25,600
 some adventure you want to have like there's there's a lot of

2537
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,280
 space there

2538
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,800
 and

2539
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,960
 and it seems to work

2540
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,159
 that

2541
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:36,320
 you know my percentage of interesting dreams and memories went up

2542
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,840
 is there

2543
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,320
 is that the source of

2544
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:45,360
 if you were able to deconstruct like where some of your best ideas came from

2545
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,360
 do is there a process

2546
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,440
 that's at the core of that yeah like so some people you know

2547
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:55,040
 walk and think some people like in the shower the best ideas hit them

2548
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,480
 if you talk about like newton

2549
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,480
 apple hitting them on the head

2550
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:03,119
 no i i found that a long time ago i'm i process things somewhat slowly

2551
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:04,480
 so like in college

2552
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:07,440
 i had friends that could study at the last minute get an a next day

2553
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:08,960
 i can't do that at all

2554
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,960
 so i always front loaded all the work like i do all the problems

2555
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,600
 early you know for finals like the last three days i wouldn't look at a book

2556
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,199
 because i want you know because

2557
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:22,800
 like a new fact the day before finals may screw up my understanding

2558
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,639
 of what i thought i knew so my

2559
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:27,119
 my goal was to always get it in

2560
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:29,760
 and and give it time to soak

2561
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:30,639
 and

2562
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:31,840
 i used to you know

2563
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,679
 i remember we were doing like 3d calculus

2564
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:35,600
 i would have these amazing dreams of 3d

2565
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,159
 surfaces

2566
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:37,119
 with normal

2567
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:41,199
 you know calculating the gradient and this is like all come up so it was

2568
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:42,320
 really fun

2569
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,840
 like very visual

2570
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,760
 and and if i got cycles of that that was useful

2571
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:53,760
 um and the other is don't over filter your ideas like i like that process of

2572
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,400
 brainstorming

2573
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,199
 where lots of ideas can happen i like people who have lots of ideas

2574
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:58,639
 and things but that's what's up

2575
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:02,480
 then there's a yeah let them sit and let it breathe a little bit

2576
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:08,320
 and then reduce it to practice like at some point you really have to

2577
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,960
 does it really work like you know is this real or not

2578
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,520
 right but you but you have to do both there's creative

2579
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,920
 tension there like how do you be both open

2580
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,199
 and

2581
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:20,320
 you know precise

2582
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,239
 if you had ideas that you just

2583
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,719
 that sit in your mind for like years

2584
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:26,000
 before the

2585
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,679
 sure

2586
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:30,560
 it's an interesting way to

2587
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:36,320
 is generate ideas and just let them sit let them sit there for a while

2588
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:40,000
 i think i have a few of those ideas you know that was so funny

2589
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,080
 yeah i think that's

2590
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:45,600
 you know creativity this one or something

2591
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,199
 for the slow thinkers in the in the room i suppose

2592
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:52,080
 as i some people like you said are just like

2593
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:57,520
 like the yeah it's really interesting like there's so much diversity in how people think

2594
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,520
 you know how fast or slow they are how well they remember don't

2595
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:06,320
 like you know i'm not super good at remembering facts but processes and methods

2596
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:10,159
 like in our engineering i went to penn state and almost all our engineering

2597
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:14,560
 tests were open book i could remember the page and not the formula

2598
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,360
 but as soon as i saw the formula i could remember the whole method

2599
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,679
 if i if i'd learned it

2600
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:22,320
 yeah you know so it's just a funny

2601
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:23,199
 or some people could

2602
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:23,920
 you know i i

2603
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:24,239
 swatched

2604
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:24,560
 friends

2605
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:25,040
 like flipping

2606
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,360
 through the book trying to find the formula

2607
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,920
 even knowing that they'd done just as much work

2608
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,960
 and i would just open the book i was on page 27

2609
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:36,000
 about half i could see the whole thing visually

2610
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,480
 yeah

2611
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,440
 and you know

2612
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,560
 and you have to learn that about

2613
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:38,880
 yourself

2614
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,239
 and figure out what to do with the

2615
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:40,560
 function

2616
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,280
 optimally

2617
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,199
 i had a friend who he was always concerned

2618
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,520
 he didn't know how he came up with ideas

2619
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:48,960
 he had lots of ideas but he said they just sort of popped up

2620
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:53,119
 like you'd be working on something having this idea like where does it come from

2621
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:56,719
 but you can have more awareness of it like like

2622
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:57,280
 like

2623
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:58,000
 like how you

2624
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,600
 how your brain works is a little murky

2625
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,400
 as you go down

2626
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:01,040
 from the voice

2627
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,480
 in your head or the obvious

2628
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,679
 visualizations

2629
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:06,480
 like when you visualize something how does that happen

2630
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,960
 yes you know if i say you know visualize volcano

2631
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,159
 it's easy to do right

2632
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:12,000
 and what does it actually look like when you visualize

2633
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,280
 it i can visualize

2634
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,400
 to the point where i don't see

2635
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,159
 very much out of my eyes and i see the colors

2636
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:16,840
 of the thing i'm

2637
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,159
 visualizing

2638
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,199
 yeah but there's like a

2639
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:20,480
 there's a shape there's a texture

2640
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,239
 there's a color but there's also conceptual

2641
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:23,040
 visualization

2642
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,000
 like

2643
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,520
 what are you actually visualizing

2644
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,119
 when you're visualizing volcano

2645
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:30,400
 just like with peripheral vision you think you see the whole thing yeah yeah

2646
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,520
 that's a good way to say it you know you have this kind of

2647
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:36,000
 almost peripheral vision of your visualizations

2648
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,320
 they're like these ghosts

2649
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,360
 but if you know if you

2650
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:39,840
 if you work

2651
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:40,960
 on it you can get a pretty high

2652
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:41,199
 level

2653
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:42,080
 of detail

2654
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:46,480
 and somehow you can walk along those visualizations to come up with an idea which is

2655
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:50,880
 but weird but when you're thinking about solving problems

2656
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:55,600
 like you're you're putting information and you're exercising the stuff you do know

2657
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:00,560
 you're sort of teasing the area that's you don't understand and don't know

2658
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:04,480
 but you can almost you know feel

2659
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:09,840
 you know that process happening you know that's that's how i like

2660
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,040
 like like i know sometimes when i'm working really hard on something like

2661
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,159
 like i get really hot when i'm sleeping and you know it's like

2662
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:19,920
 we got the blank throw i wake up all the blankets are on the floor

2663
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,719
 and you know every time it's while i wake up and think wow that was great

2664
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:26,400
 you know are you able to

2665
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:30,880
 to reverse engineer what the hell happened there oh sometimes it's vivid dreams and sometimes

2666
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,040
 it's this kind of like you say like shadow

2667
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,040
 thinking that you you sort of have this feeling

2668
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:35,679
 you're

2669
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:38,560
 you're going through this stuff but it's it's not that obvious

2670
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:42,159
 isn't that so amazing that the mind just does all these little

2671
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:42,719
 experiments

2672
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:43,440
 i never

2673
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,119
 you know i thought i always thought

2674
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:48,080
 it's like a river that you can't you're just there for the ride

2675
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,239
 but you're right if you prep it

2676
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:52,400
 no it's all understandable

2677
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:52,960
 meditation

2678
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,679
 really helps

2679
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:58,880
 you you got to start figuring out you need to learn language of your own mind

2680
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:02,080
 and there's multiple levels of it

2681
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:05,520
 but the abstractions again right it's somewhat comprehensible

2682
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:07,760
 and observable and

2683
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,840
 feelable or whatever the right word is no it's

2684
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,520
 you know you're not long for the ride you are the ride

2685
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,239
 i have to ask you hardware engineer working on neural networks now

2686
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:23,920
 what's consciousness what the hell is that thing is that

2687
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,760
 is that just some little weird quirk of our particular

2688
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,040
 computing device

2689
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,480
 or is it something fundamental

2690
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:33,760
 that we really need to crack open if we're to

2691
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,320
 to build like good computers

2692
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,760
 do you ever think about consciousness

2693
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:42,560
 like why it feels like something to be i know it's it's it's really weird

2694
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:45,440
 so yeah

2695
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:50,639
 i mean everything about it is weird first it's a half a second behind reality

2696
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:56,400
 right it's a post-hoc narrative about what happened you've already done stuff

2697
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,719
 by the time you're conscious of it

2698
01:50:58,719 --> 01:50:59,679
 and your consciousness

2699
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:03,679
 generally is a single threaded thing but we know your brain is 10 billion neurons

2700
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:06,080
 running some crazy

2701
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:07,840
 parallel thing

2702
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,679
 and there's a really big sorting

2703
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,960
 thing going on there it also seems to be really reflective

2704
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,679
 in the sense that

2705
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:20,320
 you create a space in your head right like we don't really see anything right like

2706
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:25,440
 photons hit your eyes it gets turned into signals it goes through multiple layers the neurons

2707
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,480
 you know like

2708
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:29,040
 i'm so curious that you know that looks glassy

2709
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,400
 and that looks not glassy

2710
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,159
 like like how the resolution

2711
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:35,520
 of your vision is so high you have to go through all this processing

2712
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,960
 yeah where for most of it it looks nothing like vision

2713
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:43,199
 okay like like there's no theater in your mind

2714
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:47,599
 right so we we have a world in our heads

2715
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:49,920
 we're literally just isolated

2716
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:58,159
 behind our sensors but we can look at it speculate about it speculate about alternatives

2717
01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:02,800
 problem solve what if you know there's so many things going on

2718
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,080
 and that process is lagging reality

2719
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,520
 and it's single threaded

2720
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:11,679
 even though the underlying thing is like massively parallel so it's so

2721
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:12,560
 curious

2722
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,920
 so imagine you're building an ai computer if you wanted to replicate

2723
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:18,880
 humans well you'd have huge arrays of neural networks and

2724
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,040
 apparently only six or seven deep which

2725
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,320
 clarious

2726
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,840
 they only remember seven numbers but i think we can upgrade that a lot

2727
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:26,960
 right and then

2728
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,159
 somewhere in there

2729
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:30,560
 you would train the network to create basically

2730
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,480
 the world that you live in

2731
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:36,719
 right so like tell stories to itself about the world that it's perceiving

2732
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:40,719
 well create this create the world tell stories in the world

2733
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:42,960
 and then have many dimensions

2734
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,639
 of

2735
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,400
 you know

2736
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,639
 like sideshows to it like we have an emotional structure like we have a biological

2737
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:51,360
 structure

2738
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,360
 and that seems hierarchical too like

2739
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:57,679
 like if you're hungry it dominates your thinking if you're mad it dominates your thinking

2740
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:59,040
 like

2741
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:02,239
 and we don't know if that's important to consciousness or not but it certainly

2742
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:02,960
 disrupts

2743
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,599
 you know in truths in the consciousness

2744
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:08,000
 like so there's lots of structure to that

2745
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,320
 and

2746
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:09,119
 we like to dwell

2747
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:09,679
 on the past

2748
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:11,119
 we like to think about the future

2749
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:12,080
 we like to imagine

2750
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,000
 we'd like to fantasize

2751
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:21,599
 right and the somewhat circular observation of that is the thing we call consciousness

2752
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:22,400
 now if you created

2753
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:22,880
 a computer

2754
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:23,199
 system

2755
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:24,159
 it did all things create

2756
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:24,800
 world views

2757
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:25,199
 created

2758
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:25,520
 future

2759
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:25,920
 alternate

2760
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,199
 histories

2761
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:31,599
 you know dwelled on past events you know accurately or semi-accurately

2762
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:33,040
 you know it's it's

2763
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:37,920
 consciousness just bring up like natural well would that feel look and feel conscious to you

2764
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:41,840
 like do you think

2765
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:46,639
 do you think the thing that looks conscious is conscious like do you

2766
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:52,880
 again this is like an engineering kind of question i think because

2767
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,719
 like

2768
01:53:54,719 --> 01:54:00,639
 if we want to engineer consciousness is it okay to engineer something that just looks conscious

2769
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:03,920
 or is it is there a difference between well we have all consciousness

2770
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,040
 because it's a super effective way to manage our affairs

2771
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:10,880
 yeah it's right the social development yeah well it gives us the planning system

2772
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,119
 you know we have a huge amount of stuff

2773
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:14,560
 like when we're talking

2774
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,800
 like the reason we can talk really fast is we're modeling

2775
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:17,760
 each other a really

2776
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:19,760
 high level of detail and consciousness

2777
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,159
 is required for that right and well

2778
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:26,080
 all those components together manifest consciousness

2779
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,000
 right so if we make intelligent

2780
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,400
 beings that we want to interact with that we're like

2781
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:34,719
 you know wondering what they're thinking you know you know looking forward to seeing them

2782
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:38,880
 you know when they interact with them they they're interesting surprising

2783
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,639
 you know fascinating

2784
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:41,280
 you know

2785
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,159
 they will probably

2786
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:46,960
 feel conscious like we do and we'll we'll perceive them as conscious

2787
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:52,400
 i don't know why not but you never know another fun question on this because

2788
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:59,440
 in in from a computing perspective we're trying to create something that's human-like or superhuman-like

2789
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:04,400
 let me ask you about aliens aliens

2790
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:12,239
 do you think there's intelligent alien civilizations out there and do you think their

2791
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:16,400
 technology their computing their ai bots

2792
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:21,199
 their their chips are of the same nature as ours

2793
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:22,960
 yeah i got i have no idea

2794
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,599
 i mean

2795
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:27,119
 if there's lots of aliens out there they've been awfully quiet

2796
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:30,560
 you know there's there's speculation about why

2797
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:36,159
 there seems to be more than enough planets out there there's a lot yeah

2798
01:55:36,159 --> 01:55:37,280
 um

2799
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:41,280
 there's intelligent life on this planet that seems quite different you know like

2800
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:47,360
 you know dolphins seem like plausibly understandable octopuses don't seem understandable at all

2801
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:50,880
 if they live longer than a year maybe they would be running the planet

2802
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:56,400
 they seem really smart and their neural architecture is completely different than ours

2803
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,480
 now who knows how they perceive things

2804
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,639
 i mean that's the question is for us intelligent

2805
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:03,520
 beings who might not be able to perceive other kinds of intelligence

2806
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,639
 if they become sufficiently different than us so yeah

2807
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:10,560
 we live in the current constrained world that you know it's three-dimensional geometry

2808
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:14,400
 and the geometry defines a certain amount of physics

2809
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:18,080
 and you know you know there's like how time works seems to work

2810
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:20,400
 like there's so many things that

2811
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,719
 seem like a whole bunch of the input parameters

2812
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:26,320
 to the you know another conscious being are the same

2813
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:32,560
 yes like if it's biological biological things seem to be in a relatively narrow temperature range

2814
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:37,520
 right because you know organic stones aren't stable too cold or too hot

2815
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:43,840
 you know so so there's if you specified the list of things that

2816
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,159
 input to that but as soon as we make really smart

2817
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:49,440
 you know beings

2818
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,320
 and they go solve

2819
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:51,599
 about how to think about a billion

2820
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:51,920
 numbers

2821
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:52,800
 at the same time

2822
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,360
 and

2823
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,840
 and how to think in n

2824
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:01,440
 there's a funny science fiction book where the all the society had uploaded into this matrix

2825
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:05,119
 and at some point some some of the beans in the matrix thought

2826
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:07,760
 i wonder if there's intelligent life out there

2827
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,520
 so they had to do a whole bunch of work to figure

2828
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:09,840
 out

2829
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,199
 like how to make a physical

2830
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:12,239
 thing

2831
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:14,800
 because their matrix was self-sustaining

2832
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,000
 and they made a little spaceship

2833
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,400
 and they traveled to another planet when they got there there was like life running around

2834
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,560
 but there was no intelligent life

2835
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,080
 and then they figured out that there was these huge

2836
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:32,400
 you know organic matrix all over the planet inside there where intelligent beings had uploaded themselves

2837
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,800
 into that matrix

2838
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:40,400
 so everywhere intelligent life was as soon as it got smart

2839
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:46,239
 it up leveled itself into something way more interesting than 3d geometry and yeah it escaped

2840
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:48,719
 whatever this is not escaped

2841
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:53,040
 better yeah the the essence of what we think of as an intelligent being

2842
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,800
 i tend to like the

2843
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:57,040
 thought experiment of

2844
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:00,239
 the organism like humans aren't the organisms

2845
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:04,960
 i like the notion of like richard dawkins and memes that

2846
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,920
 ideas themselves are the organisms

2847
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:15,199
 like that are just using our minds to evolve so like we're just like meat receptacles

2848
01:58:15,199 --> 01:58:22,080
 for ideas to breed and multiply and so on and maybe those are the aliens yes

2849
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:24,320
 so

2850
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,119
 jordan peterson

2851
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:26,239
 has a line says

2852
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:29,119
 you know you think you have ideas but ideas have you

2853
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:31,440
 yeah right good line which

2854
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:34,239
 and and then we know about the phenomena of groupthink

2855
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:37,840
 and there's so many things that constrain us

2856
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:41,280
 but i think you can examine all that and not be

2857
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:46,000
 completely owned by the ideas and completely sucked into groupthink

2858
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,679
 and part of your responsibility as a as a human

2859
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:51,599
 is to escape that kind of phenomena

2860
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:52,639
 which isn't

2861
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:56,880
 you know it's you know it's it's one of the creative tension things again you're constructed

2862
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,760
 by it

2863
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:59,199
 but you can still observe

2864
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:01,679
 it and you can think about it and you can make choices

2865
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:02,400
 about

2866
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,920
 to some level

2867
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,880
 how constrained you are by it

2868
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:11,440
 and you know it's useful to do that

2869
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,360
 and

2870
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:15,599
 but but at the same time

2871
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:17,280
 and it could be by doing that

2872
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:18,080
 that you know

2873
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:18,560
 the

2874
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,000
 the the group and society

2875
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:20,639
 you're

2876
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,080
 you're part of becomes collectively even more interesting

2877
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:28,159
 so you know so the outside observer will think wow

2878
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:31,040
 you know all these lexus running around with all these really independent

2879
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:32,000
 ideas have created

2880
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,679
 something even more interesting

2881
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:35,679
 and aggregate

2882
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:37,119
 so

2883
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:39,599
 so i so i don't know i'm

2884
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:41,760
 those are lenses to look at the situation

2885
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:45,360
 but i'll give you some inspiration but i don't think they're constrained

2886
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:51,280
 right you know as a small little quirk of history it seems like you're

2887
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:57,599
 related to jordan peterson like you mentioned he's going through some rough stuff now

2888
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:02,480
 is there some comment you can make about the the roughness of the human journey

2889
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:04,239
 the ups and downs

2890
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:06,159
 well

2891
02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:10,719
 i i became an expert in benzo withdrawal

2892
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:18,880
 like which is you took benzodiazepines and at some point they interact with gaba circuits

2893
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:23,119
 you know to reduce anxiety and do 100 other things like there's actually

2894
02:00:23,119 --> 02:00:24,560
 no known list of everything

2895
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,080
 they do because they interact with so many parts of your body

2896
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,840
 and then once you're on them you habituate

2897
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,520
 to them and you're you're

2898
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,560
 you have a dependency

2899
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,920
 it's not like you're a drug dependency we're trying to get high it's a

2900
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:36,800
 it's a

2901
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,800
 metabolic dependency

2902
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:42,480
 and then if you discontinue them

2903
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:45,280
 there's a funny thing called kindling

2904
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:46,560
 which is if you stop

2905
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:49,840
 them and then go you know you'll have a horrible it's for all symptoms

2906
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:53,199
 if you go back on them at the same level you won't be stable

2907
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:53,920
 and

2908
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,760
 that unfortunately happened to him

2909
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:56,719
 because it's so deeply

2910
02:00:56,719 --> 02:00:57,119
 integrated

2911
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:58,480
 into all the kinds of systems

2912
02:00:58,480 --> 02:00:59,199
 in the body it literally

2913
02:00:59,199 --> 02:00:59,679
 changes

2914
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:00,800
 the size and numbers

2915
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:01,280
 of

2916
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:02,080
 neurotransmitter

2917
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,840
 sites in your brain yeah

2918
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,520
 so there's a there's a

2919
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:10,239
 process called the ashton protocol where you taper it down slowly over two years

2920
02:01:10,239 --> 02:01:12,560
 to people go through that goes through unbelievable

2921
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:13,599
 hell

2922
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:16,719
 and what jordan went through seemed to be worse because

2923
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:20,239
 the on advice of doctors you know we'll stop taking these and take this

2924
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:21,360
 it was the disaster

2925
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:22,480
 and

2926
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:25,760
 he got some yeah it was pretty tough

2927
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,480
 um

2928
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,119
 he seems to be doing quite a bit better intellectually

2929
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:31,840
 you can see his brain clicking back together

2930
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:34,800
 i spent a lot of time with i've never seen anybody suffer so much

2931
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:39,599
 well his brain is also like this powerhouse right so i wonder

2932
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:41,040
 does a brain

2933
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:46,080
 that's able to think deeply about the world suffer more through these kinds of withdrawals like

2934
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:49,440
 i don't know i've watched videos of people going through withdrawal

2935
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:51,760
 they they all seem to suffer

2936
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,000
 unbelievably

2937
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,440
 and you know my work goes out to everybody

2938
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:01,599
 and there's some funny math about this some doctors said as best you can tell

2939
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:03,440
 you know there's the standard recommendations

2940
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:07,040
 don't take them for more than a month and then taper over a couple of weeks

2941
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:12,719
 many doctors prescribe them endlessly which is against the protocol but it's common

2942
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:14,320
 right and then

2943
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:18,480
 something like 75 percent of people when they taper it's you know

2944
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:20,719
 half the people have difficulty but 75

2945
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:22,000
 get off okay

2946
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:27,119
 20 have severe difficulty and 5 have life-threatening difficulty

2947
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:29,440
 and if you're one of those it's really bad

2948
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:32,560
 and the stories that people have on this is

2949
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:33,599
 heartbreaking

2950
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:34,239
 and

2951
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:34,800
 tough

2952
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,639
 so you put some of the fault that the doctors

2953
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:39,440
 that just not know what the hell they're doing oh no

2954
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,119
 it's hard to say it's

2955
02:02:41,119 --> 02:02:46,000
 it's one of those commonly prescribed things like one doctor said what happens is

2956
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,679
 if you're prescribed them for a reason and then you have a hard time getting off

2957
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:54,000
 the protocol basically says you're either crazy or dependent

2958
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,480
 and you get kind of pushed into

2959
02:02:56,480 --> 02:03:01,679
 a different treatment regime you're a drug drug addict or a psychiatric patient

2960
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:02,560
 and so

2961
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:03,440
 like one doctor

2962
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,400
 said you know i prescribed

2963
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:06,400
 me for 10 years thinking i was helping my patients

2964
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:06,960
 and i realized

2965
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:07,599
 i was really

2966
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:08,000
 harming

2967
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,520
 them

2968
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:14,480
 and you know the awareness of that is slowly coming up

2969
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:20,800
 the fact that they're casually prescribed to people is horrible

2970
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:23,679
 and it's bloody scary

2971
02:03:23,679 --> 02:03:26,080
 and some people are stable on them but they're on them for life

2972
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,080
 like once you know it's another one of those drugs

2973
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:29,119
 that

2974
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:32,480
 but benzo's long range have real impacts on your personality

2975
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,599
 people talk about the benzo bubble where you get disassociated

2976
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:38,000
 from reality and your friends a little bit

2977
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:43,040
 it's it's it's it's really terrible the mind is terrifying we were talking about how

2978
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,360
 how the infinite possibility of fun

2979
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:46,400
 but like

2980
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:51,199
 it's the infinite possibility of suffering too which is one of the dangers of

2981
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:55,040
 like expansion of the human mind it's like

2982
02:03:55,040 --> 02:04:01,679
 i wonder if all the possible huma experiences that a intelligent computer can have

2983
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:04,480
 is it mostly fun or is it mostly

2984
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,679
 suffering

2985
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:10,000
 so like if you if you brute force expand

2986
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,840
 the set of possibilities like are you going to run into some trouble

2987
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:16,480
 in terms of like torture and suffering and so on

2988
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,639
 maybe our human brain is just protecting

2989
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:19,520
 us from

2990
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:22,159
 much more possible pain and suffering

2991
02:04:22,159 --> 02:04:24,719
 maybe the space of pain

2992
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:30,639
 is like much larger than we could possibly imagine and that the world's in the balance

2993
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:32,639
 you know all the all the literature

2994
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:35,520
 on religion and stuff is you know the struggle between

2995
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:36,960
 good and evil is

2996
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,320
 is balanced versus

2997
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:41,440
 very finely tuned for reasons that are complicated

2998
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:44,719
 but that's a that's a long philosophical conversation

2999
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:46,560
 speaking of balance that's complicated

3000
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:50,320
 i i wonder because we're living through one of the more important

3001
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:53,679
 moments in human history with this particular virus

3002
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:55,679
 it seems like pandemics

3003
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:58,480
 have at least the ability to

3004
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:01,280
 kill off most of the human population

3005
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,880
 at their worst

3006
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:05,440
 and they're just fascinating because there's so many viruses

3007
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,440
 in this world there's so many i mean viruses

3008
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:09,920
 basically around the world in the sense that

3009
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,520
 they've been around very long time they're everywhere

3010
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:16,639
 they seem to be extremely powerful and they're just in a distributed

3011
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:19,440
 kind of way but at the same time they're not intelligent

3012
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,040
 and they're not even living

3013
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:25,520
 do you have like high level thoughts about this virus that

3014
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:30,320
 like in terms of you being fascinated about terrified or not somewhere in between

3015
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:33,280
 so i believe in frameworks right so

3016
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:36,159
 like one of them is the evolution

3017
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:38,880
 like we're evolved creatures right yes

3018
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:42,560
 and one of the things about evolution is it's hyper competitive

3019
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,760
 and it's not competitive

3020
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:47,679
 out of a sense of evil it's competitive in the sense of there's endless variation

3021
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:50,239
 in variations that work better when

3022
02:05:50,239 --> 02:05:54,719
 and then over time there's so many levels of that competition

3023
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:59,199
 you know like multi-cellular life partly exists because of

3024
02:05:59,199 --> 02:06:04,079
 you know the the competition between you know different kinds of life forms

3025
02:06:04,079 --> 02:06:08,000
 and we know sex partly exists to scramble our genes so that we have

3026
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,520
 you know genetic variation against

3027
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:15,920
 the invasion of the bacteria and the viruses and it's endless

3028
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:16,480
 like

3029
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:17,920
 i read some funny statistic

3030
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:18,800
 like the density

3031
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:19,440
 of viruses

3032
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:21,840
 and bacteria in the ocean is really high

3033
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:26,000
 and one third of the bacteria die every day because the virus is invading them

3034
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,920
 like one-third of them

3035
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:28,880
 wow

3036
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:32,560
 like like i don't know if that number is true but it was like it's

3037
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,719
 like there's like the amount of competition

3038
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:37,119
 and what's going on is stunning

3039
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:40,079
 and there's a theory as we age we slowly accumulate

3040
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:40,800
 bacterias

3041
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:41,679
 and viruses

3042
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:44,400
 and as our immune system kind of

3043
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:47,599
 goes down you know that's what slowly kills us and

3044
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:50,079
 it just feels so peaceful from a human perspective

3045
02:06:50,079 --> 02:06:54,239
 when we sit back and they're able to have a relaxed conversation

3046
02:06:54,239 --> 02:06:58,480
 and there's wars going on out there like right now

3047
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:02,560
 you're you're harboring how many bacteria and you know the ones

3048
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:04,239
 many of them are parasites

3049
02:07:04,239 --> 02:07:07,040
 on you and some of them are helpful and some of them are modifying

3050
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:09,360
 your behavior and some of them are

3051
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,079
 you know it's just really it's really wild

3052
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:16,079
 but you know this particular manifestation is unusual

3053
02:07:16,079 --> 02:07:17,679
 you know in the demographic

3054
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:19,360
 how it hit and the political

3055
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:21,199
 you know response that it engendered

3056
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:23,760
 and you know the health care response it engendered

3057
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:24,960
 and the technology

3058
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,880
 it's gendered it's kind of wild

3059
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:28,000
 yeah the communication

3060
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,840
 on twitter that it

3061
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:33,360
 every level all that kind of stuff at every single level yeah but but

3062
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,360
 what usually kills life the big extinctions

3063
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,960
 are caused by

3064
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,360
 meteors and volcanoes

3065
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:44,400
 that's the one you're worried about as opposed to human-created bombs

3066
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,239
 solar flares are another good one

3067
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:48,480
 you know occasionally solar flares hit the planet

3068
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,480
 so it's nature

3069
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:53,440
 oh yes yeah it's all pretty wild

3070
02:07:53,440 --> 02:08:01,360
 on another historic moment this is perhaps outside but perhaps within your

3071
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:04,480
 space of frameworks that you think about that just happened

3072
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:06,480
 i guess a couple weeks ago is um

3073
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:09,040
 i don't know if you're paying attention at all it's the

3074
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:11,360
 the game stop and

3075
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:14,079
 wall street bets

3076
02:08:14,079 --> 02:08:16,480
 so it's really fascinating

3077
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:18,480
 there's kind of a theme to this conversation

3078
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:22,000
 today because it's like you know that works the

3079
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,360
 it's cool how there's a large number of people in a distributed way

3080
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:34,560
 almost having a kind of fun we're able to take on the powerful elites

3081
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:39,840
 elite hedge funds centralized powers and overpower them

3082
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:43,360
 do you have thoughts i mean saga

3083
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:47,119
 i don't know enough about finance but it was like the elon

3084
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:51,360
 you know robin hood guy when they talked yeah what do you think about that

3085
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:54,159
 well the robin guy didn't know how the finance system worked

3086
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:55,040
 that was clear

3087
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:58,400
 right he was treating like the the people who settled the transactions

3088
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:59,840
 as a black box

3089
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:03,440
 and suddenly somebody called him up and said hey black box calling you

3090
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:04,239
 your transaction

3091
02:09:04,239 --> 02:09:04,639
 volume

3092
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:06,000
 means you need to put up three billion

3093
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:06,400
 dollars

3094
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:08,719
 right now and he's like i don't have three billion dollars

3095
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:10,400
 like i don't even make any money on these trades

3096
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,360
 why do i owe three billion

3097
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,400
 dollars while you're sponsoring

3098
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:13,119
 the trade

3099
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:15,520
 so so there was a set of abstractions

3100
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,639
 that

3101
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:19,280
 you know i don't think either like like now he understands

3102
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:21,679
 it like this happens in chip design like

3103
02:09:21,679 --> 02:09:23,760
 you buy wafers from tsmc

3104
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,520
 or samsung or intel

3105
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:25,840
 and

3106
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:26,880
 you know they say it works

3107
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:28,239
 like this and you do your design

3108
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:31,119
 based on that and then chip comes back and doesn't work

3109
02:09:31,119 --> 02:09:33,840
 and then suddenly you start having to open the black boxes

3110
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:34,880
 like the transistors

3111
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:38,000
 really work like they said you know what's the real issue

3112
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,199
 so

3113
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:41,599
 so the

3114
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:47,119
 there's a whole set of things that created this opportunity and somebody spotted it now

3115
02:09:47,119 --> 02:09:52,320
 people spot these kinds of opportunities all the times there's been flash crashes there's been

3116
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:55,280
 you know there's always short squeezes are fairly regular

3117
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:58,400
 every ceo i know hates the shorts

3118
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:00,159
 because they're they're manipulating

3119
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:03,760
 they're trying to manipulate their stock in a way that they make money

3120
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:08,800
 and you know deprive value from both this you know the company and the investors

3121
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:11,840
 so the fact that

3122
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:15,679
 you know some of these stocks were so short it's hilarious

3123
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:19,760
 that this hasn't happened before i don't know why and i don't actually know why

3124
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:23,280
 some serious hedge funds didn't do it to other hedge funds

3125
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:26,840
 and some of the hedge funds actually made a lot of money on this yes

3126
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,840
 so

3127
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:32,000
 my my guess is we know five percent of what really happened

3128
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,679
 and that a lot of the players don't know what happened and

3129
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:39,440
 the people who probably made the most money aren't the people that they're talking about

3130
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:40,960
 yeah that's

3131
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:42,480
 do you think there was something

3132
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:45,599
 i mean this is the this is the cool kind of

3133
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:47,920
 elon

3134
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,560
 you're the same kind of conversationalist

3135
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:56,159
 which is like first principles questions of like what the hell happened

3136
02:10:56,159 --> 02:11:00,880
 just very basic questions of like was there something shady going on

3137
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:02,079
 what

3138
02:11:02,079 --> 02:11:03,199
 you know who are the parties

3139
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:03,520
 involved

3140
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:04,079
 it's the basic

3141
02:11:04,079 --> 02:11:04,400
 questions

3142
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:04,880
 that everybody

3143
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:06,159
 wants to know about

3144
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:09,280
 yeah so like we're in a very hyper competitive

3145
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:13,360
 world right but transactions like buying and selling stock is a trust event

3146
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:16,079
 you know i trust the company representing themselves properly

3147
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:19,520
 you know i bought the stock because i think it's going to go up

3148
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:22,560
 i trust that the regulations are solid

3149
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:29,760
 now inside of that there's all kinds of places where you know humans over trust and

3150
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:34,480
 you know this this expose let's say some weak points in the system

3151
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:35,920
 i don't know

3152
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:38,400
 if it's going to get corrected i don't know if the

3153
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:41,599
 i don't know if we have close to the real story

3154
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:44,000
 yeah my suspicion is we don't

3155
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,199
 yeah and listen to that guy he was like a little wide-eyed

3156
02:11:47,199 --> 02:11:50,880
 about and then he did this and then they did that and it was like

3157
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:54,000
 i think you should know more about that your business than that

3158
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:58,560
 but again there's many businesses when like this layer is really stable

3159
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,560
 you stop paying attention to it

3160
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:04,400
 you pay attention to the stuff that's bugging you or new

3161
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:05,199
 you don't pay attention

3162
02:12:05,199 --> 02:12:07,920
 to the stuff that just seems to work all the time you just

3163
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,880
 you know the sky's blue every day california

3164
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:15,199
 and where once a while the continued rains there was like what do we do

3165
02:12:15,199 --> 02:12:17,119
 somebody go bring in the lawn furniture

3166
02:12:17,119 --> 02:12:17,760
 you know like

3167
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:18,239
 it's getting

3168
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:18,639
 wet

3169
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:19,840
 we don't know it's getting wet

3170
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,520
 yeah it doesn't it was blue for like 100

3171
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:23,360
 days and now it's

3172
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:24,480
 you know so

3173
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:25,040
 but

3174
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:29,360
 part of the problem here with vlad this the ceo of robin hood is the scaling

3175
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,840
 is that what we've been talking about is

3176
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:33,760
 there's a lot of

3177
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,840
 unexpected things that happen with the scaling and you have to be

3178
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:41,760
 i think the scaling forces you to then return to the fundamentals

3179
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:44,960
 well it's interesting because when you buy and sell stocks the scaling

3180
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:45,920
 is you know the stocks

3181
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:46,800
 only move in a certain

3182
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:47,199
 range

3183
02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:49,920
 and if you buy a stock you can only lose that amount of money

3184
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:53,760
 on the short short market you can lose a lot more than you can benefit

3185
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:55,760
 like it has a it has a weird

3186
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:59,119
 cost you know cost function or whatever the right word for that is

3187
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:02,719
 so he was trading in a market where he wasn't actually capitalized

3188
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:04,159
 for the downside

3189
02:13:04,159 --> 02:13:07,360
 if it got outside a certain range

3190
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:14,239
 now whether something the various has happened i have no idea but at some point the

3191
02:13:14,239 --> 02:13:19,040
 financial risk to both him and his customers was way outside of his financial capacity

3192
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:22,719
 and his understanding how the system work was clearly

3193
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:27,040
 weak or or he didn't represent himself i you know i don't know the person

3194
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:28,400
 when i listened to him nick

3195
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:32,239
 yeah it could have been the surprise question was like and then these guys called and

3196
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:33,920
 you know it sounded like

3197
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:36,159
 he was treating stuff as a black box

3198
02:13:36,159 --> 02:13:37,440
 maybe he shouldn't have

3199
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:38,480
 but maybe his whole pilot

3200
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:39,040
 expert somewhere

3201
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:41,119
 else and it was going on i don't i don't know

3202
02:13:41,119 --> 02:13:42,159
 yep

3203
02:13:42,159 --> 02:13:43,920
 i mean this is

3204
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:45,119
 this is one of the qualities

3205
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:45,520
 of

3206
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:48,960
 a good leader is under fire you have to perform

3207
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:52,960
 and that means to think clearly and to speak clearly

3208
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:56,159
 and he dropped the ball on those things because

3209
02:13:56,159 --> 02:14:01,920
 and understand the problem quickly learn and understand the problem like at this like

3210
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:04,960
 basic level like what the hell happened

3211
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:07,040
 and my guess is

3212
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:10,480
 you know at some level it was amateurs trading against

3213
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:14,800
 you know expert slash insiders slash people with you know special information

3214
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,800
 outsiders is insiders

3215
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,800
 yeah and the insiders

3216
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:22,800
 you know my guess is the next time this happens we'll make money on it

3217
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,960
 the insiders always win

3218
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:29,520
 well they have more tools and more incentive i mean this always happens like the outsiders

3219
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:33,199
 are doing this for fun the insiders are doing this 24 7.

3220
02:14:33,199 --> 02:14:35,520
 but there's numbers in the outsiders

3221
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:40,239
 this is the interesting thing well there's numbers on the insiders too

3222
02:14:40,239 --> 02:14:43,840
 like different kind of numbers different kind of numbers

3223
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:45,199
 but this could be a new era

3224
02:14:45,199 --> 02:14:45,599
 because

3225
02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:46,719
 i don't know at least i didn't

3226
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:47,040
 expect

3227
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:47,599
 that

3228
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:48,639
 a bunch of redditors

3229
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:50,159
 could you know there's

3230
02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:52,159
 you know millions of people who can get together

3231
02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:54,000
 the next one won't be a surprise

3232
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:59,040
 but don't you think the the the crowd the people are planning the next attack

3233
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:04,239
 we'll see but it has to be a surprise can't be the same game

3234
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:05,920
 as to the end

3235
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:06,880
 it could be there's

3236
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:09,520
 a very large number of games to play and they can be

3237
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:10,000
 agile

3238
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,079
 about it i don't know i'm not an expert

3239
02:15:12,079 --> 02:15:17,840
 right that's a good question how the space of games how how restricted is it

3240
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:22,560
 yeah and the system is so complicated it could be relatively unrestricted

3241
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:26,480
 and also like you know during the last couple financial crashes

3242
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:30,800
 you know what set it off was you know sets of derivative events where

3243
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:33,520
 you know the you know nasim talibs

3244
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:37,199
 you know thing is they're they're they're trying to lower

3245
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:38,560
 volatility

3246
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:41,520
 in the short run but creating tail events

3247
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:45,360
 and systems always evolve towards that and then they always crash like

3248
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,040
 the gas curve is the

3249
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:47,760
 you know

3250
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:48,800
 star low

3251
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:49,599
 ramp

3252
02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:50,320
 plateau

3253
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:51,360
 crash

3254
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:54,400
 it's 100 effective

3255
02:15:54,400 --> 02:16:00,560
 in the long run let me ask you some advice to put on your profound hat

3256
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:01,440
 what

3257
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:03,920
 there's a bunch of young folks to listen to this

3258
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:07,679
 thing for no good reason whatsoever

3259
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:15,440
 undergraduate students maybe high school students maybe just young folks a young at heart looking for

3260
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:16,480
 the next steps to taking

3261
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:17,280
 life what advice

3262
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:18,800
 would you give to a young person

3263
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:19,199
 today

3264
02:16:19,199 --> 02:16:19,760
 about

3265
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:20,960
 life

3266
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:23,760
 maybe career but also life in general

3267
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,920
 get good at some stuff

3268
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:28,159
 well get to know yourself right

3269
02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:30,239
 get good at something that you're actually interested

3270
02:16:30,239 --> 02:16:33,280
 in you have to love what you're doing to get good at it

3271
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,200
 you really got to find that don't waste all your time

3272
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,160
 doing stuff that's just

3273
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:36,558
 boring

3274
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:37,120
 or bland

3275
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,879
 or numbing

3276
02:16:38,879 --> 02:16:43,439
 right don't let old people screw you

3277
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:48,080
 well people get talked into doing all kinds of and wrapping up huge student

3278
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:50,080
 you know student debts and

3279
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:52,000
 like there's so much crap going on

3280
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,920
 you know and then it drains your time

3281
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:54,478
 and drains

3282
02:16:54,478 --> 02:16:55,519
 yeah the eric weinstein

3283
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:58,000
 you know thesis that you know the older generation

3284
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,040
 will let go

3285
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:01,120
 yeah and they're trapping all the young people

3286
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:04,879
 i think there's some truth to that yeah sure

3287
02:17:04,879 --> 02:17:08,558
 just because you're old doesn't mean you stop thinking i know lots of really original

3288
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:10,160
 yeah old people

3289
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:11,840
 i'm an old person

3290
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:13,280
 so

3291
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:14,080
 um

3292
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:18,240
 but you have to be conscious about it you can fall into the ruts and then

3293
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:20,318
 do that you know when i hear

3294
02:17:20,318 --> 02:17:24,318
 young people spouting opinions that sounds like they come from fox news or cnn

3295
02:17:24,318 --> 02:17:26,000
 i think they've been captured by

3296
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:26,638
 groupthink

3297
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:28,000
 and memes and

3298
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,080
 supposed to think on their own you know so

3299
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:33,359
 if you find yourself repeating what everybody else is saying

3300
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:35,679
 you're not going to have a good life

3301
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:38,398
 like like that's not how the world works it may be

3302
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:42,558
 it seems safe but it puts you at great jeopardy for

3303
02:17:42,558 --> 02:17:44,000
 well being boring

3304
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,280
 or unhappy

3305
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:48,879
 or how long did it take you to find the thing that

3306
02:17:48,879 --> 02:17:50,398
 you have fun with

3307
02:17:50,398 --> 02:17:52,000
 well i don't know

3308
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,160
 i've been a fun person since i was pretty little

3309
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:54,799
 so everything

3310
02:17:54,799 --> 02:17:56,638
 i've gone through a couple periods of depression

3311
02:17:56,638 --> 02:17:57,920
 in my life

3312
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:02,478
 for a good reason or for the reason that doesn't make any sense

3313
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:04,558
 yeah

3314
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:08,638
 like some some things are hard like you go through mental transitions in high school

3315
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:11,599
 i was really depressed for a year and

3316
02:18:11,599 --> 02:18:14,959
 i think i had my first midlife crisis at 26.

3317
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:17,359
 i kind of thought is this all there is like i was

3318
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:19,920
 working at a job that i loved

3319
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:23,280
 and but i was going to work and all my time is consumed

3320
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:27,920
 what's what's the escape out of that depression what's the answer to is is

3321
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:30,318
 this all there is well

3322
02:18:30,318 --> 02:18:30,558
 a

3323
02:18:30,558 --> 02:18:31,040
 friend of mine

3324
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:31,280
 i

3325
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:32,240
 asked him because he was working

3326
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:32,638
 his ass

3327
02:18:32,638 --> 02:18:33,359
 off i said what's your

3328
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:33,840
 work-life

3329
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:34,478
 balance

3330
02:18:34,478 --> 02:18:35,200
 like

3331
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:36,160
 like there's

3332
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:40,080
 you know work friends family personal time

3333
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:44,638
 are you bouncing in that and he said work 80 family 20 and i try to

3334
02:18:44,638 --> 02:18:47,359
 i try to find some time to sleep

3335
02:18:47,359 --> 02:18:51,679
 like there's no personal time there's no passion at a time

3336
02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:54,558
 because you know young people are often passionate about work

3337
02:18:54,558 --> 02:18:56,799
 so and i was certainly like that

3338
02:18:56,799 --> 02:19:01,679
 but you need to you need to have some space in your life for different things

3339
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:04,638
 and that's that creates

3340
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:06,718
 that makes you resistant to the whole

3341
02:19:06,718 --> 02:19:08,478
 the the the dip

3342
02:19:08,478 --> 02:19:10,478
 the the deep dips into depression

3343
02:19:10,478 --> 02:19:13,519
 kind of thing yeah well you have to get to know yourself too meditation

3344
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:14,398
 helps

3345
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:16,000
 some physical

3346
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,398
 something physically intense helps

3347
02:19:18,398 --> 02:19:19,840
 like the weird

3348
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:23,599
 places your mind goes kind of thing like and why does it happen

3349
02:19:23,599 --> 02:19:25,519
 why do you do what you do like triggers

3350
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:26,080
 like

3351
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:28,799
 the things that cause your mind to go to different places

3352
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:31,120
 kind of thing or

3353
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:31,679
 events

3354
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:32,080
 like

3355
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:32,799
 you're upbringing

3356
02:19:32,799 --> 02:19:35,599
 for better or worse whether your parents are great people or not

3357
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:36,000
 you

3358
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,040
 you

3359
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:38,799
 you come into

3360
02:19:38,799 --> 02:19:42,240
 you know adulthood with all kinds of emotional burdens

3361
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:45,679
 yeah and you can see some people are so bloody stiff and restrained

3362
02:19:45,679 --> 02:19:47,599
 and they think you know the world's fundamentally

3363
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:48,880
 negative

3364
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:50,720
 like you maybe

3365
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:56,160
 you have unexplored territory yeah or you're afraid of something

3366
02:19:56,160 --> 02:20:01,520
 definitely afraid of quite a few things then you gotta go face them

3367
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:05,040
 like like what's the worst thing that happened you're going to die right

3368
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:09,600
 like that's inevitable you might as well get over that like a 100 death rate

3369
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:14,399
 like people were worried about the virus but you know the human condition is pretty deadly

3370
02:20:14,399 --> 02:20:16,240
 there's something about embarrassment

3371
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:18,960
 let's see i've competed a lot in my life and

3372
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:20,000
 i think the

3373
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,840
 if i'm too introspected

3374
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:24,399
 the thing i'm most afraid of is

3375
02:20:24,399 --> 02:20:26,000
 being like humiliated

3376
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,040
 i think nobody cares about that look you're the only

3377
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:31,520
 person on the planet zack cares about you being humiliated

3378
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:32,160
 exactly

3379
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:33,600
 it's like a really useless

3380
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:34,640
 thought

3381
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:36,240
 it is

3382
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:38,000
 it's like

3383
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,439
 you're all humiliating

3384
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:39,840
 something

3385
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:40,080
 happened

3386
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:40,960
 in a room full of people

3387
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:41,439
 and they walk

3388
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:42,240
 out and they didn't think

3389
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:42,479
 about

3390
02:20:42,479 --> 02:20:42,880
 it one

3391
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,200
 more

3392
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:43,600
 second

3393
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:44,160
 or maybe

3394
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:44,479
 somebody

3395
02:20:44,479 --> 02:20:45,040
 told a funny

3396
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:45,680
 story to somebody

3397
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:46,560
 else and then it just

3398
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:46,880
 hates

3399
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:47,439
 it throughout

3400
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:48,640
 yeah

3401
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:51,920
 yeah now i know it too i mean

3402
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:55,439
 i've been really embarrassed about that nobody cared about myself

3403
02:20:55,439 --> 02:20:59,439
 yeah it's a funny thing so the worst thing ultimately is just

3404
02:20:59,439 --> 02:21:00,880
 yeah but that's the cage

3405
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:02,479
 and then you have to get out of it yeah

3406
02:21:02,479 --> 02:21:05,680
 like once you here's the thing once you find something like that

3407
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:08,800
 you have to be determined to break it

3408
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:10,960
 because otherwise you'll just you know slowly accumulate

3409
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:13,359
 that kind of junk and then you die as a

3410
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:15,359
 you know a mess

3411
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:15,920
 so

3412
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:17,040
 the goal i guess it's so

3413
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,000
 it's like a cage with

3414
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
 a cage i guess the goal is to die in the biggest

3415
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,399
 possible

3416
02:21:20,399 --> 02:21:21,760
 cage

3417
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:25,359
 well ideally you have no cage

3418
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:28,319
 people do get enlightened i've got a few it's great

3419
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:31,920
 you found a few there's a few out there i don't know of course

3420
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:33,439
 um

3421
02:21:33,439 --> 02:21:35,120
 either that or they have you know it's a great sales

3422
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:36,080
 pitch there's like enlightened

3423
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:36,399
 people

3424
02:21:36,399 --> 02:21:38,080
 writing books and doing all kinds of stuff

3425
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:39,359
 it's a good way to sell a book

3426
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:39,840
 i'll

3427
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:41,840
 give you that you've never met somebody

3428
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:42,720
 you just thought

3429
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:45,040
 they just killed me like this

3430
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:47,760
 like like mental clarity humor

3431
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:48,720
 no 100

3432
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:51,920
 but i just feel like they're living in a bigger cage they have their own

3433
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:54,960
 they don't think there's a cage they're still okay you secretly

3434
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:55,520
 suspect

3435
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:57,120
 there's always the case

3436
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:05,760
 ah there's no there's nothing outside the the unit there's nothing outside the cage [laughter]

3437
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:12,960
 you were you worked in a bunch of companies you led a lot of amazing teams

3438
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:15,200
 um i don't

3439
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:19,359
 i'm not sure if you've ever been like at the early stages of a startup

3440
02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:24,080
 but do you have advice for

3441
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:28,240
 somebody that wants to do a startup or build a company

3442
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:33,600
 like build a strong team of engineers that are passionate just want to

3443
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:38,880
 solve a big problem like is there more specifically on that point

3444
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:41,200
 well you have to be really good at stuff

3445
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:43,200
 if you're going to lead and build a team

3446
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,960
 you better be really interested in how people work and think

3447
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:47,600
 the people

3448
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:48,399
 or the solution

3449
02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:49,120
 to the problems

3450
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:49,760
 there's two things

3451
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:50,080
 right

3452
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:51,040
 one is how people

3453
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:51,359
 work

3454
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:52,880
 and the other is

3455
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:53,600
 actually

3456
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:55,120
 there's there's quite a few successful

3457
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:58,240
 startups it's pretty clear the founders don't know anything about people

3458
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:03,120
 like the idea was so powerful that it propelled them but i suspect somewhere

3459
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:06,800
 early they they hired some people who understood people

3460
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:09,600
 because people really need a lot of care and feeding to collaborate

3461
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:13,359
 and work together and feel engaged and work hard

3462
02:23:13,359 --> 02:23:16,800
 you know like startups are all about out producing other people

3463
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:19,680
 like you're nimble because you don't have any legacy

3464
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:20,640
 you don't have

3465
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:25,359
 you know a bunch of people who are depressed about life you know just showing up

3466
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:28,800
 you know so startups have a lot of advantages that way

3467
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:33,520
 you know do you like the the steve jobs talked about this idea of

3468
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:36,240
 a players and b players i don't know if you

3469
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:37,920
 know this formulation yeah no

3470
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:44,840
 um organizations that get taken over by pb player leaders

3471
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:50,560
 often really underperform their rc players that said in big organizations

3472
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:50,880
 there's

3473
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:52,160
 so much work to do

3474
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:52,479
 like

3475
02:23:52,479 --> 02:23:53,920
 and there's so many people who are happy

3476
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:55,760
 to do what you know like the leadership

3477
02:23:55,760 --> 02:24:00,240
 or the big idea people who can see it consider menial jobs

3478
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:04,000
 and you know you need a place for them but you need an organization that

3479
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:08,399
 both values and rewards them but doesn't let them take over the leadership of it

3480
02:24:08,399 --> 02:24:12,399
 got it but so so you need to have an organization that's resistant to that but

3481
02:24:12,399 --> 02:24:14,240
 in the early days

3482
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:17,600
 the the notion with with steve was that

3483
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:19,760
 like one b player in a room

3484
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:22,080
 of a players will be like destructive

3485
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:27,200
 to the whole i've seen that happen i i don't know if it's like always true

3486
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:27,760
 like

3487
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:29,680
 you know you you run into people who are clearly

3488
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:31,040
 b players but they think they're very

3489
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:31,359
 players

3490
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:32,479
 and so they have a loud voice

3491
02:24:32,479 --> 02:24:33,040
 at the table

3492
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:34,240
 and they make lots of demands

3493
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:34,880
 for that

3494
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:37,280
 but there's other people are like i know who i am

3495
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:39,600
 i just want to work with you know cool people and cool

3496
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:41,680
 and just tell me what to do and i'll go get it done

3497
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:45,680
 yeah you know so you have to again this is like people skills like

3498
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:49,600
 what kind of person is it you know i've met some really great

3499
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:51,120
 people i love working with

3500
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:53,520
 that weren't the biggest id people the most productive

3501
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:56,000
 ever but they show up they get it done

3502
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:01,040
 you know they create connection and community that people value it's it's

3503
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:04,960
 it's pretty diverse so i don't think there's a recipe for that

3504
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:06,800
 i gotta ask you about love

3505
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:08,560
 i heard you're into this now

3506
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:09,840
 into this love thing yeah

3507
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:13,200
 is this is you think this is your solution to your depression

3508
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:15,280
 no i'm just trying to like you said the enlightened

3509
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:16,000
 people on occasion

3510
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,680
 trying to sell a book i'm writing a book about

3511
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:19,200
 love you're writing a book about me no

3512
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:19,760

3513
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:22,240

 friend of mine he's gonna

3516
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:28,960
 somebody said you should really write a book about your you know your management philosophy

3517
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:34,880
 he said it'd be a short book [laughter]

3518
02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:37,840
 well that one was all pretty well

3519
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:42,319
 what role do you think love family friendship all that kind of

3520
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:47,439
 human stuff play in a successful life you've been exceptionally successful in the space of

3521
02:25:47,439 --> 02:25:53,120
 like running teams building cool in this world creating some amazing things

3522
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:56,479
 what did love get in the way did love help

3523
02:25:56,479 --> 02:26:02,080
 the family get in the way to family help friendship you want the engineer's answer

3524
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:05,760
 please so but first love is functional right

3525
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:10,800
 it's functional in what way so we habituate ourselves to the environment

3526
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:13,840
 and actually jordan told me jordan peterson told me this line

3527
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:14,319
 so

3528
02:26:14,319 --> 02:26:16,319
 you go through life and you just get used to everything

3529
02:26:16,319 --> 02:26:16,640
 except

3530
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:17,920
 for the things you love

3531
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:20,000
 they they remain new

3532
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,399
 like this is really useful for you know

3533
02:26:22,399 --> 02:26:25,920
 like like other people's children and dogs and you know trees

3534
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:30,880
 you just don't pay that much attention to your own kids you monitor them really closely

3535
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:35,200
 like and if they go off a little bit because you love them if you're smart

3536
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:41,439
 if you're going to be a successful parent you notice it right away you don't habituate

3537
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:42,479
 to

3538
02:26:42,479 --> 02:26:44,160
 just things you love

3539
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:47,439
 and if you want to be successful at work if you don't love it

3540
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:50,160
 you're not going to put the time in somebody else

3541
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:52,160
 it's somebody else that loves it like

3542
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:53,680
 because it's new and interesting

3543
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:57,439
 and that lets you go to the next level

3544
02:26:57,439 --> 02:27:01,600
 so it's the thing it's just a function that generates newness and novelty

3545
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:04,560
 and surprises you know those kind of things

3546
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:05,600
 it's really interesting

3547
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,200
 but and there's people

3548
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:08,960
 figured out lots of you know frameworks

3549
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:10,240
 for this you know like

3550
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:10,880
 like humans

3551
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:12,319
 seem to go in partnership

3552
02:27:12,319 --> 02:27:16,479
 go through you know interest like somebody suddenly somebody's interesting

3553
02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:20,000
 and then you're infatuated with them and then you're in love with them

3554
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,359
 and then you you know

3555
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:22,160
 different people have

3556
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:22,479
 ideas

3557
02:27:22,479 --> 02:27:23,120
 about parental

3558
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:23,439
 love

3559
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:24,000
 or mature

3560
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:24,399
 love

3561
02:27:24,399 --> 02:27:25,600
 like you go through a cycle

3562
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:26,399
 of that

3563
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:31,200
 which keeps us together and it's you know super functional for creating families and

3564
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:32,479
 and creating communities

3565
02:27:32,479 --> 02:27:36,880
 and making you support somebody despite the fact that you don't love them

3566
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:39,520
 like and

3567
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:41,120
 and

3568
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:44,080
 it can be really enriching

3569
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:49,600
 you know now in the work life balance scheme if all you do is work

3570
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:51,200
 you think you may be optimizing

3571
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,160
 your work potential

3572
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:55,760
 but if you don't love your work or you don't have

3573
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:59,120
 family and friends and things you care about

3574
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:01,760
 your brain isn't well balanced

3575
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:02,399
 like everybody

3576
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:03,120
 knows the experience

3577
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,160
 of you works on something

3578
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:05,920
 all week you went home and took two days

3579
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:06,800
 off and you came back

3580
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:07,600
 in

3581
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:09,840
 the odds of you working on the thing you

3582
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:12,640
 picking up right where you left off is zero

3583
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:16,000
 your brain refactored it

3584
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:19,040
 but being in blood is great

3585
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:22,000
 it's like changes the color of the light in the room

3586
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:27,760
 it creates a spaciousness that's that's different it helps you think

3587
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:29,439
 it makes you strong

3588
02:28:29,439 --> 02:28:30,160
 buckowski

3589
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:36,160
 had this line about love being a fog that dissipates with the first light of reality

3590
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:39,520
 in the morning it's that's depressing i think it's the other way around

3591
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:40,240
 it lasts

3592
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:42,000
 well you like you said it's a function

3593
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,319
 it's a thing that just be the light that actually

3594
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:44,960
 enlivens

3595
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:49,200
 your world and creates the interest and the power and the strength and the

3596
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:51,520
 to go do something

3597
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:52,800
 well it's like

3598
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:54,160
 like that sounds like

3599
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:56,640
 you know there's like physical love emotional of intellectual

3600
02:28:56,640 --> 02:29:00,960
 love spiritually yeah right isn't it all the same thing kind of nope

3601
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:03,920
 you should differentiate that maybe that's your problem

3602
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,120
 in your book you should you should refine that a little bit different chapters

3603
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:07,920
 yeah there's different

3604
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:08,319
 chapters

3605
02:29:08,319 --> 02:29:09,120
 what's that what's

3606
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:09,439
 these

3607
02:29:09,439 --> 02:29:10,399
 are there aren't these

3608
02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:11,120
 are just different

3609
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:11,439
 layers

3610
02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:12,240
 of the same thing

3611
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:13,280
 the stack

3612
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:15,600
 no physical people people

3613
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:19,520
 some people are addicted to physical love and they have no idea about emotional or intellectual

3614
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:21,680
 love

3615
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:23,760
 i don't know if they're the same thing so i think they're different

3616
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:24,080
 that's

3617
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:25,200
 true they could be different

3618
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:25,520
 it'd

3619
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:25,840
 be

3620
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:26,160
 it

3621
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:26,479
 i

3622
02:29:26,479 --> 02:29:27,120
 guess the ultimate

3623
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:28,880
 goal is for it to be the same well if you want something

3624
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:30,080
 to be bigger and interesting

3625
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,439
 you should find all its components

3626
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:32,160
 and differentiate

3627
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:34,640
 them not climb it together

3628
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:38,000
 people do this all the time they yeah and the modularity

3629
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,439
 get your abstraction layers right and then you can you have room to breathe

3630
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:44,479
 well maybe you can write the forward to my book about love

3631
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:45,840
 yeah or the afterwards

3632
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:49,200
 and the after you really tried

3633
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:53,680
 i feel like lex has made a lot of progress in this book but

3634
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:56,560
 well you have things in your life that you love yeah

3635
02:29:56,560 --> 02:30:01,200
 yeah you know so and they are you're right they're modular it's

3636
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:03,120
 and you can have multiple

3637
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:07,359
 things with the same person or the same thing and yeah but

3638
02:30:07,359 --> 02:30:11,200
 yeah depending on the moment of the day yeah there's

3639
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:12,399
 like what bukowski

3640
02:30:12,399 --> 02:30:13,040
 described

3641
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:16,160
 as that moment you go from being in love to having

3642
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:17,840
 a different kind of love yeah

3643
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:19,359
 right and that's the transition

3644
02:30:19,359 --> 02:30:20,240
 but when it happens

3645
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:23,439
 if you read the owner's manual and you believed it you would have said

3646
02:30:23,439 --> 02:30:25,200
 oh this happened

3647
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:28,800
 it doesn't mean it's not love it's a different kind of love

3648
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,560
 but

3649
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:33,520
 but maybe there's something better about that as you grow old if

3650
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:35,520
 all you do is regret

3651
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:38,479
 how you used to be it's sad

3652
02:30:38,479 --> 02:30:41,359
 right you should have learned a lot of things because

3653
02:30:41,359 --> 02:30:43,840
 like who you can be in your future self is

3654
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:47,520
 is actually more interesting and possibly delightful than

3655
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:52,880
 you know being a mad kid in love with the the next person like

3656
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:55,600
 that's super fun when it happens but

3657
02:30:55,600 --> 02:31:00,960
 that's that's you know five percent of the possibility

3658
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:03,760
 yeah that's right that there's a lot more fun to be had

3659
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:05,200
 in the long lasting stuff

3660
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:07,520
 yeah or meaning you know if that's me

3661
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:09,120
 which is a kind of fun

3662
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:12,720
 it's a deeper kind of fun and it's surprising you know that's

3663
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:15,840
 like like the thing i like is surprises

3664
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:18,800
 you know and you just never know what's gonna happen

3665
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:19,280
 yeah

3666
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:20,479
 but you have to look carefully

3667
02:31:20,479 --> 02:31:22,080
 and you have to work at it you have to think about

3668
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:22,560
 it and

3669
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:23,840
 you know it's

3670
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:25,439
 yeah you have to see the surprises

3671
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:28,160
 when they happen right you have to be looking for it

3672
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:29,760
 from the branching perspective

3673
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:33,359
 you mentioned regrets

3674
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:38,000
 do you have regrets about your own trajectory oh yeah of course

3675
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:43,040
 yeah some of it's painful but you want to hear the painful stuff

3676
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:46,720
 i'd say like in terms of working with people

3677
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:50,560
 when people did say stuff i didn't like especially if it was a bit nefarious

3678
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:53,520
 i took it personally and i also

3679
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:55,760
 felt it was personal about them

3680
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:59,520
 but a lot of times like humans are you know most humans are a mess

3681
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:02,000
 right and then they act out and they do stuff

3682
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,680
 and i this psychologist

3683
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,920
 i heard a long time ago said

3684
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:09,040
 you tend to think somebody does something to you

3685
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:09,359
 but

3686
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:10,800
 really what they're doing is they're doing

3687
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:11,520
 what they're doing

3688
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,200
 while they're in front of you

3689
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:15,359
 it's not that much about you

3690
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:20,240
 yeah right and as i got more interested in

3691
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:24,960
 you know when i work with people i think about them and probably analyze them

3692
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:28,880
 and understand them a little bit and then when they do stuff i'm way less surprised

3693
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:32,160
 and i'm wait you know and if it's bad i'm way less hurt

3694
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:34,000
 and i react way less

3695
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:37,040
 like i sort of expect everybody's got their

3696
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:40,880
 yeah and it's not about you it's not about me that much

3697
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:41,760
 it's like you know

3698
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:43,760
 you know you do something and you think you're embarrassed

3699
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:45,120
 but nobody cares

3700
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:48,479
 like and somebody's really mad at you at the odds of it being about

3701
02:32:48,479 --> 02:32:49,280
 you

3702
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:53,040
 yeah no they're getting mad the way they're doing that because of some pattern they learned

3703
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:55,439
 and you know and maybe you can help them

3704
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:56,479
 if you care enough about

3705
02:32:56,479 --> 02:32:57,040
 it but

3706
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:58,560
 or you could step you could see it coming

3707
02:32:58,560 --> 02:32:58,960
 and step

3708
02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:00,399
 out of the way

3709
02:33:00,399 --> 02:33:00,800
 like

3710
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:04,640
 like i wish i was way better at that i'm i'm a bit of a hothead

3711
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:05,920
 and and

3712
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:08,800
 you said with steve that was a feature not a bug

3713
02:33:08,800 --> 02:33:12,479
 yeah well he was using it as the counter force the orderliness

3714
02:33:12,479 --> 02:33:14,960
 that would crush his work well you were doing the same

3715
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:15,439
 yeah

3716
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:17,439
 maybe i don't think i don't think my

3717
02:33:17,439 --> 02:33:18,800
 my vision was big enough

3718
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:21,359
 it was more like i just got pissed off

3719
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:23,920
 and did stuff

3720
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:29,120
 i'm sure that's just yeah yeah you're telling me i don't know if it had the

3721
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:30,479
 it didn't have the amazing

3722
02:33:30,479 --> 02:33:30,800
 effect

3723
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:31,200
 of creating

3724
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:31,920
 the trillion dollar

3725
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:32,240
 company

3726
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:33,600
 it was more like i just got pissed

3727
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:35,200
 off and left

3728
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:36,880
 and or

3729
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:39,040
 made enemies that he shouldn't have been

3730
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:40,319
 yeah it's hard

3731
02:33:40,319 --> 02:33:43,600
 like i didn't really understand politics until i worked at apple

3732
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:46,000
 where you know steve was a master player of politics

3733
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,359
 and his staff had to be or they wouldn't survive them and

3734
02:33:49,359 --> 02:33:51,200
 it was definitely part of the culture

3735
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:54,399
 and then i've been in companies where they say it's political but it's all

3736
02:33:54,399 --> 02:33:58,640
 you know fun and games compared to apple and it's not that

3737
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:04,560
 the people apple are bad people it's just they operated politically at a higher level

3738
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:07,760
 you know it's not like oh somebody said something bad about somebody

3739
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:10,720
 somebody else which is most politics

3740
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:15,600
 it's you know they they had strategies about accomplishing their goals

3741
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:17,359
 sometimes you know

3742
02:34:17,359 --> 02:34:19,760
 over the dead bodies of their enemies

3743
02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:21,120
 you know

3744
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:22,640
 with some communication

3745
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:25,359
 yeah more game of thrones and sophistication

3746
02:34:25,359 --> 02:34:28,240
 and like a big time factor rather than a

3747
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:32,160
 you know well that requires a lot of control over your emotions i think

3748
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:35,520
 to do to have a bigger strategy in the way you behave

3749
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:37,359
 yeah and it's it's it's

3750
02:34:37,359 --> 02:34:38,000
 effective

3751
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,680
 in the sense that coordinating

3752
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:42,560
 thousands of people to do really hard things

3753
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:47,600
 where many of the people in there don't understand themselves much less how they're participating

3754
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:50,640
 yeah creates all kinds of

3755
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:52,560
 you know drama and problems

3756
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:55,680
 that you know our solution is political in nature

3757
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:56,640
 like how do you convince

3758
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:58,800
 people how do you leverage them how do you motivate

3759
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:01,120
 them how do you get rid of them how you know like there's

3760
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:02,319
 there's so many layers

3761
02:35:02,319 --> 02:35:04,399
 of that that are interesting

3762
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:08,479
 and even though some some of it let's say may be tough

3763
02:35:08,479 --> 02:35:10,840
 it's not

3764
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:12,160
 evil

3765
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:17,280
 unless you know you use that skill to evil purposes which some people obviously do but

3766
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:20,720
 but it's a skill set that operates you know and i wish i'd

3767
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:22,000
 you know i was interested

3768
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,720
 in it but i you know it was sort of like i'm an engineer

3769
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:26,640
 i do my thing

3770
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:31,280
 and you know there's there's times when i could have way bigger impact

3771
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:33,120
 if i you know knew how to

3772
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:36,880
 if i paid more attention and knew more about that

3773
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:40,640
 about the human layer of the stack yeah that human political

3774
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:44,560
 power you know expression layer of the stack which is complicated

3775
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:45,120
 and there's lots

3776
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:45,680
 to know about

3777
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:45,920
 it

3778
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:46,399
 i mean people

3779
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:47,280
 are good at it are just

3780
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:49,280
 amazing

3781
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:52,840
 and when they're good at it and let's say

3782
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:54,160
 relatively

3783
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:58,479
 kind and oriented in a good direction you can really feel

3784
02:35:58,479 --> 02:36:03,520
 it can get lots of stuff done and coordinate things you never thought possible

3785
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:07,680
 but all people like that also have some pretty hard edges because

3786
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,439
 you know it's it's a heavy lift

3787
02:36:09,439 --> 02:36:13,040
 and i wish i'd spent more time with that when i was younger but

3788
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:17,520
 but maybe i wasn't ready you know i was a wide-eyed kid for 30 years

3789
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:21,920
 it's a little bit of a kid i know what do you hope

3790
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:25,120
 your legacy is when there's a

3791
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:27,040
 when there's a book like a hitchhiker's

3792
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:31,120
 guide to the galaxy and this is like a one sentence entry ball jim caller

3793
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:34,399
 from like that guy lived at some point

3794
02:36:34,399 --> 02:36:37,680
 there's not many you know not many people be remembered

3795
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:40,720
 you're one of the sparkling little

3796
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:42,479
 human creatures

3797
02:36:42,479 --> 02:36:44,720
 that had a big impact on the world

3798
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:48,399
 how do you hold you'll be remembered my daughter was trying to get

3799
02:36:48,399 --> 02:36:53,760
 she added my wikipedia page to say that i was a legend and a guru

3800
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:58,160
 but they took it out so she put it back in she's 15.

3801
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:02,640
 i think i think that was probably the best part of my legacy [laughter]

3802
02:37:02,640 --> 02:37:04,479
 she got her sister they were all excited

3803
02:37:04,479 --> 02:37:06,479
 they were like trying to put it in the references

3804
02:37:06,479 --> 02:37:07,439
 because there's articles

3805
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:09,280
 in that and they're telling you that

3806
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:11,520
 so the eyes of your kids your

3807
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:12,960
 legend

3808
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:18,319
 well they're pretty skeptical because they'll be better than that they're like dad

3809
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:19,359
 so yeah that's

3810
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:21,520
 that's stupid that kind of stuff is super fun

3811
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:24,399
 in terms of the big legends stuff anchor

3812
02:37:24,399 --> 02:37:28,399
 okay legacy i don't really care you're just an engineer

3813
02:37:28,399 --> 02:37:32,000
 no they've been thinking about building a big pyramid

3814
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:36,720
 so i had a debate with a friend about whether pyramids or craters are cooler

3815
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:38,160
 and you realize that

3816
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:38,800
 there's craters

3817
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:40,720
 everywhere but you know they built a couple of pyramids

3818
02:37:40,720 --> 02:37:44,960
 five thousand years ago in there and they remember you

3819
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:47,120
 think that would be foreign

3820
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:50,160
 those aren't easy to build oh i know

3821
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:54,399
 and they don't actually know how they built them which is great

3822
02:37:54,399 --> 02:38:00,479
 it's either agi or aliens could be involved so i think

3823
02:38:00,479 --> 02:38:03,520
 i think you're gonna have to figure out quite a few more things than just

3824
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:06,560
 the basics of civil engineering

3825
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:09,920
 so i guess you hope your legacy is pyramids

3826
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:12,319
 that would that would be cool

3827
02:38:12,319 --> 02:38:16,160
 and my wikipedia page you know getting updated by my daughter periodically

3828
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:18,560
 like those two things would pretty much make it

3829
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:19,359
 jim it's a huge

3830
02:38:19,359 --> 02:38:19,920
 honor talking

3831
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:20,479
 to you again

3832
02:38:20,479 --> 02:38:21,920
 i hope we talk many more times

3833
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:22,720
 in the future

3834
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:24,560
 i can't wait to see

3835
02:38:24,560 --> 02:38:27,680
 what you do with tennis torrent i can't wait to use it

3836
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:30,000
 i can't wait for you to revolutionize

3837
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:33,359
 yet another space in computing

3838
02:38:33,359 --> 02:38:37,280
 it's a huge honor to talk to you thanks for talking today this was fun

3839
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:41,680
