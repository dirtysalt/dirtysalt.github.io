13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,570
so can we start by um

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,770
having you tell us

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,170
uh

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,130
where and when you were born.

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,010
sure.

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,850
i was born in portland, maine back east in 1961.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,370
okay.

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,730
and um

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,930
can you tell us something about your family and how your family came to to maine

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,329
and

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:48,969
um

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,570
you know a little bit of their origin?

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:51,770
so

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:52,649
uh

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,530
i'm 100 % armenian. both of my parents are armenian and both of their parents

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,530
all of my grandparents came over in the early 1900s from armenia.

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:02,489
um

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,250
as part of the um

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,729
you know war with the turks. um

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,369
i should know more about that than i actually do.

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:09,850
uh

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,170
certainly heard a lot of stories about that when i was younger and mostly forgotten them. um

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,130
so anyway, my grandparents came across literally on the boat.

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:17,930
um

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,290
they had children.

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:19,930
uh

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,330
my

40
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,570
dad

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,650
my dad's family went to portland, maine. my mom's family went to worcester, massachusetts. somewhere along the way

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,970
they met each other. don't know how that happened.

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:31,850
um

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,689
they got married and i was her oldest son.

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,810
and was armenian spoken in the household when you were growing up? it was a little bit

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:39,930
uh

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,409
my parents were both fluent in armenia. armenian.

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,850
they would usually use it when they didn't want us kids to know what they were saying. um

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,530
but we knew a few of the words ourselves.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,530
not enough to converse with them, but we could usually figure out what they were saying. yeah.

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:53,930
yeah.

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,610
and what did your parents do?

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,850
so my mom was some kind of bookkeeper before she was married.

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,770
when she got married, i think she gave up that career, just became a full-time mom.

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,128
i came pretty early on after they got married and she had four boys

56
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,090
so we kept her busy.

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,209
um

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,730
my dad started out

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,610
um

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,129
basically

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,330
uh

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,290
well

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,489
when he was very young

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,890
like 10, 11, 12,

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,410
very poor family

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,610
obviously coming from armenia

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,569
in portland

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,770
and

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:26,489
uh

70
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:30,170
he worked when he was very young and tried to also go to school. so he would

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:30,730
in portland

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,010
he'd go down to the warf in the morning like 3 : 00 a.

73
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,010
m.

74
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,569
4 : 00 a.

75
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:34,569
m.

76
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,930
when the fishing boats were coming in.

77
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,330
he'd buy the fish from them, take them to the supermarkets and try to make some money doing that.

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,370
then he go do a paper route and just anything that he could

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:44,489
um

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,930
while still going to school.

81
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,730
uh

82
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,690
he then went into the army for world war ii. he was a machinist.

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,209
he was always good with his hands.

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,090
uh

85
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,050
he was literally in the action, not on the front lines, but right behind as a machinist.

86
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,569
he would go and fix tanks when they broke down or whatever else.

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,370
then he came back and he was basically

88
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,409
um

89
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:04,810
you know

90
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,970
he did jobs where he could use his hands for a while working in machine shops,

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,170
worked in a christmas ornament factory for a while

92
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,050
if i recall correctly

93
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,090
and then he basically became an entrepreneur in the late 50s

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,450
um

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,690
which of course is before i was born.

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,170
he saw an opportunity

97
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,450
or he saw a movement of drive-in theaters

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,690
and so he bought some land just outside of portland and built a drive-in theater

99
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,090
which exists today and is still a family business.

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:34,810
oh wow.

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,370
um

102
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:36,569
he

103
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:36,970
then

104
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,090
in the 60s

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,370
um

106
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,970
while also operating the um drive-in theater

107
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,370
bought a bowling alley out of bankruptcy and rebuilt that business and turned it around.

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,170
i spent many hours working in that bowling alley myself. um,

109
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,810
and then as my younger brothers were getting to the age

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,090
where they would go out

111
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,569
and get jobs

112
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:04,409
and stuff, he built a business beside the bowling alley, which was at

113
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:13,689
that time a retail boat business, which then got morphed into other fun toys like snowmobiles, motorcycles, things like

114
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:13,849
that,

115
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,570
which a couple my brothers still run. your dad's sort of entrepreneurial gene. um, it's interesting.

116
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,290
he started sort of as bluecollar worker. yes.

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:32,169
and but going back, do you know if there was an entrepreneurial history in the in the family in armenia? i mean, what pushed him toward business? um,

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,889
you know,

119
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,250
i i really don't know.

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:34,810
um,

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,330
i mean, it's

122
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,370
it was so long ago

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,530
and we lost him about 30 years ago, so it's been a while since i've heard any of the stories.

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,050
um

125
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,850
he

126
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,330
you know

127
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,009
he grew up in the age himself

128
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,850
where you had to work hard just to put food on the table

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,729
and he was helping put food on his family's table by doing that

130
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:55,210
and so i think you learned a lot from being in the army

131
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,410
especially in world war ii

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,090
and he was just always looking for ways to better his family's life and so i think

133
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,650
when he got to a certain point of um

134
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:07,289
affluence

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,169
if you will

136
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,169
i mean by the time i was born and growing up

137
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:11,530
we were definitely middle class.

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,570
um,

139
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,690
you know,

140
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,530
by working hard for many years, earning a salary, and i'm sure saving it like crazy.

141
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,650
um,

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,650
i think he thought he could take a little more risk, which was, you know,

143
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,410
building the drive-in theater to get beyond just having the regular 9-to-five type job. but he was

144
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,130
he was

145
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,289
he was not just a typical,

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,169
even though he started out as a blueco collar worker, he was not typical.

147
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:34,970
i remember

148
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,610
when i was younger, he taught me about how the stock market worked, which i thought was, you know,

149
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,250
even back then,

150
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,289
not many people even invested in the stock market. you had the wall street journal with the, you know,

151
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:47,770
the quotes in the back of the paper every single day.

152
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,050
it was only you got stock quotes, but he was into that and he'd show it to me.

153
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,850
so, he was interested in these other things beyond just the blue, the blue collar type stuff.

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,810
yeah. um, could you say a little bit about your brothers?

155
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,449
um, and what did they go in a technical direction

156
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,490
just sort of general? so, i'm completely different than my brothers.

157
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,130
um, they all went into the hands-on type businesses themselves.

158
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,009
the, in fact, the three i have three younger brothers.

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,330
they all went into the family business focusing on what would again start out as the boat business.

160
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,009
now, my father actually died shortly after that was set up and operating,

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,690
and he had always intended that that was something they could do with their lives,

162
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,810
and they ended up doing that

163
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,090
because he wasn't there to run anymore.

164
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,729
so they kind of learned trial by fire on some of that.

165
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,330
i had one brother who worked building yachts for a while up at a place in maine

166
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,850
and doing some other things like that.

167
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,850
but two of them still do that today. okay. and sort of characterize what the household was like

168
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,009
grow,

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,410
you know,

170
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,810
your home was like growing up. were dinner table conversations lively? sort of stylistically.

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,690
what was the family like? yeah, it was kind of crazy with four of us boys. uh

172
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:53,930
you know

173
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,250
in retrospect

174
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,449
um

175
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,729
in some sense it was a traditional armenian family in that

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,289
you know

177
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:04,490
my mom was just a great cook making traditional armenian foods

178
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,250
and so you know nothing

179
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,610
i would have appreciated at the time

180
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,009
of course

181
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,849
it was just dinner right

182
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,330
but

183
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,370
um

184
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:11,770
it was

185
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,449
it was something that i think was just really good for our upbringing

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,849
we always saw our dad as a hard worker

187
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,449
going in early in the morning

188
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:20,650
coming back late at night

189
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,610
um

190
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,889
when we were old enough to know he

191
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,810
when he was rebuilding the bowling alley.

192
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,770
um,

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,610
my brothers and i were all close.

194
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,449
we'd do things together all the time.

195
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,970
we lived in a neighborhood that was friendly.

196
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,090
doors were always unlocked.

197
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,770
we knew all the neighborhood kids.

198
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,849
we'd go outside on the street, play kickball.

199
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,650
we'd go down the street and find a big field and play baseball.

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,810
all those kinds of things. but this was

201
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,569
this was typical of the, you know,

202
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:43,610
60s and early 70s.

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,810
um

204
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,610
you know

205
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,210
many evenings we'd all stay home and watch tv around the the one

206
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,410
family tv like again

207
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,610
like everybody did with

208
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,050
sometimes with our tv dinners.

209
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,810
i became a huge star trek fan then

210
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,849
right when it came out.

211
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,129
and so if your brothers went into the family business

212
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,410
was there something

213
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,090
why did you go in a different direction? i was always the different one.

214
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,650
so when i was very young

215
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,009
they knew that i had an aptitude for math

216
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,210
is what it turned out

217
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,449
to be.

218
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:19,050
and so we'd all be in our station station station wagon driving along, the six of us, two parents

219
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,770
and four kids,

220
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,210
and my dad would be

221
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,370
th

222
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,770
would be shouting out math problems for me to solve.

223
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,690
and it would be, you know,

224
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,810
multiplication tables or things things like that.

225
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,650
but um

226
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,930
you know,

227
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,769
i was always the one that got good grades in school and homework was easy

228
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,490
and it was

229
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,929
it was more challenging for my brother.

230
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,130
so it was always new.

231
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,250
it was always informally known that i was kind of going to be the one to go off

232
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,970
and do something different.

233
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,690
yeah.

234
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,250
did you say you were the first? i was the oldest. yes.

235
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,050
okay. yes.

236
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,010
and any idea what where the aptitude for math came from? um,

237
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,649
you know,

238
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,490
i i think both my parents were pretty smart.

239
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,089
i can't say that either one of them was particularly good at math.

240
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,450
and i'm pretty sure that

241
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,170
by the time i got to high school, i was doing more advanced math than they knew about

242
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,410
cuz they never helped me with homework.

243
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,410
and i'm not sure they could have at the time.

244
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,450
um

245
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,730
it's just i just got that gene from somewhere. yeah.

246
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,089
and and i had a love for it.

247
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,330
and i think maybe that's part of the genetics, too. yeah.

248
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,890
and in that period in the 60s

249
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,970
when you're growing up, religion and politics in your household, were there? um

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,250
the

251
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,490
the religion was minimal. uh

252
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,089
my mom was somewhat religious from massachusetts. she was a regular churchgoer and but we'd all worn her down

253
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,209
and the extent of her religion at

254
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:44,330
that point was to try to get us to go to church for christmas

255
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:44,970
or easter,

256
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,810
something like that. um

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,330
minimal politics.

258
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:49,769
um

259
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,850
my dad leaned republican as a businessman. um

260
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,850
he did run once for some city alderman position

261
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,290
and he didn't know what he was doing and he didn't win

262
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,089
but he only did that once. yeah.

263
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,930
was your mother orthodox? um

264
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,250
so i don't even know.

265
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,810
my mother

266
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,649
i don't

267
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:13,130
i don't know.

268
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,089
there was an armenian church though. there was an armenian church. uh

269
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:18,649
well

270
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,290
it was

271
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,690
that was a big deal in worcester where she came from.

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,250
um,

273
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,010
in portland

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,370
there was an armenian community

275
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,209
which i think went to an armenian church or an armenian dominated church. i'm not sure

276
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,290
because that was not my thing. yeah.

277
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,730
and portland, maine in the 60s and 70s.

278
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,290
um,

279
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,170
it was big enough

280
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,890
that we wouldn't call it a small town, right? how would you describe portland in in

281
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,930
you know your community in portland when you were growing up? was it suburban or urban or?

282
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,130
so i grew up, we lived in portland

283
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,610
when i was born and we moved from portland to a neighboring town, westbrook,

284
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,250
when i was in second grade.

285
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,089
so i was maybe six or seven years old

286
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:05,690
and westbrook was definitely the suburbs even though it was only four miles away.

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,890
um, so i i consider myself as growing up in the suburbs.

288
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:09,850
and

289
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,810
when we got old enough, we had dirt bikes

290
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,810
and we literally drove the dirt bikes a quarter of a mile down the road to

291
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,690
where the trails were

292
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,570
and there were trails there. and and uh

293
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:20,970
it's

294
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,850
it's probably worth mentioning.

295
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,170
i mean, my brothers and i, i mean, me being more of an academic type person

296
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,130
had this exposure to all these things that academics normally don't get exposed to.

297
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,329
like we'd go dirt bike riding all the time over huge jumps,

298
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,209
you know,

299
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:38,810
doing crazy things. we look back, we don't know how we possibly survived.

300
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,769
with my brothers, we literally built a boat.

301
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,130
and it was a high-speed boat that went 90 to 100 miles an hour called a drag boat.

302
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,810
quartermile drag boat. and we

303
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,209
we

304
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:49,370
we

305
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,930
what the time would have been called mailordered a small fiberglass hull from somewhere in california

306
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:56,970
that got shipped out.

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:57,850
um

308
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,250
actually

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,769
that was our second boat. our first boat

310
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:05,050
we literally got plywood, we bought frames, plywooded it, and fiberglassed it ourselves.

311
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,089
that boat probably went 70 miles an hour

312
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,970
and my brother

313
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,490
and i were driving in it at one time

314
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,370
and i looked over the side and i it was blue.

315
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,490
i see this blue flap

316
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,370
and it was fiberglass starting to come off my motion.

317
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,930
i said we better go back quickly. when we got back it had all ripped off on the bottom

318
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,490
just the plywood.

319
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,130
so it was interesting growing up in a family like that

320
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,810
because of all these other experiences

321
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,050
that i think most of the people i know today never had anything like it.

322
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,370
yeah.

323
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:33,769
um

324
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,649
and somehow we all survived it. and um

325
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,170
in in your school in

326
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,570
i guess

327
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,930
in in the in the suburban in westbrook, you know,

328
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,570
science and technology,

329
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,810
did you get exposed to besides sort of math, was there,

330
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,370
you know,

331
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,930
would you call

332
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,170
i

333
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,130
i guess i would call it

334
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,610
um

335
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,930
sort of fallout from sputnik? did

336
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,130
did you have a science education in

337
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,089
yeah,

338
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,170
we had a science education and a math education.

339
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,649
you know, we're talking rural maine now

340
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,130
or semi not way out in the boonies, but we're near portland, so we've got good teachers.

341
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,089
we've got money for the schools. we've got good schools. um,

342
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,889
and to to me it was a good exposure.

343
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,850
westbrook had a very good school system. um,

344
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,209
and you know, it it today you go to a lot of schools

345
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:29,290
and there's all these different lanes and different tracks and you're on the advanced lane

346
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,970
where you're learning calculus as a junior or even earlier

347
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,370
sometimes

348
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,730
and the low lanes where you're kind of struggling to get algebra done.

349
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,970
we had one lane with some honors classes

350
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,850
and that was it

351
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,050
and that was only in math.

352
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,290
we we had that in some science too. but i feel i got good solid exposure to the sciences

353
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,329
which i liked and to math which i liked.

354
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,170
and i think

355
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,730
um

356
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,690
maybe

357
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,570
more importantly, i think i was lucky in that

358
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,130
the school

359
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,610
when i went to high school, actually in 8th grade,

360
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,570
as i was preparing to go to high school, the school knew that i had some good math aptitude.

361
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,730
and so they kind of singled me out

362
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,010
maybe along with a few other kids to show us a few extra things and give us extra stuff.

363
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,930
so, i remember so vividly

364
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,250
when i was in 8th grade at the or high school orientation, they pulled me in

365
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,250
and they said, " and we have a computer.

366
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,130
" and i didn't even know what a computer was.

367
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,490
okay? i didn't know what a calculator was, nothing like that.

368
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,690
but they had a pdp8e and i didn't know what it did.

369
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,209
it was just this box that had some flashing lights and i just fell in love with it.

370
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:40,410
i'm like, " high school is going to be so cool. " uh,

371
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,209
and it was.

372
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:42,810
and so, you know,

373
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,850
i had a a teacher.

374
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,250
i had the same math teacher for three years, mr.

375
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,490
small, sophomore, junior, and and senior years. he had an advanced

376
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,130
uh

377
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,370
honors

378
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,170
uh

379
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,449
math class, which i was in.

380
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,730
and he would do other things after school that would enrich us even more.

381
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,649
so, while i mean, we did most of our pdp programming after school, kind of come in

382
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:08,889
and use it, right, for as much as you want, and there only half of us ever wanted to.

383
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,089
um, but he would do other things like offer a special class, learn how to programming.

384
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,930
we had an oliveti cash register that could be programmed in some way i can't even remember now.

385
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,449
and and so i would get access to all these sort of extracurricular things.

386
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,850
so this is by now we're in the early 70s

387
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,810
or is this well,

388
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,930
now you're mid to late 70s.

389
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,570
late 70s. okay. so was the pdpa connected to the outside world with a modem or anything

390
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,889
or was it just a standalone? it was a standalone computer with two

391
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,570
asr33 teletypes, which is where the normal

392
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,690
the computer quote

393
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,089
computer science class, there was no computer science class.

394
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,290
there was a math class

395
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:54,649
where you learned a little bit about programming it and you always used just the asr33s, right? um,

396
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,089
but again, they would let me go after school and load up different things into the computer.

397
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,170
so, everyone's using basic. i would learn focal.

398
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,290
i would learn how to program from the switches on the front.

399
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,250
um,

400
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,130
and i would write

401
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:07,930
and

402
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,329
and obviously my regular basic programs, but i could just do all these other things just to learn extra stuff

403
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,490
that weren't wasn't even being taught in class.

404
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,610
focal was lower level

405
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,850
or what kind of a program? it was another programming language.

406
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,009
i i can't even remember any details, but it was basic like i think

407
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,529
but what what really excited me was programming at the switches. yeah.

408
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:27,930
you know,

409
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,009
you select the address, you select the data in,

410
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,570
you know,

411
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:30,730
load

412
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,769
and that was it

413
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:32,810
and then run when you're done.

414
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,529
so is that

415
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:33,690
even

416
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,730
is that machine or assembler?

417
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,250
what would you machine code?

418
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,209
machine code.

419
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:39,050
yeah, you wrote out the bits. you can go

420
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,410
each switch was a bit.

421
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,449
yeah, that was

422
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:41,930
that was

423
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,970
i thought that was the best.

424
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,610
that's great. that that's great. and so would you call it was mr. small?

425
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,050
what did you think of him as a mentor? did he take you under his wing kind of?

426
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,170
yeah, i think he did. yeah.

427
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,529
and it was the computer stuff,

428
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,329
you know,

429
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:55,449
he sponsored our math team.

430
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,130
i became the captain of the math team.

431
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,529
had tremendous fun with that. he gave us all this extra stuff to do outside of class.

432
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,570
um

433
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,209
yeah,

434
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,730
and interestingly through all this i thought i was going to become a statistician because i was told

435
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,130
um by they

436
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,569
they would have career people come in for career advice and they say

437
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:14,730
oh

438
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:14,890
you

439
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,250
you guys that are really good in math

440
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,530
you're going to become statistitians

441
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,770
and now that would be a perfect career choice

442
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,089
because you could have gone right into machine learning and be set.

443
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:24,809
yes.

444
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,890
well, what actually what happened was

445
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,370
i think it was either my junior year or senior year,

446
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,650
we got some new fangled data

447
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,929
general computer that had memory and our our programs could be stored on it.

448
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,929
and this was a whole new paradigm for us programming

449
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,850
and it had a much more advanced basic and other ways to interact with it

450
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,250
and you could

451
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,049
we could like

452
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:47,610
like write

453
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,890
like real games and stuff on it. and i remember

454
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:51,850
um

455
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,210
you know

456
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,090
when i got to the school

457
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,410
the pdp was already installed up and running

458
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,090
but for the data general

459
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,130
it took like a week for some technicians to come in

460
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,650
and set it up and test it and do whatever they did.

461
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,809
and i at that point i said that's what i'm going to be

462
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,650
that's going to be my job. one of those people. and did it

463
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,210
when you talk about

464
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,330
did it come with games

465
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,850
like was adventure on it

466
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,490
or were there

467
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,010
and were you taken with games at all or were you more interested just in this was before adventure.

468
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,049
um

469
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,730
there was some game on it.

470
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,929
i think it was a very basic game that would have been a teletype type game.

471
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,210
i don't remember what it was

472
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,850
but i did

473
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,809
i did love it. yeah,

474
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,970
i did love it. and did math take over your life? i mean were you a math geek

475
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,690
or were you were there other subjects in school that caught your interest? so,

476
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,490
um

477
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,530
i guess i was probably a math geek then

478
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,929
because the computer science part of it was very minor.

479
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,610
although i liked working with the computers much more, right? i also enjoyed some of the scientists.

480
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,610
i really liked physics for some reason. something about that really really resonated with me. um

481
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,490
but when i went to college then it wasn't about math. it was about computers

482
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,130
and i went to university of rochester

483
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,130
which didn't offer computer science program

484
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,650
knowing i wanted to do computers.

485
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,410
so i was still sort of a quote unquote math geek

486
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,570
because i had to get a degree in math.

487
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,130
that's all they offered.

488
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,289
there was no computer science degree. but i spent all my time working on computers. yeah.

489
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,690
and before we leave high school, um

490
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,650
um

491
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,730
outside pursuits

492
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:29,289
like

493
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:29,850
like sports

494
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,410
and reading, were

495
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,330
were you a jock at all

496
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,650
or

497
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,490
um

498
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,169
so that that's an interesting question

499
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,570
because in middle school

500
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,370
of all things

501
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,970
it was all intramural sports

502
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,570
and i literally played every intramural sport that you could play

503
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,890
and i won an award for that in my eighth grade

504
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,770
like most intramural sports played something like that.

505
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:52,970
um,

506
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:53,929
but

507
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,090
by the time i got to high school, i wasn't good enough at any of the sports except for bowling

508
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,289
because we own the bowling alley.

509
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,450
very good bowler. probably could have become a professional galloping bowler. um,

510
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,169
but i wasn't really good enough at the other sports.

511
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,929
and i think it was more i wasn't big enough to play the other sports.

512
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,330
so, i didn't do them in high school other than recreationally, occasionally with friends.

513
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,169
i then got bigger in college for some reasons.

514
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,330
my i had a big growth spurt in college

515
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,770
and i'm actually much more athletic now than i was in high school.

516
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,330
so never get into sports per se.

517
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,450
that having been said,

518
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,169
my family spent every summer on a lake nearby where we had a summer place.

519
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,330
and so i became a very good water skier

520
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,169
and you know

521
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,010
to some people riding dirt bikes and things like that is very much a sport

522
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,850
in that it takes a lot out of you

523
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,330
when you're out on trails and it's bouncing around and you're hitting jumps and doing corners and everything else.

524
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,730
yeah. so there was that aspect of it. did your dad's background as a machinist

525
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,970
carry over? did you get into tinkering

526
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,090
or was there a machine shop at the house? did he had a machine shop at the bowling alley?

527
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,650
and we'd always joke it was behind the machines.

528
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,010
you the front of the house and then you've got behind the machines

529
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,970
and usually the only time you go behind the machines is to fix them.

530
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,450
he would go behind the machines to build things

531
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,289
and so he would buy equipment, lathes or what you know

532
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,210
massive drill presses, whatever.

533
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,970
and during the day

534
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,409
when he's supposed to be working up front, he would have someone else work up front

535
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:24,010
and go back and just build things.

536
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,210
on the weekends, he'd sometimes bring us in and show us how to do things.

537
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,690
but i personally had no aptitude for that.

538
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,169
um

539
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,570
that was my brother's when we built that boat.

540
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,650
we built an engine from scratch.

541
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,169
we went down to a chevrolet dealer

542
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,330
and ordered a bare block from and they're like, " what? " yeah.

543
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,890
well, okay.

544
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,690
we'll order it for you.

545
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,490
and they shipped it to our house and we bought all the other parts and built the motor.

546
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,250
now, that was all my brothers

547
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,409
cuz they had much more aptitude for that than i did.

548
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:52,570
gotcha. but i got to see it all happen. yeah.

549
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,850
and um

550
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,530
in high school, did you have any like

551
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,570
did you have to

552
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,130
did you work in the family business or did you have jobs?

553
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,770
um

554
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,169
good question.

555
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:02,970
um

556
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,010
so

557
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,490
in high school, uh

558
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:06,890
on weekends

559
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,210
definitely work at the bowling alley, help out in the morning on saturdays and sundays

560
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,090
when it would get busy.

561
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,169
sometimes help out during the week

562
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:14,730
on the evening

563
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,929
when there's a big league night,

564
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:18,730
but not too much because we had school to worry about.

565
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,370
the first real paying job i had was after my senior year

566
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,929
just before college at a company paper mill called sd warren.

567
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,929
and um

568
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,210
i won if you can win a job, i won this job.

569
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,650
they gave this job to a couple students in recognition of some academic whatever.

570
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,610
um

571
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,169
they

572
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:43,530
they were the local company in westbrook

573
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,289
and so they gave a couple jobs and the job was outside crew.

574
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,370
and you may ask,

575
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,570
well, what's outside crew?

576
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,570
well, let me just say

577
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,929
when we didn't have our normal job to do, we would go and we would sweep parking lots.

578
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,770
so, so

579
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,650
uh

580
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,370
we would do things like you'd go on the daily run around the paper mill to empty the trash cans.

581
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,490
um

582
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:12,730
you would be called on occasion to clean out a sewer, which meant taking these massive hoses with these um water jets

583
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,490
that shot backwards, sticking them into the sewer, then firing it up

584
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,370
and just having it bore through the sewer.

585
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,490
and it's a paper mill. things

586
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,250
these things would get plugged a lot and you just do all these crazy things throughout the mill.

587
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,890
so that was my first real job, which was interesting

588
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,570
because the next summer i worked at the paper mill again, but i worked in the research department programming their computers.

589
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:33,770
cool.

590
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,370
and what kind of machines did you have? that was still in high school.

591
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,049
no, that was after one year of college. okay. after my my first my

592
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,169
after my freshman year.

593
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,570
and the corporate computers of that era, what what did you do

594
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,890
you remember what they were? they deck micomp computers

595
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,570
or um

596
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,210
we had

597
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,610
so this was interesting because it was in the research lab and it wasn't really programming the corporate computers.

598
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,650
we got to do research projects where

599
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:01,929
uh

600
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:02,970
for example

601
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,049
so they would make paper and then they would code it

602
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:06,809
and there's all these different codings you could do

603
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,929
and in the research lab

604
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:14,330
they had a smallcale prototype coder where they'd run experiments and they had a control system on it

605
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,850
that was unlike what was in the mill

606
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,690
because in the mill it just did one thing right

607
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,970
but we could fully program it to control the coder

608
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,650
and and mostly get readings off it to figure out temperatures and all kinds of other things

609
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,090
and i got to do the programming on that

610
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,970
which i think was probably controlled by digital equipment, probably pdp type stuff.

611
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,650
and i love that because i got to work on all these programs to control equipment.

612
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,049
i mean, control real equipment. i i could control digesttors that would cook the pulp as it's being prepared

613
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,690
um to turn into paper to control the temperatures and heat and everything else.

614
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,650
and i and i could control the computers to basically run and monitor this coder.

615
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,370
it was

616
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,890
it was very cool stuff. excellent.

617
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,650
and so in that period through high school, so personal computers were starting to show up in the world.

618
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,850
microcomputers were starting to show up in the world in 75, but it sounds like you sort of grew up on many computers.

619
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,049
and when you were in high school, did pcs show up at all in your um

620
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,090
you didn't see that issue of popular computing that had the mitsal tear on the

621
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,450
it wasn't popular computing, it was popular electronics that had mitsal out there on the cover

622
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,850
or have your own computer kind of thing.

623
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,890
that was not even on our radar screen.

624
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,890
the closest thing

625
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,610
that we had to

626
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:39,770
that was i had, you know, the top line top-of-the-line ti handheld pocket, not pocket, the big ti calculators back then.

627
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,289
programmable programmable.

628
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,929
they were programmable.

629
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,130
yes. yes.

630
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,169
so so

631
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,130
um

632
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:45,850
and then

633
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,529
in terms of of going to school, what determined where you went to to college? almost accidental.

634
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,650
um

635
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,890
so you know,

636
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,890
obviously neither of my parents had gone to college. um

637
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,169
they

638
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,090
they were not

639
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,090
they were smart. they were not highly educated.

640
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,130
um

641
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,529
which was not uncommon back then. um,

642
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:09,610
i had

643
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,049
i mean i was

644
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:13,929
i was literally going high school for me was day-to-day whatever,

645
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,090
right? i'm having fun on the math team.

646
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,929
i'm having fun programming computers and no long-term planning.

647
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,570
someone's telling me i'm going to be a statistician, but i'm thinking i'm going to be a computer technician

648
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,490
installing computers, whatever.

649
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,289
and i i realized at some point

650
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,490
that i was going to go to college, but i knew nothing about college.

651
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,570
i knew nothing even about the application process.

652
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:44,330
and then i started hearing in the fall of my senior year about some of my friends who had been getting some early acceptances at colleges.

653
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,169
i'm like, really? i didn't even know you're supposed to like apply now, right?

654
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,970
and so somehow i figured out

655
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,130
and i think my parents started helping me a little bit, probably mostly high school counselors.

656
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,490
yeah, you need to apply to college.

657
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,210
and i had won this award

658
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,250
um

659
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,370
called the bosch and lom science award

660
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,529
which was awarded by bosch and lom in rochester, new york

661
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,650
um

662
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,809
back in the day, right? and they or they

663
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:15,130
they gave this award to an outstanding science student in every high school in the country.

664
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,529
and one of the benefits of that was you got a free application to the university of rochester.

665
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,490
and this is a really

666
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,929
it's kind of a sad but funny story.

667
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,289
so i had heard of rochester institute of technology being a technology person

668
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,730
and i figured that was one of the schools i would apply to.

669
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,690
and so i'm given this free application from the university of rochester. i think they're basically the same thing.

670
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,690
it never occurred to me they were different.

671
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,130
and i'm like this is great.

672
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,210
i get to save 50 bucks.

673
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,650
i don't have to pay them for the for the admission fee.

674
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,929
so, i sent it in and i sent in a couple others. um,

675
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,770
and um

676
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,010
the ones i remember i applied to were rochester, um,

677
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,890
princeton, mit, and tufts.

678
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,570
um,

679
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:07,770
uh,

680
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,610
both princeton and mit said no.

681
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,570
um, mit said no because they didn't like my essay.

682
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,130
and i remember at the time i made a mistake of not having anyone help with my essay.

683
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,090
and i'm sure it was a disaster.

684
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,210
um,

685
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,490
which in retrospect i should have done differently. both tus

686
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,250
and um,

687
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,690
rochester accepted me

688
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,730
and so we figured i just go to tus because it's pretty close. and we

689
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,090
we drove down there one day. it seemed like a fine school. and so we went,

690
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,210
that was a fine trip.

691
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,649
but then a friend of our family said, you know, you should look at rochester before you make the final decision.

692
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,409
so my dad and i got on a plane.

693
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,929
first time ever getting on a plane.

694
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,610
we we had to take a connection to get to rochester, new york. okay.

695
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,169
and and i remember going there

696
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:48,890
and

697
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,690
um

698
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,289
they said

699
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,610
well

700
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:51,850
you know

701
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,130
we don't have a computer science program

702
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,690
and i think tus might have had a minimal computer science program

703
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,570
there was pretty rare

704
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,570
but they took me in

705
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,690
they had graduate students

706
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,690
graduate computer science students

707
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,970
they took me into the lab

708
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:03,610
where the

709
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,370
where the graduate students worked

710
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,730
and they had a xerox alto

711
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,490
and i didn't know what a xerox alto was

712
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,010
but they showed me

713
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,570
this computer with a spinning globe on it

714
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,649
so here i am coming from a pdp8

715
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,330
okay.

716
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,690
and i see a computer with a graphical display with spinning color earth graphics.

717
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,690
i was just blown away. i didn't see anything like that at tus. yeah. okay.

718
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,049
and i'm like, okay. even though this

719
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,490
even though these are graduate students

720
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,409
and and they said, " and by the way,

721
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,730
you know, we can probably get you in here and give you some access.

722
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,730
" i'm like, " i have to come here.

723
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,210
" so, i decided to go there. and so, what year

724
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,370
would

725
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,529
what

726
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,289
what year did you enter? um

727
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,929
79. 79. okay. okay. so, the alto was pretty mature at that point. it was

728
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,250
uh

729
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,730
relatively

730
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,330
it was rare, right? but it was relatively mature. do you know why they ended up at why rochester?

731
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,010
do you know? was there a faculty member? xerox.

732
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,049
oh, of course.

733
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,370
yeah.

734
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:55,770
of course.

735
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,490
yeah. right.

736
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,570
xerox was a big supporter of rochester.

737
00:29:59,039 --> 00:29:59,450
that's right.

738
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,010
that's right.

739
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,370
so, it was all accidental.

740
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,210
i thought i was applying to rit

741
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,409
and i i finally get to rochester. oh, that's actually a different school. but it's okay.

742
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:09,049
it worked out.

743
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,529
so, so before leaving high school, um, did either video games

744
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,450
or computer networks show up on your your radar at

745
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:19,690
all

746
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,610
in video games were out in the world. we had a pong.

747
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,450
okay. so, we had the first ataris that came out. oh, the bowling alley.

748
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,250
no, no, no.

749
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,250
on our tv at home. okay. and i loved those things. yeah. right.

750
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,730
the video games in the bowling alies came a little bit later, but remember you could get pong

751
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,409
and you could get the basic atari thing.

752
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,649
um, may maybe you could get the video games in in the bowling alleys then too.

753
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,929
i don't remember. but it was very cool. very cool to have it. p

754
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:46,490
you could get pong.

755
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,049
that's right.

756
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:48,010
pong was first.

757
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,649
and so i remember falling in love with all that stuff.

758
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,049
yeah.

759
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:57,049
but to me, the notion of being able to program those things myself was completely foreign, right?

760
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,649
that was something way beyond what i even thought possible.

761
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:00,970
yeah.

762
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,970
at least for myself. yeah.

763
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,770
but the the family had some one of the video game like an atari or something to play.

764
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,090
yeah.

765
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,330
yes.

766
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,970
and but you weren't programming that. you were programming real computers. well, i mean, you couldn't really pro

767
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,289
it was an atari game console, right? and you bought the pre-programmed games.

768
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,970
you couldn't program them yourself. it was a big deal to program them. yeah. yeah.

769
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,649
so, um

770
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,090
um

771
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,250
tell us about the university of rochester and sort of what showing up as a freshman.

772
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:35,690
what was it like? would you living in a dorm? and and living in a dorm, i remember it

773
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,850
it was very hard for me. um

774
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,289
because i'd never been away from home before,

775
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,570
completely isolated,

776
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,850
no internet to send emails to friends or family,

777
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,850
right? no unlimited cell phone plan to call home.

778
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,370
there's one phone in the dorm and you have to pay long distance charges which i couldn't afford.

779
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:54,890
so, i was isolated.

780
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,169
and to make matters worse, i go to my first orientation meeting with a bunch of other freshmen

781
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,649
and they're all saying, " what's that weird accent you have? "

782
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,210
and had a really thick man accent at the time.

783
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,690
and i'm like, " oh my god, i didn't even know i had an accent.

784
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,370
what are these guys talking about?

785
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,649
they're all from new york and everything else. " and so it was

786
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,850
it was very hard yet. um,

787
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,850
you know,

788
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,890
by those day standards, they had great computing facilities

789
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,690
and again no undergraduate computer science program as a degree, but they did offer some classes.

790
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,649
and so of course

791
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,370
first semester i signed up for intro to programming

792
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,890
whatever it was where we learned pascal or fortrren or whatever.

793
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,529
and so i got an account on the ibm 3070

794
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,929
or whatever whatever it was at the time the big computer punch cards

795
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:44,649
and everything else.

796
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,649
and so um

797
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,529
that was for classwork.

798
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,970
and so i started using that

799
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,049
and i found another friend in my dorm who was also in the computers.

800
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,769
he wasn't quite a good programmer as i

801
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:56,409
but i

802
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:58,409
i would be in my dorm writing my programs

803
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,730
and then taking them in to the punch cards and so remember

804
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,529
in those days you had an allocation of computer time right

805
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:08,570
and it was all normalized to dollars you had

806
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,570
so we had like say $ 100 for the semester

807
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,570
i used it all up in like two weeks

808
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:13,690
okay

809
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,769
just writing my own programs and experimenting

810
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,049
and i

811
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,690
one of the first programs i wrote even without any assignments

812
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,890
was a program that would print posters because we want to put posters on our walls in our dorm

813
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,450
in the hall

814
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,929
in the hallways of the dorms. we had no way to do that.

815
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,130
so i said, i can write a program.

816
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,130
so i designed a font and did it all,

817
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,850
you know,

818
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,450
i encoded it myself and then wrote a program.

819
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,610
you just put in the cards for what i was going to print out.

820
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,289
and i got in big trouble for that

821
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:39,769
because i had these huge printouts coming out

822
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,730
which, you know,

823
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,330
some guy would, you know,

824
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,809
cut it off

825
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:43,450
and bring it to you

826
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,610
and start yelling at you, why did you do this? so i got in trouble for huge printouts.

827
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,090
i got in trouble for using up all my money,

828
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,010
but that was a blessing in disguise

829
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,890
because within the first couple weeks of this class, i had to go visit my professor

830
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,649
because i had no computer time left to do my homework.

831
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,609
so, so i had to explain to him how i'd used up all my computer time

832
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:10,489
and i was in fear.

833
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,649
but in retrospect,

834
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,929
i realized he said, " okay, this guy has selfidentified as someone who is really interested in this.

835
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:21,210
" so, not only did he fix my problem with computer time,

836
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,250
he said, " i want to introduce you to our graduate computer lab.

837
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,810
" i see.

838
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,409
so, and so back to the alto.

839
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,770
so, i got back into the alto.

840
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,129
not not quite into the alto then, but i started getting jobs working for computer science faculty.

841
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,649
okay. working side by side with graduate students, getting, you know,

842
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,329
paid, you know,

843
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:41,530
a reasonable amount of money.

844
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,690
i wasn't expecting to get any money, but they were paying me now. so in evenings and weekends

845
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:46,969
i would go in there

846
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,849
and i would either do the work i was supposed to do for the professor

847
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,010
or teach myself how to program the alto

848
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,050
or a lot of the work i was a lot of the paperwork i was doing was on a vax at the time.

849
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:57,609
um

850
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,130
so i got to use all the different systems. so you

851
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,890
you moved to computing right from the what was the math scene like? did you stay in the math program

852
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,450
and was it competitive and how did you stack up against

853
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,369
when you got to college? you've been a math star.

854
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,050
were you still a math star?

855
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:13,609
okay.

856
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,290
so my ego is usually in check, but there's one thing i have to say, which is at orientation,

857
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,170
they had us all in a big auditorium.

858
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,970
all the freshmen are going to say, " okay, you guys, you're all one of the top students at your high school.

859
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,290
now you're just one of the normal people.

860
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,730
" that scared me, but i still had no trouble there.

861
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,290
and in the math stuff, i was able to stay ahead of everybody.

862
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,930
computer science stuff, clearly it was not

863
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,970
it was still not a problem.

864
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,410
so i felt good about that.

865
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,050
and the math stuff i had to do because it was my degree. um

866
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,170
the

867
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:46,970
the

868
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:47,849
um

869
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,089
the math was getting pretty abstract and pretty complicated. and um

870
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:54,890
certainly

871
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,010
in the later years with the really advanced classes, i was more in the mode of okay,

872
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,290
i'm just going to figure out how to get an a in this class as opposed to really learning it.

873
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,770
and that's what would start to h to happen.

874
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,930
and i know i've every once in a while i'll find some old document in a closet.

875
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,210
and i found one a few years ago

876
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,849
which was some old math notes i had

877
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:14,570
and i looked at them

878
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,849
i i didn't even know what they were about.

879
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,530
so you know

880
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,329
i i've learn

881
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:20,329
i've lost lost so much of the knowledge.

882
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,329
on the other hand, i remember

883
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,210
um

884
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,369
i was still into sciences

885
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,570
and so i took chemistry

886
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,290
and physics

887
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:34,250
and other classes almost for fun, which in retrospect was kind of crazy, but i remember i took a lot of advanced physics classes

888
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,210
and i remember even though i was in advanced math, um

889
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,570
we got to a point in physics

890
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,170
where the professor said, " okay,

891
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,410
and so now we're going to do some differential calculus that you guys haven't got to in math yet.

892
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,490
" and so just trust me, this is how it works.

893
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,089
and that's when i said, " okay, this physics is getting a little too complicated for me.

894
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:57,690
" some particle physics and quantum theory. and i stopped.

895
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,290
so i'd had enough of that.

896
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,570
and then i just focused on the math.

897
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,609
but my time was all about the computers. and it wasn't even about the

898
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,890
i mean i took some good classes in compiler theory and other things

899
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,609
where i learned how to build compilers and did interesting things there

900
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,970
but it was all about being able to work with faculty and doing actual research with them

901
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,250
where they were doing research projects and i got to contribute to it. yeah.

902
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,609
and and and doing fun things myself, right? i i mean i

903
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:23,849
i

904
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,730
you talk

905
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,089
you asked about games before. i started writing games on eltos. what were your

906
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:28,490
so

907
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,089
what were early games that you wrote on

908
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,369
i may have played some of your games. you probably have

909
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,089
um

910
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,570
i

911
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:34,890
i

912
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,570
i forget what order i wrote them in.

913
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,530
i think the first one i wrote was i did knockoff games

914
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,849
cuz i wasn't creative enough to do original games. the first one was a knockoff of missile command.

915
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,570
okay.

916
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,410
i think that's the first one i did

917
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,690
because it was relatively straightforward for the graphics capabilities of the alto at the time.

918
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,210
didn't require too much microode.

919
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,570
and then the second one that i did was defender.

920
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,410
and defender was tricky

921
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,329
because the graphics on that are very intense and i had to write most of the game in microode.

922
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,810
oh wow. were there highlight was

923
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,970
was there pascal? well, there was small talk, right? did you learn?

924
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:09,849
no. small tech.

925
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,369
small talk was useless for games.

926
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:11,849
yeah.

927
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,170
okay.

928
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,010
i wrote in microode and bcpl.

929
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,730
didn't spend any time really in small talk.

930
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,329
that was too abstract a language for me.

931
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:18,650
yeah.

932
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,890
and and how about i mean the alto was such a statement about interface at that point.

933
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,570
i mean you had been in this asr world

934
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,089
and all of a sudden you were in this human machine interactive world.

935
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,849
did how did that i mean

936
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:33,930
did that play a role in shaping your outlook about computing?

937
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,130
um

938
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,450
probably you have to remember

939
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,329
i was still doing a lot of programming on the vax too. so i had a normal

940
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,210
was it a vt50 something or other

941
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,010
you know

942
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,250
screen

943
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,369
that i'd spent probably almost as much time using

944
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:47,849
for

945
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,410
you know

946
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,609
i'm writing when i'm writing my compiler

947
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:50,490
i'm doing that.

948
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,770
i was doing some vssi design work, some design checkers.

949
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,530
i was using that with big data.

950
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,050
um, so i spent probably roughly equal amount of times

951
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,290
and and but i really loved the graphics part of the alto

952
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,490
and just i

953
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:06,730
i

954
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,690
what i really loved about the alto also was the fact that you could write microode

955
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,690
and you could get right in there

956
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,369
and it was literally the case

957
00:39:13,379 --> 00:39:13,530
that

958
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,490
that your program could break the computer if you didn't have the right weight states in the right spots.

959
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,010
bad things would happen to the computer

960
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,089
and so i had to be really careful about that

961
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,450
and i there's something about that

962
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,770
i always like to be really close to the metal

963
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,930
did maze wars exist

964
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,050
i think so

965
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,170
and were they were

966
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,970
the altos connected

967
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,010
the altos were wereworked

968
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:34,890
and

969
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:35,369
uh

970
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:37,450
my adviser later on at carnegie melon

971
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:37,930
rick

972
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,930
rashid had written with jean baltre

973
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,810
which inspired me to do the other games

974
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:43,609
okay

975
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,530
so you saw it before you met

976
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,250
rick

977
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,010
or rick had already left

978
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,490
rick

979
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,410
rick was a graduate student at rochester

980
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,730
just prior to my arrival there

981
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,530
and then he went off to be faculty at carnegie melon

982
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,250
and so i i was able to see track

983
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,450
which of course i loved.

984
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,010
yeah. right.

985
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,130
that was clearly one of the

986
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,450
that's probably one of the very first network games. yeah.

987
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,250
and were you already just in terms of your your studies and your interests

988
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,690
was there already an os direction in as an undergraduate? no,

989
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,570
because people didn't really talk about os's then. it was

990
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,690
i would say it was an interest in low-level software. so close to the mission.

991
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,130
was there an os on the alto?

992
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:23,690
yes.

993
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,890
did i care about it? no.

994
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,050
because i was writing to the bare metal.

995
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,570
and as soon as you launched the defender program, it took over everything.

996
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,170
i didn't use any of the ui elements that the os provided. none.

997
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,570
yeah.

998
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,210
um,

999
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,369
so that never really occurred to me.

1000
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:41,770
and all the interesting to me, all the interesting games, trek, i was

1001
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,170
i loved clint parker's pinball game. remember pinball?

1002
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,890
that was awesome. these are things that motivated me and they completely took over the whole computer.

1003
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,930
and did you have a view into park? did park show up on your world view as an undergraduate

1004
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,369
where allen's group lrg or any of the other

1005
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,050
not at all.

1006
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:01,369
yeah.

1007
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,930
not at all.

1008
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,450
it was so disconnected and well i should say if it did

1009
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,010
i don't remember.

1010
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,530
this is a long time ago. so it's entirely possible that it did.

1011
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,849
it's just that i've kind of blanked it out. yeah. yeah.

1012
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,290
and so at that point had personal computers begun to be accessible at rochester

1013
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,810
or were you still a big computer guy? personal computers were accessible. the alto

1014
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,690
there

1015
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,890
there was an undergraduate lab

1016
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,490
which fortunately i didn't have to use

1017
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,770
which had

1018
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,250
uh

1019
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,290
was it the commodore pets

1020
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,250
and then they had some apple 2. okay.

1021
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,010
and so before i got to spend a lot of time in the in the graduate lab, i did spend some time there,

1022
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,170
which again this was all outside of class,

1023
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,849
but i would do silly things like i would create

1024
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:44,490
um

1025
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,250
so let's say there was um

1026
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,130
eight of these computers. i can't remember whether whether it's the commodore or the apple,

1027
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,690
i don't remember.

1028
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,530
i would write a program that would play music

1029
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,250
and i would have an instance running on each computer simultaneously

1030
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,930
each playing a different part.

1031
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:02,329
cool.

1032
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,490
i would do stupid things like that. that's very cool. for the audience

1033
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,410
in that case was you? it was me.

1034
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,890
it was me just to show that i could do it.

1035
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,609
i'have to figure out a way to get them all started at the same time. yeah.

1036
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,210
but that would probably be by bringing in friends or something. yeah. that's a classic hacker behavior. yeah.

1037
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,770
i mean, you were pushing the machine to its limits.

1038
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,410
i would just try to think about what could i possibly make this thing do that's never done before.

1039
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:26,810
interesting.

1040
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,250
and um

1041
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,130
how much of your life was computing during college? i mean, were you just sort of swept into the computing world?

1042
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,329
and i was swept into it all my spare time.

1043
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:44,970
okay. so, today it would be worse because today you're always connected. so, you know,

1044
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,690
at least then

1045
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,730
when i went home, i was disconnected. yeah.

1046
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,170
but i would be connected a lot in the office or in in the lab for many many hours.

1047
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,410
yeah. was rochester an arpa site? did you have connection to the arpanet

1048
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,410
or was it something that you were aware of?

1049
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,210
um

1050
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,050
i don't think we were an arpa site at the time

1051
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,849
because we did all of our external email with ucp in uset.

1052
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,050
so we probably were not an arpa site at the time

1053
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,770
or it may have just been barely coming in. yeah.

1054
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:16,329
yeah.

1055
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,530
and um

1056
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,369
in terms of the people who were influential

1057
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,410
um

1058
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,290
the computer scientists at rochester as being very influential on your development

1059
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,569
as as a young computer scientist? um

1060
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,130
this again

1061
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,569
this is a long time. i remember

1062
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:35,450
um

1063
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,290
first of all

1064
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,410
i remember a lot of them were tall and i'm tall

1065
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,569
and i wonder if there's some correlation there between tall and computer science.

1066
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,089
i was thinking that at the time.

1067
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:49,690
this is interesting. they're all 6 feet and above and i'm like 6'2, 63.

1068
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,050
um,

1069
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,690
so that was the first thing that i thought was an interesting correlation.

1070
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:54,810
um,

1071
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,890
there were a bunch of guys there. i have a hard time remembering their names. um,

1072
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,010
who are very influential.

1073
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,089
one was i already mentioned

1074
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,130
uh

1075
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,849
clint parker

1076
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,490
who he wasn't that active

1077
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,210
when i he was

1078
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,410
he was officially a graduate student

1079
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,290
but he wasn't that active.

1080
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,890
i think he'd been there for a while.

1081
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:17,690
he had done the pinball game and he had done a lot of really low-level groundbreaking elto stuff.

1082
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,010
i know i leveraged some of his stuff in some of my games. he would do like he would

1083
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,569
he wrote the classic super fast multiply divide for the elto

1084
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,089
and i lifted that and put it in.

1085
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,690
and there a few other things that he had done that i i would just kind of take from.

1086
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,450
i was inspired by the work rick and gene had done on track

1087
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,609
even though i'd never met them. um

1088
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,290
there were some people there who were starting to do some experimenting with networking

1089
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,810
which i was just kind of learning about. i don't remember who they were.

1090
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,690
yeah. but

1091
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:48,329
um

1092
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,210
it's

1093
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,970
it's so long ago. i

1094
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,130
i

1095
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:51,210
i

1096
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,609
i definitely had good relations with faculty. um

1097
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:56,650
you know

1098
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:56,810
the

1099
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,450
the person i was working for for most of the time was a vssi per vssi design person.

1100
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,329
and at that point in time, the the design tools for vlsi were very primitive.

1101
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,130
and he hired me to write a design rule checker program, which had never been done before,

1102
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,849
where you make sure it's actually probably going to work

1103
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:14,810
and not, you know,

1104
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,970
short circuit immediately, right? um

1105
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,250
i did some um computer

1106
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:20,890
uh

1107
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,890
computer vision work, very early computer vision

1108
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,170
where the hard

1109
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,130
i mean you had to like figure out how to do an edge detector, right?

1110
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,170
and now that's all given, right? uh

1111
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:30,810
with

1112
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,450
um

1113
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,970
i think his name was chris brown

1114
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,890
who's doing some early work in computer vision

1115
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,930
which now seems so basic. um

1116
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,050
and then i got

1117
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,450
i had a good relationship with um

1118
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,130
his name escapes me. it'll come to me

1119
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:45,369
jerry.

1120
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,490
it'll it'll come to me later. he was the department head

1121
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:49,609
um

1122
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,369
who helped me get into grad school as it turns out.

1123
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:53,609
okay. and questions about your games.

1124
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:57,770
first of all, if defender was graphic intensive, one of the innovations of alto

1125
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:58,410
as i remember

1126
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,130
it was bit blit.

1127
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,050
and i wonder if bitblit was something that was which you used

1128
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,450
or that you knew about in terms of its graphics capabilities.

1129
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,210
um, i knew about biplit and bitlit was important for the games,

1130
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,770
but defender had a unique

1131
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,250
a unique sort of challenge,

1132
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:24,569
which is it drew a landscape in real time at the bottom of the screen that was basically random.

1133
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,369
no, not random,

1134
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,010
but it was

1135
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,690
it was like a squiggly line.

1136
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,490
okay, it wasn't just a line from one point to another.

1137
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,970
it was thousands of points.

1138
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:33,369
yeah.

1139
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:33,770
okay.

1140
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,609
and it had to be drawn in real time.

1141
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,690
and bipllet was useless for that. and so i had to code that by hand. there was

1142
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,730
i coded one instruction which would draw the landscape

1143
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,730
and another instruction which would erase the landscape.

1144
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,770
and so as fast as it could, basically 60 times a second, it would erase and redraw.

1145
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,930
er, erase and redraw and try and get display sync just right. yeah. there was

1146
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,770
that was the only way to do it. and did did these um games

1147
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,410
uh

1148
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,130
give you a reputation? was there already a community of people who would, you know,

1149
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:05,290
value

1150
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,050
i never thought about that at the time,

1151
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,530
but probably

1152
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:10,970
um

1153
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,329
there weren't a lot of things like that for the alto, right?

1154
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,569
and i do know these games spread to the other of the other sites

1155
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:20,890
that

1156
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,329
as everything did

1157
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,170
everything good that got got spread out.

1158
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,930
so it did spread to other elto sites.

1159
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,650
um, i can't say that i can look back

1160
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,930
and say that caused me to meet more people or whatever.

1161
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,290
um,

1162
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,450
i just i just don't know.

1163
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:37,770
yeah.

1164
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,170
okay.

1165
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:38,810
and

1166
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:39,450
um,

1167
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,849
so were you always

1168
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,650
at this point

1169
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:42,890
you

1170
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,050
were

1171
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,530
you were always

1172
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,050
so i'm just wondering about high level languages and what the gestalt was

1173
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,810
or the sort of at rochester at that point. was it a pascal world?

1174
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,770
what was the sort of this high level language that was fashionable

1175
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,890
and did you have to spend time with it? so

1176
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:04,490
from an academic perspective, teaching the masses of undergrads was pascal. they offered some more advanced classes

1177
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:05,930
um

1178
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,609
where you could do more. you could learn more languages

1179
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,130
and in particular

1180
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,569
i remember there was a language class

1181
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,810
part of which

1182
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:15,690
well

1183
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,810
i think there was a language class

1184
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,250
and then there was a compiler class

1185
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,930
and in the language class we learned a lot of languages.

1186
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,849
i remember i remember doing homework.

1187
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,050
there was one homework where you had to write a text editor in snowball of all things.

1188
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,010
um

1189
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,490
so i do remember learning a lot of languages at least at a peripheral level.

1190
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:34,970
yeah.

1191
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:35,530
um

1192
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,970
enough to do a text command line based text editor. yeah. back at that time. um

1193
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,329
but when you graduated

1194
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,770
you still graduated with a math

1195
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,730
not an applied math degree, a math degree. i had graduated with a ba in math. math.

1196
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,210
yes.

1197
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:49,609
yeah.

1198
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,530
and tell us about the the

1199
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:51,690
the

1200
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,730
the sort of the path from from rochester to cmu and the help that you got from the chair.

1201
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,530
it's jerry

1202
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,369
and his name is jerry feldman.

1203
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,130
oh my god. okay. you know jerry feldman?

1204
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:01,530
i do know.

1205
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,569
a lot of people know jerry feldman.

1206
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,170
so jerry was the chair of the department at the time

1207
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,690
and i got to work with him a little bit.

1208
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,490
he got to know me.

1209
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:21,369
so if you think back to what i said about high school, i was going to be a statistician, right? well, so i'm thinking as an undergraduate in um college now, i'm a pretty good programmer.

1210
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,010
i've done a lot of work for the faculty writing code, not not research per se,

1211
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,250
but you know, some good work under their direction.

1212
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,210
okay.

1213
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,530
well, i'm going to go get a reasonably good paying job at microsoft who does all the professional software, right? so,

1214
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,650
that was my thinking certainly at least through junior year.

1215
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,450
um, but jerry and others said, you know, avi, you should take a look at graduate school.

1216
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,809
they thought i'd be a good candidate for graduate school. i'm like, i'm like, what are you talking about?

1217
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,970
it's never even occurred to me. i'm lucky to have even finished college.

1218
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,010
this is totally cool. first person in my family. um,

1219
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,450
but i was working with researchers now. so, i saw what they did.

1220
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,569
and somewhere along the way,

1221
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:11,050
what what i did was this this um work i've been doing on the vssi design rule checker.

1222
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,690
i had built a um

1223
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,050
interesting piece of technology

1224
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,130
which would do in using the c language

1225
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:19,770
which would

1226
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:20,329
um

1227
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,369
it was a

1228
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,170
it was a dynamic

1229
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:23,369
uh

1230
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:25,050
mark and sweep type garbage collector

1231
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:26,089
uh

1232
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:31,210
to automatically manage data structures without having to write any code that no one had ever done before.

1233
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,010
or it was kind of interesting.

1234
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,089
i pre-processed the header files and i added to them and recompiled them

1235
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:36,650
and there's all

1236
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,809
there's all this other magic with a runtime library and could garbage collect in real time.

1237
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,450
it was pretty cool for what it was especially for an undergrad

1238
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,050
and i wrote a paper on it and i don't

1239
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,210
i didn't even submit it for publication or anything

1240
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,650
but i figured this would just be a cool thing

1241
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:54,010
and and the faculty i knew was helping me with it

1242
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,410
and and so so it's a bit of unusual research for an undergraduate to do. um

1243
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:01,609
and

1244
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:09,210
and so the faculty said, " look, you should at least look at a graduate program before you go off

1245
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:09,770
and get a job.

1246
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,450
" i said, " okay, i love working with you guys.

1247
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,050
i love this research aspect of it.

1248
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:13,530
why not? "

1249
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,690
and so i said, " but i'm only going to do

1250
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,290
that if i can go to either carnegie melon, stanford,

1251
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:19,930
or mit.

1252
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,210
" okay.

1253
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,050
and if i can't get into one of those then, and they kind of agreed with me.

1254
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:29,770
they're like, " yeah, absolutely. " and so, um, i applied to all three

1255
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,569
and jerry wrote me letters of recommendation.

1256
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,329
i had a research paper that i had written.

1257
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,410
lo and behold, i got accepted at all three.

1258
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:37,369
okay.

1259
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,130
and so, i'm like, i guess destiny is that i go to grad school.

1260
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,210
so, that's how that happened.

1261
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,010
and how did you choose which of the three? that's a really interesting.

1262
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,410
the way i choose these things seems strange.

1263
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,010
i mean, you go back to the rochester thing. so, here's here's the way that works.

1264
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:59,210
so, i get letters of acceptance from all three and um carnegie melon in their letter of acceptance

1265
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,170
or maybe in a in a quick follow-up says in you know

1266
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:02,890
we'd love to see

1267
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,410
they're all saying we'd love to see you come right

1268
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,490
because they don't accept everybody there

1269
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:07,369
15

1270
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,849
maybe a year at those places at the time. yeah.

1271
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,170
and and they're like

1272
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,369
come visit us

1273
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,849
call us up. tell us when you can come down

1274
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,690
we'll schedule you know

1275
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:22,089
meetings and everything. we'll take care of everything. so i called him up and i went down.

1276
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,530
it wasn't too far of a trip. it was easy drive down to pittsburgh and loved it. and so

1277
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:28,329
um

1278
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,210
i then

1279
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,250
uh

1280
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,690
tried to talk to both

1281
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,010
like

1282
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:37,369
i talked to both stanford and mit to try to do something similar. and so i called mit

1283
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:38,890
uh

1284
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,329
and they said, " oh, we don't do that.

1285
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,970
we we expect people that we expect to come here. " yeah. i was like, " okay,

1286
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:45,770
well

1287
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,890
you turned me down once.

1288
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:51,849
i'm going to have turned you down this time. " and then stanford said, " um,

1289
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:52,569
yeah,

1290
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,530
we can host you. we don't always do that. we'd love to see you come out,

1291
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,970
but you know,

1292
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,130
no,

1293
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,369
we can't play pay for a plane ticket, and no, we can't give you a hotel or anything.

1294
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:03,609
" i'm like, screw that.

1295
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:04,089
yeah.

1296
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,890
if i want to go to the west coast, i'll go there for a job after i graduate from carnegie melon.

1297
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,290
yeah.

1298
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,369
so, so carnegie melon was very good about this.

1299
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:21,369
and they weren't really, i mean, they weren't the name brand school, right? so i would talk to my uncles back in maine who had heard of stanford

1300
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,290
and mit but never heard of carnegie melon

1301
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,970
and they're like wait a minute

1302
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,089
especially mit

1303
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,130
when if you're in maine

1304
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,329
mit is like it

1305
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,290
you've been accepted at mit and you're not going like

1306
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,010
trust me

1307
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:32,890
this is the right thing

1308
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,530
but when i visited carnegie melon

1309
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,089
it was just

1310
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:36,490
you know

1311
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,130
i loved it

1312
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,210
just like i loved rochester when i went there and

1313
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,849
and they were very welcoming and they had a

1314
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:42,730
from what i could tell

1315
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,609
a great program.

1316
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,050
it was a great program. yeah.

1317
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,010
go ahead. was so you applied to those three because they were the three top programs

1318
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:54,010
or they were the ones that you that the faculty recommended?

1319
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,369
those were the three top programs. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1320
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,849
and just there are some people who said, " why didn't you apply to berkeley? "

1321
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:01,210
and i said, "

1322
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,170
because berkeley was number four.

1323
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:08,809
" sorry, berkeley fans. yeah. before we leave college,

1324
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,650
outside of computing, social life, sports,

1325
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:13,690
what

1326
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,210
what was what did you do besides compute while you were?

1327
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,450
so, what did i do besides compute?

1328
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,010
um, nothing of interest that i remember.

1329
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,849
um, so,

1330
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:24,650
you know,

1331
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,650
i still had, you know,

1332
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,770
interesting summer jobs, but that's was still around computing.

1333
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:30,329
although,

1334
00:54:30,339 --> 00:54:33,369
when i was in as an undergrad, i would still go back

1335
00:54:33,379 --> 00:54:35,050
and we'd go to our summer place on the lake.

1336
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:38,010
and so that was a 9-to-f5 computing job.

1337
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,329
you left it there because there was no way to commute compute remotely and everybody left at 5.

1338
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:43,290
the place was shut down

1339
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,210
and then i i'd come back to the lake

1340
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,849
and go water skiing with my brothers or boating or whatever.

1341
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:55,450
and we go dirt bike riding or you all those kinds of things, but there wasn't that much else.

1342
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,849
yeah. yeah.

1343
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:58,650
um

1344
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,450
before we go into the the cmu section, um

1345
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,490
could you tell us more about the the other research projects that you were working on at rochester

1346
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,369
and some of the other programs that you wrote?

1347
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,050
so the

1348
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:13,450
the

1349
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:13,530
the

1350
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:19,530
the two research projects i remember at rochester were the vlsi design tool and the computer vision work.

1351
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,530
i don't even remember the details of the computer vision work.

1352
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,609
those are the only ones that i really remember

1353
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,530
and frankly those are probably the two major ones that i did.

1354
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,569
if there was anything else, i don't really remember what it was.

1355
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,170
and then everything else was all my personal programming projects.

1356
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,369
and and i always took some kind of computer science class every semester. there was all

1357
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,170
there was plenty that were offered. i took them all. um

1358
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,569
but probably the most time was spent on my own projects.

1359
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:54,569
and then the big ones i think were definitely missile command and defender. those took a lot of time.

1360
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,170
oh, go ahead.

1361
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,569
and the lsi design,

1362
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,450
was that because rochester had that connection to xerox?

1363
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,410
was that coming straight out of xerox park?

1364
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:05,530
um,

1365
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,770
we had someone on faculty whose area was vssi design

1366
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,770
and um

1367
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,010
i don't know why we did,

1368
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,490
but we had a diverse set of faculty.

1369
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,890
did conway and meat exist by that time? that that text about blsi designer?

1370
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:21,690
i think so.

1371
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,329
i think so.

1372
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:22,970
yeah.

1373
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,130
but that was a graduate level text probably not for you know

1374
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:31,530
i remember taking a vlsi undergraduate class where we did

1375
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,809
we built a basic circuit

1376
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,010
sent it out for fab.

1377
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,210
oh, so that was

1378
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:35,930
but it was

1379
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,250
it was

1380
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,530
it was very basic. yeah.

1381
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,530
and i think as i recollect

1382
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,170
that helped me a little bit to at least understand what i was working on on the design rule checker.

1383
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:44,809
yeah.

1384
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:45,450
yeah.

1385
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,010
and while you were there, did the ibm pc emerge and did

1386
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:54,410
did there become a culture of the ibm pc style computing, doss,

1387
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,410
did that all happen while you were an undergraduate?

1388
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:58,410
um,

1389
00:56:58,799 --> 00:56:59,049
jamie,

1390
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,930
we can look at the calendar. yeah, it would have happened when i was an undergraduate

1391
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:03,530
just based on the calendar,

1392
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,890
but it never i was always doing much more interesting things. i mean, programming on a vax

1393
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,329
was way more interesting

1394
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,010
and programming on elto

1395
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,369
was way more interesting yet again.

1396
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,849
so why would you ever use an ibm computer?

1397
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,290
and if i wanted to do anything, i could always go use the apple 2

1398
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,730
or the the commodore pet,

1399
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,290
which in many respects was even more interesting than ibm.

1400
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,849
and did computing ever did

1401
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:26,329
were you in

1402
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:28,569
did you live in a dormatory the entire time you were at school

1403
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:29,609
or did you move off campus

1404
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,890
or so

1405
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:31,690
uh

1406
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,849
it was different every year. so my freshman year i was in the dorm.

1407
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:40,890
sophomore year, i was in an off-campus school-managed uh

1408
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,490
two-bedroom apartment with a friend.

1409
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,450
junior year, i was back on campus in a suite with five friends.

1410
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:55,849
and then senior year, i was in an off-campus uh apartment with a couple of friends

1411
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,049
that was on the school shuttle. yeah. yeah.

1412
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,410
and and did com

1413
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,970
did you ever have a not home computer

1414
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,329
but a computer that you know that was not a work computer. so, so did you

1415
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,569
what did did that transition happen while you were in school? like in your dorm room

1416
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:13,210
or in your

1417
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,450
so, the first computer i had that was not that was like in my room was probably

1418
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,490
i think about this for a second.

1419
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,130
that was probably when i bought a mac for myself at carnegie melon in 1984.

1420
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:29,849
yeah.

1421
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:31,210
so, the mac happened after you left.

1422
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,210
yeah, i was at carnegie melon. yeah.

1423
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,250
was it a big deal to buy a mac at that point? oh yeah.

1424
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:36,490
$ 2, 400

1425
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,849
or whatever it was.

1426
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,049
it was like it was a commitment student discount. that's right.

1427
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,690
and did so you were around when you know the the mac team was on their tour.

1428
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,170
did do you remember the mac did?

1429
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:50,329
like

1430
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:53,369
did steve come through while you were a graduate student?

1431
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,329
um

1432
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,569
if he did on a mac tour, i don't remember it. yeah.

1433
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,450
do you remember the 3m machine? the concept of a dream. absolutely.

1434
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:05,849
yeah.

1435
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:06,410
absolutely.

1436
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:06,730
yeah.

1437
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,890
but it was bubbling while you were a graduate student, didn't it? or maybe it was too early.

1438
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,770
when did it start? 85.

1439
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,290
well, so you know,

1440
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:18,410
i mean, different people have different views of when the first 3m machine was, but like the um

1441
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:19,930
the um

1442
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:20,569
uh

1443
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,210
the perk

1444
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:22,329
um

1445
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,450
what was the name of the company?

1446
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:23,930
uh

1447
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:24,329
perk

1448
00:59:24,339 --> 00:59:26,010
systems or something like that. yeah, it was.

1449
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:26,970
uh

1450
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:27,369
yeah,

1451
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:27,770
perk.

1452
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,010
they sort of had one of the first 3m machines

1453
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:30,569
which

1454
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:33,930
of course that was a carnegie melon spin out and it was moused driven.

1455
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,450
i remember it was mouse driven. yeah.

1456
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:35,690
yeah.

1457
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,369
it was a forgotten perk entirely.

1458
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:44,089
so tell us about coming to carnegie melon entering the program and what what it was like. yeah.

1459
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:44,490
so

1460
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,290
um

1461
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,410
very different than being an undergrad. um

1462
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,450
i was almost like a kid in a candy store. i mean they had everything.

1463
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:54,410
they had altos

1464
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,049
of course. they had the ibm machines

1465
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,250
which i could care less about.

1466
00:59:58,559 --> 00:59:59,690
they had a deck 20

1467
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,290
which was super hot, right? and i mean hot in temperature

1468
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,250
was hot in temperature

1469
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,890
but super hot as a computer, right? and and i could get on that if i wanted to.

1470
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:09,849
uh

1471
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,690
they had perks all over the place.

1472
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,410
um

1473
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,930
which was totally cool

1474
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:19,770
cuz not only was it like an elto in the lab, but you could actually get a perk in your office

1475
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:20,970
which was

1476
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,650
i mean that was really cool. yeah.

1477
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:23,369
um

1478
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,250
so

1479
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,530
from that perspective i was like a kid in a candy store. um

1480
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,930
it was also different in that there were some academic requirements

1481
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,049
but they were very minimal

1482
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,170
you know

1483
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,210
minimal theory class

1484
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:36,329
minimal

1485
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,609
i probably took four classes the whole time there

1486
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:40,010
it was

1487
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:40,170
it

1488
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:40,329
was

1489
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,930
this is one of the things i liked about it.

1490
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,130
it was applied research.

1491
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,809
everybody there, almost everybody was doing things

1492
01:00:46,819 --> 01:00:47,530
that was tangible

1493
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,650
that you could see was going to have some real impact in three to five to 10 years.

1494
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,970
so what was the process of pairing up with the project or the faculty

1495
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:57,849
or you know

1496
01:00:57,859 --> 01:00:58,010
so

1497
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,490
was it a

1498
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,770
was it a recruiting scene

1499
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:03,369
or did you volunteer? how did you find your way to the

1500
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,690
to the project you you ended up

1501
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,170
and

1502
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:06,970
was it more than one?

1503
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,250
you know, i don't know the way it exactly happened, but i think there was,

1504
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:14,730
first of all,

1505
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:18,170
i think rick may have sponsored my visit to go to go see the place

1506
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:21,130
because they knew there was a connection there with him being a rochester grad

1507
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,049
and i think i'd expressed some interest in os level stuff by then.

1508
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,410
i'd certainly taken some os classes by then. um,

1509
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,170
and so i don't know that they assigned us together.

1510
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,210
they probably didn't.

1511
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,250
um

1512
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:39,290
other than maybe an informal temporary adviser, but we were sort of naturally drawn together

1513
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,530
because his area of expertise and research was

1514
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:42,809
um

1515
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,049
oss and he was working on the perk systems

1516
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:45,690
with the accent

1517
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,569
operating system

1518
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,329
and operating systems were an area of interest to me and we had the connection with rochester.

1519
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,410
so he became my adviser.

1520
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:55,849
um

1521
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,650
and most other students who took on rick as an adviser

1522
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,170
who or he took on as a student

1523
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,130
um

1524
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,089
prior to me

1525
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,329
would go work on some aspect of accent

1526
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,369
and there were plenty of things plenty of research to do there.

1527
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:10,730
and i looked at that

1528
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,450
i said i don't want to do that and um

1529
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,809
i wanted to do something new

1530
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,650
and accent was fairly mature. it was they were selling it

1531
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,809
um through perk and i wanted to do something completely new

1532
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,730
and i think it was

1533
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:25,290
rick told me

1534
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:25,530
he said

1535
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:25,849
you know

1536
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:28,809
we've got this other thing that we're looking at getting a darpa grant for

1537
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:30,410
um

1538
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,329
why don't you take a look at that

1539
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,450
either he told me that

1540
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,410
or someone else told me that

1541
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,930
or i somehow i discovered that

1542
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,210
and i looked into it

1543
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:42,890
and it was this project to build um parallel computing

1544
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:43,609
if you will.

1545
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,210
it had been done a little bit at the time

1546
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:45,849
but not really

1547
01:02:45,859 --> 01:02:46,809
and they wanted to do

1548
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:47,450
they were

1549
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,809
they were putting in a grant for it

1550
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,130
and so i decided i wanted to do that

1551
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,369
and so that was a clean slate project

1552
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,410
which i could basically start with rick from scratch

1553
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,770
and he was very supportive

1554
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:58,089
and

1555
01:02:58,099 --> 01:02:59,450
and that's how it all started. yeah.

1556
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,250
and what

1557
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,049
when you so

1558
01:03:01,059 --> 01:03:02,490
parallel computing was on the horizon

1559
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,290
what were the hot

1560
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,450
risk was a very hot topic there

1561
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,809
but that was probably more architectural

1562
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,809
like in the software world

1563
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,210
what else was there was

1564
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,569
i think risk came a little bit after

1565
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,849
just a little bit after that

1566
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,650
soon after that

1567
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:14,970
though

1568
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,250
um

1569
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:18,730
robotics was starting to get hot

1570
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,410
not like it is today

1571
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:20,890
right

1572
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,770
very different levels

1573
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,849
there was a lot of going on in theory

1574
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,770
ai was very hot

1575
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:26,569
okay

1576
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:27,369
um

1577
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,089
ai was sort of one of the newer things.

1578
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,530
people didn't know it didn't work then.

1579
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,329
at least they couldn't get it to work then with the resources they had then.

1580
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,289
but they really were trying to make it work. that was a big one. yeah.

1581
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:37,849
um

1582
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,450
there was still stuff going on in computer vision. there was stuff going on with

1583
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:42,089
uh

1584
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:43,289
uh

1585
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:45,609
transaction technologies, database and transactions.

1586
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:47,530
um

1587
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,609
those are the ones that i remember off top of my head.

1588
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:52,089
wasn't there a file system project at that was later

1589
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:53,450
file systems came a little bit later.

1590
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:54,089
okay.

1591
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:54,569
yeah.

1592
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,010
and so you know there was a community of people.

1593
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,609
were there other faculty who you know were sort of alternative universe ways for you to go that

1594
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:03,930
you know

1595
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,210
paths not taken because there was

1596
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:05,369
there

1597
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:05,530
was

1598
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:05,690
there

1599
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:05,930
was

1600
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,130
well,

1601
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:07,849
i'm sure there was

1602
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:09,930
but i never really considered them. um

1603
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,849
i mean i could have gone to work for a on ai.

1604
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,650
i mean, carnegie melon was really leading that

1605
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:14,890
then

1606
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,490
with some of the people that were there or robotics. they were leading a lot of the robotic

1607
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,250
they had a whole separate robotics area

1608
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,170
and um

1609
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:23,530
you know

1610
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,809
maybe robotics could have interested me a little bit because i like doing that kind of stuff

1611
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,410
but some

1612
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,049
it just didn't

1613
01:04:29,059 --> 01:04:29,770
it didn't click.

1614
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,890
i just i think rick and i hit it off hit it off pretty well

1615
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,809
and i just love this.

1616
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,369
it was a ground floor thing that no one was working on at all.

1617
01:04:37,379 --> 01:04:38,250
it was a whole new project

1618
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,490
which got me really excited too. did do you remember the name red whitaker?

1619
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,970
he was the hot roboticist when you were there.

1620
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,410
you didn't end up doing anything with him. i remember the name. that's about it.

1621
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:48,730
yeah.

1622
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:49,450
um

1623
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,809
and there was

1624
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,450
you're right.

1625
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:56,170
the ai project stuff they had there was formidable. i mean it was simon alen newell.

1626
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,369
yeah. they were the guys.

1627
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,250
they were the guys. they were all there doing that. yeah.

1628
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:00,809
so

1629
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:01,450
um

1630
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:02,890
the challenge

1631
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,010
talk about getting into parallel computing and the challenges of

1632
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:06,410
i mean

1633
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:06,809
did you

1634
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:08,970
i mean

1635
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:13,130
i remember that time as parallelization was not working very well

1636
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,369
i mean there were people didn't think parallel

1637
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,250
there were all kinds of sort of threads

1638
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,849
but it wasn't really

1639
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,329
things were not parallelized that

1640
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:23,369
at that point in the world

1641
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:23,930
well

1642
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,210
as far as i was concerned

1643
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,289
and sometimes i have tunnel vision

1644
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,490
this may have been one of the times

1645
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,210
as far as i was concerned

1646
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,089
we were the first ones doing

1647
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:30,890
and we're

1648
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,450
it was an unsolved problem and we were going to make it work.

1649
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,609
okay. and it wasn't really going to be

1650
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,609
i never thought of it as a hard problem. it's like oh

1651
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:37,930
you've got

1652
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:38,730
instead of one computer

1653
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:39,369
you've got four.

1654
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:44,490
you just got to coordinate things, right? and people knew some of the basic things like semaphors.

1655
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,930
those were known concepts, right? and so to me it was like okay

1656
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,089
we just got to do some hard work. um

1657
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,010
so we got the grant. um

1658
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:55,369
digital

1659
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:56,569
uh

1660
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:57,770
had been tapped to build the computer.

1661
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:58,730
they were going to take a 780

1662
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:07,289
and turn into a 784, which was four 780s all hooked in with an inter interconnected shared memory to turn into a 784,

1663
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,329
which i love.

1664
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,210
i love the 780.

1665
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,650
i get to use four of them.

1666
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,730
this is totally cool and it's all mine.

1667
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,410
um, i get to build the os for it.

1668
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,010
no one's there's no os for it.

1669
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,210
that was just beautiful.

1670
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:23,210
and as part of that, they had just come out with the microvax.

1671
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,329
they gave me a microvax which i got to put in my office.

1672
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:30,089
i had like the best computer in anyone's office in the whole school.

1673
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,289
um,

1674
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,170
and it was interesting. i got because i got to write

1675
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,690
write the os for it. yeah.

1676
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,609
and it was not so your

1677
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,289
the sort of the

1678
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:44,569
the architectural direction was not parallelizing unix. it was much more fundamental than that.

1679
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,089
um, i want to say yes,

1680
01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:57,289
but it's not that simple. there was a very fundamental aspect of it

1681
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,770
which was to start with

1682
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:02,569
what are the concepts we need to build a parallel

1683
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,530
an an os for a par parallel computer

1684
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,010
and so from that perspective

1685
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,289
we did look at important subsystems

1686
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,049
that hadn't really been done in a way that we thought needed to be done

1687
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,130
excuse me at the os level for threading

1688
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,170
scheduling

1689
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:21,450
virtual memory

1690
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:21,770
management

1691
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,890
some things like that

1692
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,010
um

1693
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,049
but as we got into it very early on

1694
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:31,450
um

1695
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:32,410
mostly

1696
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:33,130
i think

1697
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,650
at rick's urging

1698
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,250
we also integrated unix

1699
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,049
and the reason for that was building an os that's useful is hard

1700
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:43,930
right

1701
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,569
there are many many different layers that you need to build

1702
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,329
and what we figured was there were a bunch of layers

1703
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:54,250
that we didn't care about some of these issues that we wanted to have access to

1704
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,369
like you

1705
01:07:55,379 --> 01:07:57,289
remember the programs a and said and grep

1706
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:57,849
y

1707
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,170
we just want those right

1708
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,809
we don't want to build those from scratch for a parallel word

1709
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:03,450
we just want them

1710
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:04,490
and

1711
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:05,369
uh

1712
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:06,809
so we figured we could leverage unix

1713
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,809
which was getting pretty popular in colleges

1714
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:10,410
um

1715
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,289
not only to get those things but to also have a way to get others to use our research

1716
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:20,649
and so we pursued this strategy of building a whole new core os

1717
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:22,408
which was mock

1718
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:24,569
and then the mock kernel

1719
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:26,009
and then grafting onto it

1720
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,370
bsd unix.

1721
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,089
the whole thing people generally refer to as mock.

1722
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,770
now it occurs to me to ask

1723
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:31,929
i

1724
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,330
um

1725
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,130
maybe i know

1726
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:33,529
the answer is

1727
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,890
where did the name mach come from?

1728
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:36,969
how did you come to name this the project?

1729
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:38,089
okay.

1730
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:38,729
um

1731
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,009
it's one of the things i remember. um

1732
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,569
so there are a bunch of us working on the project. um

1733
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,770
and it didn't have a name.

1734
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:51,929
and one of the things about rochester is it rained a lot

1735
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:53,290
or i mean um

1736
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,810
pittsburgh is it rained a lot. um

1737
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,569
and a bunch of us would go to lunch over at pit

1738
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,330
which was right next door to carnegie melon.

1739
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:04,649
there were lots of good restaurants there. so we go to lunch over at pit almost every day

1740
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,488
and and so rick and me and a couple of the grad students

1741
01:09:08,499 --> 01:09:14,089
maybe a couple of the faculty members were were trying to figure out what name we should pick for this thing.

1742
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,810
and the best we had come up with is

1743
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,689
um

1744
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:19,448
um

1745
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,290
i can't remember what

1746
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,089
the best we came up with,

1747
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,448
but we're all walking along

1748
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:29,370
and we're trying to find acronyms that have multiprocessor in them and computing in them

1749
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,089
and things like that. and we're

1750
01:09:32,099 --> 01:09:32,569
we're failing.

1751
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,130
and as we're walking over one of the bridges, we huge puddles of mud everywhere.

1752
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,370
and we're like walking, look at all this muck. and someone said, " muk,

1753
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:42,569
that should be the name,

1754
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,089
right? multi-user communicating kernel,

1755
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,049
something like that. and we're all just joking about it.

1756
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,009
and so we get back after lunch

1757
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,730
and we're joking with one of the other faculty members who i believe was italian.

1758
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,969
and we're like, " the best we've come up with so far is muk.

1759
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:03,770
" and he heard it as mock.

1760
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,610
he's a great name, mock.

1761
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,290
and so it stuck.

1762
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,730
there was no star wars. i mean, star trek.

1763
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:11,530
uh, no.

1764
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:12,810
that's why i guess it's

1765
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,010
i thought that was the answer.

1766
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:14,969
no.

1767
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:16,330
so, so

1768
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,050
um

1769
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,210
did the idea of the micro kernel exist at that point

1770
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:21,610
or did

1771
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,890
where were you guys in the sort of architectural approach

1772
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:31,050
that that was based on separating things in that way? i i think the answer to that is yes,

1773
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:37,050
if only because accent had already had an architecture sort of like that. um,

1774
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:45,210
and i don't remember if it was a similar time frame, but there there was other work going on.

1775
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,010
i think there's some work at stanford going on or should would go on soon with the v kernel.

1776
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,050
um,

1777
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,730
and there may have been other work going on a little bit later.

1778
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,650
it so it wasn't brand new, but it wasn't old either.

1779
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,090
right. right. and were you thinking i'm trying to remember

1780
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,130
at a certain point

1781
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,489
parallel languages began to emerge. the one i'm thinking of right now is linda,

1782
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,850
but i think that was maybe in the late 80s. were you ahead of all the parallel?

1783
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,409
were there any parallel languages to to design to?

1784
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,730
as far as i can recall,

1785
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,250
we were ahead of the parallel languages.

1786
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,929
and again, we were

1787
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:20,090
we were operating at a level below that anyway.

1788
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:20,650
yeah.

1789
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:21,610
and if anything,

1790
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:27,449
we were trying to provide something that people doing parallel language development could take use of. yeah. yeah.

1791
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,250
um

1792
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,570
and and um

1793
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:31,690
okay,

1794
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:37,050
i guess one of the things we wanted to ask for is sort of a a definition for a general audience of what a micro kernel is

1795
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:40,250
or how you thought about separating function in the in design.

1796
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:50,730
the the simplest way to describe how i think about the separation is you have only the minimal functionality

1797
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,050
that you require in the kernel

1798
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:53,610
in the kernel.

1799
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,130
everything else is out.

1800
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:02,730
and so what that basically means is the basic functions to control the computer itself. um

1801
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,409
which is resource management for the protected resources

1802
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:08,330
um

1803
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,690
the scheduling of the resources

1804
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,730
which is both scheduling of processors and scheduling of memory

1805
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,010
which is the virtual memory part.

1806
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,130
and that's it from a conceptual perspective.

1807
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:22,650
now then reality sets in, right? and you look at things from a performance perspective.

1808
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,050
and so there's all these things

1809
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:32,170
that are now conceptually outside of the micro kernel, file system, networking, even device drivers

1810
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,690
that have logic in them.

1811
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:39,370
um, but what you do is you colllocate them with the kernel for performance reasons

1812
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,810
and that's what exists today.

1813
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,810
okay. yeah.

1814
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:44,570
did

1815
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:49,370
i don't know if we we had talked about this at lunch and the performance issue in particular.

1816
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:50,969
did did you have

1817
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,929
oh, i was actually i was just going to ask sort of what

1818
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,770
what was mach's major advance over accent?

1819
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,650
so, accent had focused on what i would say

1820
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,130
is two

1821
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,050
two

1822
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,010
one idea

1823
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,370
that's almost the same thing

1824
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,090
or two things

1825
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:10,969
that almost one idea

1826
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,890
message passing and virtual memory.

1827
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:13,449
m

1828
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:18,090
and so accented message passing in a certain style

1829
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:24,810
that allowed you to decompose problems into multiple processes that communicate each with each other

1830
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:29,050
and also introduced this notion of what's called copy and write

1831
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:29,530
virtual memory

1832
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,810
where you can send

1833
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,250
you can send

1834
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:33,210
um

1835
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,489
this is important when you

1836
01:13:34,499 --> 01:13:35,050
when you have things

1837
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,130
sharing two processes sharing a lot of data but don't actually have to use it all.

1838
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,290
you could send like 10 megabytes of data in one message without actually sending it

1839
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,969
and it goes copy on write.

1840
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,890
so it only actually copies when the other process writes it.

1841
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,489
and so that and the message passing and they

1842
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:53,530
they kind of go hand in hand.

1843
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:58,810
and we actually did a paper about the duality of virtual memory and message passing at one point. um

1844
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:04,570
that was sort of one of the key things behind accent other than powering a 3m machine. um

1845
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,370
and so we kept that paradigm

1846
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:13,770
but the newer things that we added were the notion of the scheduling of multiple processors

1847
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:15,050
and how you do that

1848
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,370
and we learned a lot over the years on how to do that efficiently

1849
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,489
based on different architectures

1850
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:20,090
um

1851
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,090
and how do you do a virtual memory system

1852
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,050
that supports this copy on write notion in a multipprocessor system

1853
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:30,250
which is much more difficult than a non multipprocessor system. um

1854
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,130
and

1855
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:31,290
and

1856
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:37,210
and then we also did some work with more formalizing the notion of having services

1857
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,650
that aren't in the kernel itself

1858
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,130
even though for optimization reasons they are. those are the the big things. it

1859
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:43,690
you know

1860
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,890
in the grand scheme of things

1861
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:45,929
it doesn't seem like a lot

1862
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,850
but it's pretty profound stuff and important stuff. mhm.

1863
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:55,530
and also to to follow up on sort of this the performance issue. um

1864
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:56,890
so mach 2.

1865
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:02,969
5 was sort of a hybrid micro kernel. so with some things were still in kernel space,

1866
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,810
not everything was in user space

1867
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:09,130
and then mach 3 tried to move everything into user space. um

1868
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,290
but then you mentioned that

1869
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:11,850
you know

1870
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,130
later on

1871
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,090
um

1872
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,130
things kind of move back towards the hybrid model. um

1873
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:18,330
yeah

1874
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,130
so that's a good memory of the version numbers

1875
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,890
i wouldn't have remembered that until you mentioned it.

1876
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:24,730
so 2. 5

1877
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,250
up until 2. 5

1878
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:27,530
um

1879
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,890
we had built everything into a monolithic kernel for performance reasons

1880
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,929
and then the 3. 0 effort was an effort

1881
01:15:33,939 --> 01:15:39,130
which i think actually that happened after i left carnegie melon and was done in part by osf.

1882
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,250
uh

1883
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,090
that was an effort to formally have a micro kernel and have services outside.

1884
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,810
to me that was more of just a research effort

1885
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:52,330
and i don't know that that codebase ever made it into any product anywhere. yeah. okay.

1886
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,330
tell us about the creating the team.

1887
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,130
how big was the team and what your role was in the mock

1888
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,850
the mock group. um

1889
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:00,810
okay.

1890
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,890
so you know that's one of those areas where my recollection differs from other people

1891
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,730
because i know people have told me what they thought the team was and how it worked

1892
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,409
and um

1893
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,489
so this is your oral history. this is my oral history and i'll

1894
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:20,730
i'll annotate it with what others have told me that that may that seem plausible. um

1895
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,730
so i started the team being the first person on the project because i wanted something new

1896
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:30,890
and rick suggested because we had this grant potential. um

1897
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,770
and of course rick was involved as my adviser. um

1898
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,929
but initially he was still mostly involved with accent

1899
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,969
and then as other students started coming in

1900
01:16:38,979 --> 01:16:40,250
they started just joining the team.

1901
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:44,409
but i think initially i was probably spending a little bit of my time on some of the classes i had to get done

1902
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,250
and just kind of poking around on this

1903
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,969
and doing a little bit of investigative work such

1904
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,690
that we could get the grant to have the money um

1905
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,730
and working with deck on getting the actual hardware things like that.

1906
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,730
i know i was working on the microvax

1907
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,250
doing a lot of prototyping before we even had a 78 784.

1908
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,090
um,

1909
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,210
so we had a few other students join the project. um,

1910
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:08,650
i think

1911
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,929
just because they thought it was interesting.

1912
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,210
um,

1913
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,489
being the person that started it, i sort of controlled the codebase.

1914
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,010
now, i've been told i was a benevolent dictator

1915
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,090
when it came to controlling the codebase

1916
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:27,850
and would send pe things back saying it wasn't good enough or all kinds of evil things like that.

1917
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:30,330
i have no recollection of that, so i can neither confirm nor deny.

1918
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:31,370
um

1919
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,210
it's partially believable. um

1920
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,290
but you know

1921
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,210
a few years in we had the

1922
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:43,770
the project was getting large and a few years in we were hiring research staff

1923
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,570
not even students to work on it to do a lot of things.

1924
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,409
it was turning into a big project and i don't know the numbers. it's too long ago

1925
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,890
but you know

1926
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:56,170
we quickly had probably a dozen people on it

1927
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,290
and then

1928
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,330
um

1929
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,969
we started deploying it internally to the department

1930
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,250
where we had people in the department using the software. yeah.

1931
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,130
and and do you remember what part of

1932
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,050
so money came from darpa the first year you were around? you you got

1933
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,370
you were up and running as a funded project pretty quickly.

1934
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,890
i don't know that the money came in the first year.

1935
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,969
i don't remember when it came in, but it came in relatively early. and from ipo,

1936
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,250
do you remember what part of darpa

1937
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,210
by any chance? i do not remember which part of darpa it came in from

1938
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,610
or the was there a program manager who showed up

1939
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,409
or it was

1940
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,370
you just had money.

1941
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,929
i remember we went to a meeting where there were arpa people there.

1942
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:35,929
there may have been some military people there as well,

1943
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,010
maybe even someone in a uniform,

1944
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:42,170
but i it was too long. i don't remember remember the details of it. so

1945
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:42,730
um

1946
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,810
the thing about mock is it got

1947
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,250
you know

1948
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,449
i i out on the west coast as a bite editor

1949
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,929
i knew about mock mach sort of established itself as a sort of

1950
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,409
you know

1951
01:18:54,419 --> 01:18:57,050
future of computing kind of idea early on.

1952
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,530
do you know

1953
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,050
have any idea how that happened

1954
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,370
how it sort of got out into the broader world?

1955
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,810
so couple reasons.

1956
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:09,449
the first reason is because we adopted bsd unix as our interface

1957
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,570
and everybody wanted to use bsd unix already

1958
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,489
at least in academia and we had a better bsd unix

1959
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,489
because we took out some of the looked at people

1960
01:19:22,499 --> 01:19:24,969
we took out some of the pieces of bsd unix they didn't like

1961
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,610
and put in parts that they now liked.

1962
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:28,810
uh

1963
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:29,770
and that's true even today.

1964
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:35,610
if you use freebsd, it's basically the version that we did. we grafted mock stuff into it. um,

1965
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,449
and so it was

1966
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,530
it was easy for people to use it.

1967
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,489
it was, you know, they could use a set and graph. it all worked just like they're used to.

1968
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,010
and the other thing that we did was we wrote research papers

1969
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,290
and went to eustix conferences and other conferences and talked about it.

1970
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,170
um,

1971
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,370
and not only did we talk about it in a research paper, we said, " and oh

1972
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:55,929
by the way,

1973
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,489
here's where you can get a copy of it.

1974
01:19:58,499 --> 01:20:01,770
" and everybody else with a research paper had the research paper

1975
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,130
and oh by the way

1976
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:03,850
that's all we have.

1977
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:09,050
so that was a pretty big difference and it gets back to the whole carnegie melon at that time

1978
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,409
doing everything was very applied.

1979
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,170
you know we thought we were failing if we weren't doing something

1980
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:17,050
that other people could actually not just read about but use.

1981
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:17,530
yes.

1982
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,330
that's an interesting culture. yeah. um

1983
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:20,810
so maybe

1984
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:21,370
um

1985
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,130
we're about an hour and a half in

1986
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:23,370
so

1987
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:26,409
maybe one last question and then we could take a little break. does that does that

1988
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,130
um

1989
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,650
so your view of the significance and the legacy of mark?

1990
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,810
i mean so sort of take it the next step

1991
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:37,210
and how did it change the world? well

1992
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:37,770
boy

1993
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,850
that's a complicated question. um

1994
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,409
i think it changed the world in this

1995
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:44,890
this is

1996
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,370
you know

1997
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:46,890
lots of unintended consequences

1998
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:48,250
perhaps in a good way

1999
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,290
which is

2000
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,050
it's not even about the technology

2001
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,969
it's about the relationships that came.

2002
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,050
so, you know,

2003
01:20:55,060 --> 01:21:02,570
as we were presenting at usnix one time, steve jobs sent some next employee, some next employees,

2004
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:06,409
and they loved what they heard and they found they could play with it, and they did.

2005
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,570
and so they called us up and said, " we want to make this part of the next computer.

2006
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,730
" so that would have been circa 86

2007
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:13,850
87

2008
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,690
86 86 87

2009
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:16,890
right after they formed next.

2010
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,290
yeah.

2011
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:22,090
so really i don't remember which conference they saw us at precisely, but they told us in'87. yeah.

2012
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,170
and then you know

2013
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:24,489
so

2014
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,969
then that caused me and steve to have a great relationship.

2015
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,770
we did everything with next that led to apple

2016
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,810
and i mean the rest is all history.

2017
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,770
so i mean it's almost a non-technical story in that regard.

2018
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,050
so clearly

2019
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,330
i mean we'll get to that

2020
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,650
but there is that thread going into next and apple.

2021
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:41,449
um

2022
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,409
did rick take stuff of mock philosophy

2023
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:50,409
and architecture into microsoft? did it also have an impact in that direction? i don't think so.

2024
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,409
i think it went more the the directions it went in obviously were the next direction.

2025
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,170
there was the osf direction

2026
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:57,210
which was pretty significant.

2027
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,370
there was the bsd direction where they took a little piece of it and then it kind of stagnated.

2028
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,850
those were probably the primary directions.

2029
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,130
there were other companies that used the osf version a little bit.

2030
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:11,290
never never in any kind of meaningful volumes. um

2031
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:16,330
and i think what rick took to microsoft was more his research philosophy just in general.

2032
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:23,290
and he wasn't even necessarily doing os research. he was doing research. yeah. okay. so then um

2033
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:33,050
in terms of the micro kernel, so so all the the major oss that use the mock

2034
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:37,370
or a version of the micro kernel still use the hybrid model that you developed

2035
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,850
and and not sort of the

2036
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:44,730
the whole theoretical absolute separation between um

2037
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:44,969
user

2038
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,889
user space and kernel space programs.

2039
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,610
at least practically like

2040
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:49,850
practically

2041
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:50,650
it's not performant

2042
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,130
enough

2043
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:52,810
right

2044
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,210
so

2045
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,050
as far as i know

2046
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:55,290
today

2047
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,050
the only commercial uses are what apple has today

2048
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,690
which is still what i would call the monolithic kernel

2049
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,449
although it is partitioned a little bit

2050
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:04,489
um

2051
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:07,690
and then the other example would be like freebsd a little bit

2052
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:08,889
um

2053
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,770
but i'm not really aware of anything that uses the mach 3. 0

2054
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,969
i know a pure micro kernel structure today. interesting.

2055
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:15,530
okay.

2056
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,730
i think that was more just a research project that proved it could be done

2057
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:21,210
and today people opt for performance.

2058
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,090
yeah.

2059
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:28,250
if i could just ask one quick question to make sure that i'm understanding the story correctly.

2060
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:36,409
it it seems like at first the mock project was very tied to this new kind of experimental machine,

2061
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,290
you know,

2062
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:41,130
this ganging the four computers together with the shared memory.

2063
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,770
but then it sounds like very quickly

2064
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,290
uh

2065
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,130
the operating system becomes

2066
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:48,489
uh

2067
01:23:48,499 --> 01:23:52,409
not particularly tuned to that parallel experimental machine

2068
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,570
but could be used much

2069
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:55,370
uh

2070
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:55,850
more widely.

2071
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:56,889
is that correct?

2072
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,330
did it lose its particularity

2073
01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,130
or?

2074
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,409
so that is a really good point.

2075
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:00,730
okay.

2076
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:01,530
and let me clarify.

2077
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,730
so initially the project was targeting the va 784.

2078
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:13,370
this cluster of four 780s. but before they could build that, they sent me a microvax

2079
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,130
which was just a vax.

2080
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:20,170
it was a 780 with a small one. little desk. it was, you know, not a desktop

2081
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:20,889
but it was small.

2082
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,330
and so i started programing.

2083
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,010
it had only had one processor in it.

2084
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:27,610
so i started building an os for one where for you know

2085
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:29,290
n processors where n equal one

2086
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,170
okay

2087
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,610
um

2088
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,010
and did work on the 784

2089
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:36,810
later on

2090
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,929
worked on other multipprocessors

2091
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,010
and what we discovered was that what we quickly discovered

2092
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:44,489
and this was a problem for bsd at the time

2093
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,370
um was

2094
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,489
bsd wasn't portable

2095
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:53,130
and so we built something that was portable and so other companies were using other instruction sets

2096
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,969
so, um, encore was using the mips instruction set.

2097
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:01,850
i believe sequent was using maybe the intel instruction set. i can't

2098
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:03,690
i can't remember exactly. um,

2099
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,690
ibm wanted to do things with the rt,

2100
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,210
which was the was that the uh pa risk instruction? no.

2101
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,090
yeah,

2102
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,050
it was pa risk. yeah.

2103
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,090
no, that was hp.

2104
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:12,810
no, no,

2105
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,810
pa risk was was hp.

2106
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:19,850
what was the ibm risk? a trivia power. power. power. yeah. power.

2107
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:20,650
um

2108
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,690
and so so we started building a portable os

2109
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,530
in addition to a multipprocessor os

2110
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,250
and and um

2111
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,130
i remember

2112
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,330
in really early days

2113
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,210
i i was thinking

2114
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,250
you know

2115
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,929
i'm a graduate student

2116
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,889
been there a couple years

2117
01:25:34,899 --> 01:25:37,610
i'm thinking where are all the places we can take this quote

2118
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:38,489
unquote micro kernel

2119
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,889
where we're not going to need all of this heavy functionality that you see in an os today

2120
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,690
and i'm thinking like maybe someday we can put this in a refrigerator

2121
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,050
okay

2122
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,330
this is back in

2123
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:49,210
you know

2124
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:49,770
mid 80s

2125
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,330
right. and i'm thinking to myself, okay,

2126
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:56,010
is this interesting enough if we can sell it for 50 cents a unit?

2127
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,850
right? thinking, nah,

2128
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:04,570
never going to sell that many copies. but but that was the thinking back then. you know,

2129
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:10,010
we were tuned for the 784 initially. um,

2130
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,929
but we knew we were building something beyond that.

2131
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:14,489
we were porting to these other systems. was reporting to the rt

2132
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,290
that was a single processor system but had an inverted page table which no one had ever seen before.

2133
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:20,170
um

2134
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,130
but our vm architecture made it easy to support.

2135
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:24,889
you know we ran on encores,

2136
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,090
we ran on sequence,

2137
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:29,050
we discovered they had different memory architectures where they were,

2138
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:29,449
you know,

2139
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,170
20

2140
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,449
30 processors in them

2141
01:26:31,459 --> 01:26:34,250
and you had to know where the caches were to make things efficient.

2142
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,210
so we were doing all of the above at that point in time

2143
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:37,370
and

2144
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,449
and we didn't just focus on the one thing

2145
01:26:39,459 --> 01:26:42,250
and maybe this is in part why we had so many people that started to work on it.

2146
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,929
yeah, that was the era of mini supers,

2147
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,889
wasn't it? did you become sort of the the

2148
01:26:46,899 --> 01:26:46,969
the

2149
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:47,050
the

2150
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,290
i mean they they needed

2151
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:49,530
they

2152
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:49,770
were

2153
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,530
they were all parallel kinds of machines and did they all pick up

2154
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:53,929
uh

2155
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:54,730
mock?

2156
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:55,610
i

2157
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:56,170
you know

2158
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,449
i think they all had projects with us going on. they all

2159
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,290
they generally ship their own os

2160
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:01,850
okay

2161
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,570
to their customers

2162
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,489
but they're all working with us and they would have people porting

2163
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,889
i don't know that any of them

2164
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,810
i'm some of them probably went commercial with it

2165
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,090
but i'm not really sure yeah

2166
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:14,250
which ones or if there were any meaningful volumes

2167
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,250
but a lot was learned in those years. yeah.

2168
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:17,449
um

2169
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,409
can we start tell us a little bit about your dissertation

2170
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,650
what you focused on and where

2171
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:23,929
okay

2172
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,730
let me remember

2173
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:25,290
oh

2174
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:25,610
yes

2175
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,170
okay

2176
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,330
long time ago. so for my dissertation, i remember

2177
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,210
my plan was to do a dissertation on mock.

2178
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,650
seemed to make perfect sense to me. rick said, " no, you can't do that.

2179
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:45,850
that's way too broad. " but, you know, i i was one that was happy being broad. right.

2180
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:46,489
um,

2181
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,409
so i said, " no, you got to focus more.

2182
01:27:48,419 --> 01:27:55,130
" so, so what i did was i focused on the virtual memory system of of the os

2183
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:56,969
and i focused on

2184
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:58,330
um

2185
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:03,370
what we had done was we had built the first both portable and parallel virtual memory system.

2186
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,489
so that was the focus.

2187
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,610
yeah. okay.

2188
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:09,850
and how does that work? did in terms of when you left and when you got your dissertation

2189
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,130
did you get your dissertation before you decamped

2190
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,290
or did it come after you were at

2191
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,290
well

2192
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,090
um

2193
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,370
you mean the chronology related to when i left carnegie melon.

2194
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:24,889
so you have to have your dissertation done before you can leave.

2195
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:25,290
okay.

2196
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,409
and so the order of events was

2197
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:29,449
um

2198
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,210
you pick your topic

2199
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:31,770
of course

2200
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,090
well

2201
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:32,969
in advance of this

2202
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,610
and then you do the research specific to it

2203
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:36,810
then you write it up.

2204
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,850
it's a massive document

2205
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:43,290
and then you defend it with your thesis committee and then there's more work to do.

2206
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:43,929
they say

2207
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:44,330
great,

2208
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:44,889
good job.

2209
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,210
now make these changes. takes you a few months.

2210
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:47,770
you do those tweaks

2211
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:48,250
and you're done.

2212
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:48,570
yeah.

2213
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,570
besides rick, was there anybody else of note or you a member on your committee?

2214
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:53,610
yes.

2215
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:54,250
um,

2216
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,770
so rick was on my committee,

2217
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:58,489
al spectre was on my committee, uh,

2218
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:02,090
al was a another faculty member, and dennis richie was on my committee.

2219
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,250
okay, that's gold standard. that's good. yeah. um

2220
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:12,489
and and then there's a question here, but maybe in the sort of flip it. um

2221
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,050
you're

2222
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,170
you continued to to work on big systems.

2223
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:22,889
there was this massive explosion of the personal computing world in the first half of the 80s, but i i get the sense aside from you having a macintosh

2224
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,889
that you were in a different world.

2225
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:29,929
you remained sort of in a high performance computing world as opposed to the pc world while you were in graduate school

2226
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:31,370
or i

2227
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:31,610
i

2228
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,770
from a research perspective, i think that's fair.

2229
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:34,810
um,

2230
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:35,370
remember

2231
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:36,250
i did have the microvax.

2232
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:37,610
yeah.

2233
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:38,650
which was

2234
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:43,130
it wasn't as low-end as the macintosh, but it was a personal

2235
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:46,250
it was essentially a personal computer, the personal workstation. yeah.

2236
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:46,810
um,

2237
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:49,929
you know,

2238
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:55,050
it's hard to say why we didn't focus on even the lower level

2239
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:59,690
more personal computer type stuff. um

2240
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,570
there

2241
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:00,810
may

2242
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,489
maybe the hardware wasn't quite ready for what we were trying to do is one of the answers.

2243
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,370
yeah. yeah.

2244
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,130
but i'm not 100 % sure about that.

2245
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:07,530
yeah.

2246
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,770
and then one one more question.

2247
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,090
um

2248
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,449
so while you were there,

2249
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,889
you know, a generation earlier,

2250
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:18,090
darpa used to have these annual meetings at snowbird in which they'd have the faculty who were the researchers

2251
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,530
and then the students would come too

2252
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,530
and it really was a community building exercise.

2253
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,730
had those stopped

2254
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:28,010
by the time you were in on a darpa track? well, if they hadn't, i never got invited to snowbird.

2255
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:32,090
maybe rick went. um, so i don't know.

2256
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:35,530
i do remember going to darpa meetings in washington. yeah.

2257
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:35,850
um,

2258
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:38,650
to talk about what we were doing every once in a while.

2259
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,210
okay. go ahead. one question also.

2260
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:47,690
um, so why did you decide to get a macintosh rather than, you know, an ibm clone? was it

2261
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,250
because of the alto?

2262
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:55,770
and how did you like the mac compared to your alto or compared to your experiences with the alto?

2263
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,570
so, that's a good question.

2264
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,330
let me think about why that might have been the case.

2265
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:11,210
um, i think it's simply that the the macintosh was i mean, we talked about the 3m machine before

2266
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:16,170
and the macintosh was sort of in the vein of the 3m machine

2267
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,570
and the pc was not.

2268
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:24,969
and so this was now a 3m machine that with a student discount i could afford. um

2269
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,850
and so it seemed to make sense to buy it.

2270
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:35,770
and while you were doing this research on on on were you a aware of the other projects

2271
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,170
that were going on at other campuses of the time.

2272
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,130
mips x had started up at um stanford.

2273
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,170
um

2274
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:43,929
there was um

2275
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,489
sun originally started with bealign and um basket at at stanford.

2276
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:54,570
were those on your radar at all before they got out into the commercial world? um

2277
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:02,409
i don't know that those were on our radar screen before they became commercial that much. we

2278
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:02,730
were

2279
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,010
you know

2280
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:09,850
we were being funded to use the deck stuff. other people who were doing things like ibm

2281
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:10,650
for example

2282
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:13,449
were coming in and showing us their stuff with the rt.

2283
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,130
um

2284
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:19,370
i don't recall which of the others had come in. some of them may or may not.

2285
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:19,610
we

2286
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:19,850
were

2287
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:21,690
we were definitely getting a lot more interest

2288
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:27,449
and focusing more on the the bigger guys, the encore as a sequence with the bigger iron.

2289
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,610
and then i was thinking west coast

2290
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,250
and then there were

2291
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:30,409
also

2292
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:31,210
so you were you

2293
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:32,409
you had perk right there

2294
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,969
and then what was the name of the sun competitor in in uh

2295
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:41,050
in cambridge that i'm forget in boston. apollo did

2296
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,409
did they have much contact with with

2297
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:42,969
uh

2298
01:32:42,979 --> 01:32:43,370
you guys?

2299
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:44,650
no

2300
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:45,370
i don't

2301
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:46,489
i mean we were aware of apollo

2302
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:47,850
um

2303
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:50,810
but we never interacted with them. you know i'm trying to think.

2304
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,650
we probably had a meeting or two with them.

2305
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,290
i remember visiting their place maybe once. yeah.

2306
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:55,850
um,

2307
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,810
but nothing really happened all that much.

2308
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:03,130
was data general still alive at that time? i'm trying to remember when they got in trouble.

2309
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:07,370
i think they were irrelevant if they were alive. yeah. yeah. yeah.

2310
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:07,929
um,

2311
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,250
go ahead. were the the mac ports of miss soul command and defender

2312
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:17,210
fairly straightforward and just something fun that you did at home? uh,

2313
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:20,969
the mac ports of those games were mostly fun. um,

2314
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:24,250
the mac,

2315
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:29,530
the mac had reasonable computing power compared to the elto,

2316
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,409
except when you program the elto microode,

2317
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,449
that was hard to be comparable to the mac.

2318
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:45,370
so, um, the ports were relatively straightforward, but i couldn't get around using the os. and uh

2319
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:45,850
i remember

2320
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:53,449
the one big problem i had was i wanted to have sound effects and music in the games. um

2321
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,690
and in the mac

2322
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:02,010
in those days when you turned on the uh sound processor

2323
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,409
it consumed like 50 % or more of the cycles of the computer.

2324
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:06,810
wow.

2325
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,409
and so that put me over the edge where the games didn't work.

2326
01:34:10,419 --> 01:34:16,409
so, i had to override the mac sound driver with my own and then i got it to work.

2327
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:19,850
were these freeware projects? i can't

2328
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:20,570
i can't remember.

2329
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:27,929
um, i had visions of selling both the mac and defender games. and in fact, you know,

2330
01:34:27,939 --> 01:34:29,929
this was sort of the beginnings of people selling software.

2331
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:40,409
and i had a contract with a company in la that was a software publisher. um,

2332
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,969
and they asked me to put some copy protection in, which basically read bad sectors on the disc.

2333
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:45,929
uh,

2334
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:47,210
and then they were going to ship it.

2335
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:50,650
and for some, i think they went out of business before they shipped it. something something like that.

2336
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:52,810
so, i gave it away as freeear.

2337
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:54,409
um,

2338
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:55,850
uh,

2339
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,650
i had a little message. if you like this, send a check to whatever.

2340
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,770
a few checks came in. i think i got

2341
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,130
i think i almost paid for the mac. maybe not quite.

2342
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:07,929
not quite.

2343
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,290
oh, that's that's they come in, you know,

2344
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,130
$ 5, $ 10 at a time. yeah.

2345
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,050
but it didn't seduce you into an open source

2346
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:19,610
i mean a a a program cottage programming lifestyle. shareware. shareware.

2347
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:20,730
yeah. no.

2348
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:21,610
no.

2349
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,010
yeah.

2350
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,409
so now here you are at your next juncture.

2351
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:25,530
um

2352
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:34,889
what was your thought process while you were sort of in the second half of your graduate student career about what you would do after after graduate school? okay.

2353
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:38,090
so let's set the stage.

2354
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:44,010
i'm a happy camper, happy graduate student at carnegie melon, loving what i'm doing. uh,

2355
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,130
i mean, i've got all these computers to myself because i'm writing the os.

2356
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,170
no one else can use them.

2357
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:49,370
um,

2358
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,170
i've got control over this os.

2359
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,650
people come to me to check in things and whatever.

2360
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,850
they look to me for advice on what to do. and we're getting, you know,

2361
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:01,210
people are following what we're doing.

2362
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,969
lots of companies want to use our stuff.

2363
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,250
and i'm just having a grand old time.

2364
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:13,850
and i'm almost falling into the trap of what happened to a lot of carnegie melon grad students, which is they can take six, seven, eight years to graduate.

2365
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:22,570
um, and so i'm probably, let's see, it's probably 90 87 now.

2366
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:24,810
so, i'm in my fourth year

2367
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:30,730
and rick and i come out to the west coast for a meeting at berkeley

2368
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,370
because we're it's berkeley unix conference

2369
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:38,650
and we find out that steve jobs wants to meet with us on our trip.

2370
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,330
um, this is probably this might be 86 actually.

2371
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:48,409
um, so we we come in, we fly in my first time ever to san francisco.

2372
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:56,570
fly into san francisco. rick and i are staying in a not so good hotel just off the airport.

2373
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:57,690
um,

2374
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,610
and we're

2375
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:01,130
we're going to meet steve for dinner.

2376
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:03,050
so, we go over to the next offices on deer creek road

2377
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,010
and we're sitting down in the lobby waiting for steve

2378
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:06,489
and

2379
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:06,969
um,

2380
01:37:06,979 --> 01:37:10,489
so steve comes down all excited. hi guys, how you doing? and shake up

2381
01:37:10,499 --> 01:37:10,730
shake

2382
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,850
shake his hand. oh, i've met you before. that's what he says to me. like, i don't

2383
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:16,090
no,

2384
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,210
you haven't met me before. yeah,

2385
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:17,850
i've met you before.

2386
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,850
like, no, you haven't met me before.

2387
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,969
i'm like, " steve, you know, i'd know if we'd met before.

2388
01:37:22,979 --> 01:37:25,610
" he's like, " no, i know we've met before. " and like, " whatever.

2389
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:28,330
" so, we go have dinner with some of his team

2390
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,170
and they tell us, you know, we we had no re,

2391
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,489
we had no understanding why they wanted to meet with us other

2392
01:37:34,499 --> 01:37:36,489
than we knew they were building a computer for education.

2393
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:37,929
um,

2394
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,530
and we thought they might be interested in what we're doing a little bit

2395
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:42,489
and want to learn about what we're doing.

2396
01:37:42,499 --> 01:37:46,650
and he's like, " well, we want to put your os on our computer.

2397
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:52,090
" i'm like, " what? really? are you kidding? so, he then leaves

2398
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,010
and we still have more dinner with the other guys

2399
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:56,330
and then we go off to our meeting at berkeley

2400
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,570
and i'm thinking, " oh my god, i better finish up

2401
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,449
because these guys want to use this stuff.

2402
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,489
they're going to fail. i'm going to have to help them. " um,

2403
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:05,369
etc.,

2404
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,170
etc., etc.

2405
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:10,010
and it's like the corporate world now needs me is the way i'm thinking.

2406
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,090
so, i get things in order. i finish up the dissertation. and i have my

2407
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:14,250
my

2408
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:14,889
uh

2409
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,250
my defense thesis defense with rick and al and dennis

2410
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,530
and i start interviewing in the meantime

2411
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:22,409
and

2412
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:22,889
uh

2413
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,449
and so you know

2414
01:38:25,459 --> 01:38:28,810
one thing kind of led to the other and ended up going to work for next.

2415
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,409
when did rick go to to microsoft a little? uh

2416
01:38:34,419 --> 01:38:36,250
that was several years after i

2417
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:36,650
oh,

2418
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:37,050
he stayed.

2419
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:37,770
oh, i see.

2420
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,090
yeah,

2421
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:42,409
he was at carnegie melon for several more years. did they try to recruit him as well as you?

2422
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:43,850
um

2423
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,170
rick expressed no interest in a corporate job.

2424
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:52,170
i think they wanted to hire him as a consultant but he wanted to stay independent.

2425
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,730
okay. and do you remember who in in the first dinner

2426
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:57,369
um

2427
01:38:57,379 --> 01:39:00,010
do you remember who uh was like was like bud?

2428
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:00,409
um

2429
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:04,010
bud was there and was doing software at that at that point

2430
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,210
in terms of bud was doing software.

2431
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:05,690
yeah.

2432
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,369
bud was doing software. bud was there

2433
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,489
and i'm not sure who the other guys were that were there.

2434
01:39:10,499 --> 01:39:15,369
i mean, i could guess, but i'd probably be 50 % chance of being right in terms of who was actually there.

2435
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:20,489
yeah. was like, did when did joanna show up on your radar? i don't think i ever met joanna.

2436
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:25,050
really? if i did, i don't remember. was she was she gone by the time? i think so.

2437
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:27,290
wow. wow. by the time you came.

2438
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,850
yeah. i never met her that i know of.

2439
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:30,889
but she was there.

2440
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:32,730
wasn't she there in the early days? i don't know.

2441
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:33,290
i don't think so.

2442
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,050
am i? maybe in the very early days.

2443
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:39,369
i think there some of the those retreats she shows up on those videos.

2444
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:39,770
okay.

2445
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:47,210
yeah. yeah. that all predated me. yeah. i may be confusing things. i got there in'88. yeah. okay. yeah.

2446
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,090
um

2447
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,210
was was michael holly still around? mike

2448
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,250
yeah, mike was there.

2449
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,290
yeah. well, he was kind of in and out. he was always in and out. yeah.

2450
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:56,730
um

2451
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,369
and were there other companies on your radar? yeah.

2452
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:01,770
so,

2453
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:02,570
um

2454
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:06,010
obviously they're saying next is saying they want to use ros.

2455
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:11,690
so obviously they're going to offer me a job if i want it, right? but i knew i had to do a little more diligence.

2456
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:12,409
um

2457
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,090
so i interviewed with microsoft, i interviewed with sun

2458
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,449
and i think that's about it.

2459
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,090
um

2460
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:25,369
if there were other interviews, they might have just been phone calls from people who knew i was looking for a job.

2461
01:40:25,379 --> 01:40:31,050
and like i think apple tried to contact me, but i wasn't interested in interviewing there. yeah.

2462
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:31,610
um

2463
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,969
so those were the the three places that i considered. son was

2464
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:37,850
um

2465
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,250
kind of confused. i mean, i knew some of the people there

2466
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:40,570
like,

2467
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:40,889
you know,

2468
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,250
james gosling was there.

2469
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:42,810
we talked

2470
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:43,530
and stuff like

2471
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:46,969
that, but they never kind of got their act together about what they wanted me to do

2472
01:40:46,979 --> 01:40:47,290
or anything.

2473
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:48,330
um

2474
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:52,570
microsoft was very organized. they wanted to hire me. um

2475
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,730
and nex wanted to hire me.

2476
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,170
so, i had to decide between those two.

2477
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,570
and if you'd gone to microsoft, would it have been

2478
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,850
where was nt at

2479
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:04,650
that point? had nt emerged in the world already? if i had gone to microsoft, nt probably would not have existed.

2480
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,969
or would have been something different. interesting.

2481
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:07,449
yeah,

2482
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:13,130
because they basically hired cutler instead when i didn't go there. cutler came after i interviewed there. interesting.

2483
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,210
and and you know,

2484
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:16,730
my view of microsoft was

2485
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:17,690
um

2486
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:19,929
it was

2487
01:41:19,939 --> 01:41:21,449
it was interesting. um

2488
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:23,130
you know,

2489
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:23,449
it was

2490
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,250
i had a great time talking with bill gates about technology and stuff. he was really into that

2491
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:30,170
and it was non-traditional interview

2492
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:34,330
where he he just wanted to know the work that i had done and the design decisions

2493
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:37,850
and he was giving his inputs and stuff like that. um,

2494
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:41,449
which i found very refreshing. um, i talked to steve balmer

2495
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,929
who was a little more, you know, salesy,

2496
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,250
right? didn't really know what i did.

2497
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:50,889
just knew that other people thought they should hire me. and then i talked to

2498
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,610
i talked to nathan

2499
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,530
nathan mirvald who had all these visions of what was going to happen.

2500
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:58,010
and i i talked to people who worked on doss

2501
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,290
and i talked to people on os2.

2502
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,889
and one of the things

2503
01:42:00,899 --> 01:42:05,770
that i learned as part of the interview process was there were kind of some waring factions

2504
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:10,090
and wasn't clear if they were really committed to os2.

2505
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:14,489
wasn't clear if they wanted me to go fix os2 or do something different.

2506
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:19,130
a lot of these things going on and and it didn't quite gel with me.

2507
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:22,090
so was this before ulen had showed up there too? was

2508
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,210
i can't remember whether i don't remember. yeah. i don't remember.

2509
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,449
so, it just it didn't feel

2510
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:34,409
i mean next had a clear sort of path to putting your software out into the world.

2511
01:42:34,419 --> 01:42:35,690
was that kind of the the

2512
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,010
the sort of if you had to

2513
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:42,090
when you came down to making a decision? why i made the decision? couple things.

2514
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:49,050
one is, you know, this was a chance from the technology perspective to take what i had worked on

2515
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:49,770
and make it successful.

2516
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:55,770
and it wasn't clear to me that that was going to be possible at microsoft.

2517
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,570
at microsoft, it's more you're a good os guy, come help us to build oss.

2518
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:04,889
okay, maybe something new or fix os2 or whatever kind of tbd.

2519
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:06,250
um

2520
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:11,850
there was the classic big company versus startup.

2521
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:17,449
you know, it's like microsoft was a let's say one or two billion dollar market cap company.

2522
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:21,050
then how big could it possibly get, right? who knew?

2523
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:22,090
um

2524
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,130
whereas next was a startup, right? it's gonna

2525
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,929
it's going to grow from where it is. no, no question.

2526
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:28,889
um

2527
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,330
and then,

2528
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:31,210
you know,

2529
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,810
i really enjoyed both bill and steve and interviewing with them, but they were very different kinds of people.

2530
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,210
and um

2531
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:41,770
at the time

2532
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,530
i kind of was more excited to work with someone like steve

2533
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:53,850
because he had not only the technology passion but also you could see he's thinking about how to drive things into markets

2534
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,130
and and stuff like that.

2535
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:56,010
um

2536
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:56,650
whereas

2537
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,409
i love the conversation with bill

2538
01:43:58,419 --> 01:44:01,210
but there was very little about the markets and that and that kind of stuff.

2539
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,170
not that it's bad.

2540
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:03,130
i mean that's who he was.

2541
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:03,530
yeah.

2542
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,170
um

2543
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:07,050
and and but you know of all those factors

2544
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:12,090
i mean the fact that they were using my technology really made a big difference. yeah.

2545
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:13,369
and then i guess you know

2546
01:44:13,379 --> 01:44:14,650
one last point is

2547
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:18,730
and this was something easier for next to do than microsoft

2548
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,250
you know

2549
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:21,449
next being a small company

2550
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,770
steve made it a point to personally try to recruit me. yeah. and he would

2551
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:30,889
he would do the follow-up calls go over the offer letter and i just can't decide. he said

2552
01:44:30,899 --> 01:44:31,130
well

2553
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,010
let me offer you this.

2554
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:34,489
you know what i mean? whereas bill couldn't do that.

2555
01:44:34,499 --> 01:44:36,570
the company was too big for bill to do that.

2556
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:41,850
and you know there there sort of legendary stories about steve walk taking people on recruiting walks.

2557
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:42,570
did you guys

2558
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:47,210
what was the sort of the dance with steve? did you ever like go on a walk with steve while he was

2559
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,010
we did not do a recruiting walk

2560
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:54,570
but that's because just i was in pittsburgh again and he was in paloalto. yeah.

2561
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,010
but, you know, steve,

2562
01:44:56,239 --> 01:45:00,969
what steve did was somehow i think

2563
01:45:00,979 --> 01:45:04,170
that part of, oh, we've met before is part of the whole thing.

2564
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:04,570
i don't

2565
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:04,810
i don't

2566
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:05,610
i don't think that was quite

2567
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:06,889
i think he thought i was someone else.

2568
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:07,770
um

2569
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:09,770
but for example,

2570
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,449
one of the things that he did was

2571
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,770
when i think he identified me as someone he wanted to hire and someone that he knew.

2572
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,650
subsequent to our first meeting in paloalto, he had had

2573
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:26,570
he was on a visit at carnegie melon with again some of his team

2574
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:27,449
and he

2575
01:45:27,459 --> 01:45:30,330
and his team took a bunch of us grad students out for dinner

2576
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,170
and he was just being real nice to me and joking and remember

2577
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:35,050
at the end of the dinner

2578
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:39,210
he said send that guy the bill pointing at me and he would

2579
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:39,290
just

2580
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:39,610
you know

2581
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:42,010
do things like that to be a little more familiar and a little more

2582
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,810
you know

2583
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:43,130
earthy

2584
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:43,770
if you will.

2585
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:44,250
yeah.

2586
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,210
um

2587
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:46,090
so

2588
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:46,489
uh

2589
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,130
had had

2590
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:48,010
um

2591
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:48,810
by the time you joined

2592
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:49,130
had

2593
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:49,690
um

2594
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:49,850
nex

2595
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,330
left deer creek and gone over to redwood city. no.

2596
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,010
so you got there while it was still at

2597
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,449
we're still at deer creek. um

2598
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:57,130
we didn't leave for

2599
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,409
i think at least a year after that.

2600
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:58,810
okay.

2601
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,170
maybe maybe even longer. we

2602
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:04,730
we launched the next product in october of 88 while we were in deer creek.

2603
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:08,889
okay. and so that launch is a famous event. um

2604
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:09,850
uh

2605
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:10,810
what was your role in

2606
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,730
did you develop software for the launch

2607
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:13,770
uh

2608
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:14,810
demo in itself?

2609
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,130
okay. so well

2610
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:19,369
there's the version in this in the jobs movie

2611
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,250
which is not true. um

2612
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,290
and i tried to explain the truth to aaron sorcin

2613
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:27,290
but he obviously didn't listen. um

2614
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,170
so the

2615
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:34,250
i have a vivid memory of the leadup of a part of the leadup to that

2616
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:34,810
which is

2617
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:35,530
um

2618
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:39,130
two or three days before the launch

2619
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:40,650
um

2620
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,969
we were working on the optical drive

2621
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:43,929
and

2622
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:44,889
um

2623
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,530
so i was part of the os team

2624
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,770
chief operating system scientist

2625
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,730
something that gave me this fancy title as a way to entice me to go work there

2626
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,050
smart

2627
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:54,090
um

2628
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:59,770
so i wasn't responsible for the optical driver. i was responsible for more the core of the os.

2629
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:01,210
um,

2630
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:06,409
and it was working pretty well, but the optical driver was unreliable. and um,

2631
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:10,170
i remember the guy working on it, outstanding engineer,

2632
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:11,130
his name is john seammons.

2633
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:12,409
um,

2634
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,050
he was, you know,

2635
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:18,010
burning the midnight oil just trying to get this thing working.

2636
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:23,210
and about three days before the intro, and this has got to work.

2637
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,889
um, i'm like, " okay, i gotta roll up my sleeves and help john.

2638
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:29,449
" so, i dive in with john, fresh eyes on the problem.

2639
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,409
and it was just unreliable.

2640
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,570
and i said, " okay, we got to do something.

2641
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,530
we got to start building reliability tests for the file system so we can figure out

2642
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:41,369
is it a driver problem? is it the file system?

2643
01:47:41,379 --> 01:47:41,770
" whatever.

2644
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:47,130
and so, i built a very simple unix level test to read

2645
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:52,409
and write files in a slightly random way and ran it and it failed immediately.

2646
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:54,730
and i built in logging and stuff

2647
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:56,330
so we could then figure out what was going on. we went

2648
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:56,730
and we

2649
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,010
and we tested

2650
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:00,489
and and we looked at the logs. we figured out the bug.

2651
01:48:00,499 --> 01:48:04,409
great. we fixed it. good. we're all set to launch. let's let's take

2652
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:07,610
but before we do that, let's take the testing to the next level.

2653
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,850
and so he and i kept iterating on these test programs to the point where

2654
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:15,449
um

2655
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:16,330
we

2656
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,170
we finally had a test program

2657
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:23,929
which was basically issuing random file system instructions to the os completely random.

2658
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,130
no program would ever do this just to get it to fail. and we would see these failure modes.

2659
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,409
oh yeah, that's a bug.

2660
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:31,610
and oh yeah, that's a bug

2661
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:37,130
because even though it's random, it should still work, right? and so we finally got it all to work.

2662
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:38,330
and we

2663
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:41,690
i think the two of us worked almost continuously for 48 hours.

2664
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:45,369
wow. to make that work. was it stressful? was that your

2665
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:46,650
i

2666
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,530
i don't remember it being stressful. i just remember being wow

2667
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,010
this is so cool. it's like

2668
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:52,969
i mean it's so hard.

2669
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,929
but i mean these are the hardest kinds of bugs to find.

2670
01:48:57,939 --> 01:49:01,290
i mean i remember before i'd been trying to find bugs in the virtual memory system

2671
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,929
where suddenly your memory isn't right

2672
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,250
and that's all you know is the memory isn't right.

2673
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:10,330
and this could be 5 seconds after it went bad that you discover this.

2674
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:12,090
and how do you discover those bugs?

2675
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,010
and we're working on hard problems like that, which is extremely satisfying.

2676
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,010
but we finally got it to work. yeah.

2677
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:23,530
and and i remember i learned a lesson from that, which is, you know,

2678
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:26,409
all of us engineers think we can write code that works.

2679
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,449
but what you really got to do to test your code is throw garbage at it

2680
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:32,730
and then see what happens.

2681
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,489
when you th throw things at it

2682
01:49:34,499 --> 01:49:36,409
that is what you expect. yes, it works.

2683
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:41,369
but a lot of times developers throw things at it that you didn't expect. yeah.

2684
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:41,929
but that

2685
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,850
so that was the leadup to the to the um intro

2686
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:46,650
from my perspective

2687
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,330
just getting the basic stuff to work.

2688
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:51,770
there's a lot of other stuff going on that i was still helping others with.

2689
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,570
you know, all the demos. you were there. i assume i was.

2690
01:49:54,639 --> 01:50:00,489
and the demos were incredible. yeah. and they all worked. at the actual event at davies hall itself,

2691
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:01,369
were you in the audience

2692
01:50:01,379 --> 01:50:03,290
or were you backstage? i was in the audience.

2693
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:07,610
yeah. okay. now, there's a bit of legend that you can help me with. um, apocryphal.

2694
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,770
i heard that, you know, there was an intermission.

2695
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,610
it was such an an event.

2696
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:15,690
i heard that the machine crashed during the intermission. it was rebooted and it worked

2697
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:21,369
and nobody knew. do you know if that's true? that is possible.

2698
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,650
i don't remember.

2699
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,090
um, i believe there was a hot spare anyway.

2700
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,250
we've always had hot spares for as long as i can remember. yeah.

2701
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:30,570
yeah.

2702
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:31,690
so that you could swap out.

2703
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:32,330
oh, that was

2704
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:33,690
it was supposed to be the luck of steve jobs

2705
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:36,170
that it would happen backstage and no one would know about it.

2706
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,330
you know, bill would always give demonstrations and it would crash during the right.

2707
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:41,530
right. yeah.

2708
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,010
it's it's possible. i don't remember.

2709
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:44,409
yeah.

2710
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:49,130
what was the just your going to next and working there

2711
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:51,369
just sort of top level

2712
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:52,969
this description about,

2713
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:53,369
you know,

2714
01:50:53,379 --> 01:50:56,570
you came from an academic environment, all of a sudden you were thrown into a steve jobs world.

2715
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:04,570
what what was the shift like? um, that's a good question.

2716
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:06,090
let me think about that for a second.

2717
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:09,929
so, for me, a lot of it seemed the same

2718
01:51:09,939 --> 01:51:15,449
because i was just always working hard, trying to make things work, right? um,

2719
01:51:16,239 --> 01:51:21,770
there was probably a little bit more of a feeling of being a part of a a whole team

2720
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,889
that is doing more than just building this os.

2721
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:26,409
i mean, we had people do

2722
01:51:26,419 --> 01:51:27,690
we have bu people building the hardware.

2723
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:31,369
we had people worrying about how to sell it, how to market it. um

2724
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,210
we had hr teams, you know,

2725
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:38,409
we had this whole this whole thing. and we also had um

2726
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:46,489
a different level of sort of frenzy in terms of it's actually going to work.

2727
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:47,610
this is not research.

2728
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,090
this is something people are going to pay for

2729
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:53,050
and we actually have deadlines, right? so

2730
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:57,610
when we announced that october 17 or something announcement, it was going to be announced

2731
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:02,570
then we weren't going to change that. and so we had to work 24 by7 to make it work

2732
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:06,489
at least well enough for the demo. there was a famous wall street journal story

2733
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:07,290
um

2734
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:10,010
which quoted a pr woman in the first paragraph.

2735
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,409
kathy cook was an outside pr woman.

2736
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:18,730
she was quoted as saying, " they're carrying them out in body bags to describe how hard you guys were working.

2737
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:22,889
" do you remember that? and it created quite a stir outside the company.

2738
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:24,650
i don't know what it was like inside the company.

2739
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:30,409
there were no body bags. there were no beds inside. um

2740
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:37,369
but i remember my personal work habit was to work as long as i could, go home

2741
01:52:37,379 --> 01:52:37,770
and sleep,

2742
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:40,570
and then come back in and work as long as i could, no matter what the time was.

2743
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:40,889
yeah.

2744
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:45,050
and i remember there were many of us who would be working all night

2745
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:47,449
and then we'd go to denny's at 3 : 00 a.

2746
01:52:47,459 --> 01:52:50,570
m. to get some food and then go back and work some more. yeah.

2747
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:52,409
and then go home at 7 : 00 a. m.

2748
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,690
8 a. m. sleep a little bit

2749
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:54,250
then come back.

2750
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,090
were you single at that point? of course.

2751
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,690
and when you came out to the valley, where did you live initially? i

2752
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:02,489
uh

2753
01:53:02,499 --> 01:53:04,889
i lived in mountain view. had a small apartment in mountain view. yeah.

2754
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:06,250
so so it was

2755
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:06,730
it was

2756
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:07,369
uh

2757
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:11,050
it was a hacker's existence basically. it was a hacker's existence and i loved it. yeah.

2758
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,770
and so you came out with that title.

2759
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:19,290
were you responsible for nextep? is that the right way to describe your your initial role? not initially.

2760
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,849
initially i was responsible for the core os

2761
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:23,530
which was in

2762
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:23,770
well

2763
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:24,010
initially

2764
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:26,330
i was an engineer. okay. i was one engineer of several.

2765
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,290
um

2766
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:27,929
you know

2767
01:53:27,939 --> 01:53:30,090
they looked up to me because it was my code base. a lot of it was

2768
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,050
um

2769
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:33,290
but i was responsible basically for making sure

2770
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:37,929
that what we had built at carnegie melon had been ported to the next computer.

2771
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:39,449
it worked.

2772
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,010
then you know

2773
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,330
like a year later i took over the whole os group

2774
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:47,290
which me meant only the compiler and a few other things

2775
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,610
and then i ultimately took budge job.

2776
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:50,170
yeah.

2777
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,770
yeah. and architecturally

2778
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,770
this was a 6840 6820

2779
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:54,730
i can't remember.

2780
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,050
uh

2781
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:56,170
i think it was a 30

2782
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:56,570
60

2783
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:56,969
6830

2784
01:53:57,679 --> 01:53:58,330
25 meghertz

2785
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,650
and the perk had been a mini computer

2786
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:03,610
or it had been a microprocessor

2787
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:04,170
bas

2788
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:05,050
i think the perk was

2789
01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:05,449
uh

2790
01:54:05,459 --> 01:54:06,090
custom architecture.

2791
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:06,810
yeah.

2792
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:07,290
yeah.

2793
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:11,050
so, this was your first real experience with the 68, 000 family

2794
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:11,770
or oh, no.

2795
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:14,090
you've been a mac programmer, so you you knew it pretty well.

2796
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:16,250
i had been a mac programmer myself, but we had

2797
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:16,409
never

2798
01:54:16,419 --> 01:54:20,090
i don't think we'd ever ported mach to the 68, 000 series. yeah.

2799
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:20,889
but i was

2800
01:54:20,899 --> 01:54:21,290
i mean,

2801
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:24,570
being a mac programmer meant i knew the instruction set.

2802
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:27,610
that was probably an advantage. but i had never done os level stuff

2803
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,849
and the mac didn't even have virtual memory in it.

2804
01:54:29,859 --> 01:54:32,730
yeah. so, we were working at a very different level. yeah.

2805
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,409
and and did the

2806
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:34,889
you know

2807
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,810
steve had taken this team or a port

2808
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:37,369
you know

2809
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,330
some version of this team through this drill before with the macintosh

2810
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:41,610
um

2811
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,010
they

2812
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,369
he'd sort of run this drill once

2813
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:43,770
well

2814
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,650
several times before

2815
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:45,130
but the

2816
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:45,369
the

2817
01:54:45,379 --> 01:54:45,770
you know

2818
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:49,050
the mac experience was this very sort of dramatic and well

2819
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:49,369
doumented

2820
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:51,130
was

2821
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:51,369
there

2822
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,489
did you feel like there was mac culture still in the next organization

2823
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,369
or he built another kind of culture at that point

2824
01:54:58,800 --> 01:54:59,050
um

2825
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:00,650
there was a little bit of matt culture

2826
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:06,409
but i saw that more from the perspective of everyone who wasn't an engineer was using a mac.

2827
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:08,650
so if they email

2828
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:09,130
well

2829
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:10,730
actually there wasn't much email back then

2830
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,849
but they were doing desktop publishing on their macs

2831
01:55:13,859 --> 01:55:14,969
or whatever they did

2832
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:17,210
they were doing pretty much on their macs.

2833
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:20,730
only the engineers had the actual computers because they didn't quite work.

2834
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:21,849
um

2835
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:25,050
and so you know

2836
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:26,250
you have to remember

2837
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:28,570
i didn't know what the mac culture was back then anyway.

2838
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:30,810
so i can't say for sure if it was

2839
01:55:30,820 --> 01:55:31,210
or it wasn't.

2840
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:34,250
and i'm sure some things were similar, some things weren't. yeah. yeah.

2841
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,770
and did you get involved in as as you got in on the project

2842
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:43,050
and got more responsibility, did you have at any point responsibility for some of the higher levels of the stack, the app kit,

2843
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:43,530
um,

2844
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:45,050
interface builder, um,

2845
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:45,929
next step layers

2846
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:46,489
or was that?

2847
01:55:46,499 --> 01:55:46,730
yeah.

2848
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:48,650
so, i don't remember what year it was,

2849
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:52,889
but um, when i became vp of software, i had all that stuff.

2850
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:56,969
yeah. and and um sort of just roughly scale

2851
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:57,690
when you came

2852
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:58,969
how many people were doing software

2853
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:00,409
and as you sort of

2854
01:56:00,419 --> 01:56:00,810
how did it

2855
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:02,090
how did it grow over time?

2856
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:04,570
okay, so when i got there

2857
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:09,449
the company was probably 70 people. um

2858
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,650
i was employee 80some

2859
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,810
and i assume a few people had left. um

2860
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,050
and most of the people were in engineering

2861
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:19,290
um

2862
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:22,810
and they were probably roughly evenly split between hardware and software.

2863
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:23,929
yeah.

2864
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,690
exact numbers, who knows?

2865
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:26,090
yeah.

2866
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:29,369
so, maybe 25 software, 25 hardware,

2867
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,610
then everybody else in, you know,

2868
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:33,610
finance and marketing and sales,

2869
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:37,929
things like that. how big was the os team? um,

2870
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,330
the os team was probably three or four people.

2871
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:43,610
wow. yeah.

2872
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:47,369
i have two very clear memories of steve giving me factory tours.

2873
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,290
once i got a tour of the mac factory

2874
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,369
and once i got a tour of the next factory

2875
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:52,170
which was

2876
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:52,889
both of them

2877
01:56:52,899 --> 01:56:53,929
actually were highly automated.

2878
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:54,810
you know

2879
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:57,530
this is 85 83 to 87

2880
01:56:58,719 --> 01:56:58,969
88.

2881
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:03,610
did you involve yourself with the factory at all? not really.

2882
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:04,250
um

2883
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:06,810
we'd have meetings over there every once in a while

2884
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,969
just you know i was part of the executive team.

2885
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:09,849
um

2886
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,770
so once a month

2887
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,010
or so

2888
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:14,889
we'd have our executive team meeting over there just to keep them connected

2889
01:57:14,899 --> 01:57:16,570
and so we were aware what was going on.

2890
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:20,330
but i didn't work with them really. not really at all.

2891
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,929
yeah. you

2892
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:22,250
you

2893
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:22,330
you

2894
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:26,730
this was not hollywood, but this was sort of silicon valley's equivalent of

2895
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:29,449
that world, but it was just intense interest at that time

2896
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,130
sort of from when steve started

2897
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:31,610
to

2898
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:32,730
you know,

2899
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:34,570
everybody wanted to know what was going on next.

2900
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:38,250
did that affect you at all? it didn't affect me at all.

2901
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:40,090
and you know,

2902
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:47,050
it's probably because i was so focused on the work, right? and it dominated everything

2903
01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:48,409
and

2904
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:49,530
um

2905
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:51,290
it

2906
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:51,770
just it

2907
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:52,090
just,

2908
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:52,570
you know,

2909
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:54,889
it wasn't on my radar. now, yeah,

2910
01:57:54,899 --> 01:57:59,449
i mean, sometimes i'd be out at dinner and maybe i'd be with steve

2911
01:57:59,459 --> 01:58:02,650
and people would recognize us and ask us things that are going on or whatever,

2912
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:07,449
but that was not necessarily the norm. that was just on occasion.

2913
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:08,090
yeah.

2914
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:12,409
so there were these kind of myths that drove silicon valley. um

2915
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:13,130
um

2916
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:13,449
you know

2917
01:58:13,459 --> 01:58:15,050
going all the way back to alan k's dynabook

2918
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:15,929
um

2919
01:58:15,939 --> 01:58:16,570
sort of this notion

2920
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:16,889
and

2921
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:17,849
and you know

2922
01:58:17,859 --> 01:58:18,969
during the macintosh days

2923
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:22,969
steve probably expressed it best when he referred to the personal computer as a bicycle for the mind

2924
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,290
and then he was clearly doing that with next.

2925
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:29,130
i mean it was clearly in line with that kind of you know tool to learn

2926
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:31,369
and and do science and all of that stuff.

2927
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,369
did did that capture you? um

2928
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,010
i mean

2929
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:34,250
were

2930
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:38,969
were you sort of in that kind of worldview and yes and no.

2931
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:42,330
but you know, i was an engineer, okay?

2932
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:47,130
and i was like, let's i mean, i love the technology, but i'm like, let's get this to work.

2933
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:53,050
and the other people can worry about these grand visions, okay? but i'm like, this is so cool.

2934
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:56,650
i want to make this work. i remember the first time i got audio to work.

2935
01:58:57,199 --> 01:58:59,690
i had no grand vision of what was going to happen with audio

2936
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:03,770
and computers, okay? but one day, the hardware guys gave me a board.

2937
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:06,810
they said, " we think audio works on this board. can you make it work in the os?

2938
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:10,170
so, i spent a couple days and did. i'm like, this is so cool. yeah.

2939
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:10,570
and

2940
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:17,130
and you know, i was always the type of person who was, okay, what's the task at hand? how do we get it done? how do we push

2941
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:19,369
that envelope a little bit more? right.

2942
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,449
and the grand vision will take care of itself.

2943
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:22,489
interesting.

2944
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:23,849
but then you

2945
01:59:23,859 --> 01:59:24,409
you moved

2946
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,050
as you moved up and became a vice president, um

2947
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:27,849
did you get

2948
01:59:27,859 --> 01:59:32,650
did you get involved in the strategy component of sort of where next was going as a company

2949
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:32,969
much

2950
01:59:32,979 --> 01:59:34,250
or absolutely.

2951
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:36,250
and and i would say

2952
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:37,369
um

2953
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:41,290
i had a chance to do that well before i became a vice president.

2954
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:42,409
first of all,

2955
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:43,530
we were a small company.

2956
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,650
second of all, i had formed a good relationship with steve

2957
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:48,250
and the rest of the management team early on

2958
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:49,050
because of my role.

2959
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:53,849
so, they didn't look at me as your run-of-the-mill engineer they hired to work on, you know,

2960
01:59:53,859 --> 01:59:54,889
piece of software x.

2961
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:57,849
so, i always had really great access.

2962
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:00,969
like i said, i was part of the executive team even though i wasn't a vp,

2963
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:02,650
which is kind of unusual.

2964
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:03,369
yeah.

2965
02:00:03,379 --> 02:00:06,570
so, i'd get to go in and listen to what was going on. and, you know,

2966
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:07,050
to be honest,

2967
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:11,050
in those early years, i was more in learn mode than anything else.

2968
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:16,090
like, here's all these really great guys who know what they're talking about. i'm learning from them. yeah.

2969
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,570
i have to tell you from the outside,

2970
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:20,810
i always thought of you as one of the executive team.

2971
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,369
i mean, i'm just thinking back on next.

2972
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,570
if i think of who the key guys were next, you were

2973
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:27,530
you were,

2974
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:27,929
you know,

2975
02:00:27,939 --> 02:00:28,969
that's the way it looked from the outside.

2976
02:00:29,199 --> 02:00:32,969
well, and that's because i had an unusual role as an engineer.

2977
02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:35,369
i quickly did become a manager and a director.

2978
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:39,929
and from day one, they used me externally to talk about things.

2979
02:00:39,939 --> 02:00:45,050
so when we would do a conference, i would be a speaker and i would talk about different things.

2980
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:47,610
so, so i did have some of that role. yeah.

2981
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:48,969
and then,

2982
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:50,409
you know,

2983
02:00:50,419 --> 02:00:55,369
steve cultivated the higher education community deciduously before and then during.

2984
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:57,530
did he use you in, you know,

2985
02:00:57,540 --> 02:00:59,530
going out outreach to the higher education community

2986
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:04,010
and were you involved in that sort of dance that went on a little bit? um,

2987
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,050
you know,

2988
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:09,770
obviously computer science departments were a pretty good target for us.

2989
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:14,969
and so when there'd be an interesting computer science department to visit, they would make use of me. um,

2990
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,409
and even beyond education,

2991
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:17,130
when we

2992
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:21,770
when we diversified to more customers, the salesforce used me quite a bit. yeah.

2993
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:26,730
and so just i'm trying to remember there were

2994
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:30,330
there were bunch of interesting people who were part of the the next team

2995
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:31,530
and one person who came down

2996
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:32,650
um

2997
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:33,849
from reed

2998
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:34,810
um

2999
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:36,889
was a physicist. i'm trying to remember

3000
02:01:36,899 --> 02:01:43,690
i'm blanking richard crannle. crannle did he very good friend of mine. did he work with you? so richard

3001
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:45,690
so i don't know if you know

3002
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,369
but richard died a few years ago. i do. i do.

3003
02:01:47,379 --> 02:01:47,530
um,

3004
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:48,330
sadly,

3005
02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:49,369
um,

3006
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:54,090
richard was probably my best friend at next.

3007
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:54,889
okay.

3008
02:01:55,199 --> 02:01:59,369
and and you know, so my best friends at next were were were richard and steve.

3009
02:01:59,679 --> 02:01:59,929
yeah.

3010
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:06,889
and re this great story about richard. when i arrived at next

3011
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:12,170
for my first day in paloalto in april of 88

3012
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:16,409
and i flew in to san francisco. um

3013
02:02:17,199 --> 02:02:18,570
i think they put me up in a

3014
02:02:18,580 --> 02:02:20,730
they probably put me in a hotel for the night

3015
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:25,290
and it was evening and i had nothing to do

3016
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:26,810
so i said i'll go into the office.

3017
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:29,770
so, it's like 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock at night

3018
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:34,330
and i'm going into the office and i go in there and i find richard

3019
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:38,889
and he was the only one there and we just hit it off

3020
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:39,690
and

3021
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:40,730
um

3022
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:41,849
you know

3023
02:02:41,859 --> 02:02:45,050
from then on we were just like best friends. yeah.

3024
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:50,170
and what kinds of things did he do inside next? i i always thought of him as sort of outward facing to the educational community.

3025
02:02:50,239 --> 02:02:57,610
did did he do design stuff too? so richard was our karajin. he would always find things wrong.

3026
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:02,489
and that day, that night, i went in and met him for the very first time.

3027
02:03:02,499 --> 02:03:04,409
he's like, " who are you? what are you doing here? "

3028
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:06,810
and i explained to him, " i'm brand new.

3029
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:09,690
" he said, " oh, well, you should know everything's broken.

3030
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:13,290
" and that was typical richard cranle.

3031
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:15,130
and so what richard would do

3032
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:15,770
is

3033
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:16,489
um

3034
02:03:16,499 --> 02:03:19,130
he was an education ambassador. um

3035
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:22,889
and so he would write educational apps. yeah.

3036
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:27,369
and what he would do is he would force us to make sure everything below that worked.

3037
02:03:28,239 --> 02:03:29,690
so he would try to push the envelope.

3038
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:34,489
and so his role from an engineering perspective was to say, " well, this doesn't work

3039
02:03:34,499 --> 02:03:35,369
and i need to use it.

3040
02:03:35,379 --> 02:03:37,369
" and he was a physicist by trade.

3041
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:40,489
so he didn't always do things the way they were intended to be done.

3042
02:03:40,499 --> 02:03:44,650
so we'd find interesting things based on him trying to use things. um,

3043
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:46,570
but then he did have a big outward role, too.

3044
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:51,290
i mean, he was part of that first keynote demoing some of the apps that he had written. um

3045
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:54,170
very smart guy, very interesting to be around.

3046
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:57,449
so that you showed up in april of 88

3047
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:01,130
and the computer was introduced in october of 88,

3048
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,090
right? okay.

3049
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:05,770
and at that point, i'm trying going back in history

3050
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:06,010
now

3051
02:04:06,239 --> 02:04:07,050
when you launched

3052
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:10,010
it was still an educational strategy and ed educational

3053
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:10,810
you were

3054
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:14,730
steve had found a way to carve out the space for himself where he wasn't directly competing

3055
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:16,010
or you know

3056
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:20,730
he said he wasn't directly competing against apple and sun and ibm, right? what did it look like?

3057
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,610
what did it feel like inside the company in terms of

3058
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:26,090
that strate market strategy? that's exactly what we thought too.

3059
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:26,810
um

3060
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:34,330
i mean we knew we were building a general computer, right? but we always thought of our primary market, maybe not only market, but our primary market is education.

3061
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:34,969
yeah.

3062
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,849
and are there sort of attributes of the

3063
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:40,570
you know there

3064
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:43,449
sort of those those little vignettes you gave of like meeting with

3065
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:44,409
uh

3066
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:49,290
meeting with rick or working around the clock? describe next culture.

3067
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:50,250
um,

3068
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:52,170
is there anything else that was sort of emblematic

3069
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:52,810
of

3070
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:54,409
i mean now we know google culture.

3071
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:56,010
what was next culture like?

3072
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:57,929
so we did have a little bit of

3073
02:04:57,939 --> 02:04:59,449
i mean there you

3074
02:04:59,459 --> 02:04:59,449
you

3075
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:00,489
in retrospect

3076
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,290
there was a bunch of us that worked in my mold

3077
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,690
but we also had some people who were married and didn't work that way.

3078
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:09,290
they worked the more nineto-five job

3079
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:10,170
and there's a little bit

3080
02:05:10,180 --> 02:05:10,330
of

3081
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:14,570
you know we didn't always get along or see eye on a lot of those things

3082
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:15,210
just a little bit

3083
02:05:15,220 --> 02:05:17,369
but at the end we all pulled together and knew what we were doing

3084
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:18,570
but you know

3085
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:22,250
we believed we were on a mission and we were building

3086
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:23,050
i mean this

3087
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:25,290
what we built was incredible for the time

3088
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:26,330
and we knew that

3089
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,010
and we just knew we had to make it work

3090
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:28,969
and

3091
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:29,770
uh

3092
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:30,969
we knew that we were

3093
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:31,849
you know

3094
02:05:31,859 --> 02:05:33,449
setting the stage for everything to follow afterwards

3095
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:34,570
and

3096
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:36,170
and so we all knew we're on a mission

3097
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:36,810
just in general

3098
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:39,449
working really hard. now, it was also very stressful

3099
02:05:40,159 --> 02:05:41,929
because it was a lot to get done quickly

3100
02:05:42,239 --> 02:05:45,369
and a lot of new things that we were inventing, things that had never been done before.

3101
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,170
it described the optical drive. you know,

3102
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:49,290
no one had ever done that before

3103
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:51,130
and it had some hard things

3104
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:54,810
where you don't just write the optical drive, you erase it, you write it,

3105
02:05:54,820 --> 02:05:56,650
and then you verify it every time you write.

3106
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:58,570
and that had never been done before.

3107
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:05,210
and to take an existing os and make it work in that model efficiently was not trivial. yeah,

3108
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:09,369
there was so much i remember when that was one of the points of skepticism about

3109
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:12,090
you know there was a performance point of skepticism around optical

3110
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:15,770
and what did i mean outside there you you

3111
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:18,090
it was sort of show me and where

3112
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:23,050
where did what did it look like inside from a sort of well

3113
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:24,409
we were all worried about it too

3114
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:25,530
um

3115
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:26,170
no question

3116
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,730
and but you know

3117
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:29,210
when you're an engineer

3118
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:31,610
you try and solve it right

3119
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:32,250
and so okay

3120
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:35,369
we know that writing is incred incredibly slow.

3121
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:36,570
okay.

3122
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:42,010
so, what are we going to do to minimize the rights and you just try and make it work?

3123
02:06:42,079 --> 02:06:42,329
yeah.

3124
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:46,730
and in the end, it was a limitation and we put in a hard drive. yeah.

3125
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:49,610
let's see. did it ever ship with the optical?

3126
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:51,369
i can't remember at what point it did. it did.

3127
02:06:51,379 --> 02:06:52,969
it did ultimately. yeah, i think so.

3128
02:06:52,979 --> 02:06:53,530
yeah. yeah.

3129
02:06:54,079 --> 02:06:57,929
and did you was one of the tricks using cache to get around the low?

3130
02:06:58,239 --> 02:06:58,489
yeah.

3131
02:06:58,499 --> 02:07:05,449
i mean, they're all standard tricks, right? caching, having higher level software be aware of what it's doing.

3132
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,250
did you realize that you're writing all this data? oh, no.

3133
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:08,650
i didn't

3134
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:09,610
i didn't need to do that.

3135
02:07:09,679 --> 02:07:16,969
yeah, it's things like that. do did you have much interaction? there was an early app developer, i think.

3136
02:07:16,979 --> 02:07:18,650
was it called lighthouse software that jonathan

3137
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:20,329
um schwarz

3138
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:22,090
was the lighthouse design?

3139
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:22,889
lighthouse design.

3140
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:23,290
that's right.

3141
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:24,010
yes, lighthouse design.

3142
02:07:24,020 --> 02:07:24,409
i know

3143
02:07:24,419 --> 02:07:24,570
jonathan,

3144
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:30,409
you brought them in early and and well, so i don't know.

3145
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:33,929
i mean, they were in pittsburgh. they're

3146
02:07:33,939 --> 02:07:35,290
i think they're all carnegie bell people

3147
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:36,489
and they loved the next

3148
02:07:36,499 --> 02:07:37,530
and they started building apps

3149
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:41,690
and we took note of people building apps, especially good apps like they were building.

3150
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:45,369
yeah. so, um

3151
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:46,570
did you there

3152
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:51,290
there was kind of a small talk like dynamic object-oriented lang language.

3153
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:57,050
were you involved? did you get involved in the at the language level? was a little bit a little more so

3154
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:58,329
when i became manager of the group

3155
02:07:58,339 --> 02:07:59,290
because i was part of the compiler.

3156
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:01,929
you're talking about objective c. objective c. yeah.

3157
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:02,329
um

3158
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:04,409
it was basically the c language

3159
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:08,170
with a little bit of small talk sprinkled in is the best way to think about it. yeah.

3160
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,489
exists today. people use it. people still use it today for ios. yeah.

3161
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:16,090
and is it it's still called objective c in yes.

3162
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:16,650
yeah. yes.

3163
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:17,690
yeah.

3164
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:18,570
um

3165
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:23,849
so one of the questions was that we had heard that at various points

3166
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:28,329
c + + and even display postcript were considered for the development language of next step.

3167
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:32,570
were there sort of steps along the way to so the

3168
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:36,090
the language for the screen was was display postcript wasn't

3169
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:37,290
that is what it was.

3170
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:38,010
yeah. um

3171
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:39,770
and that was also profound. yeah.

3172
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:40,250
um

3173
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:42,250
and and even today

3174
02:08:43,199 --> 02:08:43,449
um

3175
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:49,530
on a mac or an iphone, it's basically pdf is what's going on.

3176
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:52,409
it's a pdf-like thing. so postcript is still the pdf.

3177
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:58,250
so that model still continues today. for the c + + issue, um

3178
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:03,770
we never considered c + + as a development language for the os itself, for next step itself.

3179
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:07,130
but at some point we had been so beat up

3180
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:08,329
by people saying they wanted to use c + +.

3181
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:11,849
we built a version of c + + we called objective c +

3182
02:09:11,859 --> 02:09:11,849
+

3183
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:15,050
which let it coexist with objective c.

3184
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,730
never got used very much.

3185
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:22,969
it became more of a checklist item for certain customers who wanted it but it was never a mainstream language for next.

3186
02:09:23,199 --> 02:09:23,449
yeah.

3187
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,010
yeah.

3188
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:24,889
um

3189
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:28,090
at some point you ended up working with mr. stallman.

3190
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:28,889
um

3191
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:30,810
was richard in the loop

3192
02:09:30,820 --> 02:09:35,130
and what is it like to try to collaborate with richard stallman?

3193
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:39,130
so we collaborated with richard stallman because we used

3194
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:39,690
uh

3195
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:40,489
his compiler gcc

3196
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:42,090
and

3197
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:43,050
um

3198
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:50,170
so had dinner with him a few times. always an interesting experience. very smart guy, very non-traditional though.

3199
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:50,570
yeah.

3200
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:50,969
uh

3201
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:52,010
very set in his ways.

3202
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:52,650
um

3203
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:56,810
and you know we were very appreciative of the work that he had done

3204
02:09:56,820 --> 02:09:59,290
and we wanted to be a good steward of what he had done.

3205
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:00,489
working hand

3206
02:10:00,499 --> 02:10:00,650
inand

3207
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:01,130
with him

3208
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:01,849
giving back changes

3209
02:10:01,859 --> 02:10:02,810
we had made suggestions

3210
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:04,969
and just that was

3211
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:05,530
you know

3212
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:05,849
we never

3213
02:10:05,859 --> 02:10:07,290
i never worked directly with him

3214
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:10,170
but i helped to facilitate the relationship a little bit

3215
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:14,090
we had some engineers who worked more closely with him and his team

3216
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:14,969
is what i would say

3217
02:10:14,979 --> 02:10:15,130
also

3218
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:17,290
you want

3219
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:17,929
oh yeah

3220
02:10:17,939 --> 02:10:18,730
i was curious

3221
02:10:19,119 --> 02:10:23,610
as how did you decide to use objective c as the as the

3222
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:26,329
the basis for all of the frameworks

3223
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:31,210
so the decision to use objective c was done prior to me arriving at next

3224
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:38,329
and the fundamental reason for it was the team wanted to use object or object-oriented programming

3225
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:40,170
and there weren't a lot of choices.

3226
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:43,690
so you could use small talk and never have a product that ships,

3227
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:45,770
right? uh

3228
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:52,889
or you could use c + + and not really have object-oriented programming. you would have object-oriented sugar syntax

3229
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:53,849
and that was it.

3230
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,849
so, objective c was the only real object-oriented programming that existed,

3231
02:10:57,859 --> 02:10:59,610
at least language for it.

3232
02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:01,369
yeah. yeah. okay.

3233
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:02,409
um,

3234
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:07,210
so ultimately you were able to build this hybrid of open and proprietary

3235
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:10,250
which continued on into the into the apple

3236
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:11,290
where you know you

3237
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:11,929
you were leveraging

3238
02:11:13,199 --> 02:11:13,449
um

3239
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:16,170
you were leveraging an an open-source community

3240
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:20,810
and and you know sort of the best of both worlds in this hybrid way.

3241
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:21,530
um

3242
02:11:22,079 --> 02:11:27,050
was that strategic? i mean did you set about to do that as a as a strategic direction?

3243
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:28,650
um

3244
02:11:29,199 --> 02:11:29,449
yes

3245
02:11:29,459 --> 02:11:30,010
and no.

3246
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:30,650
um

3247
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,369
there was a feeling

3248
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:35,130
that there were areas

3249
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:42,010
that we would adding we would have just incredible added value for things

3250
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,090
that were brand new that should be kept proprietary

3251
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:45,449
and and unique.

3252
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:49,369
but other areas you didn't need to do that. so,

3253
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:50,170
you know,

3254
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:50,409
networking,

3255
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:52,570
why wouldn't you support tcp ip

3256
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:57,530
and be open, right? there's no reason to have a whole new separate networking language, if you will.

3257
02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:00,969
and so, that was sort of the general thinking.

3258
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:06,170
um, and the nature of our business was we had many things

3259
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:10,090
where interoperability or reuse was more important than being proprietary

3260
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:14,889
and other areas where you could do something where proprietary really wasn't going to hurt you

3261
02:12:14,899 --> 02:12:16,730
and it added a lot of value and had a lot of differentiation.

3262
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:17,610
yeah.

3263
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,570
very pragmatic then. it's very pragmatic. yeah. yeah.

3264
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:21,050
i remember

3265
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:22,170
um

3266
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:24,489
sort of after you guys got os 10 up

3267
02:12:24,499 --> 02:12:26,570
and running, bud came to give a talk at berkeley once

3268
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:27,290
and at some point

3269
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:31,449
like half of the lines in the code of os 10 he said were open source.

3270
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:32,889
i mean i was just struck

3271
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:35,369
the number was that large. um

3272
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,130
that does not surprise me. yeah.

3273
02:12:37,140 --> 02:12:39,369
and and it's because there's a very large unix core

3274
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:40,650
um

3275
02:12:40,660 --> 02:12:42,409
that's basically these days all open source.

3276
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:45,449
and actually we we open sourced our version of it as well. yeah.

3277
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:46,730
um

3278
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:47,210
and you

3279
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:47,610
um

3280
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,090
so i think you you've kind of answered

3281
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:53,449
you have this practical view of open source. um

3282
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:56,010
in terms of getting of shipping

3283
02:12:56,159 --> 02:12:56,730
next step

3284
02:12:57,199 --> 02:12:57,449
um

3285
02:12:57,459 --> 02:13:00,889
did it stay in beta after it was out in the world

3286
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:01,290
when

3287
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:01,690
when

3288
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:03,130
when the next was shipping

3289
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,369
the first cube was

3290
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:05,690
so

3291
02:13:05,700 --> 02:13:08,170
i think the first cube we shipped had version 0. 8

3292
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:11,849
which obviously was we didn't call it beta

3293
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:14,090
we called it 0. 8 a um

3294
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:16,730
and then we shipped a 0. 9 and then we shipped a 1. 0.

3295
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:21,929
i don't remember the exact dates, but we realized that the first version we were shipping wasn't 1. 0.

3296
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:22,810
yeah.

3297
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:23,690
yeah.

3298
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:24,969
um

3299
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:28,489
in brent shen schlender's book, he writes

3300
02:13:28,499 --> 02:13:33,130
that you wrote the music synthesis program that played during the keynote demo.

3301
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:34,170
um

3302
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:35,449
is there is

3303
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,810
that is not correct.

3304
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:36,810
um

3305
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:39,210
i don't know if he wrote that or not,

3306
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:40,650
but i know if he did, it's not correct.

3307
02:13:40,660 --> 02:13:40,889
correct.

3308
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:41,690
um,

3309
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:44,409
so what i wrote

3310
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:50,090
i described a little while ago was the first test program to verify that sound actually worked.

3311
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:55,690
the demo, at least one of the demos, the most interesting demo at that introduction

3312
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:56,810
um

3313
02:13:57,280 --> 02:14:00,170
was when the computer played with the violinist

3314
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:02,489
and that was done

3315
02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:03,449
um

3316
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:07,130
from the dsp with synthesized instruments. and i did not write that.

3317
02:14:07,199 --> 02:14:07,449
yeah.

3318
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:10,409
i worked with people that wrote that. i did not write that. yeah.

3319
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:12,570
and um

3320
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:13,849
i think you've

3321
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:14,810
i mean

3322
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:16,090
you know

3323
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:21,690
if you look back at the nextstep project and and the challenges and getting it to the market initially

3324
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:22,969
what

3325
02:14:22,979 --> 02:14:24,329
what do you remember as being

3326
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:25,130
you know

3327
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:25,690
the the hurdles

3328
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:27,690
like hurdles that stick out in your mind

3329
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:28,730
as as

3330
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:32,170
um

3331
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:33,130
well

3332
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:35,130
so i talked about the optical drive

3333
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:36,810
huge hurdle. um

3334
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:40,250
most things were just good old engineering work

3335
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:44,570
but the optical drive was definitely paradigm issues. um

3336
02:14:47,119 --> 02:14:47,690
we were

3337
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,130
we were getting into new space

3338
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:50,409
providing developer tools

3339
02:14:51,119 --> 02:14:51,369
um

3340
02:14:51,379 --> 02:14:51,690
at a

3341
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:53,369
at a level never done before

3342
02:14:53,379 --> 02:14:56,409
and that required a certain level of ways to work with developers

3343
02:14:57,199 --> 02:14:59,369
which also required adoption.

3344
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,690
and one of the challenges was, you know,

3345
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:07,210
we're building a new platform and we couldn't build all the apps ourselves.

3346
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:10,329
so we had to have other people who would build apps for us.

3347
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:14,969
and that was a big challenge. you know, i mean, pricing, right?

3348
02:15:14,979 --> 02:15:17,530
and this wasn't really a software issue, but it was a hardware issue.

3349
02:15:18,239 --> 02:15:22,889
the the staggering cost of the hardware from a cost perspective,

3350
02:15:23,119 --> 02:15:27,050
and then you translate into what it what you have to charge for it, that was a huge hurdle.

3351
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:27,530
yeah.

3352
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:29,770
just going into the market with a new computer.

3353
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:34,170
i mean, you'd be insane to do that today, right? yeah. yeah.

3354
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:35,290
um,

3355
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:42,250
jumping a little bit forward, there was a point where the company's strategy shifted from educational to business productivity.

3356
02:15:43,599 --> 02:15:44,810
what can you tell us about

3357
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:49,449
that process from the from the inside? i remember how how it struck the the industry

3358
02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:50,090
or the

3359
02:15:50,159 --> 02:15:50,570
you know

3360
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:54,250
the computer trade journalism industry is like a huge deal.

3361
02:15:54,400 --> 02:16:00,170
i know next was shifting gears. well, so i forget the exact timing, but the big deal there was

3362
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:03,290
we signed a deal with businessland. i don't know if you remember that.

3363
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:04,170
yeah, i do. i do.

3364
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,130
but um

3365
02:16:05,599 --> 02:16:08,489
i don't know if that was in conjunction with our push into business

3366
02:16:08,499 --> 02:16:10,250
or sort of right along with it.

3367
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:12,250
and um

3368
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:12,810
they

3369
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:20,010
i believe they committed to buying something like a hund00 million worth of product over some interesting period of time, maybe a year

3370
02:16:20,020 --> 02:16:20,409
or something.

3371
02:16:21,199 --> 02:16:21,449
um,

3372
02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:22,969
and i remember,

3373
02:16:24,159 --> 02:16:24,409
um,

3374
02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:31,290
shortly after we did that deal, they invited me and steve to go down to some event

3375
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:33,370
where ronald reagan was speaking of all people,

3376
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:34,170
just,

3377
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:34,648
you know,

3378
02:16:34,659 --> 02:16:37,689
to celebrate the fact that we had done that deal. um

3379
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:42,410
and and so we were really jazzed about that

3380
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:48,648
because business land was a real company that sold to businesses and they had basically produced, you know,

3381
02:16:48,659 --> 02:16:50,728
soft pos for $ 100 million worth of product

3382
02:16:50,799 --> 02:16:53,209
which is way more than we had ever sold. yeah.

3383
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,808
so we're pretty jazzed about that.

3384
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:55,209
uh

3385
02:16:55,219 --> 02:17:00,728
but then they went out of business. so yeah.

3386
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:04,170
was that i'm trying to remember now

3387
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:07,450
where that uh stood with the sort of the politics of os2

3388
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:10,490
and what was going on in the broader industry.

3389
02:17:10,718 --> 02:17:11,530
were you were you

3390
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:12,170
at some point

3391
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:16,010
were you moving toward competing head-to-head with this new sort

3392
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:16,250
of

3393
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:18,090
there was a

3394
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:18,808
there was a tren

3395
02:17:18,818 --> 02:17:25,129
a phase change in in the broader desktop industry as well. i remember our biggest competitor was always sun.

3396
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:26,010
yeah.

3397
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:30,010
we were more compared to the workstation market and um

3398
02:17:30,638 --> 02:17:31,209
we had

3399
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:31,849
i remember

3400
02:17:31,859 --> 02:17:36,170
we had done some uh marketing programs specifically. uh

3401
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:36,568
i remember

3402
02:17:36,579 --> 02:17:37,450
we did this one program

3403
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:43,530
where we had two programmers, one programming with nextstep, one programming with the sun tool set side

3404
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:48,808
by side on camera and the next guy obliterated the sun guy.

3405
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:49,609
u

3406
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:53,370
we did a little, you know, 15 20 minute video. it's probably on youtube. um

3407
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:54,808
uh

3408
02:17:54,818 --> 02:17:58,808
and so we we really started competing at that level. yeah.

3409
02:17:59,200 --> 02:17:59,450
yeah.

3410
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:00,968
and the the transition.

3411
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:05,450
so then there came the transition to the intel hardware, moving away from 6848.

3412
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:11,049
do do you remember why you chose to move away from the motorola architecture

3413
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:16,250
and go with intel? well, the intel was not about using intel hardware ourselves.

3414
02:18:16,799 --> 02:18:19,769
it was about selling software on pcs. yeah.

3415
02:18:20,398 --> 02:18:20,648
uh

3416
02:18:20,718 --> 02:18:27,129
the thinking there being these guys building pcs can do it for zero profit margin, right?

3417
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:29,530
and they're at scale and we're not.

3418
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:30,728
simple as that.

3419
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:31,370
yeah.

3420
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:35,530
and but that that for you that that meant

3421
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:39,129
then you had to take this operating system and move it to a new architecture.

3422
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:39,929
how

3423
02:18:39,939 --> 02:18:42,648
how how hard was it to move next step?

3424
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:45,530
that was our specialty. remember we had mock

3425
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:46,410
which is already portable.

3426
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:46,968
yeah.

3427
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:47,290
yeah.

3428
02:18:47,359 --> 02:18:48,888
so, you know, that was easy

3429
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:49,290
and

3430
02:18:49,299 --> 02:18:56,808
and in fact we ended up porting it to the x86 to the pa risk to the power architecture to spark.

3431
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:00,490
um, you know, we were turnurning them out, you know,

3432
02:19:00,959 --> 02:19:03,049
give us the funding or commit to go

3433
02:19:03,059 --> 02:19:04,490
and six months later we'd have a running.

3434
02:19:04,558 --> 02:19:04,808
yeah.

3435
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:05,609
we

3436
02:19:05,619 --> 02:19:05,769
we

3437
02:19:05,779 --> 02:19:05,849
we

3438
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,609
we ported to some processor that never shipped the 88k.

3439
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:10,568
remember the 88k?

3440
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:11,450
i do remember the 88k.

3441
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:14,010
we had it running on 88k prototypes. yeah.

3442
02:19:14,799 --> 02:19:17,929
and the decision process inside was it was it

3443
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:18,410
um

3444
02:19:18,718 --> 02:19:19,129
you know

3445
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:26,728
did you debate inside about whether to you know to go from from one architecture to to a software base? of course.

3446
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:27,370
um

3447
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:32,090
do you remember who was on what side and what it was like? you know i don't remember

3448
02:19:32,478 --> 02:19:32,728
exactly

3449
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:39,209
but obviously that kind of a decision is something that hardware people don't like. uh

3450
02:19:39,219 --> 02:19:42,490
and almost everybody else does just generally speaking. yeah.

3451
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:43,209
yeah.

3452
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:44,648
um,

3453
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:46,568
and do you remember

3454
02:19:46,579 --> 02:19:50,569
where steve was? sometimes i know that steve has to be brought around on issues

3455
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:52,649
and then he becomes a champion at a certain point.

3456
02:19:53,439 --> 02:19:54,250
do do you remember?

3457
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:55,050
that's right.

3458
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:56,090
and and usually

3459
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:57,370
um,

3460
02:19:59,200 --> 02:19:59,689
you know,

3461
02:19:59,699 --> 02:20:03,689
to expand further on what you're saying, usually things have to get pretty bad before it gets brought around.

3462
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:04,090
yeah.

3463
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:04,729
not always,

3464
02:20:04,739 --> 02:20:05,210
but usually.

3465
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:08,250
and i think that's what was starting to go on here, which is

3466
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:10,250
i mean, this hardware business is a tough one.

3467
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:14,890
not only are we not selling very much, but it's capital intensive and, you know,

3468
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:17,930
risky and and still not working. yeah.

3469
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:19,210
and and oh, by the way,

3470
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:22,170
most people see the value in the software. yeah.

3471
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:25,290
where was bud trible on on that issue

3472
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:28,649
porting to intel? um, i do not remember.

3473
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:31,210
and in fact, it may have been that bud had already gone to sun,

3474
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:32,569
so i'm not sure.

3475
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:33,050
yeah.

3476
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:33,770
yeah.

3477
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:35,370
bud,

3478
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:36,170
i mean there were,

3479
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:36,490
you know,

3480
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:38,490
there were people who had been so close to steve

3481
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:39,290
um

3482
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:43,210
who at various points left. do you remember that as being painful?

3483
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,530
i mean, but leaving. yeah, absolutely.

3484
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:46,250
yeah.

3485
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:48,729
that's another one of those things i remember vividly.

3486
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:54,490
for some reason, i was at home in my apartment not working. i get a phone call from steve

3487
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:56,090
and he was practically in tears.

3488
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:59,130
he said, " you're not going to believe this, but is leaving.

3489
02:20:59,140 --> 02:21:02,330
" and i said, " really? where's he going to say? you're not going to believe this.

3490
02:21:02,399 --> 02:21:03,050
he's going to sign.

3491
02:21:03,060 --> 02:21:06,410
" yeah. and he just could not believe it.

3492
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:10,490
it was he's like, i don't understand how i could possibly do this. yeah.

3493
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:15,530
and were you close to bud at all? did you get a view into that about what his personal

3494
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:16,490
um,

3495
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:18,490
i was pretty close to bud.

3496
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:24,410
um, i'm sure i talked to him after this, but i don't really remember.

3497
02:21:24,479 --> 02:21:28,490
we talked about it was so long ago. i'm sure he gave me some good reasons about yeah.

3498
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:32,890
why he was doing it, what the opportunity was, something like that, but i don't remember exactly.

3499
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:34,170
do you remember?

3500
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:36,250
oh, go ahead. i'm sorry. what was it like to work with bud?

3501
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:38,090
i loved working with bud.

3502
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:38,810
um,

3503
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:40,410
you know,

3504
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:40,569
bud,

3505
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:42,649
one of the smartest people you'll ever meet,

3506
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:45,370
very nice person. um,

3507
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:46,810
always wants to do the right thing,

3508
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:50,090
always, you can always have a great discussion with him. um,

3509
02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:55,210
never got very social with him. um, probably because he was married and i wasn't.

3510
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:56,330
um,

3511
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:58,569
but he was just a great guy to work for.

3512
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:02,970
yeah. and did did dana leave before or after? dan

3513
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:08,170
did i think dana left before? yeah. yeah. i think dana left pretty early. yeah.

3514
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:08,810
yeah.

3515
02:22:11,439 --> 02:22:18,090
so, in terms of your career, your your your time at at nex going from engineering to management, did what was

3516
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:19,370
that as as a learning experience

3517
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,970
and sort of learning to be a manager? and it was trial

3518
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:23,530
by fire.

3519
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:24,410
um,

3520
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:25,689
you know,

3521
02:22:25,699 --> 02:22:27,850
i became a manager like within a year of joining next,

3522
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:28,490
i think.

3523
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:28,729
wow.

3524
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:29,930
um,

3525
02:22:30,479 --> 02:22:31,290
but we were small.

3526
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:32,649
we all knew each other really well.

3527
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:34,250
there wasn't much managing to do.

3528
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:38,649
um, again, i'm coming from being thought of as

3529
02:22:38,659 --> 02:22:43,450
that benevolent dictator on the mock project, which is probably not a good management trait.

3530
02:22:44,319 --> 02:22:44,569
um,

3531
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:46,810
and i'm sure i learned that along the way.

3532
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:47,530
um

3533
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:49,130
but again

3534
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,569
as far as i was concerned

3535
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:52,729
we were also heads down at that point in time

3536
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:54,490
just trying to get things done. yeah.

3537
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:55,130
you know

3538
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:55,450
yeah

3539
02:22:55,460 --> 02:22:56,410
we did annual reviews

3540
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:59,609
but as to standard hr practices

3541
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:01,609
very little at least at that time.

3542
02:23:01,619 --> 02:23:02,010
so i was

3543
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:02,250
you know

3544
02:23:02,260 --> 02:23:02,649
i was learning

3545
02:23:02,659 --> 02:23:03,370
trial by fire

3546
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:04,490
learn what works

3547
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:04,729
learn

3548
02:23:04,739 --> 02:23:05,290
what doesn't work.

3549
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:05,770
yeah.

3550
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:09,450
in terms of sort of picking a replacement for bud.

3551
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:10,090
um

3552
02:23:10,319 --> 02:23:14,170
were there others who were in contention? do you remember any of it

3553
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:15,530
how steve chose?

3554
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:17,770
was it was it paul heaggerty was being considered as

3555
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:18,250
well?

3556
02:23:18,319 --> 02:23:19,530
do you know if that was correct?

3557
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:23,530
so i'm not sure who took over after, but it might have been paul

3558
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:26,729
but i'm not sure. i don't remember.

3559
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:27,210
okay.

3560
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,410
but then ultimately

3561
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:31,370
then ultimately i took over. yeah. yeah.

3562
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:34,410
so

3563
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:35,130
um

3564
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:39,930
so in that period when you managed software

3565
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:43,930
so what are the sort of milestones that that you accomplished?

3566
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:47,450
well

3567
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:51,689
so i think if you look at sort of the assume you're asking about sort of the big ticket items

3568
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:52,890
things that got done.

3569
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:59,210
so i mean obviously we had next steps starting with the intro making it into a real product.

3570
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,689
i think we took it through like 3.

3571
02:24:01,699 --> 02:24:04,010
0 or something as a product.

3572
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:09,850
we introduced some really innovative features in it like distributed objects, enterprise objects framework.

3573
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:12,250
these are things that were just groundbreaking at the time.

3574
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:17,370
we had it such that it could communicate with windows systems over the network through an object model.

3575
02:24:18,319 --> 02:24:18,569
um

3576
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:25,130
we built this product called pdio, portable distributed objects, which was our distributed object technology running on any

3577
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:27,130
that was part of the windows angle.

3578
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:35,850
then we ported it as a whole os to all these different architectures. intel, hppa risk, um,

3579
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:38,330
power architecture, um,

3580
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:40,810
the 88000, um,

3581
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:41,770
etc., etc.,

3582
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:42,170
etc.

3583
02:24:42,399 --> 02:24:42,649
um,

3584
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:44,170
and then we took, uh,

3585
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:45,530
the higher levels of it

3586
02:24:45,540 --> 02:24:48,490
and turned it into openstep, which then ran on solaris

3587
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:51,770
and windows, was going to run on aix at one point.

3588
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:52,890
um,

3589
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:54,569
that's right.

3590
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:55,450
uh,

3591
02:24:55,460 --> 02:25:00,090
that was an andy heler deal. do you remember this? i remember the deal. i don't remember andy.

3592
02:25:00,319 --> 02:25:00,569
yeah.

3593
02:25:00,579 --> 02:25:04,970
he was the head of the of the rt business. okay. yeah. um

3594
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:06,010
and then

3595
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:07,050
um

3596
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:12,170
so i mean these were all really great innovations through the years

3597
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:13,930
and then we had this

3598
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,850
what i thought was a revolutionary product

3599
02:25:15,920 --> 02:25:16,410
web objects

3600
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:21,930
which was the very first server-based application service ever. ever.

3601
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:26,090
what year would that have been roughly? would that have been 9495 by then?

3602
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:26,330
uh

3603
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:27,450
yeah,

3604
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:27,850
maybe.

3605
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:29,689
yeah, probably i think so.

3606
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,689
the s1 says it shipped in 96.

3607
02:25:32,399 --> 02:25:32,649
okay.

3608
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:33,609
so, a little bit later.

3609
02:25:33,619 --> 02:25:35,450
that's when it first could be somewhere in that range.

3610
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:37,530
yeah. yeah. we would have been working on it before that.

3611
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:38,330
so, maybe 95ish.

3612
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:44,410
so, you know, we we haven't asked you about this, but you know, the web was built on next.

3613
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:46,010
how much of it was

3614
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:50,330
i mean, from being inside next, how much did you have a early sense

3615
02:25:50,399 --> 02:25:53,770
that the web was going to be a worldchanging architecture?

3616
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:59,530
so i think we got that not because of the client being on nex,

3617
02:25:59,540 --> 02:26:00,729
but because we built web objects.

3618
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:01,450
yeah.

3619
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:01,930
okay.

3620
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:07,290
and the client being on x was kind of cool, but all you had was static websites, which is interesting for researchers

3621
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:08,649
and a few things like that.

3622
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:09,530
but

3623
02:26:09,540 --> 02:26:11,609
when we built this first web server

3624
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,930
and we started thinking about all the things that could now be done, you know,

3625
02:26:15,940 --> 02:26:21,850
we built demos of a car selector where you pick models and options and colors

3626
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:26,410
and it's changing in real time. you know, you have to refresh the page back then, but it changes.

3627
02:26:26,479 --> 02:26:30,490
and we built the first system that ever tied into saber for booking tickets.

3628
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:32,170
i mean, who would have ever thought?

3629
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:39,850
and so, we just knew then that we had something. yeah. so just

3630
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:43,770
and and yet next you know

3631
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:44,010
you could

3632
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:44,810
you could almost see a

3633
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:48,170
you know a business strategy based on that insight

3634
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:52,729
and yet you weren't able to to sort of take it to the to the scale

3635
02:26:52,739 --> 02:26:53,689
that the web became.

3636
02:26:54,399 --> 02:26:58,090
well, that's because we got bought by apple. yeah. right. and so i think

3637
02:26:58,399 --> 02:27:01,689
um you know, if we hadn't got bought by apple,

3638
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:03,770
web objects would have become a huge business

3639
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:08,250
because we know how big these web services businesses are today. and it could have been a very

3640
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:09,290
very large business.

3641
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:09,770
yeah.

3642
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:13,770
and i don't see any reason why it wouldn't because we had a huge head start on on everybody.

3643
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:14,649
you can't even

3644
02:27:14,659 --> 02:27:15,930
you can't even say head start on the competition

3645
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:16,810
because there was no competition.

3646
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:20,010
there's maybe one other guy out there, cold fusion, i think it was,

3647
02:27:20,319 --> 02:27:22,090
that was even doing anything that got bought

3648
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:22,490
by adobe.

3649
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:25,130
yeah. yeah. that's interesting. um,

3650
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:30,649
who sort of in terms of that openstep licensing decision, do you remember who's how that came about

3651
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:32,970
inside next was for ibm? uh,

3652
02:27:32,980 --> 02:27:33,210
no.

3653
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:34,010
i was thinking about sun.

3654
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:37,530
oh, openstep on solaris and openstep on solaris.

3655
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:38,569
windows and windows

3656
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,290
and well, so windows wasn't a licensing situation.

3657
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:44,970
that was us just having a product to sell with solaris.

3658
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:48,490
i'm trying to remember how far that got. um,

3659
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:54,810
i was told that the source code for the app kit was actually licensed to sun. it was

3660
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:57,930
and we sent some engineers over to help them port it.

3661
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:05,370
i don't know that they ever shipped it. um, it was we

3662
02:28:05,380 --> 02:28:07,689
we probably had things in place that made it too hard

3663
02:28:07,699 --> 02:28:09,770
like it had to be done in a clean room so

3664
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:12,810
that anyone from sun working on it couldn't work on other sun projects

3665
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:13,770
or talk to them.

3666
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:14,729
all these requirements

3667
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:17,770
and maybe that had a little bit to do with slowing it down.

3668
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:19,370
we had some next employees on site

3669
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,250
and i think you know it's probably one of those things

3670
02:28:22,260 --> 02:28:26,170
where sun probably had some antibodies that didn't want it to succeed anyway.

3671
02:28:26,319 --> 02:28:30,890
that wouldn't surprise me. most companies of that size have that kind of a problem. yeah.

3672
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:34,649
but it just it just never got out. and and

3673
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:35,370
um

3674
02:28:35,439 --> 02:28:36,810
a little bit more about web objects

3675
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:37,530
um

3676
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:38,490
you know

3677
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:39,370
is there more of a backstory

3678
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:41,290
sort of what you know

3679
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:44,410
what were the sort of threads coming into web objects or what drove it

3680
02:28:44,420 --> 02:28:45,609
or you know

3681
02:28:46,479 --> 02:28:46,729
well

3682
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:47,290
i remember

3683
02:28:47,439 --> 02:28:48,490
so i know i was running

3684
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:50,890
i was running the software group at the time one of the guys

3685
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:54,250
and engineers came to me and said got this idea

3686
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:01,130
we can have a server that you send info to and it does something and then sends html back

3687
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:01,450
i'm like

3688
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:02,170
what do you mean

3689
02:29:02,319 --> 02:29:06,810
and he showed me a little demo of a very simple script like that's pretty cool.

3690
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:08,250
we can do something with that.

3691
02:29:08,319 --> 02:29:14,490
so i authorized him and a couple other guys to go spend some resources on it. said okay

3692
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:17,930
go build this and come back and then show them when you've got something a little more real.

3693
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:22,170
and i mean it's one of those things where the first time you see that demo

3694
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:22,649
it's like

3695
02:29:22,659 --> 02:29:25,290
of course this is the way it should be. yeah.

3696
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:26,649
oh

3697
02:29:26,659 --> 02:29:30,250
and web objects was built on top of enterprise objects framework.

3698
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:32,170
um

3699
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:36,810
i would say it a little bit differently. web objects was built on the side of enterprise objects framework.

3700
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:37,770
so

3701
02:29:38,479 --> 02:29:38,729
uh

3702
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:41,689
web objects didn't require enterprise objects framework. eof

3703
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:45,130
is what we called it, but it benefited from it if you had a data source.

3704
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:47,689
so you would use eof to access a database.

3705
02:29:48,319 --> 02:29:50,410
didn't have to, but it was the easiest way to do it. yeah.

3706
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:51,930
and h

3707
02:29:52,000 --> 02:30:01,050
how did how did the eof project come about? the eof project came about much earlier. uh

3708
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:06,250
its first instantiation was something we called dbkit, database kit. uh

3709
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:10,330
we had kits for everything and we knew accessing databases was important

3710
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:12,410
and so we built a kit that let you access databases

3711
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:17,210
and then we discovered what people liked and didn't like about it and redid it as eof.

3712
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:18,170
yeah.

3713
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:18,970
okay.

3714
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:20,090
um

3715
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:21,210
i'd forgotten this

3716
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:23,210
an attempted um

3717
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:24,250
next ipo.

3718
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:25,689
do you

3719
02:30:25,699 --> 02:30:25,930
yes.

3720
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:27,290
when did that

3721
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:30,410
i'm totally lost in history. so my history

3722
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:31,210
so

3723
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:32,170
um

3724
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:34,250
attempted in the form

3725
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:35,770
it wasn't actually attempted in that

3726
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:36,649
there was a registration

3727
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:41,850
but there was an s1 that was 95 % done.

3728
02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:46,010
i've donated it the an original copy to the museum. okay. um

3729
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:47,130
and

3730
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:48,090
uh

3731
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:54,649
we were working on it. i i think the draft is dated november of 96. uh

3732
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:58,010
which was the same time we began discussions with apple. ah

3733
02:30:58,160 --> 02:30:58,410
okay.

3734
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:03,130
so apple basically preempted it. yeah. okay. so yeah. um

3735
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:04,410
and at that point

3736
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:05,050
um

3737
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:09,689
talk a little bit about java and was there a next java strategy

3738
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:13,130
and where did java fit in the in the puzzle? uh

3739
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:16,170
there was no real next java strategy at the time.

3740
02:31:16,180 --> 02:31:19,930
java came later on mostly for compatibility reasons. yeah. yeah.

3741
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,970
actually, so blaine gar told me

3742
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:30,090
that he had actually um created the java bridge for web objects while still at next.

3743
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:33,530
is that correct? that's entirely possible. yeah. i don't

3744
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:36,729
i don't remember the exact details on those dates. okay. yeah.
