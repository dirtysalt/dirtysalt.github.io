1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,540
- For the vast majority of human existence.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,930
We've been nomadic and we've done these kind of wider

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,210
or tighter nomadic circles,

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,690
depending on the geographic region, but they'd move.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,350
So once humans figured out how to stay in a place,

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,910
that's the initial trigger

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,730
to what would become civilization.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,170
- I think you said beauty

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,720
and blood went hand in hand for the Aztec.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,960
- What I meant by that is they were absolutely comfortable

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,612
with human sacrifice and,

12
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:32,580
you know, ripping people's hearts out.

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,580
They had this just, you know, grotesque, violent bent.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,260
But in the same way, they also

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,260
absolutely loved flower gardens and poetry

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,360
and music and dance.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,010
The same Aztec king who would order the hearts

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,790
of a thousand people extracted also would stand up

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,390
at dinner parties to recite his own poetry,

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,370
but they were really just surgical about it.

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,739
They'd use a thick obsidian knife

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,490
where they could just break the ribs right along the sternum

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,940
and then push the sternum down, pull up and just.

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,200
- While the person was alive?

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,243
- Yep, while the person was alive.

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,150
- The following is a conversation with Ed Barnhart,

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,630
an archeologist specializing in ancient civilizations

28
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,310
of South America, Mesoamerica and North America.

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,890
This is the "Lex Fridman Podcast," to support it,

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,560
please check out our sponsors in the description.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,373
And now, dear friends, here's Ed Barnhart.

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,500
Do you think there are lost civilizations in the history

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,520
of humans on Earth, which we don't know anything about?

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,105
- Yes, I do, and in fact, you know,

35
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:54,870
we have found some civilizations that we had no idea about,

36
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,000
just in my lifetime.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,580
I mean, we've got go Gobekli Tepi

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,410
and we've got the stuff that's going on in the Amazon

39
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,060
and there's some other less startling things

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,229
that we had no idea existed and pushed our dates back

41
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,800
and give us whole new civilizations we had no idea about.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,940
So yeah, it's happened and I think it'll happen again.

43
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,450
- Do you think there's a lost civilization in the Amazon

44
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,750
that the Amazon jungle has eaten up

45
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,630
or is hiding the evidence of?

46
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,020
- Yes, I do, and we're beginning to find it.

47
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,560
There are these huge, what we call geoglyphs,

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,180
these mound groups that are in geometric patterns.

49
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,860
I think that the average Joe,

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,990
when they hear the word civilization,

51
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,660
they think of something that looks like Rome.

52
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,970
And I don't think we're ever gonna find anything

53
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,240
that looks like Rome in the Amazon.

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,280
I think a lot of things there, I mean,

55
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,660
wherever you are on the planet,

56
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,550
you use your natural resources.

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,400
And in the Amazon, there's not a whole lot of stone.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,710
What stone is there is deep, deep, deep.

59
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,030
So a lot of their things were built out of dirt

60
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,920
and trees and feathers and textiles.

61
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,730
- But is it possible that all that land that's not covered

62
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,310
by trees is actually hiding stone?

63
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,497
For example, some architecture, some things

64
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:22,860
that's just very difficult to find for archeologists.

65
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,820
- I think at the base of the Andes where the Amazon connects

66
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,897
to the Andes, there's a lot of potential there

67
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:33,120
'cause that's where the stone actually starts poking up.

68
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,360
When you get down into the basin, stone is meters

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,107
and meters under the ground except for a stray cliff here

70
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:43,350
and there where the river dug deep.

71
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,660
And even then, only in the dry season

72
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,360
'cause that river rises like

73
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,870
over a hundred feet every year.

74
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,100
- Well, that's one of the things, having visited that area,

75
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,080
just interacting with waterfalls

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,340
and seeing the water, I was humbled by the power of water

77
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,680
to shape landscapes

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,930
and probably erase history in the context

79
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,330
that we're talking about of civilizations,

80
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,060
as water can just make everything disappear

81
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,060
over a period of centuries and millennia.

82
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,660
And so if something existed a very long time ago,

83
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,430
thousands of years ago,

84
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,553
it's very possible it was just eaten up by nature.

85
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,550
- Absolutely, in fact, in my opinion,

86
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,814
that's almost a certainty in a lot of places.

87
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:32,610
You know, the Grand Canyon was dug by water.

88
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,040
There's this wimpy little river in it right now,

89
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,000
and you can't possibly imagine that it dug that, but it did.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,470
The power of nature and geology is really kind of magical.

91
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,830
And when it comes to, you know, ancient civilizations

92
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,440
that could be from a long time ago, there's probably a lot

93
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,720
that are just under the ocean.

94
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,900
And just the wave action have destroyed them

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,273
and what they haven't destroyed buried deep.

96
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,430
- Under the ocean.

97
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,623
So you think Atlantis ever existed?

98
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,450
- I don't think that Atlantis existed.

99
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,920
I do think it was one

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,340
of Plato's many parables talking about, you know,

101
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,230
putting it in an interesting story

102
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,960
as a teaching device in his school.

103
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,800
If one did exist or a shadow of it,

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,440
my money would be on Akrotiri.

105
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,830
Akrotiri is what's left of a big city

106
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,440
that was on the island of Santorini.

107
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,240
And when their volcano blew up, it blew up most of the city

108
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,970
and shot chunks of it so fast

109
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,510
that 70 miles away in Crete,

110
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,870
there are chunks of Santorini in their cliff.

111
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,210
So it blasted what was ever there.

112
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,780
But what's left on the side of the crater, Akrotiri,

113
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,920
is strangely advanced for its age.

114
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,700
And so if there's anything that's a model for Atlantis,

115
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,510
as Plato explained it, it's Akrotiri.

116
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,090
- Akrotiri, the ancient Greek city.

117
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,010
So it says the settlement was destroyed

118
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,010
in the Theran eruption sometime in the 16th century BCE

119
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,470
and buried in volcanic ash, which preserved the remains

120
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,010
of the frescoes and many objects and artworks.

121
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,740
So we don't know how advanced that civilization was.

122
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,930
- No, but we can walk around the ruins

123
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,140
and see that it's got streets, it's got plumbing,

124
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,000
it's got little sconces for torches at night.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,200
It was a vibrant city with a lot of, especially

126
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,350
in terms of hydraulic engineering.

127
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,350
It's very advanced for being 3,500 years old.

128
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,860
- So if you check out, here's an image

129
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,640
of the excavation, what a project.

130
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,620
- It's an amazing place.

131
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,590
And you can tell that it's just part of it

132
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,710
because it's pretty close to where the crater begins.

133
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,890
So the city itself was probably much larger.

134
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,810
- So in this case, there's a lot of evidence.

135
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,400
But like we said,

136
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,680
there could be civilizations that there is no,

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,300
there's very little evidence of,

138
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,250
because of the natural environment

139
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,050
that destroys all the evidence.

140
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,450
- And I think Akrotiri is actually a great example

141
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,750
of that because here we have the side that did preserve,

142
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,760
that looks amazing,

143
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,470
but we know there was more of the city

144
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,260
that was completely obliterated.

145
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,690
It was shot, chunks of that city are probably

146
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,960
in the walls of Crete 70 miles away.

147
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,660
And you know, Plato says that it sunk,

148
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,790
it was on an island and it sunk.

149
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,580
Well that's exactly what happened to Akrotiri.

150
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,890
- You think this is what Plato was referring to?

151
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,250
- If it does exist, at least the model of it,

152
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,010
I think this is probably what he was talking about.

153
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,600
- And there could be other civilizations

154
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,060
of which Plato has never written?

155
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,400
- Absolutely. - That we have no record of.

156
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,540
And it's humbling to think that entire civilizations

157
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,630
with all the dreams, the hope, the technological innovation,

158
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,690
the wars, the conflicts, the political tensions,

159
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,960
all of that, the social interactions, the hierarchies,

160
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,070
all of that, the art can be just destroyed like that

161
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,070
and forgotten, completely lost to ancient history.

162
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,990
- I reflect upon that often as an archeologist.

163
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,200
I think about this great country that I live in

164
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,270
and love and all the things we've achieved.

165
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,500
But you know, we're a baby historically speaking.

166
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,720
We've been around 200 years.

167
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,350
Heck, a lot of the cities I study in Central

168
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,303
and South America, they had a run of, you know, 800,

169
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,049
a thousand years and now they're ruins.

170
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,900
But we're barely getting started in terms

171
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,363
of historical civilizations.

172
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,053
- So humans, homo sapiens evolved,

173
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,010
but they didn't start civilizations right away.

174
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,180
There's a long period of time

175
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,867
when they did not form these complex societies.

176
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:59,640
So how do we, let's say 300,000 years ago in Africa

177
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,110
actually go from there to creating civilizations?

178
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,110
- I think that a lot of human evolution

179
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,810
had to do with the pressures

180
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,390
that their environment put upon them.

181
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,480
And you know, a lot of things start changing

182
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,520
right around 12,000 years ago.

183
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,140
And that's when, you know, our last ice age really ended.

184
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,450
And I think there was a whole lot of things

185
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,980
that just pressured them into, especially finding new ways

186
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,420
of subsistence.

187
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,250
Here in the Americas,

188
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,970
a huge thing that happened was all the megafauna went away.

189
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,500
When the climate changed enough, the mammoths died out

190
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,480
and the bison died out.

191
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,300
And there was just, they had to come up

192
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,730
with different ways of doing things.

193
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,500
We were hunters and gatherers

194
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,240
and we had things we got from hunting

195
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,580
and we got things we got from gathering.

196
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,950
And in the Americas when the things

197
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,500
that they were used to hunting went away

198
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,610
and they had to make do with rabbits there, you know,

199
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,470
the gathering started to be a much more important thing.

200
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,410
And I think that led to figuring out,

201
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,420
hey, we could actually grow certain things.

202
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,170
And gardens turned into crops, turned into intensive crops,

203
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,320
and then people were allowed to gather in bigger groups

204
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,303
and survive in a single area.

205
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,760
They didn't have to roam around anymore.

206
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,870
And that's where we get the first sedentary communities,

207
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,233
which means they stayed in the same place all year long.

208
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,520
For the vast majority of human existence,

209
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,850
we've been nomadic and we've done these kind of wider

210
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,190
or tighter nomadic circles,

211
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,557
depending on the geographic region where they'd know, okay,

212
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:50,070
you know, in the mountains,

213
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,510
we'll be in the summer, in the mountains

214
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,950
'cause there's berries and things.

215
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,720
And then in the winter we'll be down here

216
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,600
and we'll hunt, but they'd move.

217
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,110
So once humans figured out how to stay in a place,

218
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,130
I think that's the initial trigger too,

219
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,410
what would become civilization.

220
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,736
- What do you think is,

221
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,500
there's a lot of questions I wanna ask here.

222
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,540
What do you think is the motivation for societies?

223
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,550
Is it the carrot or the stick?

224
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,850
So you said like, is it, well, like when resources run out,

225
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,460
when the old way of life is no longer feeding everybody,

226
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,680
then you have to figure stuff out.

227
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,070
Or is it more the carrot of like, there's always this kind

228
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,320
of human spirit that wants to explore,

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,700
that wants to maybe impress the rest of the village

230
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,730
or something like this with the new discovery they made

231
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,510
in venturing out and coming out with different ideas

232
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,120
or technological innovation, let's call it?

233
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,090
- Well, you know, I have an explorer's heart,

234
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,870
so I'm kind of, you know, I'm biased.

235
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,610
You know, I do think

236
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,610
that we have an innate desire to see what's on the horizon.

237
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,450
And to impress other people

238
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,180
with our achievements, things like that.

239
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,247
We're social beings.

240
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:05,850
That's really the edge that humans have

241
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,920
is our ability to work together.

242
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,610
So I think that it's much more the carrot than the stick.

243
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,860
When things get ugly, the stick comes out.

244
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,380
But usually the carrot does the job.

245
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,000
- The really interesting story is

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,913
how the first people came to the Americas.

247
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,750
I mean, to me that's pretty gangster to go from Asia

248
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,210
all the way potentially during the ice age,

249
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,560
maybe at the end of the ice age

250
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,660
or during that whole period, not knowing

251
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,150
what the world looks like going into the unknown.

252
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,470
Can you talk through that process?

253
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,600
How did the first people come to the Americas?

254
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,950
- Well, first off, I agree with you.

255
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,180
That was pretty gangster.

256
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,930
I mean, that's a hard place to live.

257
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,670
I listened to some of your podcasts.

258
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,830
Is that guy Jordan Jonas?

259
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,760
He cut the mustard,

260
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,700
but I wouldn't have made it crossing there.

261
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,293
- Well there you go,

262
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:56,760
like the fact that those guys exist,

263
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,930
that somebody like Jordan Jonas exists, people that survive

264
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,930
and thrive in these harsh conditions,

265
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,270
that's an indication that it's possible.

266
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,340
But yeah, so when do you think,

267
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,173
and how did the first people come?

268
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,850
- The traditional theories are still somewhat valid,

269
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,240
or at least you know, on the table that when

270
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,410
that land bridge occurred, that nomadic hunters

271
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,080
just followed the game like they always had

272
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,230
and the game went across there 'cause there was no barrier

273
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,270
and they followed them across.

274
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,960
The thing that has changed is how early that happened.

275
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,760
DNA has been a total game changer for archeology.

276
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,260
You know, we get all these evolutionary tracks

277
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,790
that we could never see before.

278
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,740
When I was a young archeologist,

279
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,390
I would've never dreamed we'd have

280
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,490
the information we have now.

281
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,070
And that information, a lot of it's coming out

282
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,120
of Texas A&M, we see the traditional

283
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,120
like 12,500 years ago that there was a migration.

284
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,050
But now we're seeing one

285
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,150
that's almost certainly happening closer

286
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,040
to 30,000 years ago.

287
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,880
And now the thing that seems like madness,

288
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,300
but might be true is that it could have been as early as 60,

289
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,960
a lot of the DNA things are suggesting

290
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,090
that the very first migration

291
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,700
could have come across as early as 60.

292
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,760
And when I was a younger archeologist,

293
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,267
it was heresy to go beyond this 12,500.

294
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:32,880
You were a wacko if you said that,

295
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,750
but now it's really very clear that they came over

296
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,630
at least by 30,000 and the bridge opened

297
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,250
and closed and open and closed.

298
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,323
- That's during the ice age. - Right.

299
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,960
- I mean, that's crazy, right, that is crazy.

300
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,180
- Yeah, I mean, you know, they didn't roll in

301
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,030
and immediately make New York, but there were people

302
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,010
and there were definitely not people here

303
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,166
before that, which is fascinating.

304
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:03,166
When the bridge closed, DNA mutated.

305
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,320
And so we have specific kinds of haplogroup

306
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,430
that are here in the Americas that don't exist otherwise.

307
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,990
And that same haplogroup game has been showing us more

308
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,990
and more that people came across Siberia.

309
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,680
That it's not Africa, it's not Western Europe.

310
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,140
Those are still, you know, they've become kind

311
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,083
of fringe theories, but they're not totally eradicated.

312
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,376
DNA is a developing science as well.

313
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,060
And I think we all need to keep that in mind,

314
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,240
that it's not like they just cracked the code

315
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,880
and now we know all the answers.

316
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,850
And sometimes, like in any science,

317
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,110
a breakthrough puts us two steps backwards, not forwards.

318
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,890
So I think, you know, we don't need to have too much faith

319
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,220
in the models that are now being created through DNA,

320
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,320
but they are pointing in the direction

321
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,750
of everybody came across from Siberia

322
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,080
that all Native American people are

323
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,690
of Asiatic descent.

324
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,330
- Do you think it was a gradual process

325
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,750
if it's like 30 to 60,000 years ago?

326
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,070
Was it just gradual movement of these nomadic tribes

327
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,870
as they follow the animals?

328
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,490
Or was it like one explorer

329
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,630
that pushed the tribe to just go, go, go, go

330
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,110
and go across maybe across a hundred years,

331
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,470
travel all the way

332
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,890
across maybe into North America, into North, North America

333
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,829
where Canada is now, and then sort

334
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,280
of like big leaps in movement versus gradual movement?

335
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,750
- I think it was big leaps

336
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,560
and now this is just, you know, mostly guess,

337
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,970
I'll admit, but I think that it much in the way that a lot

338
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,000
of our evolutionary models talk about

339
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,230
punctuated equilibrium, that there are big moments of change

340
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,670
and then it settles out into a more slow

341
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,119
and steady pattern and then something big will happen again.

342
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,410
I do think that the early people went as far

343
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,530
as they could go, and there were certain colonies

344
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,040
that just got isolated for thousands of years.

345
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,250
One of the fascinating things that DNA is showing us,

346
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,650
which actually blood types were showing us

347
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,750
way before that, is

348
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,670
that the oldest people in the Americas are in South America.

349
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,900
The ones that got separated early

350
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,460
and didn't mix their DNA, like the people in the Amazon,

351
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,110
most of those guys have O blood type

352
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,350
and they're haplogroup D, which is the oldest one

353
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,210
that entered the US and what are they doing down there?

354
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,400
I do believe they came across the Bering Strait,

355
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,820
I don't think it's very, we have no real evidence

356
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,820
to say they came in mass across Oceania.

357
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,480
So they made it probably by boat along the coast,

358
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,250
all the way to South America.

359
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,040
- So there's some kind of cultural engine

360
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,200
that drove them to explore.

361
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,270
So if you had to bet all your money,

362
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,560
it happened like tens of thousands of years ago.

363
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,070
But in a very rapid pace, there's these explorers,

364
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,920
they went all the way to South America

365
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,660
and there established their kind of more stable existence.

366
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,050
And from there, South America, Mesoamerica,

367
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,770
North America was kind of gradually expanded into that area.

368
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,290
- I think the next waves came down

369
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,540
and did North America and Central America.

370
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,320
And the very first wave made it all the way down

371
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,780
to South America and got isolated there,

372
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,410
and then mixed in with the next groups that came.

373
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,970
- That's fascinating. - Kinda like there's,

374
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,930
there's an interesting correlate in Europe

375
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,470
where today everybody feels

376
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,450
like Celtic people are from Ireland,

377
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,960
but actually Celtic people started in Eastern Europe

378
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,550
and it was the entire area.

379
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,270
And when Rome kind of swept everything

380
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,540
and Rome was now the ruler of the day,

381
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,540
it was only that far edge of the Celtic world, Ireland

382
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,220
that they were like, ah, we're not gonna mess

383
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,300
with those guys on that island.

384
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,630
We'll leave them be, so now it looks like that's the heart

385
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,630
of Celtic tradition, but actually it's the fringe.

386
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,640
- So if it is 60,000 years ago,

387
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,410
these are really early humans.

388
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,020
- Yeah, and there were consistent things

389
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,700
that have been coming out for decades

390
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,700
about very old Carbon 14 dates in the Amazon

391
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,120
and in the Andes area that everybody just dismissed.

392
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,960
It's, no, it didn't get a date of 40,000 years,

393
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,000
but I think we're gonna come back around

394
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,770
to start readdressing some of these

395
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,383
based on new evidence at hand.

396
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,170
- And that's the interesting thing is, you know,

397
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,110
the early human spread throughout the world

398
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,530
and then like you said, perhaps have gotten isolated

399
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,260
and then civilization sprung from there

400
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,000
and they all have similar elements

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,100
even though they were isolated.

402
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,990
That's really interesting.

403
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,270
That's really interesting that there's multiple cradles

404
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:32,253
of civilization, not just one, like one good idea,

405
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:35,010
that those ideas naturally come up.

406
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,053
Those structures naturally come up.

407
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,030
- And I wonder whether, you know, the similarities

408
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,620
that all those cradles have, it could be, you know,

409
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,490
a shared much deeper past that they all have.

410
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:55,490
Or it could be a more kind of Star Trek thing where,

411
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,390
you know, captain Kirk was always talking

412
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,860
about the theory of parallel human development,

413
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,310
that humans across the universe go through certain stages

414
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,313
of development and that that could be the answer to it.

415
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,070
- Which one do you lean on?

416
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,889
Which one do you lean towards?

417
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:14,700
- I think it's a case by case thing.

418
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,440
I think if we look globally,

419
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,340
I'd lean much more towards the human parallel development.

420
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,560
But if I look just to the Americas,

421
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,440
and we have a shorter time period where, you know,

422
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,110
the things that become major civilizations,

423
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,830
now I'll say, you know, up to 30,000 years ago,

424
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,973
which is still a blip in the time of humans,

425
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,420
I think that there were shared things

426
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,860
that those people came over with from Asia,

427
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,780
and that as they got separated, that they had core values

428
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,960
that then turned into things like religion

429
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,535
and cultural customs that we can see.

430
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:59,910
I'm a big proponent that there are commonalities

431
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,020
in all the cultures of the Americas that lead back to

432
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,950
and point to a single distant origin.

433
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,600
- You've spoken about the lost cradle

434
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,313
of civilization, South America.

435
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,450
So South America is not often talked about

436
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,870
as one of the cradles of civilization.

437
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,270
So South America, Mesoamerica, can you explain?

438
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,910
- Well, we have very early stuff in South America.

439
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,860
You're right, I mean, you know, especially,

440
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,570
as an American, our country's so big

441
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,960
and you know, that we are so far removed from these places,

442
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,790
we don't even think about it.

443
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,110
But more and more we're seeing things that predate

444
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,810
the earliest stuff that we like to talk about,

445
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,183
like Egypt and Mesopotamia.

446
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,820
There are things, it's all on the Peruvian coast

447
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,280
that we have these cradles of civilization.

448
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,980
Someday we might start talking about the Amazon more

449
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,520
and more, but right now what we've got are things

450
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,260
that date back into the three thousands BCE

451
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,620
along the coast of Peru.

452
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,620
And there are big stone built pyramids and temples

453
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,320
and they're amazingly isolated,

454
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,150
even now that we've found them.

455
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,950
Some of them, like Caral is one

456
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,040
of the most famous ones just north of Lima.

457
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,140
We've known about it for a couple decades now,

458
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,973
how old it is.

459
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:29,940
But every time I visit there, it's like I visited the moon,

460
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,400
there's absolutely nobody there.

461
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,870
Not for miles.

462
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,870
It's amazing how such a discovery was made

463
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,120
and yet still nobody goes to see it.

464
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,443
It's not easy to get to.

465
00:23:44,312 --> 00:23:45,630
- So you think there's a bunch of locations like that.

466
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,720
Some may not have been discovered in the Peru area.

467
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,030
- Oh, there are so many, Peru has tons,

468
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,580
that desert gets really ugly quick

469
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,620
and it buries things completely.

470
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,290
There are so many pyramids out there

471
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,663
that are still completely untouched.

472
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,750
You know, when people hear the name pyramids,

473
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,910
they think of Egypt immediately.

474
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,180
But Egypt has got about 140 pyramids,

475
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,520
and we have pretty much found them all.

476
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,630
Peru has thousands, thousands of pyramids.

477
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,930
And now they weren't built of a lot,

478
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,550
not all of them were built of stones.

479
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,170
Some of them were adobe bricks,

480
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,550
which have weathered terribly.

481
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,870
So now they don't look,

482
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,573
they're not exciting places to visit today.

483
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,120
You know what's funny too, you know,

484
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,950
we started off talking about, you know,

485
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,640
whether I think there's a lost civilization out there,

486
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,380
there are definitely things that are still to be discovered,

487
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,490
but there are some things

488
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,030
that were discovered a hundred years ago and archeologists

489
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,720
or back then, they called themselves antiquarians

490
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
just kind of passed over.

491
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,050
Caral was one of these sites

492
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:56,190
because the coast of Peru has some of those pyramids

493
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,810
that were made by the Moche are full of gold

494
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,570
and beautiful ceramics.

495
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,290
And you know, things that you can sell for big money,

496
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,170
but Caral was found a long time ago,

497
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,690
but the archeologist was like, God, no gold,

498
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,880
no ceramics, forget about it.

499
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,880
This place is no good, we can't sell anything here.

500
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,460
And then about the 1970s or eighties,

501
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,460
somebody said, hey, no ceramics,

502
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,410
is that older than the invention of ceramics.

503
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,690
Shit, we better go take another look at that place.

504
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,610
- So what's the dating on Caral?

505
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,610
- Caral I think starts at about 3,200 BCE

506
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,370
and it lasts as a major civilization with a lot

507
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:46,370
of other cities around it, until about 1800 BCE.

508
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,020
- So what's the story behind,

509
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,120
like looking at some of these images?

510
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,010
What's the story about constructions like that?

511
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,030
What was the idea?

512
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,680
- That thing, isn't that amazing?

513
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,080
Oh that, gosh.

514
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,840
I mean, it should be some sort of, you know,

515
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,450
I'll be a flaky archeologist, like, you know,

516
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,453
this is a place where rituals took place.

517
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:11,550
So many things we say are so just painfully vague.

518
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,110
And that's about, you know, what we got.

519
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,700
And a place like this.

520
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,320
I know the one we're looking at here,

521
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,330
I've been here a couple of times.

522
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,320
In the pyramid behind it, the rubble's built in a way

523
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,330
where the building won't rock apart.

524
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,810
This is a very earthquake prone place,

525
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,220
but the buildings haven't fallen

526
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,450
because they make these net baskets

527
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,290
of rocks inside that all kinda wiggle around

528
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,933
and don't allow the building to fall down.

529
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,470
And inside these, we've also found a couple of things

530
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,940
that were babies, that were human babies

531
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,890
that were buried in there.

532
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,780
And I don't think, there's a lot of people

533
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,160
that see that and go, oh, look at that.

534
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,040
They were sacrificing babies, these monsters.

535
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,980
I think a lot of the things that are interpreted

536
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,810
as baby sacrifices, Caral's evidence being one of them,

537
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,320
I think it's more about the tragic nature

538
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,970
of infant mortality,

539
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,390
in the past it was a lot more common.

540
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,100
There were cultures that didn't even really

541
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,620
properly name their kid until they got to five

542
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,040
because chances were they were gonna die.

543
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,140
And so I think a lot of these babies

544
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,690
that we find in these ceremonial contexts

545
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,910
that are interpreted as sacrifices,

546
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,490
I think they're putting them in special places

547
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,460
because they mourn the death of their kids

548
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,133
and it just happened a lot more frequently then.

549
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,790
- One of the things you said that really surprised me is

550
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,790
that pyramids were built in Peru, possibly hundreds of years

551
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,176
before they were built in Egypt.

552
00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:47,009
Is that true?

553
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:48,827
- Absolutely, absolutely, in fact, there's.

554
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:50,730
- That's crazy. - There's one

555
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:55,030
that's now pushing 6,000 BCE,

556
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,580
like that's thousands of years before the stuff in Egypt

557
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,990
and that one's called Huaca Prieta.

558
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,640
And it was not a, it was not an Egyptian pyramid.

559
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,750
But it was a pyramid

560
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,273
and it was thousands of years before.

561
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,640
- What do you think is the motivation to build a pyramid?

562
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,530
The fact that it can withstand the elements structurally,

563
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,543
that kind of thing, is it?

564
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,940
Why do humans build pyramids

565
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,850
and why do they build it in all kinds

566
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,830
of different locations in the world?

567
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:36,393
- Well, you know, my root answer is pretty boring really.

568
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,610
A lot of people ask me,

569
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,440
why are there pyramids all over the planet?

570
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,380
How is that, is that a coincidence, I mean, who?

571
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,440
I think that when people wanted

572
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,440
to build a big building without rebar or cement,

573
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,420
you end up building something with a fat base

574
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,293
that goes up to a skinny top and that turns into a pyramid.

575
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,690
You know, any kid who's playing

576
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,120
with blocks on the floor builds a couple towers

577
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,440
and his brother knocks them down.

578
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,990
And if he wants one that's gonna stay and be tall,

579
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,090
he ends up making something with a fat base

580
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,640
and a tiny top.

581
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,970
And I think that, you know, building something big

582
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,750
and tall together is one of those human things.

583
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,930
Like we built that, that will be here after we're gone.

584
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,330
People remember who we were.

585
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,410
We are all, if there's any human commonality,

586
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,350
it's fear of our own deaths and that we were nothing

587
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,000
and no one will ever remember us.

588
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,170
I think that the first big monuments like that were probably

589
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,050
a group of people saying we're gonna do something

590
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,883
that people will remember forever.

591
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,270
Now that being said, you remember we were just talking

592
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,830
about Huaca Prieta and this one

593
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,180
that's almost 6,000 BC now is the first one.

594
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,640
That one's a funny case.

595
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,770
We just talked about all these lofty goals,

596
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,570
but actually I'm pretty sure

597
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:02,570
that Huaca Prieta's first pyramid was about capping

598
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,570
a smelly pile of trash.

599
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,850
I think everybody piled up their trash

600
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,290
in the middle of town.

601
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,920
And it stunk, it's on the coast, it stunk like fish.

602
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,760
And somebody said, if we just bury this thing with dirt,

603
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,560
it won't smell anymore.

604
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,600
And then it was a big mound where people could get up

605
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,660
and talk to everybody and then said, well, it's squishy,

606
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,360
you know, if we cap it with clay,

607
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,490
then it will really not smell.

608
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,310
I really think that the very first pyramids

609
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,403
in Peru were about trash management.

610
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,223
Talk about deflating, huh?

611
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,631
- Yeah, but then they probably saw it

612
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,630
and they were impressed and humbled by the sort

613
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,340
of the enormity of the construction.

614
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,020
And then they're like, oh, we should,

615
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,790
maybe the next guy thought maybe we should

616
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,750
keep building these kinds of things.

617
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,770
- Yeah, yeah, not to jump ahead,

618
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,570
but in North America, you know,

619
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,490
where they also made pyramids.

620
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,320
There's this interesting evolution

621
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,120
where there were these piles of shells along rivers

622
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,390
and along the coastlines, people ate a lot of shells.

623
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,970
That was an easy thing to collect and eat.

624
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,690
So these piles of shells would be near communities

625
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,460
and they probably became landmarks,

626
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,220
but eventually they started burying their dead

627
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,690
inside those too, probably again, you know, about stink

628
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,480
and about, you know, well we don't want the dogs to eat 'em.

629
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,090
Maybe we put 'em in the middle of the shell pile.

630
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,540
But then that all of a sudden became this like,

631
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,610
that's where my grandfather's body is.

632
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,560
That's where great grandfather's body is.

633
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,920
And all of a sudden people started being attached to place,

634
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,050
not just for the resources,

635
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,780
but for the shared memories of their ancestors.

636
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,450
So when the very first pyramid was built

637
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,450
in Ohio area by the Adena people, it was built outta dirt,

638
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,820
but it's full of bodies.

639
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,300
And I think it's an echo of a old thing where they used

640
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,990
to be putting bodies in shell mounds.

641
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,990
- So where and who were the first civilizations

642
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,557
in South America, Mesoamerica?

643
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,200
- Well, you know, I think we're still piecing that together.

644
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,970
Coming back to the first things we talked about,

645
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,490
I think we're still missing a lot of stuff,

646
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,260
especially in South America.

647
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,110
It just keeps getting older and older.

648
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,815
Part of the reason it's hard to answer that question is,

649
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:27,690
you know, at what point do we consider people

650
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,003
a civilization or a culture?

651
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,920
We have in the Americas this long period of time

652
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,760
that we call the Paleo Indian time

653
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,820
where they were hunting megafauna.

654
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,990
And then when those went away,

655
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,850
we get into this even longer period

656
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,950
of time called the archaic,

657
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,780
where they're just hunters and gatherers.

658
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,190
Sometimes somebody's coming up

659
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,130
with a cool different kind of arrowhead.

660
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,410
They go back and forth with different hunting tools,

661
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,490
but really nothing changes for thousands of years.

662
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,860
And then finally they start developing

663
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,030
into these larger groups, which for the most part has

664
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:10,350
to do with agriculture, it used to be archeology.

665
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,350
That was just the end all, be all, civilization starts

666
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,630
with the invention of agriculture.

667
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,820
And we can't have sedentary communities

668
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,100
until people learn how to farm.

669
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,140
But that's been discounted.

670
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,920
Peru was a big part of that, that area of Caral.

671
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,407
It's connected to another city on the coast called Aspero.

672
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:33,390
And Aspero starts about the same time,

673
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,010
but they're all about fishing.

674
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,470
They have no farming.

675
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,350
And Caral who's up river from them is farming.

676
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,170
But funny enough, they're not really farming food.

677
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,380
They're farming cotton and they're making nets

678
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,790
and they're trading the nets

679
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,103
with the people on the coast for the fish.

680
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,440
So it's not as simple as it's just agriculture anymore.

681
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,680
But it is, I think, still rooted in

682
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,350
how can we feed more people than just our family?

683
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,350
How can we together create a food abundance

684
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:09,179
so we're no longer scared about running out of food?

685
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,880
- So is it possible, which is something you've argued

686
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,389
that civilization started in the Amazon,

687
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,943
in the jungle versus the coast?

688
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,120
- I think so, I think religion

689
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,940
in South America began in the Amazon.

690
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,670
I think there were people there, very old.

691
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:31,010
There's actually the earliest pottery in all

692
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,750
of the Americas of all these places

693
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,210
that we have civilizations that grew up, you know,

694
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,730
where the oldest pottery is?

695
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,530
The middle Of the Amazon.

696
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,199
- So there's interesting cultures developing in the Amazon.

697
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,730
So religion, you would say preceded civilization?

698
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:51,483
- In South America, Caral and Aspero,

699
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:52,920
that I was just talking about.

700
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,530
It's weird what a dearth of art

701
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,730
and any evidence of religion we have, we have those pyramids

702
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,680
and things that we call temples,

703
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,450
but we don't really know what went on in there.

704
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:08,450
And there's no hints of religious iconography,

705
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,310
ceremonies, nothing like that.

706
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,370
The first stuff that we get is right

707
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,060
when that culture ends about 1800 BCE,

708
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,060
this culture called Chavin starts up and they,

709
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,620
their main temple is up in the Andes.

710
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,280
And this place of path

711
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,240
of least resistance between the Amazon and the coast.

712
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,540
It's about three days walk either way from this place

713
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,640
where this temple is, that's

714
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,270
where we start seeing the very first religious iconography.

715
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,270
And it's all over the temples.

716
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,610
There are things that are definitely from the coast,

717
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:52,110
but the iconography are all jaguars and snakes

718
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,670
and crocodiles, and those don't come from the coast.

719
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,340
All of those things are coming out of the Amazon.

720
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,590
- Religion is a really powerful idea.

721
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,560
Religions are one of the most powerful ideas.

722
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,810
They're the strongest myths that tie people together.

723
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:11,810
And to you, it's possible that this powerful idea

724
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,380
in South America started in the Amazon.

725
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,243
- I do, I do think it did.

726
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,791
And you're right, you know,

727
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:25,410
ideas are more powerful than weapons,

728
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,570
but archeology can't see them at all.

729
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:32,130
We can see, sometimes we can see ideas manifesting

730
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,040
in the things they create and lead to,

731
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,350
but there's an interpretation problem.

732
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,990
Are we right about what idea created this?

733
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,800
That those are things that archeology just can't get at.

734
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,840
- That's one of the challenges of archeology

735
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,880
and looking into ancient histories.

736
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,360
You're trying to not just understand

737
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,010
what they were doing in terms of architecture,

738
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,920
but understand what was going on inside their mind.

739
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,470
- That's really what I'm in it for,

740
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,330
trying to understand these people

741
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,800
and it's real detective work

742
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,270
and we know we're dealing with a totally flawed record.

743
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,603
We only have what could preserve the test of time.

744
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:12,630
You know, if we look around this room here,

745
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,290
if 2000 years of weathering happened in this room,

746
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,443
what would be left and what would we think happened here?

747
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,020
- Right, right, right.

748
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,690
But there's not in this room,

749
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,940
but if you look at thousands of rooms like it,

750
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,620
maybe you can start to piece things together

751
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,773
about the different ideologies that ruled the world,

752
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,720
the religions, the different ideas.

753
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,090
Tell me about this fanged deity.

754
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,220
One of your more controversial ideas is

755
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,220
that you believe that the religions,

756
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,960
there's a thread that connects the different civilizations

757
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,920
to societies of the Indian region

758
00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:00,240
and the religion that practice is more monotheistic

759
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,080
than is currently believed in the mainstream.

760
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,520
- That is exactly what I think.

761
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,800
And I think it's all about this fanged deity

762
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,160
who somewhere thousands of years ago crawled his way out

763
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,480
of the Amazon up into the Andes and a religion took hold.

764
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,820
That could have been kind of a combination

765
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,860
of ideas from the coast and the Amazon.

766
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,793
But he is the one creator deity,

767
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:26,910
in my opinion, through all of these cultures.

768
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,670
And the people in the Amazon still talk about him.

769
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,810
There his name is Vijomase in some groups.

770
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,310
But they say that his emissaries on Earth are the jaguars

771
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,980
and that he is the creator deity.

772
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,380
- Why is the current mainstream belief is that a lot

773
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,320
of the religions are not monotheistic?

774
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,287
- Well, there are bonafide pantheons.

775
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,020
You know, Greece had one,

776
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,030
Egypt had one, Mesopotamia had one.

777
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,490
Lots of the early religions

778
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:59,610
of the old world were pantheons.

779
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,860
And I think that was part of the problem.

780
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,950
The earliest archeologists walked in there

781
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,140
with a preconceived notion

782
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,450
that ancient cultures have pantheons.

783
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,680
And so they went to the art looking for them

784
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,810
and they came up with things like the shark god

785
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:19,830
and the moon goddess and the sun God and all these things.

786
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,600
But when I look at the art,

787
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,830
and I was trained by a person right here in Austin, Texas

788
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,690
as an art historian,

789
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:32,640
you follow certain diagnostic traits through art

790
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,650
to see the development over time.

791
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,820
And when I look at it

792
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,210
and use that methodology, there's a single face

793
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,830
with goggle eyes and fangs and claws on his hands and feet

794
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:47,550
and snakes coming off of his head and off of his belt.

795
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,280
He's got really identifiable traits.

796
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,100
He also likes to sever people's heads off

797
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,660
and carry them around.

798
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,280
But he's the fanged deity

799
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,000
and he's there, he shows up in Chavin de Huantar,

800
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,790
the capital of that Chavin culture.

801
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,330
And he keeps showing up through every culture,

802
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,300
even thousands of miles away

803
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,850
throughout the next two millennium,

804
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,860
right up to the Inca.

805
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:18,860
The Inca have a creator deity, they call Viracocha.

806
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,023
But Viracocha is the fanged deity.

807
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,520
When we do see him, by the time you get to Inca,

808
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,480
they do this kind of like almost Islamic thing

809
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,190
where they say you can't understand the face of Viracocha.

810
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,910
So when they do put him in a cosmogram,

811
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,800
they'll make him just a blob.

812
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,650
Like he's just unknowable, but he's at the very top.

813
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,700
I think we're misunderstanding a lot of things that we used

814
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,380
to say were deities as just supernatural beings.

815
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,900
If we flip the mirror on Christianity

816
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,800
and take a look at it,

817
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,800
which of course Christianity's monotheistic, right,

818
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,500
it would be heresy to say otherwise.

819
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,690
But who are all these other characters?

820
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,790
Who are all these angels and demons

821
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,010
and you know, Jesus Christ

822
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,950
and I mean, I don't even know who the Holy Spirit is,

823
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,810
but he's some sort of supernatural being.

824
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:17,810
But it's that monotheistic system has lots of things

825
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,993
that have supernatural powers that are not God.

826
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,718
That's where I think the crux

827
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:29,190
of us misunderstanding ancient Andean art is.

828
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:33,090
- So what is the process of analyzing art through time

829
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,010
to try to figure out

830
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,850
what the important entities are for that culture?

831
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,480
Do you just see what shows up over

832
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,610
and over and over and over?

833
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,723
- Well, certainly without the advent of writing,

834
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,660
depictions in art have all sorts

835
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,550
of meanings encoded in them.

836
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,840
And there are certain, you know,

837
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,080
what we call diagnostic elements.

838
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,560
Like we can pull apart the same sort

839
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,500
of thing in like in the Greek pantheon, you know,

840
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,170
you know by their dress and what they're holding,

841
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,340
what the different gods are.

842
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,880
You can tell Hades from Zeus

843
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,590
by the different things they're holding, you know,

844
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:16,590
lightning bolts or tridents or whatever it is.

845
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,010
So they all have these diagnostic elements to them.

846
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,780
So that's how art history goes

847
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,320
about analyzing art over time.

848
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,750
Once we can put it in a chronological sequence,

849
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,850
then we can say, okay,

850
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,510
here's a deity here in Chavin culture.

851
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:37,920
Now we move forward 500 years, now we're in Moche

852
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,310
and Nazca culture, you know,

853
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,550
where are the deities here?

854
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,180
And what I see is that same guy with not just one

855
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,050
or two traits, but a whole package of them

856
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,880
that shows up again and again

857
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,400
and again for thousands of years in each one

858
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,700
of these cultures, he's got circular eyes,

859
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,280
he's got a fanged mouth,

860
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,790
he's got claws on his hands and feet.

861
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,050
He's a humanoid,

862
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,030
but he also has snakes coming off of his head, like hair

863
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,070
and snakes coming off of his belt.

864
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:16,530
And then not so much in Chavin,

865
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,800
but as it goes forward, he starts carting around

866
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,170
severed heads, human severed heads.

867
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,143
So they're like, in the old literature,

868
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,760
the Moche will call him the decapitator deity.

869
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,650
But then they have these other like,

870
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,290
oh, here's the crab deity and here's the fox deity.

871
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:41,010
But if you look at them, like the crab deity is just

872
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,740
that guy's face coming off of a crab.

873
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,340
And the fox deity is that guy's face coming off of a fox.

874
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,760
So I think on that particular instance,

875
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,610
I explained it similar to what Zeus did.

876
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,380
You know how Zeus was able to like, you know,

877
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,180
turn into whatever animal he wanted

878
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,800
to get with the woman he wanted.

879
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,660
And he showed up in all sorts of forms.

880
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,190
But he was always Zeus.

881
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,080
I think that the fanged deity manifests himself

882
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,740
through people and animals throughout the art.

883
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,010
And that there are missing stories of mythology

884
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,230
that we don't have anymore.

885
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,270
- And across hundreds of years, thousands

886
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,450
of years from Chavin to Moche to Inca as you're saying.

887
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,760
- Right, Wari has them too.

888
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,230
Tiwanaku, that famous place Pumapunku,

889
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,580
he's all over there.

890
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,440
- I wonder how those ideas spread and morph

891
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,640
of this fanged deity.

892
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,970
- I think people walked and proselytized

893
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,220
and places like Chavin,

894
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,670
there's a later one in Inca times called Pachacamac

895
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,060
that are pilgrimage places where people come in

896
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,370
to be healed if they're sick,

897
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,700
but also just to pay homage to the powers that be.

898
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,960
So Chavin was a place where people from the Amazon

899
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,720
and people from the coast were all coming together.

900
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,090
In fact, we saw it in the archeology there.

901
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:07,800
There's these interesting labyrinths under the pyramids

902
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,100
with the fanged deity all over them that have like,

903
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,350
one labyrinth will have all pottery.

904
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,780
The next labyrinth will have a bunch of animal bones.

905
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,690
The next one will have a bunch of things made outta stone.

906
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,040
So people are showing up and giving this tribute

907
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,030
and they're learning

908
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,830
and then they're going back to their community.

909
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:29,250
So I think it dispersed from certain pilgrimage spots

910
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,430
and became just like pilgrimage spots do.

911
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,380
Somebody goes back and they build a temple

912
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,840
to the fanged deity.

913
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,230
- Do we know much about the relationship they had

914
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,700
with the fanged deity and like their conception

915
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,983
of the powers of the fanged deity?

916
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:50,550
Were they afraid of the fanged deities

917
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,920
and all knowing God?

918
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,920
Is it something that brings joy and harvest

919
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,627
or is it something that you're supposed to be afraid of

920
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:05,627
and sacrifice animals and humans to keep at bay?

921
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,280
- I think he had two sides of the coin.

922
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,830
Like a lot of the Hindu gods are, you know,

923
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:14,043
one aspect is terrible, the other aspect is lovely.

924
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,400
I think he had that same sorts of qualities

925
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,570
'cause we do see him

926
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,720
as a fierce warrior taking people's heads off.

927
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,220
And he is a jaguar, which in

928
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,880
and of itself implies a certain power and ferocity.

929
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,890
But then there are other funny things about him.

930
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,650
Like he is definitely involved

931
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,480
in a lot of healing ceremonies

932
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,670
and a lot of those healing ceremonies are involved

933
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,670
with sex acts, when it comes to the Moche,

934
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,690
there's this whole group

935
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,620
of sexual pottery where priests are having sex

936
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,183
with women or men.

937
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,500
And some of them show their faces transforming

938
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,810
into that fanged deity.

939
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,273
Like he is acting through them.

940
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,750
But the thing that most cracks me up

941
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,970
that shows his softer side

942
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:03,270
is the fanged deity has a little puppy.

943
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,570
He has a puppy that's like just dancing around his feet

944
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,000
and like jumping up on him in various scenes.

945
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,140
They see him again and again.

946
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,860
Sometimes he's in these healing sex scenes.

947
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:18,420
In fact, I tracked that puppy from other contexts

948
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,290
to these sex scenes where a priest was having sex

949
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:25,530
with somebody in a house and there's a fanged deity

950
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:27,360
and there's a puppy just scratching at the door like,

951
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,920
hey, you forgot me.

952
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,070
And then finally one day I found one

953
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,560
with the puppy having sex with the woman

954
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,060
instead of the fanged deity.

955
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,420
I was like, oh, he really is very involved in this.

956
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,560
What is this weird puppy?

957
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,840
So yeah, he likes to take heads off,

958
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,970
but he also has a puppy he adores.

959
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,093
- Actually this awesomely makes sense now

960
00:47:47,093 --> 00:47:49,020
because I saw the opening

961
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:53,220
of a paper you wrote 30 years ago on shamanism

962
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,110
and Moche civilization.

963
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:58,200
It reads "the Moche are the major focus of this paper,

964
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,710
sex, puppies and headhunting will be shown to be related

965
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,447
to ancient Moche shamanism."

966
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,560
So now I understand, I was like, well, the puppies?

967
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,057
- [Ed] Yeah, it's true.

968
00:48:09,057 --> 00:48:11,760
- And the headhunting, that's the decapitate aspect.

969
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,240
- And I've added rock and roll to that list since actually,

970
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,290
rock and roll are, you know,

971
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,153
music is also a big part of it.

972
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,990
- Oh, interesting. - They call spirits down.

973
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,370
There's this whole spirit world.

974
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,140
There's the ancestors

975
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,860
and the people that drink San Pedro cactus juice

976
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,130
kind of, they don't talk about the fanged deity anymore.

977
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,410
I think Christianity in 500 years

978
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:38,070
has somewhat put him in the back.

979
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,860
You know, it was unpopular to have a pagan deity.

980
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,200
So they don't talk about him much anymore,

981
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,550
though he's still around.

982
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,913
They're in like around Trujillo, they call him Aiapec.

983
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,510
But music play in the Amazon, they play flutes.

984
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,730
Sometimes a chorus of women sing

985
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:59,490
and that's supposed to bring the spirits down

986
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,110
into the ceremony.

987
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,660
There's a spirit that's hurting the person that's sick.

988
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,350
And then the priest or the shaman or the curandero,

989
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:12,350
whatever you wanna call him, has his own posse of spirits

990
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,330
that are gonna help him figure out what's going on.

991
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:19,620
So when the music starts, that's bringing

992
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,110
those spirits in and people don't see them

993
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:26,520
unless they've imbibed the San Pedro Cactus Juice,

994
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,650
which is the hallucinogen,

995
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,340
which is in the Amazon side, it was ayahuasca.

996
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,723
On the coast, it was San Pedro Cactus.

997
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,940
But that's what allows you to actually see that other world.

998
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,427
- Yeah, I went to the Amazon recently

999
00:49:44,427 --> 00:49:48,300
and did Ayahuasca, a very high dose of it.

1000
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,133
- Bold move.

1001
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,253
- When in Rome.

1002
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,190
How far back does that go?

1003
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,160
- Oh, I think longer than anybody can remember.

1004
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,040
But I mean, it's a natural plant that's been there forever.

1005
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,860
I think that it's thousands and thousands of years.

1006
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,730
That's another thing Chavin de Huantar, I was talking about,

1007
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,110
where I think the things came,

1008
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,840
the religion came from the Amazon.

1009
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,660
There's this wall on the backside

1010
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,310
that faces the Amazon side.

1011
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:20,700
So if you're entering the city from the Amazon path,

1012
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,800
you see this wall first.

1013
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,380
And it's a bunch of faces that some of them are human,

1014
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,030
some of them are total jaguar

1015
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:30,870
and some of them are transforming in between.

1016
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,730
But there's a group of them

1017
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,400
that are midway through transformation

1018
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,400
and they show their nostrils leaking out this snot

1019
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,320
that's coming like down their face.

1020
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,730
San Pedro doesn't do that to you, but ayahuasca does.

1021
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,430
Ayahuasca traditionally, they'd take a blow gun

1022
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:53,790
and just shoot it up your nose or up your ass.

1023
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,250
But a lot of times up your nose.

1024
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,350
And when it shoots up your nose, the first thing

1025
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,460
that happens is just this gush of snot comes out of you.

1026
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,790
And there are stone depictions

1027
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,490
of people uncontrollably snotting

1028
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,357
on the backside of this temple from,

1029
00:51:10,357 --> 00:51:12,930
you know, 3000 years ago.

1030
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,990
- So that you think could have been a big component

1031
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:19,110
of the development of religion and shamanism?

1032
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:23,730
- I think that hallucinogens opened the mind then,

1033
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:25,650
like they opened the mind now.

1034
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,500
- Do you think that, you know, the stoned ape theory,

1035
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,330
do you think that actually could have been

1036
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:34,983
an actual catalyst for the formation of civilization?

1037
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,780
- In the Americas, yes, I do, though,

1038
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,970
you know, hallucinogens are not part

1039
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,420
of every ancient tradition in the world.

1040
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,840
In fact, strangely, the majority of plants

1041
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:53,310
that are actually psychotropic, not just mood altering,

1042
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,710
are from here in the Americas.

1043
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:59,220
There are very few drugs

1044
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,250
that will make you hallucinate outside of the Americas.

1045
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,750
Of course now they're global

1046
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,200
and you know, they can be grown all over the place.

1047
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,060
But originally speaking,

1048
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,910
very, very few were outside of the Americas.

1049
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,490
So they were part of the experience here in a way

1050
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,850
that they just couldn't be in other places.

1051
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,370
- I wondered to a degree, they were just part of a ritual

1052
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:25,080
and the creative force behind sort of art

1053
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,790
versus like literally the method

1054
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:33,110
by which you come up with ideas that define a civilization.

1055
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,740
So like the degree

1056
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,500
to which they had a role in the formation of civilizations.

1057
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,020
It's kind of fun to think about psychedelics being

1058
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:46,050
like a critical role in formation of civilizations.

1059
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,300
- I think in terms of South America,

1060
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,953
they really were.

1061
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:55,171
In North America where we're in a more northern climb here

1062
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,970
and there are less of them, not so much, at least in terms

1063
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:00,060
of psychedelics, things like, you know,

1064
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,760
tobacco was always a big part of it.

1065
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,990
But a lot of the, you know,

1066
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,850
there's more than one way

1067
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,580
to reach a hallucinatory state.

1068
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:13,580
The hard way is starvation, sleep deprivation.

1069
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,110
And for the Maya, for example,

1070
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,080
would go sleep deprivation, starvation,

1071
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,570
and then they'd cut themselves very badly.

1072
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:26,280
And that loss of blood, we believe triggered hallucinations

1073
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,013
and visions, nothing to do with drugs.

1074
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,165
I would much prefer the drugs route.

1075
00:53:32,165 --> 00:53:34,140
- It's the result,

1076
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:38,610
the tools aren't the thing that creates insight.

1077
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,368
It's the result.

1078
00:53:40,368 --> 00:53:42,357
- It's that getting to, you know,

1079
00:53:42,357 --> 00:53:45,180
the hallucinogens are poisoning us, they're killing us.

1080
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,480
That's, you know, it's a near death state.

1081
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,170
And people of the Americas believed

1082
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,200
sleeping was entering that other world.

1083
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,877
Death, you entered this other world

1084
00:53:56,877 --> 00:54:00,720
and that when you took this mighty dose of poison,

1085
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,070
it was helping you enter

1086
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,710
that other world for a period of time.

1087
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,057
- Yeah, as Tom Waits said in that one song,

1088
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:10,230
"I like my town with a little drop of poison."

1089
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,820
So maybe that poison is a good catalyst for invention.

1090
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:19,820
So who were the early first sort of mother cultures,

1091
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,060
mother civilizations in South America?

1092
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:28,050
And like what is, if we look chronologically,

1093
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,940
is there a label we can put

1094
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,433
on the first peoples that emerged?

1095
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,980
- That picture is evolving.

1096
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,340
I mean, forever it was just the Chavin people

1097
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,450
that we've been talking about.

1098
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,490
The ones with all the first depictions

1099
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,250
of religious art were the mother culture.

1100
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,410
And they certainly did transmit a lot of stuff,

1101
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:50,460
but then all of a sudden we find Caral.

1102
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,000
The next one that we've barely even begun looking at,

1103
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,290
but it's probably older than Caral is Sachin culture.

1104
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,360
I was just poking around there last year

1105
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,320
and just from the bus on the highway,

1106
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,280
I could see like, that's a pyramid out there.

1107
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,960
What, oh, there's another one.

1108
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,900
And I know how old the stuff we have studied there is,

1109
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,960
it's again, 3000 BC,

1110
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,660
we're just barely beginning to understand them.

1111
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,580
Caral frustrates me to no end.

1112
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:24,210
The lack of art there that's, we've got, you know,

1113
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:28,680
stones and bones and not even ceramics to go on.

1114
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,960
And they didn't have the courtesy to leave me a bunch

1115
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,070
of art I can interpret.

1116
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:34,530
So I don't know what those people believed.

1117
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,300
- Right, so one of the ways to understand

1118
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,190
what people believe is looking at the art,

1119
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:41,550
the stories told through the art, and then hopefully

1120
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,430
deciphering if they were doing any kind of writing.

1121
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:46,260
- That's our most fruitful place to try

1122
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,930
to get at these elusive ideas.

1123
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,353
- Yeah, and it sucks when they don't have art.

1124
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,560
If we just go back to the Amazon, you've mentioned

1125
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,380
that it's possible that there's a lost civilization

1126
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,030
that existed in the Amazon.

1127
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:05,030
So it's carried a lot of names, Lost City of Z or El Dorado.

1128
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,050
Do you think it's possible it existed?

1129
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,250
- Well, City of Z

1130
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:11,700
and El Dorado are in pretty different places.

1131
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,330
El Dorado, the ideas of where it is kind

1132
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,180
of center around towards Columbia.

1133
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,850
And the City of Z is named

1134
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:24,630
after a region of Brazil called the Xingu.

1135
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:29,610
And so those, those are an America worth

1136
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,761
of distance apart, you know,

1137
00:56:31,761 --> 00:56:33,960
people don't really think about it on the map,

1138
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,340
but the entire United States would fit inside the Amazon.

1139
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,500
That's how big that place is.

1140
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,210
And these two are on either end,

1141
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:45,930
but both of them have evidence of civilizations.

1142
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,260
These big, you know, it's lowland

1143
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,820
and it floods all the time.

1144
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,190
So what they did is they'd make these big mounds

1145
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:57,450
and then they'd make huge causeways between mounds

1146
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,400
so they could walk through their cities

1147
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,710
while they were seasonally inundated.

1148
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:06,120
And a bunch of that stuff has been found in the Xingu area,

1149
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,000
like huge areas that would support

1150
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,980
tens of thousands of people.

1151
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,590
Again, you know, it's not stone built

1152
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:16,140
and it's been under the forest forever,

1153
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,420
so it's very torn up.

1154
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,680
But it's there now.

1155
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,910
You know, Brazil is big

1156
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:23,220
on cattle farming more than ever now.

1157
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:27,120
And a thing that I think is completed now is Brazil

1158
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,930
and Bolivia partnered together

1159
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:34,620
and built a highway all the way across

1160
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,399
and opened up a whole bunch more land, which has found more

1161
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:42,390
of these, what we call like geometric earthworks.

1162
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:46,117
So there's more and more evidence of these civilizations.

1163
00:57:46,117 --> 00:57:50,460
It's not, it could be there, it's there for sure.

1164
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,570
- By the way, the people who are trying

1165
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,970
to protect the rainforest really hate the highway.

1166
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,650
One of the things I learned is

1167
00:57:55,650 --> 00:58:00,033
if you build a road, loggers will come.

1168
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,330
And they'll start cutting stuff down.

1169
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,880
Now from an archeology perspective, if you cut down trees,

1170
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,770
you get to discover things.

1171
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:10,440
But from a sort of protecting

1172
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,070
very precious rainforest perspective,

1173
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,053
it's obviously the opposite way.

1174
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,650
But it is interesting I've seen where loggers cut

1175
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:20,700
through the forest

1176
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,700
and when they leave the forest heals itself very quickly.

1177
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,290
- [Ed] So quick, so quickly.

1178
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:31,443
- And you know, you just think that across decades,

1179
00:58:32,841 --> 00:58:36,990
you expand that to centuries and it's like you could see

1180
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:39,960
how a civilization could be completely swallowed up

1181
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,790
by the rainforest.

1182
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,550
- And it happened for sure in the Amazon.

1183
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:47,760
You know, one of the ways that we're trying

1184
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,000
to push the frontier of where people were in the Amazon

1185
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,160
'cause yes, the trees

1186
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,160
and just the biomass have eaten so much evidence,

1187
00:58:58,890 --> 00:58:59,970
but they're finding more

1188
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:04,050
and more of these places that they call terra preta,

1189
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:08,460
which is black earth and there's huge swaths of it.

1190
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,580
So I guess the anthropology term

1191
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:15,510
is anthropogenic landscapes.

1192
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,850
And what they're saying is that

1193
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:21,360
that really dark earth couldn't have just got that way

1194
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,400
through natural forest processes

1195
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,210
that sometime in the distant past that forest wasn't there

1196
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,010
and there was major farming

1197
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:31,440
and human activity to the point

1198
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,200
where they totally turned the soil black

1199
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,570
and it's much more enriched.

1200
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:39,900
And when I took a trip into the Amazon,

1201
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,860
I went from Manaus up the river, the black river a couple

1202
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,950
of days and went and met some different communities

1203
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,920
and I asked them about this black earth

1204
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,500
and they were like, yeah, that's why we're here.

1205
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,510
Sometimes we move our village,

1206
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:58,920
but when we move we look for the terra preta

1207
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,570
and that's where we're gonna put our village

1208
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,240
because that's a place that all of our gardens work.

1209
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,710
The other places they don't.

1210
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,631
- One of the things you talked about literally,

1211
01:00:06,631 --> 01:00:09,060
you have to ask the right question

1212
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:13,440
and the stories, all the secrets that carried

1213
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,690
by the people and they'll tell you.

1214
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,490
- Yeah, there's so many of them.

1215
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:18,720
You know, a thing

1216
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,910
that excites the world about archeology right now

1217
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,650
is Gobekli Tepe and this,

1218
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:26,880
you know, 10,000, now Karahan Tepe is 11,000.

1219
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,190
The whole area is called the Tas Tepeler,

1220
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,100
we only found it a couple of decades ago,

1221
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,553
but it was just a, you know,

1222
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:35,790
a archeologist rowing through the area

1223
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:38,250
and ask a sheep herder, hey, you know,

1224
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,720
you guys know where anything ancient is?

1225
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,970
Oh yeah, lemme show you this.

1226
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,970
And then all of a sudden we've got a lost civilization.

1227
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,670
And the shepherds always knew where it was,

1228
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,350
just nobody asked him.

1229
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,783
- So speaking of Gobekli Tepe,

1230
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,650
what do you think about the work

1231
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:55,230
of Gram Hancock who also believes

1232
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:59,100
that there's a lost civilization in the Amazon?

1233
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:03,900
- Well, I've met Graham and personally I like him.

1234
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,120
He's a nice guy, got a nice sense of humor,

1235
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,270
and I think he's smart.

1236
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:13,560
And I also think he is a very good researcher.

1237
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,370
He and I are working on the same set of facts.

1238
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,800
The differences are interpretations.

1239
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,520
I do not believe Graham's idea

1240
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,990
that a single now lost ancient civilization seeded

1241
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:28,860
the rest of them.

1242
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,700
I just don't see that on a number of levels, artifact wise,

1243
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:36,273
technology wise, art, historical analysis.

1244
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,993
So I think his research is great.

1245
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,900
I think that he's very well read,

1246
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,690
in fact better read than a lot of my colleagues.

1247
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:48,900
But his conclusions I disagree with.

1248
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,950
And he and I have talked about this and had a very civil

1249
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,080
and normal conversation about it,

1250
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,470
and agree to disagree without spitting any venom

1251
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,060
at any point in the conversation.

1252
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:04,173
- That would be a fun argument to be a fly on the wall for.

1253
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,350
So he believes, he's proposed,

1254
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,300
it's possible that the Amazon jungle is

1255
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,630
sort of a manmade garden.

1256
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:17,340
So it was planted there by advanced ancient civilization.

1257
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,953
Is there any degree to which that could be possible?

1258
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,560
- Frankly, I agree with him.

1259
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,223
I mean, it's just like what I was just talking about,

1260
01:02:25,223 --> 01:02:28,950
it's the conclusion part that we differ from.

1261
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,290
But the facts that he's basing that on are

1262
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:36,090
that terra preta are the huge geometric earthworks,

1263
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:38,430
are the ever increasing evidence of them.

1264
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,470
They are now from, you know,

1265
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:44,490
the bottom of Bolivia to Guyana.

1266
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:45,570
They're everywhere.

1267
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:49,860
Every time we open up the jungle, we find these big works.

1268
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:53,790
So yes, there was a vast civilization that was there.

1269
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:58,790
How advanced they were is a question.

1270
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:02,460
And also, you know, a perspective thing.

1271
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:07,460
Graham really focuses in on what we don't know.

1272
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,240
And what could be.

1273
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,490
- What's the, just to educate me,

1274
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,920
what's the key idea that he's proposing

1275
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,090
that you disagree with?

1276
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,450
It was the level of advancement the civilization was,

1277
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,940
or how large and centralized it was?

1278
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:24,300
- My main point of disagreement is that his,

1279
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,490
and his ideas evolve, like everybody's,

1280
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,220
you know, no scientist

1281
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,670
or researcher in anything, has an idea at the beginning

1282
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,120
of their career and holds it till the day they die.

1283
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,480
His ideas are evolving, but his ideas remain,

1284
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:44,460
a core of them are that there was a very advanced single,

1285
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:48,960
ancient civilization that was utterly destroyed

1286
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,000
by climactic conditions.

1287
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And the Younger Dryas hypothesis is part of that,

1288
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,020
most recently, he used to not say that,

1289
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,423
now he's into this meteor thing,

1290
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:06,240
but he believes that that civilization was destroyed,

1291
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:11,240
but that members of it escaped this cataclysm

1292
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:15,500
and then spread out all over the world to seed all

1293
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,800
of the world's civilizations for the next revival.

1294
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,360
There's where I disagree with him,

1295
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,900
I think these were independent civilizations that grew up

1296
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,130
in their own ways, that they were not seeded

1297
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:33,150
by some more advanced civilization from the past.

1298
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:36,210
And that they all hold things in common

1299
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:39,650
because they have this common ancestry of a, you know,

1300
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:44,370
in his early books he suggested it's Atlantis.

1301
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,470
I don't think he suggests that anymore,

1302
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:50,430
but he still hangs on to the single advanced,

1303
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:55,310
now completely lost civilization and, you know, archeology.

1304
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:56,910
So we don't have, you know,

1305
01:04:56,910 --> 01:05:00,150
all of our ideas are theories.

1306
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,770
Very few of them are facts,

1307
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,320
and we're not, you know, we could have the story wrong,

1308
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,380
but one thing we're real good at is finding stuff.

1309
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,910
I mean, we find fish scales, so I find it just

1310
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:15,420
too big a pill to swallow that there was a civilization

1311
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,970
that was that technologically advanced

1312
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:21,363
and that large that we can't even find a potsherd from.

1313
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:26,580
- Yeah, and of course, it is a compelling story

1314
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,510
that there's a single civilization from which all

1315
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,260
of this came from, because the alternative is, you know,

1316
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:37,876
the idea that we came across the Bering Strait

1317
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:41,820
from Asia, went all the way down to South America

1318
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,410
and got isolated

1319
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:48,410
and created all these marvelous, sophisticated civilizations

1320
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:53,450
and ideas, including religious ideas that look similar

1321
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:57,280
to other, you know, everybody has a flood myth.

1322
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:00,600
So like, there's a lot of similarities.

1323
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,103
Everybody building pyramids.

1324
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,870
But there could be a lot of other explanations

1325
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:13,530
and even if it's a simple, compelling explanation

1326
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:16,234
that has to be evidence for it, right.

1327
01:06:16,234 --> 01:06:17,880
And what would that evidence look like?

1328
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,861
- Well, that's the bottom line.

1329
01:06:18,861 --> 01:06:19,950
I mean, everything's theories,

1330
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:22,050
and as responsible scientists we're trying

1331
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,580
to disprove our theories.

1332
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:27,346
We are not supposed to be trying to prove our theories.

1333
01:06:27,346 --> 01:06:30,420
That's one more foot out of the science box

1334
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,360
that archeology often steps.

1335
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,280
We're supposed to be disproving

1336
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,160
what we think is happening, not proving it.

1337
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,023
- Yeah, you don't wanna lean into the mystery too much.

1338
01:06:44,006 --> 01:06:46,560
I mean, it's such a weird discipline

1339
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,120
'cause you're operating in a,

1340
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,650
it's like really in a dark room,

1341
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:50,940
you're feeling around a dark room.

1342
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,580
So it's mostly mystery, I would say,

1343
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:57,753
a lot of sciences operate in a mostly well lit room.

1344
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:59,740
It's like a dark corner

1345
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,420
and you're kind of figuring out a way to light it.

1346
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:06,480
But in, yeah, in archeology, it's,

1347
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,250
most of it is a mystery, right?

1348
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:11,997
- Yes, it's job security, I like that part, you know.

1349
01:07:11,997 --> 01:07:15,210
But I do also try to always remind myself

1350
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:18,270
that every paradigm shifting idea

1351
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:23,270
that humans have ever had began as heresy and lunacy.

1352
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,010
You know, that guy was crazy up

1353
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:28,110
to the second he was brilliant.

1354
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,480
And so we gotta keep our minds open

1355
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,080
to the things that sound outlandish,

1356
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,410
because one of them eventually is gonna lead us

1357
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:39,060
to the big paradigm shift.

1358
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:43,200
And if we, you know, if we're busy burning books of ideas

1359
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,170
that we don't like, that's where we close our minds

1360
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:48,480
to the possibility of advancing things.

1361
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,835
- I really love that,

1362
01:07:49,835 --> 01:07:51,540
and I really appreciate that you're saying that.

1363
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:56,500
One of the fascinating things about just the Amazon to me is

1364
01:07:57,802 --> 01:08:00,602
that there's still a large number of uncontacted tribes.

1365
01:08:01,848 --> 01:08:05,840
To rewind back into ancient history, you can imagine all

1366
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,820
of these tribes that existed in the Amazon

1367
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:13,820
that were isolated, very sort of distinct from each other.

1368
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:17,790
Can you speak to this, your understanding of these tribes

1369
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:20,640
and their history that are still here today?

1370
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,160
- Well, a lot of them are these, you know,

1371
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,859
by uncontacted we mean

1372
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:27,660
we don't know anything about these guys.

1373
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,850
We know roughly where they are,

1374
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:33,270
but places like Ecuador have very responsible policies

1375
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,300
where no one's allowed to go contact them.

1376
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,250
So we have a dearth of information.

1377
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,899
If they walk out of the jungle

1378
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:41,939
and talk to us, that's one thing.

1379
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:44,490
But we don't go out and there looking for 'em.

1380
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:47,310
But they do seem, you know, frozen in time.

1381
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,979
And I don't think any of us have a good estimation

1382
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:52,770
of how long they've been like that.

1383
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:55,680
But, you know, we were saying earlier that, you know,

1384
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:00,359
humans change based on pressures of their environment.

1385
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:03,689
You know, it's a mother necessity is oftentimes

1386
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:07,023
how we invent things or why we change it's pressure.

1387
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:10,800
And one thing the Amazon is, once you, you know,

1388
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:14,939
figure out how not to die in it, it's a paradise of food,

1389
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:18,479
food's falling from the sky all the time there.

1390
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:21,330
And if once you learn to adapt to that environment,

1391
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:23,100
you've got very little need.

1392
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,580
There's no pressure to make anything else.

1393
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,109
Things are working.

1394
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:29,640
- So for the modern humans

1395
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,040
that come across these uncontacted tribes,

1396
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,689
one of the things they document

1397
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:37,979
and notice is the propensity of these tribes for violence.

1398
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,645
So they get very aggressive

1399
01:09:39,645 --> 01:09:42,479
in attacking whoever they come across.

1400
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,939
- And not just foreigners, they attack each other.

1401
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:48,120
The Yanomami are famous for just having

1402
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,510
never ending feuds with each other.

1403
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:54,212
- What do you think of the philosophy behind that?

1404
01:09:56,017 --> 01:09:59,880
- I don't, you know, I'm a relatively peaceful person,

1405
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,260
but I've got, you know,

1406
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,530
I've got the monster in me like everybody does.

1407
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:09,530
And I think that these, you know, it's cultural norms

1408
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:12,090
that become institutionalized.

1409
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:14,370
For the Yanomami, they really,

1410
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:18,540
part of the rite of passage to be a man

1411
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:23,540
is to go kill or maim somebody from an outer village.

1412
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,250
And they go in there, they oftentimes,

1413
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:30,420
the way they don't let inbreeding set in

1414
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,040
and ruin everybody, not that they think

1415
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,920
of it scientifically, but they typically go

1416
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,430
and steal women from far off communities.

1417
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,830
And that starts a big fight.

1418
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:42,420
Another thing that starts fights

1419
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:46,080
when nobody even fought is illness.

1420
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,330
Illness in the Amazon

1421
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:51,150
and all of the ancient Americas wasn't seen

1422
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:54,660
as a biological thing, it was a spiritual thing.

1423
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,840
So if somebody in your village gets sick,

1424
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,130
the question is asked, well, what spirit is menacing him?

1425
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,860
And who called it out on him?

1426
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,120
And then the rumor starts,

1427
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,860
well, I bet you it was Joe over there

1428
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,630
in that other community, he's still pissed off

1429
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:11,790
for that time when we stole his daughter.

1430
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,560
And we ought to go over there and kill Joe.

1431
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,860
And then he'll get better.

1432
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:20,550
And so this round of never ending violence,

1433
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,860
like Hatfield and McCoys had that thing.

1434
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:27,860
And the people of New Guinea also do that.

1435
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,783
So it's not, you know, there are certain areas,

1436
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,010
mostly wooded areas now that I think about it,

1437
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,630
where people just hide out

1438
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:40,993
and they attack each other as a cultural institution.

1439
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,220
- It's such a tricky thing to do,

1440
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,860
to study an uncontacted tribe

1441
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,990
without obviously contacting them

1442
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:52,710
to figure out their language, their philosophy of mind,

1443
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,890
how they communicate, the hierarchy they operate under.

1444
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:59,010
- And yeah, you know, there was a fascinating story in Peru,

1445
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,260
I guess it was probably like eight years ago or something,

1446
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:05,370
but there was a ranger from one of the biology stations

1447
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:09,180
who just in the by and by of protecting his area,

1448
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:11,280
met one of these uncontacted tribes

1449
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,590
and befriended someone, not the whole tribe,

1450
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:14,790
but he made some friends

1451
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,940
who would meet him in the woods, not in their community.

1452
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:21,990
And he started to learn their language over a couple years.

1453
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,930
And so he was this kind of important guy

1454
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:27,150
who actually could be the first translator

1455
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:28,950
to talk to these people.

1456
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,890
And one day a couple of them just came out of the woods

1457
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,860
and just plugged him with arrows and just killed him.

1458
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,120
And then they went back in the woods.

1459
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,270
Like, that's the one guy who understands what we're saying,

1460
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,210
we should kill him and move our village.

1461
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:44,940
- So those folks really lean into the,

1462
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:48,330
as you said, the monster versus the puppy.

1463
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,510
- You know, everybody's got it, I think,

1464
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,253
I think, you know,

1465
01:12:54,141 --> 01:12:58,290
we need to listen to our better angels

1466
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:02,670
because if we don't, we as a human species

1467
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,240
can easily devolve into just using violence

1468
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,700
and against others to get what we want.

1469
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,210
It's a daily choice we make not to be savages.

1470
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:14,670
- Which is fascinating thing to remember.

1471
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,290
We kind of think in civilized society,

1472
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:18,180
we've moved past all that.

1473
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:23,180
But it can be summoned like in 1984, the two minutes of hate

1474
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:33,770
with the right words, that primal thing can be summoned

1475
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,490
and directed and lead to a lot of destruction.

1476
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,142
- And, you know,

1477
01:13:40,142 --> 01:13:43,620
our sports are really based on taking those kinds of urges

1478
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,690
and channeling them positive,

1479
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:48,210
where somebody's not dead at the end of it.

1480
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,043
- Yep.

1481
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:54,630
So at which point

1482
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:58,983
did what we now call the Maya civilization arise?

1483
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,730
- That's another complicated one.

1484
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:06,000
Another group living mostly in a jungle

1485
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,330
that we have barely begun to explore.

1486
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:12,570
You know, the truth is, a lot of the questions in the Amazon

1487
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:15,450
and what we're talking about now is the Peten

1488
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,640
and the mountains there.

1489
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,950
Those aren't places archeologists wanna live.

1490
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,720
They're horrible, I mean, I've been there.

1491
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,600
I don't wanna live in a tent and eat rations.

1492
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,070
I wanna live in a nice town.

1493
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,740
So a lot of the places where the answers are,

1494
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:30,787
we still really haven't gotten there

1495
01:14:30,787 --> 01:14:33,690
'cause it takes a special person to be educated enough

1496
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,740
to know what they're looking at

1497
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:37,410
and tough enough to want to be there.

1498
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:39,240
I've done my tour of duty,

1499
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,943
I'm now in a nice little podcast studio.

1500
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,530
But seriously, the Maya, the first hint

1501
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:50,970
that we see people who are culturally Maya very close

1502
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:52,410
to where the time period

1503
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:55,830
for that Chavin culture is about 1800 BCE.

1504
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:59,580
There's a culture that's some called the Mokaya, not Maya,

1505
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:03,210
but they're on the Pacific coast

1506
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:05,850
where Guatemala and Mexico connect.

1507
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:08,250
It's called the Soconusco.

1508
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,720
And those are the first people

1509
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,240
that are really gonna be culturally Maya.

1510
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,060
And they're interacting with the culture

1511
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:19,380
that has traditionally been seen as Mexico's mother culture,

1512
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,150
which is the Olmec.

1513
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,440
They're kind of the same thing

1514
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,030
as we were talking about in South America,

1515
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:28,200
where the Maya, the original Maya are not,

1516
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,280
there's not a whole lot

1517
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,473
to indicate that they have a religion,

1518
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:35,880
but the Olmec have this religion they develop

1519
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,380
and they start exporting it.

1520
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,150
And you see the Maya become more

1521
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:42,810
and more involved in the religion that's being created

1522
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:45,180
by the Olmec who are to the north of them

1523
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:49,260
in the swamps of what we call the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

1524
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,180
- I have a lot of questions

1525
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:54,750
to ask here about just the natural stupid confusion I have.

1526
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:58,990
So first, did the Maya or the Olmec come first

1527
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:04,080
and are they distinct groups?

1528
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,710
Like how do you maintain a distinct civilization

1529
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:09,210
when you're so close together?

1530
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:13,827
- I just finished filming a whole thing on the Olmecs

1531
01:16:13,827 --> 01:16:16,410
and their interaction with the Maya for the great courses.

1532
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:18,753
I'm thrilled for it to come out next spring.

1533
01:16:19,692 --> 01:16:22,110
I think they co-evolved.

1534
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:25,050
Archeology in this regard is the worst enemy of this.

1535
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:28,050
So we put these names on cultures.

1536
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:31,260
We talk about how they evolve from one to another.

1537
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,750
We draw these lines where there aren't any,

1538
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:36,600
we make these time periods that a culture

1539
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,600
magically transforms into somebody with another name,

1540
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,070
where I'm pretty sure they didn't care

1541
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:43,200
about any of those names.

1542
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,370
But the Maya and the Olmec are two parts

1543
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,800
of a larger interaction sphere

1544
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,100
that's happening in Mesoamerica, very dynamic time.

1545
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,030
The Olmec are really bringing the religion part,

1546
01:16:57,030 --> 01:17:00,570
but the other areas are bringing technology,

1547
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:05,100
ceramic technology, making hematite mirrors,

1548
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,725
making tools out of obsidian

1549
01:17:07,725 --> 01:17:11,940
and other stone types.

1550
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,520
So you've got the Olmec in the middle

1551
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:18,660
where Mexico gets skinny and it gets swampy down there.

1552
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,310
That's called the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

1553
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:21,960
That's where the Olmec are.

1554
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,020
Then you've got the Maya to the east of them.

1555
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,880
Then you have the Valley of Oaxaca

1556
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,900
where the people call the Zapotecs, they're rising up.

1557
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,760
And then you have the Valley of Mexico,

1558
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,610
which will eventually become the Aztecs,

1559
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,800
but not for millennia.

1560
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,920
All those areas are interacting with each other.

1561
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,610
- Can we just also draw some more lines?

1562
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:45,450
- Yeah, sure.

1563
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:48,325
- So what is Mesoamerica and what is South America

1564
01:17:48,325 --> 01:17:52,800
and what you just said, the Olmecs and the Maya,

1565
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,140
like, can we just linger on the geography

1566
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:56,910
that we're talking about here in the,

1567
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:58,783
what is this, like a thousand BC?

1568
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:02,100
- Yeah, the time period we're talking about

1569
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,930
where the Olmec are there,

1570
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,140
a thousand BC is a great midpoint of it.

1571
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,960
I'd say it starts about 1800 BCE.

1572
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,960
And by 500 BCE the Olmec are gone.

1573
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:19,080
And a whole new wave of civilization

1574
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,300
and population increase happen.

1575
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,950
In terms of Mesoamerica,

1576
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:25,980
looking at your map here, I'd say about halfway

1577
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,980
through the Chihuahua desert up there in the top left.

1578
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:35,413
That's about the boundary of Mesoamerica.

1579
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:39,600
There's this big desert where almost nobody lives.

1580
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,010
And once you get north enough,

1581
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:44,190
you get into the ancestral pueblo people

1582
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:47,310
of what's now America, the Four Corners area.

1583
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:50,880
They're not Mesoamerican, they have different lives.

1584
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,160
- Where does modern Mexico end?

1585
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,167
- Modern Mexico ends, right,

1586
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:56,250
you know, you see the name Maya

1587
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,480
there with the white line around it.

1588
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,600
That's Guatemala, so Guatemala cuts off most

1589
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,520
of Mexico from Central America.

1590
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,016
- Got it.

1591
01:19:04,016 --> 01:19:05,370
- But Mesoamerica only goes about halfway

1592
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:07,200
through Honduras.

1593
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,783
And then it's really kind of a no man's land.

1594
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,880
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama.

1595
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,150
They really, they're neither,

1596
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:21,390
they're not Mesoamerica, they're not South America.

1597
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:22,590
They're more South America

1598
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:24,340
'cause they've got some gold there.

1599
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:27,540
But then basically you get on the other side of Panama

1600
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:30,690
and you're fully in South America

1601
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:32,250
with two distinct groups too.

1602
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:36,690
You've got the guys that are on the Andes on the West Coast,

1603
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:38,140
and then you have the Amazon.

1604
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,010
- So the West of the Andes

1605
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,570
and the Amazon are very distinct.

1606
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:46,440
So when you refer to the Andean region,

1607
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,570
is that referring to the Andes and the Amazon

1608
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:49,740
or just the Andes?

1609
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:54,740
- Just the Andes and the coast to the Pacific there.

1610
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:58,410
That's Andean civilization.

1611
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:02,940
- So did the Maya make it to the Andes, the Andean region?

1612
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,010
- Not that archeology can prove,

1613
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:07,170
but it's almost certain

1614
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,640
that they interacted with each other.

1615
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,970
Number one, it's just, you know, it's biased to think

1616
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:14,190
that these people couldn't travel as widely

1617
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:17,220
as people on the other side of the planet did.

1618
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,600
But there's all sorts of hints.

1619
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,060
Like that first ceramics I was talking about

1620
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:24,783
that the Maya made, they show up strangely,

1621
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:29,190
sophisticated technologically already

1622
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:31,350
and down in Ecuador,

1623
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:33,480
they had them for a thousand years before.

1624
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:38,480
So a lot of people, myself included, think that the idea

1625
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:41,703
of ceramics actually came from South America to the Maya.

1626
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:47,600
- Did the Maya get seeded by the second wave

1627
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,830
across the Bering Strait

1628
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:53,760
or did that initial wave of people that came

1629
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,910
and populated South America,

1630
01:20:56,910 --> 01:21:00,360
were they the ancestors of the Maya?

1631
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,520
Like how did the migration happen here?

1632
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,353
Do we understand that?

1633
01:21:03,353 --> 01:21:04,830
- We're still piecing it together.

1634
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:07,560
I don't think, you know, I'd be lying if I told you I had

1635
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,183
the answers, but we do have evidence of Maya stature people,

1636
01:21:12,183 --> 01:21:14,880
they are small people, generally speaking,

1637
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,250
people that grow up in the forest are smaller

1638
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,920
and people that grow up in the open plains are taller.

1639
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,170
Probably about, you know, just generations of people

1640
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:25,513
that hit their head on a branch or not. (laughs)

1641
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:28,463
- Joking, but, you know, there could be something to that.

1642
01:21:28,463 --> 01:21:29,940
- I think there's some truth to it,

1643
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,033
I mean, the Pygmies are small

1644
01:21:32,033 --> 01:21:35,185
and the people on the plains in Africa are big.

1645
01:21:35,185 --> 01:21:38,135
The North American Indians are tall and the Maya are small.

1646
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:42,300
There's definitely a pattern of smaller people

1647
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,443
in the forests.

1648
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:47,400
But anyway, there's a cave

1649
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,920
in the Yucatan called Loltun Cave

1650
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,340
that has hand prints in the cave.

1651
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:54,990
It's somebody who put their hand on the cave

1652
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:56,910
and spit charcoal around their hand,

1653
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:58,620
like a negative print.

1654
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,300
We can date that charcoal.

1655
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,870
And it comes from 10,000 years ago.

1656
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:06,780
And the hands are all small.

1657
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:09,810
It's, you know, typical Old Mexico.

1658
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:13,020
I walked right up to these things and could put my hand.

1659
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,250
I didn't, you know, mess with them,

1660
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,740
but I put my hand next to these hands

1661
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:19,380
and they're all smaller than my, you know,

1662
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,270
Northern European hand.

1663
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:24,030
And so either it was a bunch of kids

1664
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,950
who were in this cave 10,000 years ago,

1665
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:29,403
or it was people of Maya stature who did it.

1666
01:22:31,982 --> 01:22:33,900
- It's so cool that you can date the charcoal.

1667
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,850
And it's so cool that 10,000 years ago

1668
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:37,320
there were people living.

1669
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:40,170
- And actually we have one that's,

1670
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:42,630
I think 2000 years older now,

1671
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:45,900
just a couple years ago, again in Yucatan, in a cave.

1672
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,960
They found a woman they named Naia now,

1673
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,710
and she's like 12,000 years old.

1674
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:56,520
- So the best guess maybe that you have

1675
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,440
is it goes across the Bering Strait to South America,

1676
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,720
possibly the Amazon, develop a lot

1677
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,800
of cool ideas in the Amazon

1678
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,920
and start drifting back up into Mesoamerica.

1679
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,900
- Was kind of a co-evolution.

1680
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:13,170
The technology of ceramics,

1681
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:15,768
I think got there through an interaction with it.

1682
01:23:15,768 --> 01:23:17,605
- See, the interesting thing is

1683
01:23:17,605 --> 01:23:19,650
that the Maya didn't really have religion,

1684
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:22,500
didn't have as a vibrant religious set of ideas,

1685
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,170
and they borrowed it from the Olmec.

1686
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:27,660
- I've been doing a deep dive on this

1687
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,427
for this Olmec course that I just did.

1688
01:23:29,427 --> 01:23:34,427
And it really does seem like these other cultures

1689
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:38,430
that have jade and hematite and obsidian,

1690
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,230
the Olmec had none of that stuff.

1691
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:44,730
They were living in a swamp and building things out of dirt,

1692
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:48,990
but they were importing those materials from those areas,

1693
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:53,160
carving them into all sorts of religious iconography

1694
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,800
and then exporting them back to them.

1695
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,477
- And still the fanged deity show up there?

1696
01:23:57,477 --> 01:24:01,860
- No, the fanged deity's nowhere in Central America

1697
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,225
and Mesoamerica.

1698
01:24:03,225 --> 01:24:06,570
There's jaguars, there's jaguar iconography,

1699
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:08,490
but it's not the same thing.

1700
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:12,720
This whole Jaguar transformer deity does not exist there.

1701
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,373
They do have a pantheon.

1702
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:17,337
- So the Maya, the Olmec

1703
01:24:17,337 --> 01:24:19,350
and the interesting peoples of the regions.

1704
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:22,740
What was their, I'd love

1705
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,360
to ask questions about who were they?

1706
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,220
So one question I'm curious about,

1707
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:29,430
what was their sense when they looked up at the stars?

1708
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:31,430
What was their conception of the cosmos?

1709
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,650
- That's a question I've spent

1710
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:37,410
my entire career trying to answer.

1711
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:41,160
I think that they saw it as proof

1712
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:45,210
of the cyclical nature of life.

1713
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,040
And certainly they saw,

1714
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,160
like every ancient group did, like, are those the gods?

1715
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,860
Why are those things so far away?

1716
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:56,310
But I think that the Maya especially looked at it

1717
01:24:56,310 --> 01:25:00,300
with a much more mathematical mind than most did.

1718
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,710
And so they watched these things move every night.

1719
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:07,140
And if you do that, even today,

1720
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:12,140
you notice that all the stars move in tandem.

1721
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,793
They're just this blanket, they're like,

1722
01:25:13,793 --> 01:25:16,320
they're like this curtain behind me.

1723
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,330
They're the stage upon which

1724
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,970
some very important players are dancing,

1725
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:24,720
and that's the moon, the sun, and the planets.

1726
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,000
There's five planets we can see visibly.

1727
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,890
So they started watching like, why are just those seven

1728
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:34,110
moving differently than the rest?

1729
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:37,110
And those are the things that they keyed on mathematically.

1730
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:38,970
The sun, of course was also involved

1731
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:41,382
in the agricultural cycle.

1732
01:25:41,382 --> 01:25:42,900
So that was important in and of itself.

1733
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:47,663
But the planets, we can see them coming up with ideas,

1734
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:50,310
definitely doing the math

1735
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:53,553
and seeing that there is a repeated cycle.

1736
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:56,820
And then coming up with mythology around them,

1737
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:00,513
like Venus for them was associated with war.

1738
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:04,950
And they had very ritualized times to go to war.

1739
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:07,440
That had something to do with Venus.

1740
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,650
Sometimes in the classic period Maya,

1741
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:13,830
it was the first appearance of Venus as the morning star.

1742
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:15,300
That was a good time to go

1743
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,520
to battle with your neighbors.

1744
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,010
And when it became the post-classic

1745
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:24,510
with like Chichen Itza being the capital of the Yucatan,

1746
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:27,630
then it looks like if you watch Venus day after day,

1747
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:30,660
it goes slowly up every day.

1748
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:33,360
And then when it hits its highest point

1749
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,360
as morningstar in the morning,

1750
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,540
it goes down to the Earth like three times as fast.

1751
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:42,570
All of a sudden it just shoots down and hits the Earth.

1752
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:47,340
And so the people of post-classic Maya civilization

1753
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:52,340
saw that as the gods shooting a spear into the Earth.

1754
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:55,110
And that was a good time to attack your neighbors.

1755
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:58,890
That was like wartime when the spear is gonna hit the Earth.

1756
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:01,800
- Right, so this is fascinating.

1757
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,580
They just had at the foundation a sense

1758
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:09,543
that life existence at the various timescales is cyclical.

1759
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:12,180
That's the starting point.

1760
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,770
And then you just look out there

1761
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:16,260
and if you are extremely precise, which is fascinating,

1762
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:21,260
how precise they were, you can just measure the cycles.

1763
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:24,030
- Yeah, and they did it really well.

1764
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:26,850
Now of course, they are the only ones

1765
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:30,390
to develop a fully elaborated writing system

1766
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:32,310
in all of the Americas.

1767
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:34,050
The South America had the Quipu,

1768
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:35,640
but it's so different than our writing.

1769
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,590
We're still trying to figure out what the heck it is.

1770
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:39,570
We know there's math there too,

1771
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:42,960
but they had the ability to take a lifetime worth

1772
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,290
of measurements and hand it to the next generation

1773
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:48,360
who would then do it more and do it more.

1774
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,010
That's how they figured out

1775
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:53,040
kind of the holy grail of ancient astronomy.

1776
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,810
How good were they

1777
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:58,410
was whether they could see the procession of the equinoxes,

1778
01:27:58,410 --> 01:28:00,690
the fact that we're just barely wobbling.

1779
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:04,380
And there's a 26,000 year period where the stars

1780
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:08,100
as that backdrop will spin all the way around and come back.

1781
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,650
It's 26,000 years.

1782
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:12,600
But the Maya were able to figure out, wait,

1783
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:16,590
it's moving one degree every 72 years,

1784
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:18,910
and did a calculation based on

1785
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,980
where it should be in the ancient past.

1786
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:25,500
And they're using constellations.

1787
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,293
They're showing us they know by saying like,

1788
01:28:29,490 --> 01:28:32,520
this planet's in this constellation right now

1789
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:36,540
and 33,000 years ago it would be

1790
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,953
in this constellation.

1791
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,980
- It's just fascinating

1792
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:43,260
that they were able to figure this out.

1793
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:46,320
I would love to sort of understand the details

1794
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,820
of the scientific community, if you can call it that.

1795
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:52,260
- I think we absolutely could.

1796
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:56,100
And that's actually one of the things that I'm hoping

1797
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:00,090
to move the needle on in my generation with my career,

1798
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:04,800
is to give these cultures the respect they deserve

1799
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,780
as standing toe to toe with the rest

1800
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:09,870
of our ancient civilizations we respect,

1801
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:13,260
there are things that should be called science

1802
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,870
that are not being called science at the moment.

1803
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,880
You know, their math is incredible.

1804
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,850
Their hydraulic engineering is incredible.

1805
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:23,310
Their chemistry is incredible.

1806
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:28,080
And so I hope to talk about these things differently

1807
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,030
as a way to get people

1808
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:33,150
to recognize the achievements in a different way.

1809
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:36,360
- Yeah, I mean, unquestionably incredible scientific work

1810
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,320
in the astronomy sense, especially here.

1811
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,830
Can you speak to all the sophisticated aspects

1812
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:47,520
of the Mayan calendar that they've developed?

1813
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,590
- I don't know, you got another five hours.

1814
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:50,440
- [Lex] Let's go.

1815
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:52,223
- No, I'm kidding.

1816
01:29:52,223 --> 01:29:54,190
- I should say that you also gave me

1817
01:29:57,123 --> 01:29:58,710
the 2024 Mayan calendar.

1818
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:01,110
- Yeah, I do this just to, you know, show the world

1819
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:03,900
that that calendar system is evergreen.

1820
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,240
It can go into the future

1821
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,960
or the past for billions of years in the system they made,

1822
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,910
just like our system is.

1823
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:13,800
- So can you speak to the three components here

1824
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:18,300
as I'm reading that Tzolk'in, the Haab and the Long Count.

1825
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,940
What are these fascinating components of the calendar?

1826
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,340
- It's neat how obsessed,

1827
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,530
they were really math nerds.

1828
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:27,180
It wasn't good enough for them

1829
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:30,300
to just make one cycle to describe time.

1830
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,800
They had all these cycles

1831
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,470
that interlocked into each other.

1832
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,540
Like cogs in a machine,

1833
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,820
though they never thought of it like that.

1834
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:42,870
But the Tzolk'in's their oldest one

1835
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:46,080
and the one that still endures today, there are millions

1836
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,300
of Maya people that are living their lives

1837
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,000
based on a 260 day count.

1838
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,070
No weeks, no months.

1839
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:57,550
It's just 13 numbers combined with 20 day names

1840
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:59,880
for a total of 260 days.

1841
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,740
And then it goes again.

1842
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,390
Everybody in the highlands knows

1843
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:05,460
what their birthday is in that calendar,

1844
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,280
knows what it means about their personality

1845
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:11,460
and the kind of jobs that they're supposed to do.

1846
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:14,340
Each one of those days has their own spirit.

1847
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,380
And what's supposed to happen in those days,

1848
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,740
the Maya collectively call them the mom,

1849
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,890
the grandmother, grandfather spirits.

1850
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:25,470
And they talk to each one

1851
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:27,780
of those days and they pray to them.

1852
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:32,010
There's now an association of some 8,000 people

1853
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:35,280
that are called Aki that are day keepers

1854
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,230
who are keeping the days.

1855
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:42,230
And they're also like community psychologists almost.

1856
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,450
People come to them and say, you know, my life is mixed up.

1857
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:46,283
What's wrong here?

1858
01:31:46,283 --> 01:31:48,870
Well, let's ask the mom, like, okay,

1859
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:51,000
well it looks like you're not doing this or that.

1860
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,800
Or you know what, you're an accountant.

1861
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,240
You're not supposed to be an accountant.

1862
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,640
You're supposed to be a, you know, a midwife.

1863
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,033
What are you doing?

1864
01:31:58,033 --> 01:31:59,100
You're living your life wrong.

1865
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,330
You're a kib.

1866
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:02,746
You need to start being a kib person.

1867
01:32:02,746 --> 01:32:03,960
- So they take extremely seriously

1868
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,280
the day on which you're born.

1869
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,820
What that means, like the spirit that embodies that day.

1870
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:12,210
- Right, like I'm kib, I'm 13 kib

1871
01:32:12,210 --> 01:32:15,120
and it says my, it's funny how accurate a lot of them are.

1872
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,623
Mine is basically is,

1873
01:32:18,341 --> 01:32:22,560
I'm an irresponsible husband and parent,

1874
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,830
but people like me, so my family still prospers.

1875
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:29,580
Like, well God, that's horribly accurate.

1876
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:32,070
- I mean some of it is also the chicken or the egg

1877
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:34,590
if you truly believe,

1878
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:36,210
so, if you structure society

1879
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:38,250
where this calendar is truly sacred,

1880
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:42,232
then it kind of like you manifest a lot,

1881
01:32:42,232 --> 01:32:45,480
the spirit does manifest itself in the life of the people

1882
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:48,120
that is born on that spirit's day.

1883
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,624
- Absolutely. - It's interesting.

1884
01:32:50,624 --> 01:32:52,260
- And the Maya really feel this in this system.

1885
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:53,430
So that's the core system.

1886
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:57,480
This 260 day calendar was the very first calendar

1887
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,550
they made thousands of years ago.

1888
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:02,190
And it's the one that's most important today.

1889
01:33:02,190 --> 01:33:04,650
- Why 260 days, by the way?

1890
01:33:04,650 --> 01:33:06,200
Is there a reasoning behind it?

1891
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,990
- Most Maya agree with this today

1892
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:11,700
and you know, who knows

1893
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,590
what the original architects thousands

1894
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:14,790
of years ago were thinking.

1895
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:18,390
But it's nine months.

1896
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:20,880
It's the human gestation period.

1897
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,540
So if you conceived on the day 13 monkey,

1898
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:28,173
chances are your kids coming out on or near 13 monkey.

1899
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,020
And I think it's beautiful.

1900
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:34,890
I mean, if that's right, that means the Maya

1901
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:38,073
and the people of Mesoamerica will all share it together.

1902
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,090
When they thought about we need a count

1903
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:45,000
of time, that's for us.

1904
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,440
They didn't look up into the heavens,

1905
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:48,030
they looked like into their bodies.

1906
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:52,710
What's the first cycle that we actually go through as humans

1907
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:54,990
and they pick this nine month thing.

1908
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:57,210
It really is our cycle.

1909
01:33:57,210 --> 01:34:01,680
And no other culture on the planet looked inside themselves

1910
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:03,513
to create their calendar like that.

1911
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,510
- So that's the oldest one

1912
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:09,780
and the sacred one that still carries through to today.

1913
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:11,340
What's the second one, the Haab?

1914
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:14,850
- The Haab is the solar calendar, the one that everybody

1915
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:17,310
on the planet eventually comes up with.

1916
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:18,630
We know it's second though

1917
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:20,820
because when they start talking about it,

1918
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:25,620
they use all the symbols and the numbers from the 260 one.

1919
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:27,360
They say, well we need a solar one too.

1920
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,300
Let's just keep counting this another 105 days

1921
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,313
and we'll get to 365.

1922
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:35,969
- Oh, interesting, they kind of carry the same.

1923
01:34:35,969 --> 01:34:37,650
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

1924
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:41,310
And that's useful because for all the sort of agricultural,

1925
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:42,420
all this kind of reasons.

1926
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:44,130
- Right, though interestingly,

1927
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:46,497
they never put a leap year in,

1928
01:34:46,497 --> 01:34:48,900
the Haab is also called the vague year

1929
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:53,250
'cause it's just 365, which means

1930
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:56,790
every year they're off a quarter of a day

1931
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:59,760
and eventually it starts really adding up.

1932
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,610
In fact, it's even caused modern problems.

1933
01:35:02,610 --> 01:35:04,140
In this calendar here,

1934
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:09,060
I just do the straight math from a thousand years ago.

1935
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:13,910
And so I place the beginning of the solar year differently

1936
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:17,640
than some Maya groups do, especially the guys

1937
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,130
in the highlands of Eastern Guatemala.

1938
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,780
They write me nasty emails saying,

1939
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:23,850
I don't know what time the year is,

1940
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:27,120
but their relatives changed it in the 1950s

1941
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:30,210
because their agricultural cycle was so far off.

1942
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:35,210
They moved it 60 days back to make it in the spring again.

1943
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:38,520
But it drifts, which is strange

1944
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,110
'cause it's not a very good thing

1945
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:42,690
for the agricultural cycle.

1946
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:43,770
It's one of these mysteries

1947
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:46,410
we still don't have an explanation for.

1948
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:49,110
- So that's the Haab, and then what's the Long Count?

1949
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,930
- The Long Count's the really mysterious cool one

1950
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:54,690
because it's a linear count of days,

1951
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:56,460
which are not like them.

1952
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:58,770
It's a bunch of cycles like ours, you know,

1953
01:35:58,770 --> 01:36:01,203
our weeks are a cycle, our months are a cycle.

1954
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:07,620
But it's weird in that its estimation of the year

1955
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:11,670
in the long count system is only 360 days.

1956
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:16,670
So it's miserably off a solar year.

1957
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:19,830
They count in base 20.

1958
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:22,950
So they count, like we count in tens we're decimal,

1959
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:25,890
they count in base 20, vigesimal.

1960
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:29,310
And so it should be, you know, there's ones,

1961
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:31,530
there's twenties, there's four hundreds,

1962
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:34,380
there's eight thousands, there's 160 thousands.

1963
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:37,770
It's up, it goes just like our tens,

1964
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:39,930
hundreds, thousands, 10 thousands.

1965
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:41,643
But it's times 20.

1966
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:47,690
So that third, so they have days, months of 20 days.

1967
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:50,670
And then they have these years that are,

1968
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:54,780
should be by their math 400, but it's only 360.

1969
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:56,010
And that throws the whole thing

1970
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57,540
outta whack going further up.

1971
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:59,170
Then they have a 20 year period

1972
01:37:00,072 --> 01:37:03,900
and a 400 year period, 400 years to their calendar.

1973
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:07,710
But it's only by that time it's only 396 years

1974
01:37:07,710 --> 01:37:09,633
in our period, in our reckoning.

1975
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:14,622
So it's mysterious that it's, why did they tweak it

1976
01:37:14,622 --> 01:37:18,000
at the year to be only 360 days?

1977
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,034
That's, you know, that doesn't follow any astronomy.

1978
01:37:21,034 --> 01:37:23,610
That's not the human cycle.

1979
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:25,410
- Yeah, but they're, I mean, it's interesting

1980
01:37:25,410 --> 01:37:27,900
that they build up towards thinking

1981
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,760
about very long periods of time.

1982
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,170
Like baktun is 144,000 days.

1983
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:39,170
- Right, or a baktun is 400 of the long counts years.

1984
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:43,260
So it's kind of like our millennium, you know,

1985
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:46,080
we think it's a big deal when we hit a millennium

1986
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,753
or a century.

1987
01:37:49,689 --> 01:37:52,320
They have a 20 year period that they do a lot

1988
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,630
of celebrations on called a katun.

1989
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:58,680
And then they have the 400 baktun, which is the big one

1990
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,060
that's like their millennium.

1991
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:05,060
And 13 of those baktuns occurred in the creation before us.

1992
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:09,540
They also think that we are in,

1993
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:11,760
that the world has had multiple creations.

1994
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:12,720
They're not alone in that.

1995
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,060
There's lots of ancient civilizations who say that,

1996
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,810
but we're technically in the fourth creation.

1997
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:23,810
And they have a creation story called the Popol Vuh.

1998
01:38:23,878 --> 01:38:26,370
And the Popol Vuh is clear as day

1999
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:30,630
that the third creation ends with the help

2000
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:33,990
of these heroes called the hero twins.

2001
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,910
And the fourth creation begins.

2002
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,190
And so on the Maya monuments,

2003
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:40,680
we see them doing the math through the long count

2004
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,230
and we can calculate it back very exactly.

2005
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:44,580
It happened.

2006
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:48,967
The fourth creation started on August 11th, 3114 BC

2007
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,290
and it says, it doesn't say it's day one,

2008
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:59,850
it says it's the last day of the 13th baktun

2009
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:04,417
of the third creation, which leads us

2010
01:39:04,417 --> 01:39:08,340
to believe that a creation is only 13 baktuns long.

2011
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,260
- Right, so, and this would be

2012
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,820
the fourth creation, the calendar.

2013
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,040
- The fourth creation.

2014
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:19,040
But if you do the math going from 3,114 BC

2015
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:24,140
and count 13 baktuns forward, you get to 2012.

2016
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:30,230
- And hence the very popular notion that 2012,

2017
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,580
whenever that was December, something like that.

2018
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:34,020
- December 21st, 2012.

2019
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,450
- Will be the end of the world.

2020
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:38,490
So can you explain this about?

2021
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:40,320
- Those were very fruitful years for me.

2022
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,410
I had so many lectures around the country that was,

2023
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:47,565
it's like Garrett Morrison Saturday Night Live.

2024
01:39:47,565 --> 01:39:51,153
The apocalypse was very, very good to me.

2025
01:39:53,314 --> 01:39:54,990
- I mean, but that is pretty interesting.

2026
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:59,990
So technically it would be in the what, in the fifth now?

2027
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,520
- Yeah, technically we'd be in the fifth.

2028
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:06,360
Though, my argument was that actually, if you look

2029
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:09,060
through all the corpus of Maya mathematics

2030
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:12,360
and calendars, they never say anything like that.

2031
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:17,360
In fact, there's a handful of dates that tell us

2032
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:20,880
that the fourth creation does continue farther on.

2033
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:25,880
That that baktun place should have 20 baktuns in it.

2034
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:32,703
Like their counting system would dictate, not 13.

2035
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:36,750
And there's a place in Palenque,

2036
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:39,510
there's a place in the Dresden Codex

2037
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:41,010
and one other place I'm forgetting

2038
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:45,963
that all talk about time after 2012.

2039
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,590
So how does that happen, it's a conflict.

2040
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:54,270
- Is there supposed to be an overlap of the 13?

2041
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:57,780
So it's like 13 is the core of it, and it's 20 long.

2042
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:00,630
- They love the number 13, it's all over the place.

2043
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:02,820
It's a magic number to them.

2044
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:07,820
My explanation, which I admit is not very solid.

2045
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:13,010
But I think that the magical deeds

2046
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:16,800
of the hero twins in their creation story at the end

2047
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:21,800
of the third creation hit the magical reset button.

2048
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,880
And that it just restarted time right there

2049
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,590
because of their magic.

2050
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:30,090
But that was not to say

2051
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:34,743
that the natural baktun cycle should be 13.

2052
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:37,200
And there are certain texts

2053
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:42,200
that go way forward in time or way backward in time.

2054
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:44,910
And whenever they wanna do that,

2055
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:47,910
there are higher increments than just the baktun.

2056
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:49,710
Above that, there's the piktun,

2057
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:53,400
then there's the kalabatun, then there's alawatun

2058
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:54,450
and it goes on and on.

2059
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:58,440
And these are like, you know, 160,000 years,

2060
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:01,470
huge increments of time, whenever they wanna do that,

2061
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:03,720
and they talk about a long period of time,

2062
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:07,080
they start putting thirteens in all of those increments,

2063
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,730
those higher increments.

2064
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:11,310
And I think what they're saying is

2065
01:42:11,310 --> 01:42:13,050
they're making an esoteric statement

2066
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:16,770
about the never ending nature of time.

2067
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:18,915
That's what I think they're telling us

2068
01:42:18,915 --> 01:42:23,915
in those texts that time goes on forever, magically.

2069
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:26,220
- But they still had a conception

2070
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:28,953
that it didn't go on forever before.

2071
01:42:30,006 --> 01:42:32,550
That there was other civilizations that came

2072
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:35,248
before and this is the fourth creation.

2073
01:42:35,248 --> 01:42:36,210
- This is the fourth creation.

2074
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:38,220
And the gods made everybody,

2075
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:40,710
the first ones were made of mud and they melted.

2076
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:43,650
The second ones were made of sticks,

2077
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:45,513
but they were jerks to the animals.

2078
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:49,680
The third ones were like us,

2079
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:54,120
but flawed in some other way.

2080
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:58,500
And then we are finally made of the blood

2081
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:01,470
of the gods and corn, we're made out of corn.

2082
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:03,750
So we're perfect.

2083
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:08,700
And as it explains to us, the Popol Vuh does,

2084
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:10,601
we got it right this time.

2085
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,920
There's no reason to believe

2086
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,313
that this creation has a set duration.

2087
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:21,120
One of the weird things is that the Aztecs,

2088
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:23,823
who we talked to a lot at contact,

2089
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:28,890
they also had the concept of multiple creations before us.

2090
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:31,530
But they were real clear to the Spanish

2091
01:43:31,530 --> 01:43:35,220
that they weren't all the same time element.

2092
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:38,430
Some of them were in the three hundreds of years.

2093
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:41,250
Some of them were in the seven hundreds of years,

2094
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:43,350
but they were not the same time period.

2095
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:47,400
So our mathematical logic

2096
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,440
that if the third creation was 13,

2097
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:54,180
this one must be third creation or also be 13.

2098
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:55,530
It's in direct opposition

2099
01:43:55,530 --> 01:43:59,100
to what the Aztecs told us about the nature of creations.

2100
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,050
They're different time periods.

2101
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:03,150
- Why do you think there was the myth

2102
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:04,530
of the previous creations?

2103
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:05,460
Did they have some kind

2104
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:10,460
of long multi-generational memory of prior civilizations?

2105
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:17,253
- It may have had some echo in the flood myths.

2106
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:19,073
- It's the same kind

2107
01:44:19,073 --> 01:44:23,400
of major myths carried through long periods of time.

2108
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,620
- There's a lot of different opinions about it.

2109
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:29,190
And you know, like if they were all 13,

2110
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:31,980
if we have five creations, like the Aztec said,

2111
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:34,590
and they were all 13, they would come up

2112
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:38,160
to roughly 25,000 something years,

2113
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,650
which is very close to that processional cycle.

2114
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:43,140
So some people are like, they designed it all

2115
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:48,140
to be one completion of the procession of the equinoxes.

2116
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:49,353
- And I mean that.

2117
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:51,570
- I don't believe that one,

2118
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:53,640
but that one sure sounds good, doesn't it?

2119
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,640
That's gonna get a lot of internet hits.

2120
01:44:57,330 --> 01:45:00,430
- And one of the things I do obviously wonder

2121
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:06,560
about is why the flood myth is part of

2122
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:10,620
like most societies and most religions?

2123
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:12,300
- I think that one's pretty easy.

2124
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:15,873
It's the end of the ice age when the bathtub filled back up.

2125
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:20,599
- So it's just the ice age bathtub refill.

2126
01:45:20,599 --> 01:45:22,323
- It's the seas filling back up.

2127
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:27,120
- And without really understanding what happened,

2128
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,970
they just carried that story?

2129
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:31,020
- Everybody knows

2130
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:35,220
that everybody's nice coastal village went underwater.

2131
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:38,070
And they had to seek higher ground.

2132
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:40,200
- And then just like people like talking about the weather,

2133
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:43,530
everybody was talking about the weather for many generations

2134
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:44,850
as the sea level was going up.

2135
01:45:44,850 --> 01:45:47,760
And then that myth carried?

2136
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,170
- Why do we live here, grandpa?

2137
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:52,413
Well, we used to live over there, but then the water came.

2138
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:55,800
- And then many grandpas later is

2139
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,590
just kind of permeates every idea.

2140
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:01,560
- It becomes mythology, but global mythology.

2141
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,030
So that one, you know, there's a lot

2142
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:05,160
of things I don't have a reasonable explanation for,

2143
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:09,720
but the flood myth is almost certainly

2144
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,493
the rise in sea level.

2145
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:16,083
- So this idea that every day represents,

2146
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:19,320
that carries a spirit.

2147
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:22,740
You know, there's modern day astrology, you know,

2148
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:25,750
most people kind of consider astrology this

2149
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,640
maybe a bit unscientific woowoo type

2150
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:32,430
of set of beliefs.

2151
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:35,410
But do you think there's some wisdom that astrology carries

2152
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:39,720
from your scholarship of the Maya calendar?

2153
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:41,670
Do you think if we carry that

2154
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:45,360
to the astrological perspective on the world,

2155
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,310
do you think there's some wisdom there?

2156
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,370
- I don't know, you know,

2157
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:52,920
I have a woowoo part of me.

2158
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,500
I would like to believe that stuff,

2159
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:58,530
but I don't think as a scientist it makes,

2160
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:03,480
I cannot come up with a biological

2161
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:06,753
scientific reason why that would be true.

2162
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:09,870
And you know, when you look at it objectively,

2163
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:14,870
I mean really is everybody born with the sign Scorpio,

2164
01:47:17,453 --> 01:47:19,757
a moody person?

2165
01:47:19,757 --> 01:47:22,683
That's just objectively not true.

2166
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:29,390
But it is funny how oftentimes these Maya horoscopes,

2167
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:32,070
for lack of a better word, do hit the mark.

2168
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:36,120
There was some student who surveyed like 300 people

2169
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:39,960
with the app I made and asked them about their Greek sign

2170
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:41,040
and their Maya sign

2171
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:44,220
and his conclusion for his term paper was

2172
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:47,190
that the Maya one was working way better.

2173
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:48,720
Which that's fascinating.

2174
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,880
At least that's fun.

2175
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,430
But no, I think I'm too much of a scientist

2176
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:55,798
to believe that, I just don't have

2177
01:47:55,798 --> 01:47:59,970
any foundation in science that would allow us to believe

2178
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:04,830
that the month in which we were born

2179
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:09,270
in a cycle sets our personality and destiny.

2180
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:12,960
- I agree, and yet there's so much mystery

2181
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,980
all around us that what I do like is

2182
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,893
the inbuilt humility to that worldview.

2183
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:25,020
That there's this whole, you can call it a spiritual world,

2184
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:28,290
but a world that we don't quite understand.

2185
01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:32,370
And then you can wander about what is the wisdom

2186
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:34,290
that that world carries.

2187
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:36,090
And then you can construct all kinds of systems

2188
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:37,410
to try to interpret that.

2189
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:42,120
And then there is where the human hubris can come in

2190
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:43,920
and, you know, but it's good

2191
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,380
to be humbled by how little we know, I suppose.

2192
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:48,450
- I do love the mysteries of the world

2193
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:52,110
and I would love to find an ancient civilization,

2194
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:56,190
but I don't want to solve the mysteries of the world.

2195
01:48:56,190 --> 01:48:57,660
I think they're one of the things

2196
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:00,390
that make life worth living.

2197
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:01,893
- That's true, that's true.

2198
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:06,360
You mentioned the Maya writing system.

2199
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:09,660
What are some interesting aspects of their language

2200
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:12,330
that they've used and the written language that they used?

2201
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:14,850
- Well, you know, one of the things that confound me

2202
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:17,760
as a guy who spent, you know, better portion

2203
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:21,660
of my life studying it, I had the honor of being the student

2204
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:23,760
of Linda Schele right here

2205
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,370
at the University of Texas at Austin.

2206
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:29,220
She got the group together who broke the Maya code

2207
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:31,676
of hieroglyphics in the 1970s.

2208
01:49:31,676 --> 01:49:33,510
So I learned from the best.

2209
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:36,840
And loved every minute of it, I miss Linda.

2210
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,280
- Can you speak to that code actually,

2211
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,920
the hieroglyphic code and what it takes to break it?

2212
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:43,140
- Oh boy, I mean, what a thing.

2213
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:46,830
We had kind of a Rosetta Stone.

2214
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:51,000
We had a page out of Diego de Landa's book,

2215
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,470
a priest who was converting the Maya in Yucatan asked

2216
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:59,280
his informants about their writing system

2217
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,590
and what every sound meant.

2218
01:50:01,590 --> 01:50:05,100
And he was convinced they had a alphabet like we do.

2219
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:08,250
So he got this Maya guy sat down in Spanish

2220
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:09,570
and he said, okay,

2221
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:11,880
you're gonna write all the symbols right here in my book.

2222
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:16,320
Write an A here, write a B here, write a C here.

2223
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:20,130
And that guy just wrote all of the sounds

2224
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:22,500
that the priest told him to write.

2225
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,090
They were actually syllables,

2226
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:27,780
they were vowel consonant combinations.

2227
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:29,490
They weren't an alphabet.

2228
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:34,110
But that turned into our Rosetta stone of sorts.

2229
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:36,900
The big key is that the Maya still speak that same language.

2230
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:38,670
There are millions of Maya people

2231
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:43,670
who are speaking a version of Maya.

2232
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:46,290
Now, there's where I get confused

2233
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:51,290
that we've got a single writing system that is intelligible.

2234
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:52,740
We've broken the code.

2235
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:55,500
So we know that it's basically the same writing system

2236
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:59,673
from the top of the Yucatan into Guatemala and El Salvador.

2237
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:04,950
But we have 33 Mayan languages today

2238
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:07,710
that are mutually unintelligible.

2239
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:10,410
And we backwards project the language

2240
01:51:10,410 --> 01:51:12,210
of what they spoke back then.

2241
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:15,240
That the glyphs are in to something called Cholti

2242
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:17,580
which is a combination of Chorti and Chol,

2243
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:18,993
two of those languages.

2244
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:21,780
But it doesn't work for me at all.

2245
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:26,780
How did, if there was one language, maybe two back then,

2246
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:31,190
how did it flower into 33 mutually unintelligible languages

2247
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:35,047
in just 500 years during acculturation

2248
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:40,260
and horrible infectious diseases

2249
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:43,020
that killed 90% of the population?

2250
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:43,860
How did that happen?

2251
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:45,690
So we're missing something huge here.

2252
01:51:45,690 --> 01:51:49,563
I think it's more like Chinese, where Chinese letters,

2253
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:55,200
writing can be read in multiple languages

2254
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,910
and still understood.

2255
01:51:56,910 --> 01:52:00,060
I don't know exactly the mechanics of how that would happen,

2256
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:04,170
but it just seems impossible that there are more languages,

2257
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:06,510
not less languages in the Maya area

2258
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:10,380
after the last 500 years that they've been through.

2259
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:12,150
- So you think that there's some kind of process

2260
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:14,280
of either rapidly generating dialects

2261
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:17,580
or there always has been these dialects,

2262
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:21,090
or I should say they're distinct languages,

2263
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:23,070
even though there was a common writing system?

2264
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:26,310
- There must have been a way that multiple languages

2265
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:28,890
understood the same writing system.

2266
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:32,790
Or maybe there was something like Latin, you know,

2267
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:34,470
how there was a period in Europe

2268
01:52:34,470 --> 01:52:37,710
where like most people were illiterate

2269
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:42,570
and there was this priesthood who all understood Latin

2270
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:44,970
and they wrote in Latin.

2271
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:48,150
Maybe the hieroglyphs represent a kind

2272
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:51,327
of Latin in the ancient Maya world.

2273
01:52:51,327 --> 01:52:52,590
- But we don't really know.

2274
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:55,470
And there's not clear evidence to fill in the gaps

2275
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:56,940
of how it's possible to have that.

2276
01:52:56,940 --> 01:53:00,840
- Right, but we did realize it was actually

2277
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:05,340
a Russian scholar named Yuri Knorozov who broke the code.

2278
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:09,810
The Americans and the Europeans were absolutely sure

2279
01:53:09,810 --> 01:53:11,463
that the language was,

2280
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:15,120
that the written language was a dead language.

2281
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:18,210
But Yuri not knowing any of that, not being filled

2282
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:21,690
with all of those thoughts from America, and Europe

2283
01:53:21,690 --> 01:53:24,820
went about it in the way that he was taught

2284
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:28,230
in his grad school in Moscow.

2285
01:53:28,230 --> 01:53:31,080
And just went to the dictionaries

2286
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,660
and he looked at Yucatec language

2287
01:53:33,660 --> 01:53:35,580
that they're speaking today

2288
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:38,370
and he applied it to the symbol system

2289
01:53:38,370 --> 01:53:40,380
and he knew that there were certain sounds.

2290
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:43,583
He used Lambda's alphabet.

2291
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:47,640
And he found there was, his two key examples were

2292
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:49,827
a picture of a dog with a symbol over it

2293
01:53:49,827 --> 01:53:51,987
and a picture of a turkey with a symbol over it.

2294
01:53:51,987 --> 01:53:53,433
And the dog,

2295
01:53:55,526 --> 01:53:57,537
a dog in Yucatec is "zool."

2296
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:01,020
So he saw two symbols and he said,

2297
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:03,750
this one's probably "zool" and this one's "ul".

2298
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:06,780
And then the Turkey was "kuuts,"

2299
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:09,180
so it would be "kuu" ending in "tsu".

2300
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:12,360
And he showed how, look, you know, this is "tsu,"

2301
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:13,920
this is "zool,"

2302
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:18,060
those two things that should be "ts" are the same symbol.

2303
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:22,830
And that began this process of unraveling the syllables

2304
01:54:22,830 --> 01:54:25,140
that we're still working on today.

2305
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:26,010
- That's fascinating.

2306
01:54:26,010 --> 01:54:28,293
Just that decoding process is fascinating.

2307
01:54:29,461 --> 01:54:30,390
Like how do you even figure that out?

2308
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:33,000
And there's probably still, is there still, are you aware

2309
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,560
of any written languages that haven't been decoded yet?

2310
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:39,570
- Yeah, yeah, there's a number of them.

2311
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:44,280
There's Easter Island Script, I was just talking to.

2312
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,680
We've apparently made a few advances there.

2313
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:49,020
Now it's called Rongorongo.

2314
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:53,460
And we only have about maybe 25 examples of texts,

2315
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:55,440
but we're beginning to break that.

2316
01:54:55,440 --> 01:55:00,150
There's also the big one is Harappan.

2317
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:02,280
Harappan for a long time we used to say

2318
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:07,140
there were five independent scripts on the planet

2319
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:12,140
and those were Chinese, Cuneiform,

2320
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:16,470
which is Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Maya,

2321
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:21,090
and then Harappan, which is from Northern India.

2322
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:23,670
That's the only one that we've never cracked.

2323
01:55:23,670 --> 01:55:27,270
And now all the epigraphers, the people, that's the term

2324
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:30,990
for epigraphy is translating these languages.

2325
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:32,400
They're all ganging up on Harappan

2326
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,310
and want to kick it off the list 'cause we can't break it.

2327
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:38,010
It had a big enough symbol set,

2328
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:39,750
but no one's been able to crack it.

2329
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:42,480
And now they're saying it's just an elaborate symbol set

2330
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,870
and doesn't reflect the spoken word.

2331
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:48,331
- That's a hypothesis,

2332
01:55:48,331 --> 01:55:50,910
which is what would explain why it's so difficult.

2333
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:53,490
- Right, but you know, we could just be faced

2334
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:54,600
with the quitter generation.

2335
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,463
Maybe somebody will pick up the baton next generation.

2336
01:55:56,463 --> 01:55:59,100
- Kids these days with their.

2337
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:01,410
- The other one that fascinates me is from the Americas.

2338
01:56:01,410 --> 01:56:05,400
It's the Quipu, the Inca had the Quipu.

2339
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,110
This nodded string records,

2340
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:10,680
but it was definitely encoding more than just math.

2341
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:12,450
We know the math.

2342
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:15,240
I know lots, I can do the math Quipus

2343
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:18,060
and figure out what they're totaling and things.

2344
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:19,290
Yeah, there's a Quipu right there.

2345
01:56:19,290 --> 01:56:22,140
- Quipu are recording devices fashioned from strings,

2346
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:24,360
historically used by a number of cultures in the region

2347
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:27,150
of Indian and South America, a Quipu who usually consists

2348
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:29,250
of cotton or camelid fiber strings.

2349
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:30,450
So there's a set of strings

2350
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:32,730
and they're supposed to what, to be saying something?

2351
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:33,960
- There's one long string

2352
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:35,637
that the little ones dangle off of.

2353
01:56:35,637 --> 01:56:39,510
And each one of the dangling strings have sets

2354
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:41,160
of knots on them.

2355
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:44,340
And the knots, some of them are mathematical Quipus

2356
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:46,230
and those, we can just do the math,

2357
01:56:46,230 --> 01:56:47,943
we can prove that it's math.

2358
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:52,050
They also encoded language in there.

2359
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:54,690
They had entire libraries in Cusco

2360
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:58,110
where Spanish conquistadors were brought through.

2361
01:56:58,110 --> 01:57:01,290
And the caretakers of the libraries would just put,

2362
01:57:01,290 --> 01:57:03,750
they'd say, pull that one down, read that one to me.

2363
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:07,170
And he'd pull it out and just read a history of something

2364
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:08,970
that happened 200 years earlier.

2365
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:11,610
So it was definitely writing.

2366
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:13,968
But in the 1570s,

2367
01:57:13,968 --> 01:57:18,968
one head of the church there had all of the people

2368
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:22,020
that could read them called quipucamayocs,

2369
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:25,380
gathered up, had them read all of their Quipus

2370
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:28,620
and transcribe them into Spanish books,

2371
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:31,833
and then had the Quipus burned and those people murdered.

2372
01:57:32,892 --> 01:57:33,725
- Okay, well there you go.

2373
01:57:33,725 --> 01:57:36,000
- And so we can't break the code still today,

2374
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:41,000
but we know it was absolutely a written language

2375
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:45,210
though it wasn't written, it was weaved or knotted.

2376
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:47,640
- And there's still some Quipus available that could be.

2377
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:51,783
- There's, I think now we've just crossed the 1000 mark.

2378
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:54,300
So we have a thousand Quipus,

2379
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,433
there's enough to break the code.

2380
01:57:58,410 --> 01:58:00,000
And I think this generation

2381
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,800
might be the one that does it.

2382
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:05,610
- It's sad that so few have survived.

2383
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:07,860
I mean a thousand is good, but it's.

2384
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:11,820
- But see, there's, Peru has barely scratched

2385
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:13,200
the surface with archeology.

2386
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,550
There's so much out there.

2387
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:18,870
There was a priest I read about named Diego De Porres,

2388
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:21,660
who was one of the early people

2389
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:23,940
in Peru converting communities.

2390
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:27,960
And his chronicle is real clear that he wanted

2391
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:30,360
to teach this community of 3000 people,

2392
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:33,630
all the Spanish prayers, the important ones

2393
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:35,910
for them to be converted into Christianity.

2394
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:40,910
And he had the communities' quipucamayocs knot Quipus

2395
01:58:41,670 --> 01:58:44,280
for each person that told them

2396
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:47,790
that they could read them out and memorize the prayers.

2397
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:49,740
And if they were caught without their Quipu

2398
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:51,780
in town, they were flogged.

2399
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:55,560
So he had 3000 of the same Quipu made

2400
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:57,870
and handed out to this community.

2401
01:58:57,870 --> 01:58:59,280
If we find that community

2402
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:04,280
and find its cemetery, there is a Rosetta Stone.

2403
01:59:04,410 --> 01:59:07,620
- You know, it is probably the case there is somebody

2404
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:09,900
in Peru and maybe a large community

2405
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:13,587
that knows this language that understands, and like,

2406
01:59:13,587 --> 01:59:15,390
you just have to show up and ask them.

2407
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:16,350
And it's like,

2408
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:18,360
they're like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2409
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,580
- There are some communities that are using them.

2410
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:22,680
There's a couple of them that we had high hopes for.

2411
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:24,090
And then it was apparent

2412
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:26,523
that they were just making shit up.

2413
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:29,100
They didn't actually know how to read it.

2414
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:30,450
They just knew it used to be read.

2415
01:59:30,450 --> 01:59:32,730
So they like made a bunch of stuff about what it says.

2416
01:59:32,730 --> 01:59:34,620
And they bring it out and they act like they can read it,

2417
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:37,800
but then when you ask 'em the details, they don't know.

2418
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:39,240
But then on a much simpler level,

2419
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:44,240
there's llama herders who keep a string in their pocket

2420
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:47,250
and they've got the knots equaling

2421
01:59:47,250 --> 01:59:48,600
how many llamas they have.

2422
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:51,240
And then they have subcategories of information like,

2423
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:56,190
this one's sick, we've lost these ones, this one's pregnant.

2424
01:59:56,190 --> 02:00:00,270
So they have these more simple and more mathematical Quipus

2425
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:04,860
but they're using them to affect as a record.

2426
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:09,030
- Is it possible through archeology to know what, you know,

2427
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:12,150
the social organization of the Maya was?

2428
02:00:12,150 --> 02:00:16,380
Like, what maybe if there was a hierarchy,

2429
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:19,260
maybe what the political structure was,

2430
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:22,770
if there was a leader, different roles, you know, priests

2431
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:25,560
or like who had the power, who was powerless,

2432
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:28,200
who had certain kinds of roles, is it possible to know that?

2433
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:29,730
- Actually because of hieroglyphs,

2434
02:00:29,730 --> 02:00:30,990
yeah, we know a whole lot.

2435
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:33,240
There's, you know, basic things that archeology,

2436
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:35,580
which is a very blunt tool, can figure out like,

2437
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:36,900
this guy lives in a rich house,

2438
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:39,000
this guy lives in a poor house.

2439
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,810
But the hieroglyphs tell us specific stuff

2440
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:47,670
about who can rule, that it was hereditary.

2441
02:00:47,670 --> 02:00:50,880
That that hereditary rule was based

2442
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:54,660
on royal blood that could be burned

2443
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:56,940
and connect to the ancestors

2444
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:58,950
that lived up in the sky versus the one

2445
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:00,690
that's lived in the underworld.

2446
02:01:00,690 --> 02:01:03,120
It also told us things about hierarchy like

2447
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:08,120
that there were councils of lords underneath the king

2448
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:11,760
who each represented clans, who had their own neighborhoods,

2449
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:16,760
and that there were revolving positions of authority.

2450
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,850
There was the site that I mapped for my dissertation

2451
02:01:20,850 --> 02:01:23,793
and spent years in the jungle there, Palenque,

2452
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:29,310
had lord's title named Fire Lord, that was one of the,

2453
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:31,860
like, generals of their army.

2454
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:36,860
And we could tell that position changed over time.

2455
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:42,840
So there was one guy named Chak Suutz, who was the Fire Lord

2456
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:44,520
for the early part of a reign

2457
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,680
of a king called the Ahkal Mo' Naab.

2458
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:49,290
And then by the time he carves this other panel,

2459
02:01:49,290 --> 02:01:54,150
there's another guy in the position of yajawk' ahk',

2460
02:01:54,150 --> 02:01:56,130
which was the fire Lord.

2461
02:01:56,130 --> 02:01:57,884
And so he had. - Got promoted?

2462
02:01:57,884 --> 02:01:59,730
- Well he could have been killed.

2463
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:01,350
I mean, in the case of that,

2464
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:04,083
but then we have the interesting case of,

2465
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:08,580
in the post-classic, they shed the idea of kings.

2466
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:09,900
They don't like kings anymore.

2467
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:14,340
That's probably a big part of why the classic disappearance

2468
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:16,290
and the abandonment of all those cities happened.

2469
02:02:16,290 --> 02:02:18,990
People just got sick of kings.

2470
02:02:18,990 --> 02:02:21,577
And so they turned into this more council system

2471
02:02:21,577 --> 02:02:23,400
at Chichen Itza.

2472
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:27,210
But then when Chichen Itza falls, there's a new city,

2473
02:02:27,210 --> 02:02:30,750
that's architecture looks a lot like Chichen Itza.

2474
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:32,400
It's called Mayapan,

2475
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:36,333
but it has what it's called the League of Mayapan.

2476
02:02:37,290 --> 02:02:39,630
And it has a council

2477
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:42,750
of representatives from the communities

2478
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:44,430
from all around the Yucatan.

2479
02:02:44,430 --> 02:02:46,683
And it is basically a democracy.

2480
02:02:47,550 --> 02:02:50,280
It is a Maya democracy that happens.

2481
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:54,720
The individuals from all around the Yucatan are there.

2482
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:58,440
Each family has their own council house at Mayapan

2483
02:02:58,440 --> 02:02:59,733
though they live back at their place.

2484
02:02:59,733 --> 02:03:03,150
It's kind of like a Maya Congress.

2485
02:03:03,150 --> 02:03:04,440
- They have representative democracy.

2486
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:06,300
- it really was, I mean,

2487
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:11,210
and this happens in I guess 1250 AD

2488
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:15,510
that this Maya democracy happens

2489
02:03:15,510 --> 02:03:18,330
and we know the names of them, we know the families,

2490
02:03:18,330 --> 02:03:20,010
and of course they were humans.

2491
02:03:20,010 --> 02:03:22,320
So eventually they screwed it all up.

2492
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:25,020
One family murdered another family

2493
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:27,430
and the whole city burned.

2494
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:28,920
- Yeah, and of course it's probably

2495
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,450
some fascinating corruption,

2496
02:03:30,450 --> 02:03:32,370
which is hard to discover through.

2497
02:03:32,370 --> 02:03:34,470
- Part of it was the Aztec screwing things up.

2498
02:03:34,470 --> 02:03:37,290
The Aztecs came down with all sorts of like,

2499
02:03:37,290 --> 02:03:39,240
we'll buy everything you're making.

2500
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:40,500
And then eventually they were like,

2501
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:43,380
could we maybe buy some humans?

2502
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:45,120
And then one family was like, no.

2503
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:46,680
And the other family was like, I don't know,

2504
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:47,760
they're making us a lot of money.

2505
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:51,533
So then, you know, they murdered each other

2506
02:03:51,533 --> 02:03:55,350
and the water supply got polluted and then the city burned.

2507
02:03:55,350 --> 02:03:57,570
- It seems like slavery, murder

2508
02:03:57,570 --> 02:04:02,570
and disease is a large component of the story of humans.

2509
02:04:05,437 --> 02:04:07,170
As you mentioned, different periods in the Maya,

2510
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:10,170
the classic, the post-classic, the pre-classic, the archaic,

2511
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:11,370
can you just speak to that?

2512
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:12,840
So archaic is before there was

2513
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,700
really a civilization that was.

2514
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:17,640
- Archaic is pretty much when everybody's hunter-gatherers.

2515
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:19,920
- So the classic period was the golden age.

2516
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:23,250
And then the pre-classic is the interesting time

2517
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:24,327
that we were talking about

2518
02:04:24,327 --> 02:04:28,680
and the post-classic is when the democracy came about.

2519
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:30,690
- Well, midway through it.

2520
02:04:30,690 --> 02:04:32,430
Reverted back to council systems.

2521
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:34,650
The Maya loved to be part of councils.

2522
02:04:34,650 --> 02:04:36,240
So yeah, we have,

2523
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:40,080
pre-classic is like the origins of civilization.

2524
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:41,760
They're starting to build cities.

2525
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:44,070
They're starting to create their calendar.

2526
02:04:44,070 --> 02:04:47,433
They're starting to create these wonderful works of art.

2527
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:50,610
And the classic period, if you look

2528
02:04:50,610 --> 02:04:53,550
at 10 different textbooks for the Maya,

2529
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:57,000
you'll get 10 different dates that wiggle around in there.

2530
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,240
But basically that's the age of kings, to me,

2531
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:02,430
that's when these cities decide

2532
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:04,080
that they're gonna organize themselves

2533
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:08,970
around elite royal families that have this magical blood

2534
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:11,040
that can contact their ancestors

2535
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:14,220
that are directly in contact with the gods.

2536
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:17,640
The Maya never contact their gods directly.

2537
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:20,040
They contact their ancestors who are up there,

2538
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:22,920
who act like liaisons to the gods.

2539
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:25,470
And so the Maya age of kings has

2540
02:05:25,470 --> 02:05:27,840
these dynasties sprouting up

2541
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:30,450
where these people have, you know,

2542
02:05:30,450 --> 02:05:32,430
basically snowed the rest of the people,

2543
02:05:32,430 --> 02:05:35,460
that they've got a special quality of their blood

2544
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:39,180
and only their offspring can do the same trick

2545
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:41,790
and talk to the gods where everybody,

2546
02:05:41,790 --> 02:05:44,760
every Joe Maya can let their blood

2547
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:48,450
and burn it and contact their ancestor

2548
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:51,450
but Joe Maya's dad is just a corn farmer

2549
02:05:51,450 --> 02:05:52,530
who lives down below,

2550
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:54,960
and he's got no influence over the gods.

2551
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:59,960
But the rulers, their spirits go down briefly,

2552
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:02,100
but then they go up into the heavens

2553
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:05,550
and reside where the gods are and can act as liaisons.

2554
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:08,790
So that's the validation for this kingship

2555
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:11,730
that happens for about 400 years.

2556
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:14,820
I know we say 250 to 900,

2557
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:18,600
which is kind of the encompassing edges of it.

2558
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:21,900
But it's interesting that it's actually specifically

2559
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:25,410
the ninth baktun of their history.

2560
02:06:25,410 --> 02:06:28,957
The ninth baktun begins in like 426,

2561
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:34,740
and it ends in like 829.

2562
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:37,350
So it's a 400 year period of time.

2563
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:39,780
And before that, there were no kings.

2564
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:42,120
And after that, there really aren't kings.

2565
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:43,983
They're heads of councils.

2566
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:46,950
So I call it the age of kings,

2567
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:49,020
where everybody's following the directives

2568
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:53,640
of basically a despot and for a while that's great.

2569
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:57,063
I mean, cities build up, populations happening.

2570
02:06:58,058 --> 02:07:01,560
I see it as kind of a cult of personality moment too,

2571
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:04,650
strong, charismatic leaders inspire people

2572
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:06,840
to do great things together,

2573
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:10,020
but eventually, like happens all the time with power,

2574
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:11,520
too much power corrupts,

2575
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:16,410
all of a sudden there's this unwieldy huge elite class

2576
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:20,215
that has to be treated special by everybody else.

2577
02:07:20,215 --> 02:07:23,370
And they start saying, well, I think we should fight

2578
02:07:23,370 --> 02:07:25,260
with those guys, and you guys should go cut,

2579
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:26,880
take these things.

2580
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:28,650
And people eventually get sick of it,

2581
02:07:28,650 --> 02:07:30,330
and they walk away from these cities.

2582
02:07:30,330 --> 02:07:33,540
And that's how we get the mysterious Maya collapse

2583
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:35,880
where all these cities are just gone.

2584
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:37,440
- That's one of the great mysteries

2585
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:40,830
of the Maya civilization is that over a very short period

2586
02:07:40,830 --> 02:07:43,170
of time, like a hundred years,

2587
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:46,530
it seems to have declined very rapidly.

2588
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:48,690
It collapsed, what do you think explains that?

2589
02:07:48,690 --> 02:07:50,010
What happened?

2590
02:07:50,010 --> 02:07:53,190
- I think it's a failing of archeology

2591
02:07:53,190 --> 02:07:56,280
to properly see what was happening.

2592
02:07:56,280 --> 02:08:01,127
I think that most of those cities, populations, moved,

2593
02:08:02,190 --> 02:08:05,400
you know, no more than 20 to 40 kilometers out

2594
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:06,780
and started their own farm,

2595
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:09,180
and they lived in perishable houses.

2596
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:11,610
And all archeology signature sees is

2597
02:08:11,610 --> 02:08:14,280
that nobody lives in the city center anymore.

2598
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:17,850
We don't see a bunch of mass bodies.

2599
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:20,220
There's no evidence of people getting sick.

2600
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:22,710
There are certain cities that fought

2601
02:08:22,710 --> 02:08:23,940
with each other at the end,

2602
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:26,130
and we see that signature plain as day.

2603
02:08:26,130 --> 02:08:29,820
We know when a city was attacked and burned,

2604
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:31,350
mostly that didn't happen.

2605
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:33,930
People moved and migrated.

2606
02:08:33,930 --> 02:08:36,660
And it seems like right there around like

2607
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:41,660
between 800 and 900, a lot of the elites that were on top

2608
02:08:42,330 --> 02:08:45,450
in the most of it was in the rainforests

2609
02:08:45,450 --> 02:08:47,280
of northern Guatemala.

2610
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:50,190
They move, they move in two directions.

2611
02:08:50,190 --> 02:08:53,400
Some of them move into the highlands of Guatemala,

2612
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:55,953
and some of them move up into the Yucatan.

2613
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:59,160
The city of Chichen Itza becomes

2614
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:02,820
the next big capital in Yucatan.

2615
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:07,820
But the word Itza is actually a word describing

2616
02:09:07,890 --> 02:09:11,460
the people who lived around Lake Peten Itza

2617
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:13,260
in northern Guatemala.

2618
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:16,260
And all of the Maya are super clear about that,

2619
02:09:16,260 --> 02:09:21,180
that the Itza came in as immigrants with these new ideas

2620
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:23,040
and created Chichen Itza.

2621
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,170
So the elites

2622
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:28,830
who were no longer welcome in their cities just moved

2623
02:09:28,830 --> 02:09:31,140
and set up shops somewhere else.

2624
02:09:31,140 --> 02:09:33,060
- So why was there a decline?

2625
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:34,710
What was maybe the catalyst?

2626
02:09:34,710 --> 02:09:37,290
Was there a specific kind of events that started this?

2627
02:09:37,290 --> 02:09:40,740
Was this an idea that kind of transformed the society?

2628
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:42,403
- We are still debating that.

2629
02:09:42,403 --> 02:09:44,430
I don't think there is a single reason.

2630
02:09:44,430 --> 02:09:46,020
I think humans are complicated.

2631
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:49,440
I think a lot of things led to this.

2632
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:52,710
One thing we can see archeologically is that every one

2633
02:09:52,710 --> 02:09:56,520
of the cities became overpopulated.

2634
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:58,020
They were too popular,

2635
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:00,600
and we think that they pushed the limits

2636
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:04,890
of their capacity to feed and house people.

2637
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:08,460
We see it in lots of the cities at the end

2638
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:11,703
of the classic period that people are seasonally starving.

2639
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:17,370
I remember really stark evidence in Copan, Honduras.

2640
02:10:17,370 --> 02:10:21,900
Copan was this beautiful city, lineage of 17 kings.

2641
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:23,370
But the last kings

2642
02:10:23,370 --> 02:10:26,913
and the last elite burials that we dig from the city center,

2643
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:30,570
the teeth are the telling part.

2644
02:10:30,570 --> 02:10:32,850
They get this thing, when you're growing up

2645
02:10:32,850 --> 02:10:36,720
and you're not getting enough food seasonally,

2646
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:38,940
it shows up in the enamel of your teeth.

2647
02:10:38,940 --> 02:10:42,150
It's called dental hypoplasia.

2648
02:10:42,150 --> 02:10:45,360
And if somebody's seasonally starving,

2649
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:48,150
it gets these lines in their teeth.

2650
02:10:48,150 --> 02:10:52,650
And that last generation of Maya before they left Copan,

2651
02:10:52,650 --> 02:10:56,190
even the rich people are seasonally starving.

2652
02:10:56,190 --> 02:10:58,233
So there's a problem there for sure.

2653
02:10:59,220 --> 02:11:01,580
But I also think, it's a weird thing.

2654
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:03,210
It was not an empire.

2655
02:11:03,210 --> 02:11:07,500
It was a group of independent city states like Greece.

2656
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:10,740
Some of them were allied, some of them were enemies.

2657
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:13,710
There was a huge civil war that settled out

2658
02:11:13,710 --> 02:11:16,440
about the end of the classic period.

2659
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:18,120
So if it was Europe, you know,

2660
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:19,830
the victors would've taken over.

2661
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:23,070
The losers would've beat it and gone wherever they went.

2662
02:11:23,070 --> 02:11:25,650
But when they abandoned these cities

2663
02:11:25,650 --> 02:11:28,080
that were independent still, they all left,

2664
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:30,810
both the guys that won and the guys that lost the war.

2665
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:34,713
So it couldn't be just as simple as spoils go to the victor.

2666
02:11:36,030 --> 02:11:37,470
It's such a wide area.

2667
02:11:37,470 --> 02:11:39,647
Not everybody was starving like the people

2668
02:11:39,647 --> 02:11:41,250
in the Copan Valley.

2669
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:46,110
So I personally think it was cylindrically timed.

2670
02:11:46,110 --> 02:11:49,350
It is interesting to note that that ninth period,

2671
02:11:49,350 --> 02:11:52,977
that ninth 400 year period ends right then,

2672
02:11:52,977 --> 02:11:55,680
and I think a lot of people, you know,

2673
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:57,180
I can't prove it archeologically,

2674
02:11:57,180 --> 02:12:00,330
but I think a lot of people said, we're coming to the end

2675
02:12:00,330 --> 02:12:03,360
of a great cycle and we need to renew.

2676
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:06,360
We need to change what we're doing.

2677
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:08,700
When you talk to the Maya today, like at the end

2678
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:12,810
of this 2012 thing, if you actually talk to Maya,

2679
02:12:12,810 --> 02:12:15,780
say, you know what happens at the end of a big cycle here,

2680
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:20,670
they say cycles are a time of renewal

2681
02:12:20,670 --> 02:12:22,080
and transformation.

2682
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:24,900
That it is all of our obligation

2683
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:27,420
to change our lives at the end of cycles,

2684
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:28,590
that change is coming.

2685
02:12:28,590 --> 02:12:31,623
We can either be part of it or we can get steamrolled by it.

2686
02:12:32,940 --> 02:12:34,470
The Aztecs did this neat thing

2687
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:37,680
called the New Fire Ceremony every 52 years,

2688
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:40,290
which was the biggest their calendar would go,

2689
02:12:40,290 --> 02:12:43,560
they'd burn down perfectly good temples

2690
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:45,660
and they'd burn down their houses sometimes.

2691
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:50,370
And they would just, everybody in society

2692
02:12:50,370 --> 02:12:53,790
would perform this, what they call the new fire ceremony,

2693
02:12:53,790 --> 02:12:55,920
and they would renew the world.

2694
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,550
So I think my personal theory is

2695
02:12:59,550 --> 02:13:03,630
that the Maya decided at the end of the ninth baktun

2696
02:13:03,630 --> 02:13:05,610
that it was time to renew the world.

2697
02:13:05,610 --> 02:13:06,810
- I think this theory makes sense

2698
02:13:06,810 --> 02:13:09,090
because they really internalized the calendar.

2699
02:13:09,090 --> 02:13:11,130
I mean, that was a really big part of their culture,

2700
02:13:11,130 --> 02:13:15,330
the sense of the cyclical nature of civilization.

2701
02:13:15,330 --> 02:13:16,320
- That's what I think.

2702
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:20,220
I think that they created

2703
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:23,460
that calendar to perceive the cycle

2704
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:25,023
and to harmonize with it.

2705
02:13:26,970 --> 02:13:29,670
- You mentioned Aztec, what was the origin of the Aztec?

2706
02:13:29,670 --> 02:13:34,240
Where did these people come from, at what time and how?

2707
02:13:36,450 --> 02:13:37,283
- You know, almost every one

2708
02:13:37,283 --> 02:13:39,180
of the cultures we're talking about now,

2709
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:40,890
we have two different versions

2710
02:13:40,890 --> 02:13:43,560
of the answer to that question.

2711
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:45,780
We have the archeology version,

2712
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:48,540
and we have the Aztecs themselves.

2713
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:52,590
The Aztecs have this wonderful migration story

2714
02:13:52,590 --> 02:13:55,740
where they say that they came from a place,

2715
02:13:55,740 --> 02:13:59,670
well to the north called Aztlan,

2716
02:13:59,670 --> 02:14:03,210
and that they had this migration that went through

2717
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:05,310
kind of a hero's journey where they go

2718
02:14:05,310 --> 02:14:07,020
to this snake mountain place

2719
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:11,100
and they encounter the birth of the war god,

2720
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:13,440
that they'll worship after this.

2721
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:18,440
And how they stepped into the valley of Mexico as the last,

2722
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:22,890
the lost brothers of everyone in the Valley of Mexico,

2723
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:26,580
they said that they all came from the north.

2724
02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:29,970
Near Aztlan is a place, a cave

2725
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:33,553
with seven different passages called Chicomoztoc.

2726
02:14:34,667 --> 02:14:35,730
And that all the people

2727
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:39,090
who spoke the language nahuatl came from the cave.

2728
02:14:39,090 --> 02:14:42,510
And most of them went early to the Valley of Mexico.

2729
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:45,780
And in the Aztecs story,

2730
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:47,730
they were just the lost tribe.

2731
02:14:47,730 --> 02:14:50,446
They were the last brothers to come in.

2732
02:14:50,446 --> 02:14:54,690
But then they show up late game,

2733
02:14:54,690 --> 02:14:56,670
and they become mercenaries.

2734
02:14:56,670 --> 02:14:57,870
They just start working

2735
02:14:57,870 --> 02:15:01,200
for communities in the valley of Mexico.

2736
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:05,970
And this takes place in the 1300s.

2737
02:15:05,970 --> 02:15:09,270
So about 200 years before Cortez shows up,

2738
02:15:09,270 --> 02:15:12,150
the Aztecs show up to the Valley of Mexico,

2739
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:14,850
and they make themselves this

2740
02:15:14,850 --> 02:15:17,520
indispensable group of mercenaries.

2741
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:22,520
They do the dirty work, all the civilized communities

2742
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:29,180
around Lake Texcoco, which is now Mexico City.

2743
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:32,760
It's all dried up, but those guys were too civilized

2744
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:34,800
to fight with each other, but they could hire

2745
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,570
the Aztecs to do their dirty stuff.

2746
02:15:36,570 --> 02:15:37,920
So the Aztecs did that

2747
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:41,220
and really changed the politics in the game

2748
02:15:41,220 --> 02:15:43,950
of the Valley of Mexico.

2749
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:46,050
- The dirty stuff, they're the muscle.

2750
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:47,370
- Yeah, they'd go in

2751
02:15:47,370 --> 02:15:50,405
and they'd kill whoever you wanted killed.

2752
02:15:50,405 --> 02:15:52,770
Now you're the king of this area.

2753
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:54,720
So one of these kings that they were working for

2754
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:57,030
really liked them and decided,

2755
02:15:57,030 --> 02:16:01,680
I'm gonna make the Aztecs part of our ancestry.

2756
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:04,285
I'm gonna give them my daughter

2757
02:16:04,285 --> 02:16:07,023
to marry the head of the Aztecs.

2758
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:09,993
And the Aztecs sacrificed her,

2759
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:13,080
and that really pissed that guy off.

2760
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,570
So he took like his whole army

2761
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:17,190
and ran the Aztecs out.

2762
02:16:17,190 --> 02:16:18,750
For a while, they say they live

2763
02:16:18,750 --> 02:16:22,560
in this horrible desert section eating lizards,

2764
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:25,350
but then one of their priests say, we're gonna walk

2765
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:29,880
around the lake, and my visions say that where we see

2766
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:34,530
an eagle sitting on a cactus with a snake in its mouth is

2767
02:16:34,530 --> 02:16:37,559
where we will build our capital.

2768
02:16:37,559 --> 02:16:41,253
And they see that, but it's out on an island in the lake.

2769
02:16:42,150 --> 02:16:44,250
And he said, well, I don't know.

2770
02:16:44,250 --> 02:16:45,840
That's the place.

2771
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:49,590
So they build up an island, they go to that island,

2772
02:16:49,590 --> 02:16:54,590
and then they just start piling up lake muck until they make

2773
02:16:54,870 --> 02:16:56,790
a whole city there in the middle of the island.

2774
02:16:56,790 --> 02:17:00,333
They make, or the lake, they make an island city.

2775
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:03,719
And all of this occurs in about a hundred years.

2776
02:17:03,719 --> 02:17:06,180
So they show up about 1300.

2777
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:10,442
The capital of Tenochtitlan, as they called it,

2778
02:17:11,490 --> 02:17:13,049
is really established.

2779
02:17:13,049 --> 02:17:17,219
And from there, they quickly take over the entire valley.

2780
02:17:17,219 --> 02:17:20,160
They make what they call the triple alliance,

2781
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:22,639
which is the two other big communities

2782
02:17:22,639 --> 02:17:24,570
of the lake are now their allies,

2783
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:25,860
but they're not really allies.

2784
02:17:25,860 --> 02:17:27,900
The Aztecs were brutal.

2785
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:30,330
They were just, those guys agreed to shut up

2786
02:17:30,330 --> 02:17:32,073
and let the Aztecs run the show.

2787
02:17:33,540 --> 02:17:36,719
And then the Aztecs spread like a wildfire all the way down

2788
02:17:36,719 --> 02:17:37,980
into the Maya area.

2789
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:40,830
Everywhere they go, they rename everybody's towns

2790
02:17:40,830 --> 02:17:42,719
and make them pay tribute.

2791
02:17:42,719 --> 02:17:45,513
- Pretty short last thing, civilization,

2792
02:17:46,350 --> 02:17:47,913
spread extremely quickly.

2793
02:17:48,990 --> 02:17:53,250
Famous, what are some defining qualities that explain that?

2794
02:17:53,250 --> 02:17:55,379
- I think they were very much like,

2795
02:17:55,379 --> 02:17:58,230
they had an attitude, like Attila the Hun.

2796
02:17:58,230 --> 02:18:02,160
They just had no problem ripping your skin off.

2797
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:06,330
Everybody else had become too comfortable and too civilized.

2798
02:18:06,330 --> 02:18:10,379
And the Aztecs were just mercenary.

2799
02:18:10,379 --> 02:18:12,330
They told everybody, you know,

2800
02:18:12,330 --> 02:18:16,139
we can either rip your heart out or you can work for us,

2801
02:18:16,139 --> 02:18:18,600
and if you work for us, you'll be just fine.

2802
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:20,250
They'd go to every town they'd go to.

2803
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:21,870
The first thing they do is they'd show up

2804
02:18:21,870 --> 02:18:24,150
with a bunch of merchants.

2805
02:18:24,150 --> 02:18:27,389
There was a merchant class who were also military.

2806
02:18:27,389 --> 02:18:30,299
They were really the people who assessed

2807
02:18:30,299 --> 02:18:31,889
where they were gonna attack next.

2808
02:18:31,889 --> 02:18:35,370
They'd go in with a bunch of Aztec products and say,

2809
02:18:35,370 --> 02:18:37,379
we'd like to trade with you.

2810
02:18:37,379 --> 02:18:41,070
But all the time they were assessing their military prowess,

2811
02:18:41,070 --> 02:18:44,850
what products they had that they could take.

2812
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:47,580
And then soon after the Pochteca were there,

2813
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:50,823
would come the military with the reconnaissance.

2814
02:18:51,719 --> 02:18:54,389
- So the Aztec had a huge warrior class,

2815
02:18:54,389 --> 02:18:55,290
as you're saying.

2816
02:18:55,290 --> 02:19:00,290
So can you linger on their whole relationship

2817
02:19:00,719 --> 02:19:02,549
with war and violence?

2818
02:19:02,549 --> 02:19:06,420
- They worshiped a war deity.

2819
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:10,320
Their main temple was the Templo Mayor.

2820
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:12,690
It had two temples up on top.

2821
02:19:12,690 --> 02:19:15,090
One was to Tlaloc the rain God,

2822
02:19:15,090 --> 02:19:17,309
who liked a lot of sacrifice himself.

2823
02:19:17,309 --> 02:19:21,059
But then the other one was Huitzilopochtli.

2824
02:19:21,059 --> 02:19:25,290
He was, that translates the hummingbird on the left.

2825
02:19:25,290 --> 02:19:27,870
But he's the war God, I love that he's a hummingbird.

2826
02:19:27,870 --> 02:19:29,370
Maybe, you know, he's fast

2827
02:19:29,370 --> 02:19:32,309
and he comes from the magical side or something.

2828
02:19:32,309 --> 02:19:35,100
But then right next

2829
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:37,200
to the temple on either side were

2830
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,450
the two temples of the warriors.

2831
02:19:39,450 --> 02:19:41,430
One was the eagle warrior clan,

2832
02:19:41,430 --> 02:19:44,250
the other one was the jaguar warrior clan.

2833
02:19:44,250 --> 02:19:46,469
And they were symbolically

2834
02:19:46,469 --> 02:19:48,209
in competition with each other.

2835
02:19:48,209 --> 02:19:50,640
Though a unified force, I guess, you know,

2836
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:54,870
probably an analogy between like the Navy and the Air Force.

2837
02:19:54,870 --> 02:19:57,510
You know, they had a good natured competition

2838
02:19:57,510 --> 02:20:00,660
of who was better, but they were the same force.

2839
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:03,750
So those were their symbolic warriors,

2840
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:06,600
dressed up in all of their finery.

2841
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:11,600
And they would come at people with these two forces.

2842
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:15,150
And it was very unlike anything

2843
02:20:15,150 --> 02:20:17,550
that had happened before in Mesoamerica.

2844
02:20:17,550 --> 02:20:19,410
Again, I think I could draw a parallel

2845
02:20:19,410 --> 02:20:21,540
to what happened in Europe.

2846
02:20:21,540 --> 02:20:26,540
You know, the famous Henry the V moment in Agincourt where,

2847
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:30,570
you know, his kind of ragtag army

2848
02:20:30,570 --> 02:20:35,570
wipes out half of France's aristocracy with the longbow.

2849
02:20:35,610 --> 02:20:38,640
Like up until that moment, Europe had

2850
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:43,530
a very wars for the elite classes kind of attitude.

2851
02:20:43,530 --> 02:20:46,650
And then after France lost half their aristocracy,

2852
02:20:46,650 --> 02:20:48,007
then it was like,

2853
02:20:48,007 --> 02:20:49,920
maybe we should be hiring from the villages.

2854
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:53,310
The same sort of thing happened with the Aztec,

2855
02:20:53,310 --> 02:20:55,413
that there was a,

2856
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:59,880
Mesoamerica really didn't have huge standing armies,

2857
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:02,160
but the Aztec put this army together

2858
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:03,960
and they intimidated people.

2859
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,910
They didn't actually have to use it a lot.

2860
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:08,400
It was used to great effect

2861
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:10,860
in the valley of Mexico.

2862
02:21:10,860 --> 02:21:12,728
And for the rest of Mesoamerica.

2863
02:21:12,728 --> 02:21:14,790
It was mostly the fear factor.

2864
02:21:14,790 --> 02:21:17,520
- But there also seemed to be, you know,

2865
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:21,840
a celebration of violence.

2866
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:24,750
I think you said that beauty

2867
02:21:24,750 --> 02:21:27,273
and blood went hand in hand for the Aztec,

2868
02:21:28,140 --> 02:21:29,520
maybe like the Roman Empire.

2869
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:31,950
Was it they just had a maybe a different relationship

2870
02:21:31,950 --> 02:21:35,160
with what violence, where that stood

2871
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:38,820
in the purpose of life,

2872
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:41,820
purpose of existence, is that fair to say?

2873
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:44,670
- I would hypothesize so, I mean, you know,

2874
02:21:44,670 --> 02:21:46,080
I think it's one of the wonderful things

2875
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:48,660
about studying these ancient cultures, you know,

2876
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:52,140
knowing what our human capacity is.

2877
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:55,590
And the Aztecs, when I said that statement,

2878
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:59,730
what I meant by that is they were absolutely comfortable

2879
02:21:59,730 --> 02:22:02,336
with human sacrifice and,

2880
02:22:02,336 --> 02:22:04,380
you know, ripping people's hearts out.

2881
02:22:04,380 --> 02:22:06,930
They had this just, you know,

2882
02:22:06,930 --> 02:22:09,420
grotesque, violent bent.

2883
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:12,210
But in the same way they also

2884
02:22:12,210 --> 02:22:17,100
absolutely loved flower gardens and poetry

2885
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:20,130
and music and dance.

2886
02:22:20,130 --> 02:22:24,780
The same Aztec king who would order the hearts

2887
02:22:24,780 --> 02:22:28,590
of a thousand people extracted also would stand up

2888
02:22:28,590 --> 02:22:32,010
at dinner parties to recite his own poetry

2889
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:36,750
or the poetry of famous statesmen that had come before him.

2890
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:41,550
And they spent money on things like flower gardens.

2891
02:22:41,550 --> 02:22:43,200
All of the causeways leading

2892
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,680
to the Aztec capital had beautiful flower gardens.

2893
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:51,450
And they had a museum, and they had an aquarium

2894
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:56,450
and a zoo, and they had an opera and they had a ballet.

2895
02:22:56,618 --> 02:23:00,090
And these things existed together.

2896
02:23:00,090 --> 02:23:04,560
There was not in the Aztec mind any conflict

2897
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:08,760
between witnessing someone's heart getting ripped out,

2898
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:11,673
one moment, in the evening we'd go to the ballet.

2899
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:15,000
- How does that contrast the relationship with war

2900
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,850
and violence, with the other civilizations

2901
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:21,540
of Mesoamerica and South America, maybe the Maya?

2902
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:23,640
What was their relationship like with war?

2903
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:25,440
- The Maya were certainly influenced

2904
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,030
by the Aztec at the end.

2905
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:29,850
So we get a skewed perspective

2906
02:23:29,850 --> 02:23:32,130
from the contact period accounts,

2907
02:23:32,130 --> 02:23:36,420
because the Maya were much more violent

2908
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:40,860
and sacrifice oriented in their post-classic rendition.

2909
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:45,750
But in the classic period, it was mostly the priests

2910
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:50,640
and the king who were doing the sacrificing of themselves,

2911
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:55,640
that we know that the Maya kings would cut their penises

2912
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:59,040
and then bleed that blood onto paper

2913
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:02,010
and the paper would burn

2914
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:05,970
and become the smoke through which they'd commune

2915
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:09,540
with their ancestors, but they'd actually tie this paper

2916
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:12,990
onto their penis, cut it, and then dance.

2917
02:24:12,990 --> 02:24:17,597
So the blood splattered, but it was them cutting themselves.

2918
02:24:17,597 --> 02:24:19,440
It was different than killing a bunch

2919
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:20,490
of other people for it.

2920
02:24:20,490 --> 02:24:23,310
It was a auto sacrifice, we call it.

2921
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:24,660
Still very macabre,

2922
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:26,790
but very different than deciding a whole bunch

2923
02:24:26,790 --> 02:24:27,870
of other people should die.

2924
02:24:27,870 --> 02:24:30,840
It was a self sacrifice thing.

2925
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:32,550
- Can you speak to the sacrifice a bit more?

2926
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:34,260
Animal sacrifice, human sacrifice.

2927
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:37,350
What role did that play in for the Maya,

2928
02:24:37,350 --> 02:24:39,723
for the Aztec, for the different cultures here?

2929
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:42,510
Was that religious in nature?

2930
02:24:42,510 --> 02:24:44,490
- It was absolutely religious in nature.

2931
02:24:44,490 --> 02:24:47,128
And the Aztecs were of the opinion

2932
02:24:47,128 --> 02:24:52,128
that the war God demanded people were captured

2933
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:56,160
and sacrificed, and it had to be valuable people.

2934
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:59,940
There was a lot of, before they made that big standing army,

2935
02:24:59,940 --> 02:25:04,170
they had just ritual battles that they would have,

2936
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:06,003
and they'd take captives.

2937
02:25:07,140 --> 02:25:10,440
In fact, all around Mesoamerica, they wanted captives

2938
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:11,940
so that they could bring them back

2939
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:14,080
and sacrifice them for the gods

2940
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:18,840
and the Aztecs deciding to specifically follow

2941
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:21,840
the war god did this more than anybody.

2942
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:23,970
They did it so much and so successfully

2943
02:25:23,970 --> 02:25:27,300
that they didn't have any enemies nearby.

2944
02:25:27,300 --> 02:25:31,350
So they decided this one poor sucker group,

2945
02:25:31,350 --> 02:25:34,830
not that far away, called the Tlaxcallans,

2946
02:25:34,830 --> 02:25:39,030
that they were never going to make peace with them

2947
02:25:39,030 --> 02:25:42,300
so that they could go close by every year

2948
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:45,300
and just have a little symbolic war with the Tlaxcallans

2949
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:48,480
and haul 'em back for a sacrifice.

2950
02:25:48,480 --> 02:25:49,980
Cortez met those guys

2951
02:25:49,980 --> 02:25:54,180
and he was like, here are people who hate their guts.

2952
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:55,470
I'll just use these guys.

2953
02:25:55,470 --> 02:25:59,250
So, you know, we say, oh, Cortez took over the Aztec world.

2954
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:04,250
It was Cortez and 20,000 super pissed off Tlaxcallans.

2955
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:06,000
- And they actual sacrifice what,

2956
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,970
so there would be kind of these ritual battles,

2957
02:26:08,970 --> 02:26:12,036
or is it chopping off people's heads,

2958
02:26:12,036 --> 02:26:15,630
like is there some interesting rituals around the sacrifice?

2959
02:26:15,630 --> 02:26:18,420
- It's mostly heart extractions, sometimes heads,

2960
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:20,610
but they bring them up on top of the temple

2961
02:26:20,610 --> 02:26:21,840
so everybody can see it.

2962
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:23,760
And they had a specific stone

2963
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,680
where they would bend them over,

2964
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:28,080
so their ribcage would come out

2965
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:31,710
and they'd use like a thick obsidian knife.

2966
02:26:31,710 --> 02:26:36,000
And they had a really just like tried and true way to do it.

2967
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,090
They'd stab it in a certain place close,

2968
02:26:39,090 --> 02:26:41,220
and then they'd push down on the sternum

2969
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:43,770
as they ripped up on the rib cage.

2970
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:45,810
And they just, so they just make a place

2971
02:26:45,810 --> 02:26:47,280
where they could just rip it right out

2972
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:49,260
- With their hand? - Yeah, with their hand.

2973
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:51,270
But they were really just surgical about it.

2974
02:26:51,270 --> 02:26:54,060
They'd use a thick obsidian knife where they could

2975
02:26:54,060 --> 02:26:57,390
just break the ribs right along the sternum

2976
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:58,740
and then push the sternum down.

2977
02:26:58,740 --> 02:26:59,763
Pull up and just.

2978
02:27:00,750 --> 02:27:02,100
- While the person was alive?

2979
02:27:02,100 --> 02:27:04,680
- Yep, while the person was alive.

2980
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:06,300
And the Aztecs had this idea,

2981
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:09,000
like there was a horrible drought that went on

2982
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,490
that almost ruined the entire valley.

2983
02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:13,920
And they came to this conclusion that it's

2984
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:16,710
because we haven't been killing enough people.

2985
02:27:16,710 --> 02:27:18,360
We've got to bump this up.

2986
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:20,970
And then when they did and they decided,

2987
02:27:20,970 --> 02:27:24,930
they really took it out on the Tlaxcallans, it rained again.

2988
02:27:24,930 --> 02:27:26,220
So it was proof positive

2989
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:28,120
that they should just keep doing that.

2990
02:27:30,270 --> 02:27:32,970
And they ate people as well, they really did.

2991
02:27:32,970 --> 02:27:35,190
- As part of the sacrifice, or is this?

2992
02:27:35,190 --> 02:27:38,220
- After the sacrifice, then they would eat them.

2993
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:39,570
And this was part of the drought

2994
02:27:39,570 --> 02:27:41,340
and the famine thing that started,

2995
02:27:41,340 --> 02:27:43,888
but then it was just kind of the thing to do.

2996
02:27:43,888 --> 02:27:46,920
When Cortez got there, they were still having

2997
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:51,153
certain special feasts that involved humans.

2998
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,690
And it really upset the Spanish

2999
02:27:54,690 --> 02:27:57,420
that they would be like tricked into eating human.

3000
02:27:57,420 --> 02:27:59,160
Like, hey, you liking dinner?

3001
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:00,360
That was a human.

3002
02:28:00,360 --> 02:28:02,313
- So the idea, was it actually,

3003
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:06,720
having a taste for human flesh

3004
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:11,070
or is it just, you know, these kinds of ideas of like,

3005
02:28:11,070 --> 02:28:12,330
if you eat a person's heart

3006
02:28:12,330 --> 02:28:14,910
that you can get their spirit and their strength.

3007
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:16,110
- In the case of the Aztecs,

3008
02:28:16,110 --> 02:28:18,240
it seemed like they just liked it.

3009
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:22,560
This guy, Sahagun, who was a very responsible chronicler

3010
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:24,180
that was pretty specific.

3011
02:28:24,180 --> 02:28:27,243
That like, there was a distribution thing.

3012
02:28:28,111 --> 02:28:30,750
Like the elites got butts.

3013
02:28:30,750 --> 02:28:32,730
The butts were the best part.

3014
02:28:32,730 --> 02:28:35,820
So the butt cheeks, those are the best parts to eat.

3015
02:28:35,820 --> 02:28:38,040
And then like, it went down the chain

3016
02:28:38,040 --> 02:28:40,830
until some people just got like fingers and toes.

3017
02:28:40,830 --> 02:28:43,710
- Literally about taste for the Aztec.

3018
02:28:43,710 --> 02:28:45,330
Boy, all right, well.

3019
02:28:45,330 --> 02:28:47,370
- They really did, they really did.

3020
02:28:47,370 --> 02:28:49,230
In fact, that's what caused the,

3021
02:28:49,230 --> 02:28:53,040
have you heard of the Noche Triste, the sad night,

3022
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:55,770
The night that the Aztecs really go nuts

3023
02:28:55,770 --> 02:28:57,900
on the Spanish and kicked them out.

3024
02:28:57,900 --> 02:29:01,743
It's all triggered by this one guy,

3025
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:06,840
Pedro de Alvarado, who's left in charge by Cortez.

3026
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:08,340
As Cortez, goes to the coast

3027
02:29:08,340 --> 02:29:11,820
and tries to talk to the New Force,

3028
02:29:11,820 --> 02:29:14,340
talk him into being for him, which he does.

3029
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:18,570
But Pedro Alvarado's left back in town in charge,

3030
02:29:18,570 --> 02:29:22,500
and they're doing another one of these huge Aztec buffets

3031
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:27,360
and parties to honor them, and it happens.

3032
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:29,370
The guy says, you know, hey, do you like dinner?

3033
02:29:29,370 --> 02:29:30,630
Like, oh yeah, it's a nice dinner.

3034
02:29:30,630 --> 02:29:32,280
Well, it's humans, you're eating humans.

3035
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:34,589
See, I told you they were good.

3036
02:29:34,589 --> 02:29:36,060
And Alvarado just freaks out.

3037
02:29:36,060 --> 02:29:39,600
And he has the guards close the doors

3038
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:43,680
and he murders everyone in the party.

3039
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:46,980
Women, children, nobody has weapons.

3040
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:49,380
He just murders everyone,

3041
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:53,550
and that's what spazzes the Aztecs out

3042
02:29:53,550 --> 02:29:57,750
to eventually murder Montezuma who was their captive,

3043
02:29:57,750 --> 02:29:59,310
and then try to murder all of them.

3044
02:29:59,310 --> 02:30:02,310
And it was all Pedro Alvarado's fault

3045
02:30:02,310 --> 02:30:05,160
for freaking out about eating humans.

3046
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:07,170
- Just a little practical joke.

3047
02:30:07,170 --> 02:30:09,810
- It was just, they thought it was funny, he did not.

3048
02:30:09,810 --> 02:30:11,010
- That's fascinating, I didn't realize.

3049
02:30:11,010 --> 02:30:12,900
So I kind of assume that some level

3050
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:14,970
of cannibalism would have to do with, you know,

3051
02:30:14,970 --> 02:30:17,880
eating the heart to gain the spirit

3052
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:19,530
of the person or something like this.

3053
02:30:19,530 --> 02:30:21,270
- In certain, like, you know,

3054
02:30:21,270 --> 02:30:22,950
deer hunting rituals, things for sure.

3055
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:25,530
But the Aztecs, no, they just liked eating humans.

3056
02:30:25,530 --> 02:30:27,120
It was part of the fear factor too.

3057
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:28,710
I mean, they could walk into a new town

3058
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:31,980
and be like, you guys could either send us, you know,

3059
02:30:31,980 --> 02:30:34,710
a number of Quetzal feathers every month,

3060
02:30:34,710 --> 02:30:36,150
or we could eat you.

3061
02:30:36,150 --> 02:30:38,280
- So that psychological warfare

3062
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:40,050
and actual warfare, it worked.

3063
02:30:40,050 --> 02:30:41,800
And that's how they spread quickly.

3064
02:30:42,690 --> 02:30:43,740
- And they were just about

3065
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:45,720
to take over the Maya when the Spanish came

3066
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:47,250
and messed everything up.

3067
02:30:47,250 --> 02:30:49,500
They had the Maya surrounded

3068
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:52,710
and they were about to take over the whole Yucatan.

3069
02:30:52,710 --> 02:30:54,720
- So you think without the Spanish

3070
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:56,340
there would be this Aztec empire

3071
02:30:56,340 --> 02:30:58,530
that would last for a very long time?

3072
02:30:58,530 --> 02:31:00,870
- Mm, I think there would've been an Aztec empire.

3073
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:03,150
I think they would've finished dominating everybody,

3074
02:31:03,150 --> 02:31:05,130
but they did it through hate.

3075
02:31:05,130 --> 02:31:08,871
And everybody hated the Aztecs.

3076
02:31:08,871 --> 02:31:10,920
So it wouldn't have lasted forever.

3077
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:13,440
They were not ruling justly.

3078
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:14,580
They were ruling by force.

3079
02:31:14,580 --> 02:31:19,580
And that can only go on so long before revolution happens.

3080
02:31:19,590 --> 02:31:23,070
The Inca Empire, I think that would've gone on forever

3081
02:31:23,070 --> 02:31:25,770
'cause they were really community oriented.

3082
02:31:25,770 --> 02:31:26,910
Once the Inca took over,

3083
02:31:26,910 --> 02:31:30,330
like no one in the Inca empire starved,

3084
02:31:30,330 --> 02:31:34,443
they built architecture, everyone was safe.

3085
02:31:34,443 --> 02:31:35,910
It was the society

3086
02:31:35,910 --> 02:31:37,290
that could have lasted a long time.

3087
02:31:37,290 --> 02:31:39,873
- What was the origin of the Inca Empire?

3088
02:31:41,190 --> 02:31:44,010
- Well, it was bloody at first, like most of them are.

3089
02:31:44,010 --> 02:31:47,700
But once they started taking over that,

3090
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:49,710
what they did is they empire built.

3091
02:31:49,710 --> 02:31:52,050
Everybody else had just raided their neighbors

3092
02:31:52,050 --> 02:31:55,710
to get the resources, but everybody they raided,

3093
02:31:55,710 --> 02:31:57,660
they turned them into the Inca Empire.

3094
02:31:57,660 --> 02:32:02,640
And they created this incredible Mita system

3095
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:05,850
where you took turns working

3096
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:09,030
and they created the road system so they could get groups

3097
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:10,320
of workers back and forth.

3098
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:13,593
So a town of let's say 5,000 people,

3099
02:32:14,610 --> 02:32:16,440
the Inca would roll up with an army

3100
02:32:16,440 --> 02:32:19,320
of a hundred, 200,000 people

3101
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:20,910
and say, you know, would you guys like

3102
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:22,380
to be part of the empire?

3103
02:32:22,380 --> 02:32:23,880
Or would you like us to escort you

3104
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:25,650
to the edge of the empire?

3105
02:32:25,650 --> 02:32:28,860
And if your mayor here agrees, then he can have a town,

3106
02:32:28,860 --> 02:32:30,930
he can have a house in Cusco.

3107
02:32:30,930 --> 02:32:35,100
But then the very next month, a big work crew would show up

3108
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:37,980
and they'd start building agricultural terraces

3109
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:39,510
and storage units.

3110
02:32:39,510 --> 02:32:44,117
And every month with the agricultural excess,

3111
02:32:45,690 --> 02:32:48,780
they would have big parties and everybody would eat.

3112
02:32:48,780 --> 02:32:51,740
So people lived well in the Inca Empire.

3113
02:32:51,740 --> 02:32:53,130
It was a rough beginning,

3114
02:32:53,130 --> 02:32:55,980
but everybody who agreed to be part of it

3115
02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:59,250
immediately had access to a whole bunch of resources

3116
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:01,410
and security they never had.

3117
02:33:01,410 --> 02:33:05,520
- So they started in South America and Peru and Cusco,

3118
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:07,170
Cusco was like the center of it?

3119
02:33:07,170 --> 02:33:10,380
- Cusco in their language, Quechua

3120
02:33:10,380 --> 02:33:13,740
it means navel or belly button.

3121
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:15,300
And it's up in the mountains.

3122
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:17,220
But there's four quarters.

3123
02:33:17,220 --> 02:33:20,460
They called their empire Tawantinsuyu,

3124
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:21,960
the Land of Four Quarters.

3125
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:25,770
And the center of those four quarters was Cusco.

3126
02:33:25,770 --> 02:33:30,120
- It sprung to life, what, in like 1200 DC?

3127
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:33,960
- Yeah, we backwards project what it was.

3128
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:38,520
But it was probably mid 1200s

3129
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:42,360
when the first Sapa Inca, the first ruler came in,

3130
02:33:42,360 --> 02:33:45,870
but it was the, I think it's the ninth one is Pachacuti

3131
02:33:45,870 --> 02:33:50,430
who really started being an empire builder.

3132
02:33:50,430 --> 02:33:53,580
- And part of that, I mean, what really defined the empire,

3133
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:58,110
as you said, roads, they build a massive road network.

3134
02:33:58,110 --> 02:34:02,910
- Roads, and in the same way that the Roman strategy

3135
02:34:02,910 --> 02:34:05,190
of building roads and infrastructure.

3136
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:06,930
And then every place they took over,

3137
02:34:06,930 --> 02:34:11,930
they'd create certain key pieces of Roman architecture

3138
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,040
that kind of made that city Roman.

3139
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:19,020
And they'd rename it something, the Inca did the same thing.

3140
02:34:19,020 --> 02:34:23,850
They had certain signature Inca architecture

3141
02:34:23,850 --> 02:34:27,480
that they would build in as the administrative part.

3142
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:32,040
They'd send the quipucamayoc, the guys

3143
02:34:32,040 --> 02:34:36,210
who would weave the, or knot the Quipus as accountants.

3144
02:34:36,210 --> 02:34:37,350
And though they would go through

3145
02:34:37,350 --> 02:34:40,800
and say what everybody did, okay, you know,

3146
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:42,840
you're a good farmer, you're gonna farm.

3147
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:44,850
You are a good weaver, you're gonna weave.

3148
02:34:44,850 --> 02:34:47,190
All the men here are gonna take a turn

3149
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:49,500
at being part of the army.

3150
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:52,680
And they sent independent quipucamayocs too,

3151
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:55,440
that every community had like five or six

3152
02:34:55,440 --> 02:34:57,330
that were not allowed to work with each other.

3153
02:34:57,330 --> 02:35:00,090
And they all had to independently send their Quipus

3154
02:35:00,090 --> 02:35:01,500
back to Cusco.

3155
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:03,840
And if there were accounting discrepancies,

3156
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:05,940
they were called to Cusco to figure out

3157
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:07,890
who was lying about what.

3158
02:35:07,890 --> 02:35:09,510
- So there's like a super sophisticated

3159
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:10,680
record keeping system.

3160
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:13,080
- Yeah, and that was the Quipu

3161
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:14,940
and the Spanish recorded

3162
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:17,070
what they could and then burned them all.

3163
02:35:17,070 --> 02:35:20,100
- But that's an interesting development for an empire

3164
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:22,020
'cause that allows you to really expand

3165
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:25,230
and have some kind of management,

3166
02:35:25,230 --> 02:35:26,850
some level of control.

3167
02:35:26,850 --> 02:35:28,650
- Yeah, they couldn't, at the end they were

3168
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:30,990
at least 10 million people

3169
02:35:30,990 --> 02:35:33,420
and there was just no way to do that.

3170
02:35:33,420 --> 02:35:37,010
Without some sort of sophisticated record keeping system.

3171
02:35:37,010 --> 02:35:39,110
- If the Inca had to face Aztec, who wins?

3172
02:35:39,990 --> 02:35:41,580
- Inca.

3173
02:35:41,580 --> 02:35:43,320
I mean, the Aztecs were psychotic,

3174
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:46,920
but the Inca had just reserves for miles.

3175
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:50,790
And they had that essential hearts and minds.

3176
02:35:50,790 --> 02:35:52,170
And there was only one thing

3177
02:35:52,170 --> 02:35:53,640
that everybody got pissed off about

3178
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:55,080
when they joined the Inca Empire.

3179
02:35:55,080 --> 02:35:58,920
For some reason everything was owned communally,

3180
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:01,350
except the llamas.

3181
02:36:01,350 --> 02:36:03,780
The llamas were the king's.

3182
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:06,480
And so that was one thing that like

3183
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:09,000
some of them would stay in town just to be work llamas.

3184
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,400
But you know, you don't own your llama anymore.

3185
02:36:11,400 --> 02:36:14,280
And people are really attached to their llamas.

3186
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:17,460
To this day, they are like family members.

3187
02:36:17,460 --> 02:36:19,380
So it'd be like everybody walked in

3188
02:36:19,380 --> 02:36:22,230
and said everybody's family dog is now mine.

3189
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:25,170
Like really upset people on an emotional level.

3190
02:36:25,170 --> 02:36:27,070
- Well, the, I mean, so llamas

3191
02:36:28,414 --> 02:36:31,920
got domesticated at some point, probably early.

3192
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:34,503
I mean, I don't even know when, but early on.

3193
02:36:35,550 --> 02:36:39,630
- We have rock art that progresses to make it seem,

3194
02:36:39,630 --> 02:36:43,470
like a progression from people depicted hunting them

3195
02:36:43,470 --> 02:36:47,520
to people depicted standing next to pregnant ones.

3196
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:49,710
So it was still in that archaic period

3197
02:36:49,710 --> 02:36:52,650
at least that they became friends.

3198
02:36:52,650 --> 02:36:55,830
- Yeah, but if you roll in and you own them, that's.

3199
02:36:55,830 --> 02:36:57,390
- Yeah, that pissed everybody off.

3200
02:36:57,390 --> 02:37:01,830
For some reason the Inca owned everybody's llama instantly.

3201
02:37:01,830 --> 02:37:03,540
And he would take anything he wanted.

3202
02:37:03,540 --> 02:37:06,480
A lot of them would just get carted away that day,

3203
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:08,670
just sent to Cusco.

3204
02:37:08,670 --> 02:37:11,370
They'd also take their mummies, that was a weird thing.

3205
02:37:11,370 --> 02:37:13,380
Everybody mourns their dead.

3206
02:37:13,380 --> 02:37:17,040
But the Inca just like ceased to accept it.

3207
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:18,660
They would just, the mummies were still there.

3208
02:37:18,660 --> 02:37:19,800
Okay, he's dead, but look,

3209
02:37:19,800 --> 02:37:21,390
he still got clothes, he's at the party.

3210
02:37:21,390 --> 02:37:23,100
Let's put a beer in front of him.

3211
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:26,730
They just like, they just kept people as mummies.

3212
02:37:26,730 --> 02:37:30,840
And so the ancestral mummies of every town,

3213
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:35,840
part of the being absorbed into the empire was, okay,

3214
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:38,910
your most important mummies are now gonna have

3215
02:37:38,910 --> 02:37:42,840
their own beautiful house in Cusco.

3216
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:46,440
But they would physically bring those mummies to Cusco

3217
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:49,170
to make now Cusco the spiritual heart

3218
02:37:49,170 --> 02:37:51,990
of their belief system.

3219
02:37:51,990 --> 02:37:53,790
- I mean, I could see how that would piss people off,

3220
02:37:53,790 --> 02:37:57,360
but it's also a pretty powerful way to say, like,

3221
02:37:57,360 --> 02:38:00,240
the ancestors that you idolize,

3222
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:03,810
that you respect are now in the capitol.

3223
02:38:03,810 --> 02:38:06,360
- They've been elevated, we didn't steal them.

3224
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:09,180
We have given them a new place of honor,

3225
02:38:09,180 --> 02:38:11,430
and you are welcome to come visit them all the time.

3226
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:13,230
And they did, they have these festivals

3227
02:38:13,230 --> 02:38:15,990
where everyone from all corners

3228
02:38:15,990 --> 02:38:18,660
of the Inca world would come to Cusco.

3229
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:22,143
- And which of the civilizations mummified people?

3230
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:25,710
- The Incas for sure mummified people.

3231
02:38:25,710 --> 02:38:27,700
And even did some of that kind of

3232
02:38:28,590 --> 02:38:32,520
like Egyptian esque taking out of organs

3233
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:33,660
and preparing the body.

3234
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:37,950
They'd put like straw inside the cavity and mummify them.

3235
02:38:37,950 --> 02:38:39,690
But the Maya didn't do it at all.

3236
02:38:39,690 --> 02:38:41,370
The Maya, in fact,

3237
02:38:41,370 --> 02:38:46,170
on purpose would flood tombs with water

3238
02:38:46,170 --> 02:38:51,090
so that the skin would float off the skeletons faster.

3239
02:38:51,090 --> 02:38:54,524
And then they'd get back in there, it was jungley.

3240
02:38:54,524 --> 02:38:56,790
So I think the bugs probably had part of it too.

3241
02:38:56,790 --> 02:39:00,060
But then they would get back in there to get the bones.

3242
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:02,220
They'd open it back up and take the bones out

3243
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:04,860
and paint them with red cinnabar.

3244
02:39:04,860 --> 02:39:08,040
The one that I was in in Copan, we had evidence

3245
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:10,770
that they had gone in there four different times,

3246
02:39:10,770 --> 02:39:13,800
and the last couple times they only took the skull out

3247
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:15,060
and repainted it

3248
02:39:15,060 --> 02:39:19,320
and then put it back in articulated on the skeleton.

3249
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:21,300
But they didn't mummify,

3250
02:39:21,300 --> 02:39:26,010
they on purpose would like grossly float the bodies.

3251
02:39:26,010 --> 02:39:28,560
So they could get the skin off faster

3252
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:29,970
and get to the bones.

3253
02:39:29,970 --> 02:39:31,260
- But would they keep the bones?

3254
02:39:31,260 --> 02:39:33,840
- Yeah, they'd keep the bones and they'd pull the bones out

3255
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:37,320
occasionally and do rituals to them

3256
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:39,690
or commune with them and then put them back in.

3257
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:41,520
- So there's a still a deep connection

3258
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:43,860
to the ancestors through the physical manifestation

3259
02:39:43,860 --> 02:39:45,660
of the ancestors then.

3260
02:39:45,660 --> 02:39:47,910
Whether mummified or bone.

3261
02:39:47,910 --> 02:39:49,320
- And to this day, like,

3262
02:39:49,320 --> 02:39:52,680
if you do an excavation here in the United States,

3263
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:54,720
Native American people don't like it.

3264
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:57,300
They don't like their graves, which is fine enough.

3265
02:39:57,300 --> 02:40:00,030
I wouldn't want somebody digging up my grandma either.

3266
02:40:00,030 --> 02:40:01,950
But the Maya, they love it.

3267
02:40:01,950 --> 02:40:05,820
And every Maya person, if we find a grave,

3268
02:40:05,820 --> 02:40:08,610
they're like, yeah, look at that, bones, cool.

3269
02:40:08,610 --> 02:40:09,453
Can I touch?

3270
02:40:10,710 --> 02:40:12,030
They're not spooked about it at all.

3271
02:40:12,030 --> 02:40:13,620
They think it's exciting.

3272
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:15,780
I one time helped out

3273
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:20,780
a physical anthropologist in town in Copan

3274
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:25,080
to get a osteology collection together of various animals.

3275
02:40:25,080 --> 02:40:29,580
So if we got bones from an excavation, we could see

3276
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:32,193
what kind of animal it was based on the collection.

3277
02:40:33,450 --> 02:40:35,910
And this family said, well,

3278
02:40:35,910 --> 02:40:38,580
our family dog died last year

3279
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:41,598
and buried him in the backyard, you could go dig him up.

3280
02:40:41,598 --> 02:40:44,580
And so we were like, okay, yeah, I mean, we do need a dog.

3281
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:45,900
We'll go dig up your dog.

3282
02:40:45,900 --> 02:40:48,510
And they were like, but the kids really want to help you.

3283
02:40:48,510 --> 02:40:51,870
So their kids came out, and this was like their puppy.

3284
02:40:51,870 --> 02:40:54,180
And it died, you know, less than a year ago when we got

3285
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:57,030
to it, that like, one of them just like grabbed up a bone

3286
02:40:57,030 --> 02:41:02,030
and he was like, "huesitos," like little bitty bones, yay.

3287
02:41:02,303 --> 02:41:05,220
Like what a weird attitude, that's your dead dog there.

3288
02:41:05,220 --> 02:41:06,180
But they just,

3289
02:41:06,180 --> 02:41:08,450
they have a different relationship with the dead.

3290
02:41:08,450 --> 02:41:10,950
- In some sense that's a beautiful attitude, right?

3291
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:12,229
- Yeah.

3292
02:41:12,229 --> 02:41:14,190
- Why pretend like we're not mortal

3293
02:41:14,190 --> 02:41:16,530
and there's not this is just the process of it,

3294
02:41:16,530 --> 02:41:18,103
and it's kind of,

3295
02:41:18,103 --> 02:41:21,570
as you say it now, it kind of would be cool.

3296
02:41:21,570 --> 02:41:23,340
- That's what Day of the Dead is all about.

3297
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:26,430
And I love Day of the Dead, you know,

3298
02:41:26,430 --> 02:41:28,980
Halloween's this creepy thing where they're all monsters,

3299
02:41:28,980 --> 02:41:31,110
but Day of the Dead is this beautiful time

3300
02:41:31,110 --> 02:41:33,030
where we remember our ancestors.

3301
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:36,990
I convinced my kids after the movie Coco came out.

3302
02:41:36,990 --> 02:41:38,520
Now we have an altar with all

3303
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:41,855
of our great grandparents on the altar.

3304
02:41:41,855 --> 02:41:43,800
And we talk about who they were and how they lived.

3305
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:46,500
And we put things on the altar that mattered in their life.

3306
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:48,420
And we remember them on that day.

3307
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:51,780
And it turned something that was a weird eat too much candy

3308
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:54,630
and wear a monster mask thing into something beautiful

3309
02:41:54,630 --> 02:41:57,630
where we discuss where we came from.

3310
02:41:57,630 --> 02:42:01,320
- I have to ask about the giant stones

3311
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:04,050
that Inca has been able to somehow move

3312
02:42:04,050 --> 02:42:05,940
and fit together perfectly.

3313
02:42:05,940 --> 02:42:07,500
Do you understand?

3314
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:11,553
Is it understood how they were able to do that so well?

3315
02:42:13,560 --> 02:42:15,793
- No. (laughs)

3316
02:42:17,910 --> 02:42:19,260
You know, the moving of it,

3317
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:21,780
I think that we have reasonable theories.

3318
02:42:21,780 --> 02:42:26,780
You know, there are ways to pivot large weights.

3319
02:42:28,170 --> 02:42:31,650
There's a great guy named Wally Wallington,

3320
02:42:31,650 --> 02:42:34,590
a retired contractor here in the US

3321
02:42:34,590 --> 02:42:38,610
who built Stonehenge in his backyard in Minnesota,

3322
02:42:38,610 --> 02:42:43,560
single handedly showing how you can move big stones.

3323
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:45,060
So you know, I think Wally's

3324
02:42:45,060 --> 02:42:46,808
already figured out how to move 'em.

3325
02:42:46,808 --> 02:42:51,720
It's the perfectly fit so carefully fit together

3326
02:42:51,720 --> 02:42:54,570
that you couldn't even put a dime in between the stones.

3327
02:42:54,570 --> 02:42:57,960
That's the one that I think still has people baffled.

3328
02:42:57,960 --> 02:43:01,980
The common archeological wisdom that you'd find out

3329
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:06,330
of a textbook is that they just kept pecking away

3330
02:43:06,330 --> 02:43:08,880
at it with hammer stones and setting them

3331
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:10,680
and resetting them until they were perfect.

3332
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:13,023
Which has to be bullshit.

3333
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:18,180
There is no way that they just were that meticulous.

3334
02:43:18,180 --> 02:43:20,670
I mean, everybody's got a hammer stone.

3335
02:43:20,670 --> 02:43:23,790
I personally think it's acids.

3336
02:43:23,790 --> 02:43:27,060
I think they melted them together.

3337
02:43:27,060 --> 02:43:30,750
And there are weird places when you really look at closely

3338
02:43:30,750 --> 02:43:32,820
to these stones, which I've done a number of times.

3339
02:43:32,820 --> 02:43:36,240
I'm going back next month to Machu Picchu

3340
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:40,020
and especially Cusco, I walk around in the alleys

3341
02:43:40,020 --> 02:43:41,910
where these 500, you know,

3342
02:43:41,910 --> 02:43:45,180
to a thousand year old walls are still there.

3343
02:43:45,180 --> 02:43:50,180
And you see, I see things like the crystals

3344
02:43:51,630 --> 02:43:56,630
in the andesite are almost stitched together

3345
02:43:57,660 --> 02:43:58,770
along the seams.

3346
02:43:58,770 --> 02:44:02,130
Like the andesite around it is melted

3347
02:44:02,130 --> 02:44:03,930
and the crystals haven't.

3348
02:44:03,930 --> 02:44:05,040
And there are other places

3349
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:09,210
where there are weird wipes on the wall.

3350
02:44:09,210 --> 02:44:12,840
Like it's just melted, like somebody like took a rag

3351
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:15,060
and wiped it while it was soft.

3352
02:44:15,060 --> 02:44:19,350
Lots of talk about soft stones turning hard too,

3353
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:20,730
I haven't been able to prove it.

3354
02:44:20,730 --> 02:44:22,440
This is one of these, you know,

3355
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:26,100
end of my archeological career chapters.

3356
02:44:26,100 --> 02:44:28,710
I'm either gonna prove myself wrong or prove it.

3357
02:44:28,710 --> 02:44:31,110
But I think they used acids.

3358
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:32,220
My dad's a chemist

3359
02:44:32,220 --> 02:44:34,290
and he told me a long time ago that there's no way,

3360
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:37,620
there's no naturally occurring acids.

3361
02:44:37,620 --> 02:44:40,170
But my current theory, actually,

3362
02:44:40,170 --> 02:44:44,730
I got the idea initially from the show Breaking Bad,

3363
02:44:44,730 --> 02:44:46,920
I don't know if you ever saw that show,

3364
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:48,480
but there's a point in which they're trying

3365
02:44:48,480 --> 02:44:50,370
to dissolve a body.

3366
02:44:50,370 --> 02:44:53,054
And they're using hydrofluoric acid

3367
02:44:53,054 --> 02:44:55,110
and it goes right through the ceiling.

3368
02:44:55,110 --> 02:44:57,397
That hydrofluoric acid is so fascinating.

3369
02:44:57,397 --> 02:44:59,730
You know, it won't go through plastic.

3370
02:44:59,730 --> 02:45:04,140
And you can also bring it in inert parts

3371
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:05,313
and then combine it.

3372
02:45:06,450 --> 02:45:11,450
The Inca made tons of jewelry out of fluoride.

3373
02:45:11,610 --> 02:45:14,220
Fluoride is big in the Andes.

3374
02:45:14,220 --> 02:45:18,300
And they also mined a lot of things for gold and silver.

3375
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:22,143
And the byproduct of that mining is sulfuric acid.

3376
02:45:22,980 --> 02:45:27,570
You put sulfuric acid and fluoride together

3377
02:45:27,570 --> 02:45:29,880
and it's hydrofluoric acid

3378
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:32,640
and that will burn through andesite or anything.

3379
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:36,270
And if you learned how to do it, you know, judiciously,

3380
02:45:36,270 --> 02:45:39,450
and then you didn't care whether, you know, servants lost

3381
02:45:39,450 --> 02:45:42,270
an arm or two, then you could actually use them

3382
02:45:42,270 --> 02:45:43,620
to fuse these together.

3383
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:46,470
And I think they're fused together.

3384
02:45:46,470 --> 02:45:48,810
I asked the city of Cusco

3385
02:45:48,810 --> 02:45:53,810
if I could take some core samples and they said,

3386
02:45:53,910 --> 02:45:56,820
go away, gringo, don't touch our walls.

3387
02:45:56,820 --> 02:45:57,930
So this actually,

3388
02:45:57,930 --> 02:46:00,690
this next time I'm gonna go try to talk

3389
02:46:00,690 --> 02:46:03,150
to the more Quechuan authorities

3390
02:46:03,150 --> 02:46:05,700
in a place called Ollantaytambo.

3391
02:46:05,700 --> 02:46:08,250
And maybe I can convince them,

3392
02:46:08,250 --> 02:46:11,190
but right now they just think I'm a weirdass gringo

3393
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:13,090
who wants to put holes in their walls.

3394
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:17,880
- That's a fascinating theory.

3395
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:21,750
And so how could you get to the bottom of that?

3396
02:46:21,750 --> 02:46:23,100
So getting core samples

3397
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:24,600
to see if there's some kind of trace?

3398
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:26,280
- Chemists I'm working with say

3399
02:46:26,280 --> 02:46:30,030
that if there was hydrofluoric acid in between these,

3400
02:46:30,030 --> 02:46:32,673
that a core sample right along a seam,

3401
02:46:32,673 --> 02:46:36,720
they they can separate out the elements in there

3402
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:39,600
and detect whether there was actually elements

3403
02:46:39,600 --> 02:46:40,740
of hydrofluoric acid.

3404
02:46:40,740 --> 02:46:42,690
I wanted to go straight to burning rocks,

3405
02:46:42,690 --> 02:46:45,870
but they were like, no, I mean, we already know that's true.

3406
02:46:45,870 --> 02:46:48,660
I mean, yeah, we can burn some rocks, but it would happen.

3407
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:49,710
That's just chemistry.

3408
02:46:49,710 --> 02:46:52,260
We gotta prove that it would happen in the walls.

3409
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:54,930
So go get us samples.

3410
02:46:54,930 --> 02:46:56,130
And that was before COVID

3411
02:46:56,130 --> 02:46:58,440
and all sorts of, you know how it is,

3412
02:46:58,440 --> 02:46:59,820
you probably are the same guy

3413
02:46:59,820 --> 02:47:02,790
where you've got a thousand ideas and you know,

3414
02:47:02,790 --> 02:47:05,310
the ones that are fruitful you run with

3415
02:47:05,310 --> 02:47:07,170
and the other ones you'll get back to.

3416
02:47:07,170 --> 02:47:08,397
- That would be fascinating if true.

3417
02:47:08,397 --> 02:47:10,710
And I hope you do show that it's true

3418
02:47:10,710 --> 02:47:13,290
or false, either one.

3419
02:47:13,290 --> 02:47:14,400
- I'll try to disprove it.

3420
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:18,600
- Disprove it, yeah, I wonder if we discount

3421
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:23,310
how much amazing stuff of collection of humans can do

3422
02:47:23,310 --> 02:47:28,083
'cause it just feels like if a large number of humans

3423
02:47:28,083 --> 02:47:31,890
are just working a little bit chipping away

3424
02:47:31,890 --> 02:47:35,190
at stuff at scale, they can do miraculous things.

3425
02:47:35,190 --> 02:47:37,860
So the question is, how can a large number

3426
02:47:37,860 --> 02:47:41,133
of humans be motivated to do a thing?

3427
02:47:43,110 --> 02:47:45,540
Because I just, when we think about like Stonehenge

3428
02:47:45,540 --> 02:47:49,260
or some very challenging architectural construction,

3429
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:50,820
we don't think about a large number

3430
02:47:50,820 --> 02:47:52,710
of humans working together.

3431
02:47:52,710 --> 02:47:56,100
- Well, you know, that large number of humans are motivated

3432
02:47:56,100 --> 02:48:00,450
to work together by a small number of administrators

3433
02:48:00,450 --> 02:48:04,290
who are dynamic and convincing in some way or another.

3434
02:48:04,290 --> 02:48:06,390
One of my favorite quotes is,

3435
02:48:06,390 --> 02:48:08,698
and I'm probably gonna misquote it here,

3436
02:48:08,698 --> 02:48:10,567
but I think it's Margaret Mead who said,

3437
02:48:10,567 --> 02:48:12,930
"never underestimate the power

3438
02:48:12,930 --> 02:48:16,560
of small groups working together.

3439
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:19,860
And the truth is that those are the only people

3440
02:48:19,860 --> 02:48:21,630
that have ever changed the world."

3441
02:48:21,630 --> 02:48:23,460
That small dedicated groups

3442
02:48:23,460 --> 02:48:25,860
of people are what change the world.

3443
02:48:25,860 --> 02:48:28,290
And they inspire big groups of people

3444
02:48:28,290 --> 02:48:30,603
to embrace their vision.

3445
02:48:31,740 --> 02:48:33,570
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3446
02:48:33,570 --> 02:48:36,240
I think we sometimes underestimate how much humans can do

3447
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:38,239
across time, across scale.

3448
02:48:38,239 --> 02:48:39,810
- And we are way less capable than we used to be.

3449
02:48:39,810 --> 02:48:42,510
I mean, the average human had all sorts of skills

3450
02:48:42,510 --> 02:48:46,096
that at least I personally do not, you know,

3451
02:48:46,096 --> 02:48:47,400
I'm wearing a shirt,

3452
02:48:47,400 --> 02:48:51,423
but I can't make a shirt, that's for somebody else to do.

3453
02:48:53,310 --> 02:48:55,533
- You've also lectured about,

3454
02:48:57,210 --> 02:48:59,310
which I really enjoyed about North America

3455
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:04,338
and also helped teach me that

3456
02:49:04,338 --> 02:49:06,938
there was a lot more complex societies going on here

3457
02:49:07,950 --> 02:49:10,380
for a long period of time.

3458
02:49:10,380 --> 02:49:12,870
So maybe can we start at the beginning?

3459
02:49:12,870 --> 02:49:15,420
Who were the early humans in North America?

3460
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:17,790
- Well, we go through that paleoindian

3461
02:49:17,790 --> 02:49:21,247
and archaic period for thousands of years.

3462
02:49:21,247 --> 02:49:24,543
You know, as we started this conversation, probably,

3463
02:49:24,543 --> 02:49:28,320
you know, 30,000 years as a conservative now

3464
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:31,230
humans first enter the Americas.

3465
02:49:31,230 --> 02:49:36,120
But the first cultures we get here are mound builders

3466
02:49:36,120 --> 02:49:39,060
around the Mississippi and to the east.

3467
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:41,850
And then also a totally separate group in the,

3468
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:43,950
what we call the American southwest now,

3469
02:49:43,950 --> 02:49:46,200
the four corners who will develop

3470
02:49:46,200 --> 02:49:50,580
into mostly the people we call the Pueblo people

3471
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:54,270
who are still there today, like Zuni and Hopi people.

3472
02:49:54,270 --> 02:49:56,760
So we've got these two clusters.

3473
02:49:56,760 --> 02:50:01,760
The very first major community in North America is

3474
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:04,560
in the most unlikely place.

3475
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:07,350
It's in northern Louisiana.

3476
02:50:07,350 --> 02:50:09,210
People think I'm crazy when I say this,

3477
02:50:09,210 --> 02:50:12,720
but there is a pyramid in northern Louisiana,

3478
02:50:12,720 --> 02:50:16,230
a big one at a site called Poverty Point

3479
02:50:16,230 --> 02:50:19,710
that is 3,500 years old.

3480
02:50:19,710 --> 02:50:24,360
So it's the same age as the pyramids in Egypt.

3481
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:26,070
And it is a giant thing

3482
02:50:26,070 --> 02:50:30,063
just poking out of the bayous of Louisiana.

3483
02:50:31,689 --> 02:50:34,920
And people don't believe me when I say it, but it's there.

3484
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:36,300
- The mound builders.

3485
02:50:36,300 --> 02:50:38,340
What was that society like in comparison

3486
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:40,470
to everything else we've been talking about in Mesoamerica?

3487
02:50:40,470 --> 02:50:42,810
- They evolved over thousands of years.

3488
02:50:42,810 --> 02:50:44,040
We call 'em mound builders.

3489
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:45,930
This is something I, you know, object to.

3490
02:50:45,930 --> 02:50:47,791
I think we should have a better,

3491
02:50:47,791 --> 02:50:52,791
the last version of them we call the Mississippians now,

3492
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:54,930
but generally speaking,

3493
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:57,030
we call all these guys mound builders.

3494
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:59,310
But what they built were pyramids.

3495
02:50:59,310 --> 02:51:01,590
They look like mounds now.

3496
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:03,420
And they didn't build them out of stone.

3497
02:51:03,420 --> 02:51:04,440
That's, you know, that's kind

3498
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:06,510
of our just inherent western bias.

3499
02:51:06,510 --> 02:51:10,200
Something that's built outta stone is sophisticated

3500
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:14,190
and something that's built outta dirt is rudimentary.

3501
02:51:14,190 --> 02:51:17,640
But in their full living form,

3502
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:19,110
they did have cores of dirt.

3503
02:51:19,110 --> 02:51:22,620
But then they also had kind of clay caps.

3504
02:51:22,620 --> 02:51:26,700
So they had terraces, they had whole complexes

3505
02:51:26,700 --> 02:51:28,440
of buildings up on top.

3506
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:30,543
There were kings that lived up there.

3507
02:51:31,496 --> 02:51:33,780
The biggest of the Mississippian cities,

3508
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:38,780
it's called Cahokia, and it's right outside of St. Louis.

3509
02:51:40,080 --> 02:51:41,910
And it was huge.

3510
02:51:41,910 --> 02:51:44,970
It had a population of 20,000 people

3511
02:51:44,970 --> 02:51:46,800
and pyramids all over the place.

3512
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:49,770
A huge palisade wall around it.

3513
02:51:49,770 --> 02:51:53,370
It was absolutely gigantic, a thriving metropolis.

3514
02:51:53,370 --> 02:51:58,020
And we in America have kind of a collective amnesia.

3515
02:51:58,020 --> 02:52:02,880
Like we never hear about these massive civilizations.

3516
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:05,730
Cahokia was the big first city,

3517
02:52:05,730 --> 02:52:08,550
but then it spread from the Mississippi

3518
02:52:08,550 --> 02:52:10,860
all the way to the Atlantic.

3519
02:52:10,860 --> 02:52:12,570
There were hundreds

3520
02:52:12,570 --> 02:52:16,410
and hundreds of these big cities that had, you know,

3521
02:52:16,410 --> 02:52:19,170
five to 10,000 people each.

3522
02:52:19,170 --> 02:52:21,000
- Were they their own thing

3523
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,520
or was there some kind of thread connecting all of them?

3524
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:26,610
- They had a unified religion and culture.

3525
02:52:26,610 --> 02:52:28,860
They were, again, not an empire.

3526
02:52:28,860 --> 02:52:30,780
So there were warring city states.

3527
02:52:30,780 --> 02:52:34,740
There were kind of territories that were owned

3528
02:52:34,740 --> 02:52:36,090
by big kings.

3529
02:52:36,090 --> 02:52:38,010
And then the cities around them were kind

3530
02:52:38,010 --> 02:52:40,890
of the subsidiary lords and kings.

3531
02:52:40,890 --> 02:52:45,300
And then one kingdom could either ally

3532
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:47,043
with a neighbor or have a fight.

3533
02:52:47,970 --> 02:52:52,920
So they were kind of countries I think for, yeah,

3534
02:52:52,920 --> 02:52:55,950
we could safely say there were different countries

3535
02:52:55,950 --> 02:53:00,420
within this patchwork that was Eastern United States.

3536
02:53:00,420 --> 02:53:03,420
And you know, it's so weird that we don't know this

3537
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:08,420
because it was clearly documented by the Spanish.

3538
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:11,460
I'm not talking about just archeology,

3539
02:53:11,460 --> 02:53:13,110
we find them in archeology now.

3540
02:53:13,110 --> 02:53:16,980
But Hernando de Soto landed in Florida

3541
02:53:16,980 --> 02:53:21,420
and went for three years from, he went up into the Carolinas

3542
02:53:21,420 --> 02:53:25,500
and over down into Alabama and Louisiana.

3543
02:53:25,500 --> 02:53:29,160
And he's the first one to see the Mississippi up there.

3544
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:33,450
But for three years he went through city after city,

3545
02:53:33,450 --> 02:53:36,780
after city, unfortunately decimating them,

3546
02:53:36,780 --> 02:53:39,720
eating all their corn, giving them diseases.

3547
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:43,500
But I mean, the documentation's clearly there.

3548
02:53:43,500 --> 02:53:46,380
He met collectively, millions

3549
02:53:46,380 --> 02:53:49,080
of people in a very sophisticated

3550
02:53:49,080 --> 02:53:51,960
and uniform civilization.

3551
02:53:51,960 --> 02:53:56,160
- So it was disease and stealing of resources.

3552
02:53:56,160 --> 02:54:00,300
But was there like explicit murdering going on?

3553
02:54:00,300 --> 02:54:01,440
- Unfortunately, yeah.

3554
02:54:01,440 --> 02:54:05,250
He was a murderer and a psycho and a liar.

3555
02:54:05,250 --> 02:54:10,250
He snowed them that he was some kind of deity,

3556
02:54:10,470 --> 02:54:12,840
actually learned a trick from the Inca

3557
02:54:12,840 --> 02:54:15,360
he was with Pizarro in his first run

3558
02:54:15,360 --> 02:54:19,110
and went back to Spain, was rich, had a wife, a castle.

3559
02:54:19,110 --> 02:54:22,110
Then he got bored and he decided to have a reign

3560
02:54:22,110 --> 02:54:26,070
of terror on Northern America for three years.

3561
02:54:26,070 --> 02:54:29,670
But he had people burned at the stake.

3562
02:54:29,670 --> 02:54:32,220
He had his dogs rip them apart.

3563
02:54:32,220 --> 02:54:34,830
He was very, very brutal.

3564
02:54:34,830 --> 02:54:38,640
He ruled that area through fear

3565
02:54:38,640 --> 02:54:42,630
and had absolutely no respect for anybody.

3566
02:54:42,630 --> 02:54:46,860
He made promises and broke them all the time.

3567
02:54:46,860 --> 02:54:50,250
He was really, he was a brutal man.

3568
02:54:50,250 --> 02:54:54,300
- So this whole period when Christopher Columbus came,

3569
02:54:54,300 --> 02:54:57,363
how did that change everything?

3570
02:54:58,200 --> 02:54:59,568
- Well, you know,

3571
02:54:59,568 --> 02:55:04,568
there's a great anthropological body of literature.

3572
02:55:04,620 --> 02:55:07,980
It's called the Colombian Exchange, based on Columbus.

3573
02:55:07,980 --> 02:55:09,840
But it's, you know, all this trade back

3574
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:13,440
and forth between the new world and the old world.

3575
02:55:13,440 --> 02:55:16,950
And the old world got just wonderful stuff.

3576
02:55:16,950 --> 02:55:18,930
All of a sudden their diet didn't suck.

3577
02:55:18,930 --> 02:55:21,660
All these vegetables came in.

3578
02:55:21,660 --> 02:55:25,830
The new world got herd animals.

3579
02:55:25,830 --> 02:55:29,370
It got pigs and cows and goats that it didn't have,

3580
02:55:29,370 --> 02:55:34,050
but it also got 13 infectious diseases.

3581
02:55:34,050 --> 02:55:36,840
Europe had had wave after wave

3582
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:39,630
and kind of had herd immunity on a lot of things.

3583
02:55:39,630 --> 02:55:41,730
But it didn't actually go away.

3584
02:55:41,730 --> 02:55:42,960
It just couldn't spread

3585
02:55:42,960 --> 02:55:45,450
like a wildfire through the community.

3586
02:55:45,450 --> 02:55:48,540
So when they arrived to the Americas,

3587
02:55:48,540 --> 02:55:51,330
all of a sudden these just a pile

3588
02:55:51,330 --> 02:55:53,010
of horrible diseases hit people.

3589
02:55:53,010 --> 02:55:56,580
I think in the first 20, 30 years there were people

3590
02:55:56,580 --> 02:56:01,580
who like had contracted multiple deadly diseases

3591
02:56:01,740 --> 02:56:03,690
at once and died of them.

3592
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:06,355
But the numbers, you know,

3593
02:56:06,355 --> 02:56:08,610
it's a shameful part of history.

3594
02:56:08,610 --> 02:56:11,727
And it wasn't something that Europe perpetrated on them,

3595
02:56:11,727 --> 02:56:13,470
but the medical science

3596
02:56:13,470 --> 02:56:16,170
at that time was still the four humors theory

3597
02:56:16,170 --> 02:56:18,630
that people were made of yellow bile,

3598
02:56:18,630 --> 02:56:21,300
black bile, blood, and phlegm.

3599
02:56:21,300 --> 02:56:23,250
And we did things like, well, you've gotta bleed him.

3600
02:56:23,250 --> 02:56:24,840
He'll feel better then.

3601
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:27,720
So we had no idea what an infectious disease was,

3602
02:56:27,720 --> 02:56:30,840
but the reality was that this hoard

3603
02:56:30,840 --> 02:56:32,640
of diseases hit everyone.

3604
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:36,810
And the numbers are now saying in the first 50 years

3605
02:56:36,810 --> 02:56:40,470
that 90% of everybody was dead.

3606
02:56:40,470 --> 02:56:44,460
And that the number of people has increased as well.

3607
02:56:44,460 --> 02:56:47,190
As far as our estimates,

3608
02:56:47,190 --> 02:56:51,130
we're thinking it's somewhere around 150 million people

3609
02:56:52,290 --> 02:56:54,540
and 90% of them died.

3610
02:56:54,540 --> 02:56:56,640
And with them all their knowledge

3611
02:56:56,640 --> 02:57:00,300
and just, I mean, imagine the moment where, you know,

3612
02:57:00,300 --> 02:57:03,660
who dies when things get bad, it's the young and the old.

3613
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:07,560
So all the knowledge keepers die suddenly,

3614
02:57:07,560 --> 02:57:09,990
the children die.

3615
02:57:09,990 --> 02:57:12,360
This next generation that's half taught

3616
02:57:12,360 --> 02:57:15,030
and now completely demoralized,

3617
02:57:15,030 --> 02:57:17,820
thinking that this is a spiritual attack,

3618
02:57:17,820 --> 02:57:19,740
that their gods hate them.

3619
02:57:19,740 --> 02:57:21,538
That the only way out of it is

3620
02:57:21,538 --> 02:57:25,140
to accept this new Christianity.

3621
02:57:25,140 --> 02:57:27,300
But they, you know, they don't wanna bring kids

3622
02:57:27,300 --> 02:57:29,100
into this world where everybody's dying.

3623
02:57:29,100 --> 02:57:31,800
And even if they do, they can't teach them

3624
02:57:31,800 --> 02:57:33,540
what the old people were gonna teach them

3625
02:57:33,540 --> 02:57:35,400
'cause the old people are gone

3626
02:57:35,400 --> 02:57:37,410
and didn't finish the transmission.

3627
02:57:37,410 --> 02:57:42,300
So in a single terrible moment in human history,

3628
02:57:42,300 --> 02:57:45,540
you know, the generation loses all their knowledge.

3629
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:46,650
So a lot of the things

3630
02:57:46,650 --> 02:57:49,713
that these people knew just blipped out.

3631
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:53,880
- But with that also just the wisdom

3632
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:57,813
of the entire civilizations.

3633
02:57:58,770 --> 02:58:03,450
- So much of what they knew was just lost at that moment.

3634
02:58:03,450 --> 02:58:05,880
We have the Maya who had those hieroglyphs

3635
02:58:05,880 --> 02:58:07,920
and that we've learned a lot from that.

3636
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:10,080
- Yeah, but not a significant integration

3637
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:12,483
of that wisdom into, so it wasn't,

3638
02:58:13,740 --> 02:58:15,480
when the Europeans came,

3639
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:17,670
it wasn't like the cultures were integrated.

3640
02:58:17,670 --> 02:58:22,170
It was a story of domination, of erasure, essentially.

3641
02:58:22,170 --> 02:58:23,040
- In North America,

3642
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:25,650
there's a new term in the literature that I like,

3643
02:58:25,650 --> 02:58:28,953
we call it the Mississippian shatter zone.

3644
02:58:30,418 --> 02:58:33,420
That Mississippian civilization was millions of people,

3645
02:58:33,420 --> 02:58:35,670
but they got spread out all over the place

3646
02:58:35,670 --> 02:58:36,990
over the next centuries.

3647
02:58:36,990 --> 02:58:39,750
And now we have this shatter zone

3648
02:58:39,750 --> 02:58:43,080
where we have ruins and the people

3649
02:58:43,080 --> 02:58:45,840
that were actually from those ruins are somewhere else

3650
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:47,670
on a reservation far away.

3651
02:58:47,670 --> 02:58:51,690
And, you know, I'm just about to talk to a Cherokee man

3652
02:58:51,690 --> 02:58:54,240
who listened to some of the things I had to say

3653
02:58:54,240 --> 02:58:56,880
and says all those Ho-Chunk things you were saying

3654
02:58:56,880 --> 02:58:59,010
from that whole Ho-Chunk culture.

3655
02:58:59,010 --> 02:59:01,230
My grandparents talk about this sort of thing too.

3656
02:59:01,230 --> 02:59:03,000
Can I talk to you by phone

3657
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:04,260
and tell you about these things?

3658
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:07,230
So we've got this shatter zone where, you know,

3659
02:59:07,230 --> 02:59:11,580
we're gonna try to put the puzzle back together.

3660
02:59:11,580 --> 02:59:15,390
Especially in terms of Mississippian religion.

3661
02:59:15,390 --> 02:59:17,880
I really think we're making headway in this generation.

3662
02:59:17,880 --> 02:59:22,880
And it's exciting to be part of piecing this old religion

3663
02:59:23,070 --> 02:59:25,140
and its mythology back together.

3664
02:59:25,140 --> 02:59:28,170
- Just since a lot of people kind of refer

3665
02:59:28,170 --> 02:59:29,250
to Christopher Columbus

3666
02:59:29,250 --> 02:59:31,100
as the person who discovered America.

3667
02:59:32,250 --> 02:59:35,310
I read that the Vikings reached North America

3668
02:59:35,310 --> 02:59:37,953
much earlier in 1000 BCE.

3669
02:59:40,110 --> 02:59:43,203
And why do you think they didn't expand and colonize?

3670
02:59:44,100 --> 02:59:45,900
- Because they got their ass kicked.

3671
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:49,310
- Okay, simple. - It's the truth.

3672
02:59:50,323 --> 02:59:52,650
It is absolutely true that the Vikings were here.

3673
02:59:52,650 --> 02:59:55,440
There's a great site in Nova Scotia

3674
02:59:55,440 --> 02:59:57,990
called L'Anse aux Meadows,

3675
02:59:57,990 --> 03:00:01,740
which definitely has what's left of a Viking colony.

3676
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:03,300
It was Leif Erik

3677
03:00:03,300 --> 03:00:05,940
and his father Erik the Red, who they got kind

3678
03:00:05,940 --> 03:00:07,980
of kicked outta Europe 'cause they apparently

3679
03:00:07,980 --> 03:00:10,200
couldn't stop murdering people.

3680
03:00:10,200 --> 03:00:11,940
And so they went to Greenland

3681
03:00:11,940 --> 03:00:15,450
and then kind of island hopped over to Canada.

3682
03:00:15,450 --> 03:00:16,680
But I think the culture

3683
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:20,010
that was in that area was named the Dorset.

3684
03:00:20,010 --> 03:00:22,380
But they would have nothing to do with the Vikings.

3685
03:00:22,380 --> 03:00:25,770
They attacked the Viking settlement every day

3686
03:00:25,770 --> 03:00:27,900
and did not give them an inch

3687
03:00:27,900 --> 03:00:30,270
until they decided it was just worthless.

3688
03:00:30,270 --> 03:00:33,510
And they left it, you know, the Vikings attacked Ireland

3689
03:00:33,510 --> 03:00:36,330
and they just found a bunch of, you know,

3690
03:00:36,330 --> 03:00:39,360
monasteries full of gold with a bunch of guys going,

3691
03:00:39,360 --> 03:00:41,010
we're men of God, we don't fight.

3692
03:00:41,010 --> 03:00:44,010
And the Vikings were like, this is great, that's great.

3693
03:00:44,010 --> 03:00:46,950
This'll be easy then we'll just loot all these Easter eggs.

3694
03:00:46,950 --> 03:00:51,120
But the Native Americans in Canada were like not having it.

3695
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:52,530
They kicked their ass, in fact,

3696
03:00:52,530 --> 03:00:57,060
Leif Erikson's brother Thor died there.

3697
03:00:57,060 --> 03:00:59,040
The natives killed him.

3698
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:02,250
He was supposed to be in charge of expanding the settlement,

3699
03:01:02,250 --> 03:01:04,110
but they just killed him.

3700
03:01:04,110 --> 03:01:07,290
- So a lot of the Native American cultures were also,

3701
03:01:07,290 --> 03:01:11,100
I mean, they're sophisticated warring cultures also.

3702
03:01:11,100 --> 03:01:14,460
- Yes, they fought, especially the Mississippians,

3703
03:01:14,460 --> 03:01:15,720
boy, they were tough.

3704
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:19,830
And so were, you know, the Five Nations, the Mohawk,

3705
03:01:19,830 --> 03:01:24,600
the Huron, the ones that kicked the Vikings' ass up there.

3706
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:28,170
They were probably Algonquian speakers,

3707
03:01:28,170 --> 03:01:29,700
but they were connected like, you know,

3708
03:01:29,700 --> 03:01:32,730
just above the Great Lakes.

3709
03:01:32,730 --> 03:01:35,700
But they were all very tough people.

3710
03:01:35,700 --> 03:01:39,720
- When you think about the Spaniards and the Portuguese

3711
03:01:39,720 --> 03:01:42,723
and over a hundred million people that were killed,

3712
03:01:44,370 --> 03:01:46,770
do you see that as a tragedy of history

3713
03:01:46,770 --> 03:01:49,080
or is it just the way of history?

3714
03:01:49,080 --> 03:01:54,080
- I think that the epidemics, I consider it a tragedy

3715
03:01:54,510 --> 03:01:55,857
that did not have to happen.

3716
03:01:55,857 --> 03:01:58,230
And that was not, you know, that was not a fair fight.

3717
03:01:58,230 --> 03:01:59,760
Nobody knew what to do about it.

3718
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:04,760
There was just a tragic, perfect storm of events.

3719
03:02:05,490 --> 03:02:07,590
It was not, you know, I think that the Spanish

3720
03:02:07,590 --> 03:02:10,980
and the Portuguese get unfairly maligned

3721
03:02:10,980 --> 03:02:13,650
in what's been called the black legend

3722
03:02:13,650 --> 03:02:16,650
that they just marched into America and murdered everyone.

3723
03:02:16,650 --> 03:02:18,420
That's not the fact.

3724
03:02:18,420 --> 03:02:20,670
It was the diseases that murdered everyone.

3725
03:02:20,670 --> 03:02:24,643
In fact, there was a really poignant story I read

3726
03:02:26,610 --> 03:02:29,610
of a Spanish priest in the Amazon

3727
03:02:29,610 --> 03:02:32,460
in the Brazilian northern part of the Amazon

3728
03:02:32,460 --> 03:02:35,850
where he made this utopian community

3729
03:02:35,850 --> 03:02:38,370
and he was bringing people in that were getting sick.

3730
03:02:38,370 --> 03:02:41,010
And he wrote, you know, I'm baptizing everyone,

3731
03:02:41,010 --> 03:02:44,100
you know, I have baptized 10,000 people a day,

3732
03:02:44,100 --> 03:02:46,290
and yet God's still killing them.

3733
03:02:46,290 --> 03:02:48,060
What, why is he doing this to them?

3734
03:02:48,060 --> 03:02:51,240
They're doing everything that I ask them to do.

3735
03:02:51,240 --> 03:02:54,060
They are submitting to the will of God.

3736
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:56,580
But this guy doesn't realize that the same bowl

3737
03:02:56,580 --> 03:02:59,160
of holy water that he's baptizing them in,

3738
03:02:59,160 --> 03:03:01,980
he's just wiping the disease on everybody's faces.

3739
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:05,040
He's accelerating it when he doesn't even realize.

3740
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:07,990
He thinks he's saving them, but he's actually killing them.

3741
03:03:10,920 --> 03:03:12,983
- Yeah. - That's a tragedy.

3742
03:03:12,983 --> 03:03:14,490
You know, that's not just

3743
03:03:14,490 --> 03:03:16,740
like spoils go to the victor stuff.

3744
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:19,680
That's just straight up tragedy.

3745
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:22,533
- Yeah, yeah, but that one is hard to know

3746
03:03:22,533 --> 03:03:24,300
what to do with like black death.

3747
03:03:24,300 --> 03:03:27,120
It's, I mean, infections,

3748
03:03:27,120 --> 03:03:29,700
they don't operate on normal human terms, right.

3749
03:03:29,700 --> 03:03:34,143
They just go through entire populations.

3750
03:03:35,130 --> 03:03:37,440
Back to wild ideas.

3751
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:39,753
- All right, just my style.

3752
03:03:41,640 --> 03:03:42,840
- I mean, we didn't really talk

3753
03:03:42,840 --> 03:03:45,270
about how life originated on Earth

3754
03:03:45,270 --> 03:03:49,623
or how humans have evolved.

3755
03:03:50,760 --> 03:03:53,850
And we did talk about that there could be just a lot

3756
03:03:53,850 --> 03:03:56,750
of stuff in ancient history we haven't even uncovered yet.

3757
03:03:58,800 --> 03:04:00,100
Do you think it's possible

3758
03:04:01,082 --> 03:04:03,000
that other intelligent civilizations

3759
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:06,843
from outside of Earth, aliens ever visited?

3760
03:04:07,740 --> 03:04:10,890
- You had me right until the ever visited thing.

3761
03:04:10,890 --> 03:04:13,200
That one I'm not entirely sure about.

3762
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:15,330
I'm not sure whether we have any,

3763
03:04:15,330 --> 03:04:20,040
we certainly have no archeological proof that I would cite

3764
03:04:20,040 --> 03:04:23,133
or contemplate as the evidence of such.

3765
03:04:24,510 --> 03:04:28,050
But, you know, the guys that discovered DNA,

3766
03:04:28,050 --> 03:04:29,970
Watson and Crick,

3767
03:04:29,970 --> 03:04:34,650
Watson, who actually habitually used hallucinogens

3768
03:04:34,650 --> 03:04:38,970
to invigorate his thinking, he said that he thought

3769
03:04:38,970 --> 03:04:43,860
that DNA on this planet was way too complex

3770
03:04:43,860 --> 03:04:46,440
to have developed over the time period

3771
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:48,150
that it had at its disposal.

3772
03:04:48,150 --> 03:04:50,040
And that his guess was

3773
03:04:50,040 --> 03:04:55,040
that our DNA was somehow seeded from outside of our planet

3774
03:04:55,803 --> 03:04:57,840
and, you know, take that for what it is.

3775
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:59,400
But the guy who we respect

3776
03:04:59,400 --> 03:05:02,193
on many other levels also said that.

3777
03:05:03,780 --> 03:05:06,230
So that's interesting, but in terms of, you know,

3778
03:05:07,440 --> 03:05:09,870
aliens visiting us, I don't know,

3779
03:05:09,870 --> 03:05:13,110
it does smack of a kind of human hubris

3780
03:05:13,110 --> 03:05:14,940
that we think we're important enough

3781
03:05:14,940 --> 03:05:18,990
for some advanced species to give a shit about us.

3782
03:05:18,990 --> 03:05:21,630
Statistically speaking, the universe is way too big.

3783
03:05:21,630 --> 03:05:24,120
We can't be the only sentient beings.

3784
03:05:24,120 --> 03:05:25,830
There's gotta be somebody else out there

3785
03:05:25,830 --> 03:05:29,070
whether they care about us, that's a question.

3786
03:05:29,070 --> 03:05:32,400
I've been on "Ancient Aliens" a number of times.

3787
03:05:32,400 --> 03:05:34,290
I show up and, you know, I'm an educator.

3788
03:05:34,290 --> 03:05:36,270
I mean, refusing to be part

3789
03:05:36,270 --> 03:05:38,820
of the conversation's an immediate fail in my book.

3790
03:05:40,140 --> 03:05:43,440
But there was one time where they asked me at the end,

3791
03:05:43,440 --> 03:05:48,420
you know, do you have anything else that you wanna say?

3792
03:05:48,420 --> 03:05:50,190
And I said, well, you know, yeah.

3793
03:05:50,190 --> 03:05:54,057
Y'all's premise is that aliens came down a long time ago

3794
03:05:54,057 --> 03:05:57,690
and they gave humanity these wonderful gifts of, you know,

3795
03:05:57,690 --> 03:06:01,350
science and medicine, engineering, all these things.

3796
03:06:01,350 --> 03:06:04,067
Today we also have a lot of stories

3797
03:06:06,450 --> 03:06:07,800
of the aliens coming down,

3798
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:11,010
but now all they're doing is mutilating cows

3799
03:06:11,010 --> 03:06:13,050
and sodomizing rednecks.

3800
03:06:13,050 --> 03:06:16,263
Like whatever we did, we super pissed them off, apparently.

3801
03:06:18,120 --> 03:06:21,183
- The quality of the gifts has decreased rapidly.

3802
03:06:23,100 --> 03:06:26,280
What it's an interesting thought you've mentioned.

3803
03:06:26,280 --> 03:06:29,940
What archeologically would you have to see

3804
03:06:29,940 --> 03:06:31,690
to be like, this might be an alien?

3805
03:06:33,210 --> 03:06:35,910
- A technology that doesn't belong there,

3806
03:06:35,910 --> 03:06:37,500
first and foremost.

3807
03:06:37,500 --> 03:06:39,090
I mean, you know, we gotta,

3808
03:06:39,090 --> 03:06:43,500
if we just run with the premise that somebody was capable

3809
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:45,570
of making a vehicle

3810
03:06:45,570 --> 03:06:48,483
that could get them from somewhere far away to here,

3811
03:06:49,320 --> 03:06:52,620
that was almost certainly mechanical.

3812
03:06:52,620 --> 03:06:55,110
Now, you know, I love the aliens thing where, you know,

3813
03:06:55,110 --> 03:06:58,260
biomechanical is something that certainly could be

3814
03:06:58,260 --> 03:07:01,710
and that would, you know, that would disintegrate.

3815
03:07:01,710 --> 03:07:02,850
We wouldn't see that at all.

3816
03:07:02,850 --> 03:07:06,900
But I would expect some kind of technology

3817
03:07:06,900 --> 03:07:09,450
that showed up out of the blue and changed things.

3818
03:07:09,450 --> 03:07:10,743
That would be something.

3819
03:07:11,670 --> 03:07:15,300
But I would think, you know, mechanical.

3820
03:07:15,300 --> 03:07:18,210
Or, you know, a substance that's not from here.

3821
03:07:18,210 --> 03:07:20,520
- But of course we would only see the results

3822
03:07:20,520 --> 03:07:22,290
of that mechanical,

3823
03:07:22,290 --> 03:07:24,420
you mean like literally a mechanical thing?

3824
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:26,733
- Right, some sort of thing like that.

3825
03:07:28,680 --> 03:07:30,540
The typical thing people say is like, you know,

3826
03:07:30,540 --> 03:07:33,540
how did they move these giant stones, right?

3827
03:07:33,540 --> 03:07:35,250
But, you know, just look

3828
03:07:35,250 --> 03:07:37,020
at that on the face for a second.

3829
03:07:37,020 --> 03:07:41,640
Aliens come from across the universe to meet humans

3830
03:07:41,640 --> 03:07:45,627
and the thing they tell them is how to move rocks.

3831
03:07:45,627 --> 03:07:47,550
Are you fucking kidding me?

3832
03:07:47,550 --> 03:07:49,980
I mean, you know, like give them antibiotics

3833
03:07:49,980 --> 03:07:51,744
or a combustion engine or something.

3834
03:07:51,744 --> 03:07:53,760
They came across the universe

3835
03:07:53,760 --> 03:07:56,760
and they showed 'em how to move big rocks.

3836
03:07:56,760 --> 03:07:58,713
I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

3837
03:08:00,430 --> 03:08:02,183
Yeah, that just doesn't make any sense.

3838
03:08:03,240 --> 03:08:05,240
- What do you think Earth will look like

3839
03:08:06,360 --> 03:08:07,833
10,000 years from now?

3840
03:08:09,240 --> 03:08:11,013
- That's a interesting question.

3841
03:08:12,780 --> 03:08:15,390
I think it will be a lot more automated

3842
03:08:15,390 --> 03:08:18,840
or it'll be a smoldering pile.

3843
03:08:18,840 --> 03:08:21,330
I mean, there is a possibility we could end ourselves.

3844
03:08:21,330 --> 03:08:22,770
There's always that possibility

3845
03:08:22,770 --> 03:08:27,770
that we've really opened Pandora's box in some regards.

3846
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:31,830
I did listen to one of your podcast guests

3847
03:08:31,830 --> 03:08:35,160
with the what would happen in the case of nuclear war.

3848
03:08:35,160 --> 03:08:36,756
That was chilling.

3849
03:08:36,756 --> 03:08:38,820
Her opinion was certainly we would burn everything

3850
03:08:38,820 --> 03:08:42,030
to a crisp within minutes apparently.

3851
03:08:42,030 --> 03:08:44,550
So we have that capacity, that's scary.

3852
03:08:44,550 --> 03:08:48,210
That's a possible future for us, but I'm an optimist.

3853
03:08:48,210 --> 03:08:49,380
You know, I'd like to think

3854
03:08:49,380 --> 03:08:51,450
that guys like you are gonna make friendly robots

3855
03:08:51,450 --> 03:08:52,600
who make my job better.

3856
03:08:54,990 --> 03:08:58,290
- But a thousand, 10,000 years is a long time

3857
03:08:58,290 --> 03:09:02,460
and technology is improving

3858
03:09:02,460 --> 03:09:04,740
and becoming more advanced rapidly,

3859
03:09:04,740 --> 03:09:09,740
and the rate of that improvement is increasing evermore.

3860
03:09:09,786 --> 03:09:12,300
- That's the part that frightens me actually.

3861
03:09:12,300 --> 03:09:13,830
I dunno, does that frighten you?

3862
03:09:13,830 --> 03:09:16,020
- Yeah, it's terrifying. - You know,

3863
03:09:16,020 --> 03:09:18,450
I heard somebody say, I forget who it was,

3864
03:09:18,450 --> 03:09:23,070
but, you know, systems of any kind,

3865
03:09:23,070 --> 03:09:27,870
human systems, biological systems can be put on a graph

3866
03:09:27,870 --> 03:09:31,020
that's change over time.

3867
03:09:31,020 --> 03:09:33,060
And any graph

3868
03:09:33,060 --> 03:09:37,350
that the change is way faster than the time.

3869
03:09:37,350 --> 03:09:41,100
And the line starts going straight up.

3870
03:09:41,100 --> 03:09:44,070
That is a system in crisis

3871
03:09:44,070 --> 03:09:46,320
in almost any biological system

3872
03:09:46,320 --> 03:09:50,850
that has that fast change over that little a time.

3873
03:09:50,850 --> 03:09:54,240
Any other thing, you'd describe it as a crisis.

3874
03:09:54,240 --> 03:09:55,620
When you apply that chart

3875
03:09:55,620 --> 03:09:59,520
to technologies change, it's a crisis.

3876
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:01,440
- From that perspective, absolutely.

3877
03:10:01,440 --> 03:10:05,220
But I also have a faith in human ingenuity

3878
03:10:05,220 --> 03:10:07,270
that we humans like to create

3879
03:10:08,400 --> 03:10:10,950
a really difficult situation

3880
03:10:10,950 --> 03:10:13,530
and then come up with ways to get out

3881
03:10:13,530 --> 03:10:14,940
of that difficult situation.

3882
03:10:14,940 --> 03:10:19,170
And in so doing, innovate and create a lot of awesome stuff

3883
03:10:19,170 --> 03:10:21,030
and sometimes cause a lot of suffering,

3884
03:10:21,030 --> 03:10:26,030
but on the whole, on average, make a better world.

3885
03:10:26,040 --> 03:10:30,750
But yeah, you know, like with nuclear weapons,

3886
03:10:30,750 --> 03:10:34,950
the bad stuff might actually lead to the death of everybody.

3887
03:10:34,950 --> 03:10:37,710
- I guess there's always that chance.

3888
03:10:37,710 --> 03:10:39,120
But I am an optimist.

3889
03:10:39,120 --> 03:10:40,710
You know, I think you're an optimist too.

3890
03:10:40,710 --> 03:10:43,320
I think exactly as you just said,

3891
03:10:43,320 --> 03:10:46,110
I think that the greatest capacity

3892
03:10:46,110 --> 03:10:48,480
of humans is our ability to innovate.

3893
03:10:48,480 --> 03:10:50,760
And we are never more innovative

3894
03:10:50,760 --> 03:10:53,130
than when we're under distress.

3895
03:10:53,130 --> 03:10:56,040
I think that a lot of the developments

3896
03:10:56,040 --> 03:11:00,033
of humans over the last thousands of years have been about,

3897
03:11:00,882 --> 03:11:02,730
you know, we didn't change the world

3898
03:11:02,730 --> 03:11:05,760
when we were comfortable, it was when we were in crisis.

3899
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:09,600
Mother necessity is the mother of invention.

3900
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:11,250
And I think we'll be all right.

3901
03:11:11,250 --> 03:11:15,150
I think that this impending climate crisis

3902
03:11:15,150 --> 03:11:17,550
is real and happening.

3903
03:11:17,550 --> 03:11:19,500
I actually personally think

3904
03:11:19,500 --> 03:11:21,840
that I'm gonna answer a question

3905
03:11:21,840 --> 03:11:23,240
that you didn't even ask me.

3906
03:11:25,470 --> 03:11:27,510
I think we're wasting our time

3907
03:11:27,510 --> 03:11:29,940
thinking that we can reverse this.

3908
03:11:29,940 --> 03:11:34,530
We're delusional, I'm all for electric cars

3909
03:11:34,530 --> 03:11:37,890
and, you know, being good stewards of the environment,

3910
03:11:37,890 --> 03:11:40,500
but we are wasting our time

3911
03:11:40,500 --> 03:11:45,330
not technologically adapting to what's about to happen.

3912
03:11:45,330 --> 03:11:48,270
We're spending too much time pretending, you know,

3913
03:11:48,270 --> 03:11:49,650
the average American thinks

3914
03:11:49,650 --> 03:11:52,200
if we all just drive electric cars, we'll be okay.

3915
03:11:52,200 --> 03:11:54,930
That's bullshit, that's not gonna happen.

3916
03:11:54,930 --> 03:11:58,770
We need to start making technologies that desalinize water,

3917
03:11:58,770 --> 03:12:01,920
that, you know, a host of things that we need

3918
03:12:01,920 --> 03:12:05,400
to use our technological capacity to accept it

3919
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:08,760
and adapt instead of Pollyanna thinking

3920
03:12:08,760 --> 03:12:10,980
we can make it go away.

3921
03:12:10,980 --> 03:12:15,780
- Yeah, yeah, kind of accept that the world will change

3922
03:12:15,780 --> 03:12:18,490
and a lot of big problems will arise

3923
03:12:19,890 --> 03:12:22,680
and just develop technology that addresses them.

3924
03:12:22,680 --> 03:12:24,240
- I think you have some guys

3925
03:12:24,240 --> 03:12:25,650
that have their finger on the pulse there.

3926
03:12:25,650 --> 03:12:26,490
We need to start thinking

3927
03:12:26,490 --> 03:12:27,810
about how we're gonna survive this.

3928
03:12:27,810 --> 03:12:30,829
Not that we're gonna make it go away.

3929
03:12:30,829 --> 03:12:32,333
- And not just survive, thrive.

3930
03:12:33,210 --> 03:12:35,490
Again, we're pretty innovative in that regard,

3931
03:12:35,490 --> 03:12:38,520
but if some catastrophic thing happens

3932
03:12:38,520 --> 03:12:40,763
or we just leave this planet,

3933
03:12:40,763 --> 03:12:44,700
what do you think would be found

3934
03:12:44,700 --> 03:12:48,930
by aforementioned alien civilizations

3935
03:12:48,930 --> 03:12:49,763
when they visit.

3936
03:12:49,763 --> 03:12:51,900
The anthropologist, the grad student anthropologist

3937
03:12:51,900 --> 03:12:54,480
that visit Earth and study,

3938
03:12:54,480 --> 03:12:57,630
how much of what we now have

3939
03:12:57,630 --> 03:13:00,450
and love and think of as human civilization

3940
03:13:00,450 --> 03:13:02,100
will be lost, do you think?

3941
03:13:02,100 --> 03:13:05,130
- Well, you know, time moves on

3942
03:13:05,130 --> 03:13:07,920
and things that are perishable perish.

3943
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:11,400
So, you know, you didn't put a time element in there,

3944
03:13:11,400 --> 03:13:13,320
but I would say that, you know,

3945
03:13:13,320 --> 03:13:15,690
everything that can perish will,

3946
03:13:15,690 --> 03:13:18,630
and whoever shows up here will be stuck

3947
03:13:18,630 --> 03:13:20,760
with only the things that didn't perish.

3948
03:13:20,760 --> 03:13:24,030
So we'll have, you know, buildings, plaques,

3949
03:13:24,030 --> 03:13:25,380
but they won't have any books.

3950
03:13:25,380 --> 03:13:28,355
They won't have any, you know, billboards.

3951
03:13:28,355 --> 03:13:32,160
They'll have the incomplete record I have.

3952
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:36,960
I one time did a talk in Sioux Falls

3953
03:13:38,040 --> 03:13:40,860
and I said, you know, I drove in here

3954
03:13:40,860 --> 03:13:45,480
and there was a big obelisk in front of the town

3955
03:13:45,480 --> 03:13:50,480
and everywhere I go, I see the names Lewis and Clark.

3956
03:13:50,490 --> 03:13:52,110
And a thousand years from now,

3957
03:13:52,110 --> 03:13:54,690
if I was an archeologist investigating this place,

3958
03:13:54,690 --> 03:13:57,450
I would think that it was founded by the Egyptians

3959
03:13:57,450 --> 03:14:01,260
and their kings were named Lewis and Clark.

3960
03:14:01,260 --> 03:14:02,670
But the truth is, you know,

3961
03:14:02,670 --> 03:14:05,610
Lewis and Clark stayed one night here,

3962
03:14:05,610 --> 03:14:07,200
but it's just a big deal.

3963
03:14:07,200 --> 03:14:11,310
So I would be so wrong about what I thought about your town

3964
03:14:11,310 --> 03:14:13,200
based on what preserved.

3965
03:14:13,200 --> 03:14:15,720
- That's so beautiful as a thought experiment.

3966
03:14:15,720 --> 03:14:19,729
Like what would archeologists be really wrong about

3967
03:14:19,729 --> 03:14:22,740
and what would they could possibly be right about.

3968
03:14:22,740 --> 03:14:25,830
- Washington DC was clearly made by a combination

3969
03:14:25,830 --> 03:14:28,650
of the Egyptians and the Greeks and the Romans,

3970
03:14:28,650 --> 03:14:30,850
because that's what all the architecture is.

3971
03:14:32,070 --> 03:14:33,240
- Yeah, and would they be able

3972
03:14:33,240 --> 03:14:35,880
to reconstruct the important empires,

3973
03:14:35,880 --> 03:14:40,653
the powerful empires and the warring empires.

3974
03:14:41,580 --> 03:14:42,413
- For that matter,

3975
03:14:42,413 --> 03:14:44,910
have me and my colleagues done that at all?

3976
03:14:44,910 --> 03:14:47,910
I'm almost certain that the Maya would just gut laugh

3977
03:14:47,910 --> 03:14:50,700
at what I think I know what they were.

3978
03:14:50,700 --> 03:14:53,490
- I wonder, do you ever think about like what

3979
03:14:53,490 --> 03:14:56,730
we just as a human civilization are wrong about the most,

3980
03:14:56,730 --> 03:15:00,780
like mainstream archeology, just like a suspicion,

3981
03:15:00,780 --> 03:15:03,183
what could we get completely wrong?

3982
03:15:05,400 --> 03:15:07,830
Well, one way to get something wrong is

3983
03:15:07,830 --> 03:15:09,570
totally like lost civilization.

3984
03:15:09,570 --> 03:15:12,870
Like an obviously gigantic civilization that was there

3985
03:15:12,870 --> 03:15:15,090
along with the Maya or something like this

3986
03:15:15,090 --> 03:15:17,340
in the 10,000 years ago.

3987
03:15:17,340 --> 03:15:19,233
- There's certainly that there could be things

3988
03:15:19,233 --> 03:15:21,060
that were either wiped away

3989
03:15:21,060 --> 03:15:22,860
or still hiding under the oceans

3990
03:15:22,860 --> 03:15:26,430
that would completely change the way we think about things.

3991
03:15:26,430 --> 03:15:27,810
- And everybody knew they existed

3992
03:15:27,810 --> 03:15:29,410
and everybody interact with 'em.

3993
03:15:30,681 --> 03:15:32,130
- I think that's our estimation

3994
03:15:32,130 --> 03:15:35,373
of their motivations that we're probably most wrong on.

3995
03:15:36,420 --> 03:15:38,940
My teacher Sheila, a long time ago said,

3996
03:15:38,940 --> 03:15:41,010
you know, I've come up with all sorts of theories.

3997
03:15:41,010 --> 03:15:42,900
I was always thinking about stuff and she looked at me

3998
03:15:42,900 --> 03:15:46,230
and she said, if you don't stop thinking

3999
03:15:46,230 --> 03:15:48,960
like a Western European

4000
03:15:48,960 --> 03:15:51,720
and start trying to put yourself in the mindset

4001
03:15:51,720 --> 03:15:56,280
of these people, you will never understand any of it.

4002
03:15:56,280 --> 03:15:58,500
Which I've always taken to heart, I mean, I really do.

4003
03:15:58,500 --> 03:16:01,710
When I approach these things, I try to step out

4004
03:16:01,710 --> 03:16:05,130
of my cultural assumptions, try to think

4005
03:16:05,130 --> 03:16:07,770
like they would think as the best I could.

4006
03:16:07,770 --> 03:16:08,880
And it's very different.

4007
03:16:08,880 --> 03:16:12,270
I mean this whole, you know, the Maya are cyclical,

4008
03:16:12,270 --> 03:16:14,160
you know, the whole sacrifice,

4009
03:16:14,160 --> 03:16:16,080
were so, you know, obsessed with that.

4010
03:16:16,080 --> 03:16:20,550
But, you know, that was a austere actual sacrifice

4011
03:16:20,550 --> 03:16:21,383
on their part.

4012
03:16:21,383 --> 03:16:23,910
They weren't just, you know, hey, let's all get together

4013
03:16:23,910 --> 03:16:25,890
and kill that guy that's pissing us off.

4014
03:16:25,890 --> 03:16:29,550
I mean, they were like, you know, giving the best of them.

4015
03:16:29,550 --> 03:16:32,790
It was a different mentality, this was not brutal.

4016
03:16:32,790 --> 03:16:34,170
This was a, you know,

4017
03:16:34,170 --> 03:16:37,473
bonafide sacrifice on their part, a loss.

4018
03:16:38,490 --> 03:16:40,320
- Plus the whole mystery of the puppy

4019
03:16:40,320 --> 03:16:43,660
that eventually starts having sex with this.

4020
03:16:43,660 --> 03:16:45,900
- I tell you, that one, I'm gonna unweave that one,

4021
03:16:45,900 --> 03:16:46,923
one of these days.

4022
03:16:48,630 --> 03:16:51,300
- Now that puppy appeared on pottery.

4023
03:16:51,300 --> 03:16:53,117
- All over pottery.

4024
03:16:53,117 --> 03:16:56,010
He's everywhere, I gotta write this book.

4025
03:16:56,010 --> 03:16:57,390
This next year is the year

4026
03:16:57,390 --> 03:16:59,240
I'm gonna write my fanged deity book.

4027
03:17:00,083 --> 03:17:02,190
And I will have a whole chapter

4028
03:17:02,190 --> 03:17:03,993
dedicated to the puppy.

4029
03:17:04,860 --> 03:17:06,360
- Mystery solved, I mean,

4030
03:17:06,360 --> 03:17:08,940
it could just be the birth of memes, of humor.

4031
03:17:08,940 --> 03:17:11,610
I don't know, I mean, again, humor, you don't know

4032
03:17:11,610 --> 03:17:14,400
what the nature of their humor, of what their jokes are.

4033
03:17:14,400 --> 03:17:17,160
- Oh, that's a neat one too, and that's so human.

4034
03:17:17,160 --> 03:17:20,430
You know, I'll tell you a little like side story here

4035
03:17:20,430 --> 03:17:24,660
that when I worked with the Maya people in Palenque,

4036
03:17:24,660 --> 03:17:28,230
I spent three years making this map of the city

4037
03:17:28,230 --> 03:17:30,390
and hiking through the jungle every day.

4038
03:17:30,390 --> 03:17:34,040
And they would talk to each other in their own language.

4039
03:17:34,040 --> 03:17:37,410
It was tseltal was the group I was working with.

4040
03:17:37,410 --> 03:17:39,990
But I noticed after a while, they were big jokers.

4041
03:17:39,990 --> 03:17:42,240
They loved to make jokes and they would laugh at jokes,

4042
03:17:42,240 --> 03:17:45,660
but then they would also, one of them would say something

4043
03:17:45,660 --> 03:17:48,690
and the other ones would go, hoo hoo.

4044
03:17:48,690 --> 03:17:50,280
And I eventually asked, you know, what is that?

4045
03:17:50,280 --> 03:17:52,530
Why do you guys always make that hoo hoo noise?

4046
03:17:52,530 --> 03:17:56,940
And he said, that's 'cause he made a really smart pun.

4047
03:17:56,940 --> 03:17:59,790
It was like he said three different things at once.

4048
03:17:59,790 --> 03:18:02,370
It was a turn of phrase that was smart.

4049
03:18:02,370 --> 03:18:03,743
And they didn't make laughs at that.

4050
03:18:03,743 --> 03:18:05,880
It was, they had a noise

4051
03:18:05,880 --> 03:18:09,690
for when somebody said something just super clever.

4052
03:18:09,690 --> 03:18:11,340
So there's also that like, you know,

4053
03:18:11,340 --> 03:18:14,310
just clever turn of speech.

4054
03:18:14,310 --> 03:18:15,510
- Yeah, wit.

4055
03:18:15,510 --> 03:18:20,100
- And I think about that when I'm a hieroglyphic translator.

4056
03:18:20,100 --> 03:18:22,770
Like, here's a beautiful thing that's gonna be like a poem

4057
03:18:22,770 --> 03:18:24,660
or a political statement.

4058
03:18:24,660 --> 03:18:27,330
Like, and I'm just plottingly looking

4059
03:18:27,330 --> 03:18:29,730
in a dictionary of what that word means.

4060
03:18:29,730 --> 03:18:31,170
There's probably double,

4061
03:18:31,170 --> 03:18:33,720
triple entendres all through this text.

4062
03:18:33,720 --> 03:18:36,480
And the real meaning is the subtext.

4063
03:18:36,480 --> 03:18:38,940
And I'm, you know, I'm thinking they're talking about corn

4064
03:18:38,940 --> 03:18:41,910
and they're talking about the nature of life.

4065
03:18:41,910 --> 03:18:44,622
- Yeah, it could be satire, it could be, you know,

4066
03:18:44,622 --> 03:18:47,130
as it was in the Soviet Union when there's a dictator,

4067
03:18:47,130 --> 03:18:49,380
maybe there's a overpowering king.

4068
03:18:49,380 --> 03:18:51,990
You're not allowed to actually speak.

4069
03:18:51,990 --> 03:18:53,880
You have to hide the thing

4070
03:18:53,880 --> 03:18:57,330
you're actually trying to say in the subtext.

4071
03:18:57,330 --> 03:18:59,163
So, and all of that.

4072
03:19:00,030 --> 03:19:03,180
- There was a funny Maya ceramic that had,

4073
03:19:03,180 --> 03:19:05,640
the ceramics are neat 'cause they don't,

4074
03:19:05,640 --> 03:19:09,540
the monuments can be kind of broken records.

4075
03:19:09,540 --> 03:19:12,420
I'm the king, I was born this time, I beat these people up.

4076
03:19:12,420 --> 03:19:14,580
I married this woman, I died.

4077
03:19:14,580 --> 03:19:17,070
But the ceramics will tell us like things out

4078
03:19:17,070 --> 03:19:18,510
of mythology stories.

4079
03:19:18,510 --> 03:19:20,730
And there was this one with a rabbit looking

4080
03:19:20,730 --> 03:19:24,210
at the merchant god, and nobody could translate the text.

4081
03:19:24,210 --> 03:19:26,370
And finally this eastern European,

4082
03:19:26,370 --> 03:19:29,700
actually a Ukrainian guy translated it

4083
03:19:29,700 --> 03:19:34,353
and the rabbit's saying to the merchant god,

4084
03:19:35,490 --> 03:19:37,473
bend over and smell my ass.

4085
03:19:38,310 --> 03:19:39,390
And like, oh man,

4086
03:19:39,390 --> 03:19:41,910
we were expecting this wonderful piece of mythology.

4087
03:19:41,910 --> 03:19:45,030
But no, it translates bend over and smell my ass.

4088
03:19:45,030 --> 03:19:47,520
That's great, that's human.

4089
03:19:47,520 --> 03:19:51,450
- As we mentioned previously, human nature does not change.

4090
03:19:51,450 --> 03:19:53,910
You mentioned Palenque, mapping it.

4091
03:19:53,910 --> 03:19:55,650
Just outta curiosity,

4092
03:19:55,650 --> 03:19:58,530
what is that process like, it seems fascinating.

4093
03:19:58,530 --> 03:20:02,517
- Oh, it was a great adventure, I loved it.

4094
03:20:02,517 --> 03:20:03,660
But it was difficult.

4095
03:20:03,660 --> 03:20:05,970
I woke up every morning thinking

4096
03:20:05,970 --> 03:20:08,182
I will be hurt today somehow.

4097
03:20:08,182 --> 03:20:09,930
I don't know how, I don't know how badly,

4098
03:20:09,930 --> 03:20:13,080
where on my body it will occur, but it's gonna happen

4099
03:20:13,080 --> 03:20:14,460
because it was the jungle.

4100
03:20:14,460 --> 03:20:17,900
- So in the jungle, what's the process like?

4101
03:20:17,900 --> 03:20:20,190
Like what do you have to do to map it?

4102
03:20:20,190 --> 03:20:21,570
- Well, it was tricky too

4103
03:20:21,570 --> 03:20:24,330
because it was also a national forest.

4104
03:20:24,330 --> 03:20:26,280
So the forestry department didn't want us

4105
03:20:26,280 --> 03:20:28,500
to cut down anything more than we had to.

4106
03:20:28,500 --> 03:20:32,190
So we basically just cut tunnels through the foliage

4107
03:20:32,190 --> 03:20:34,860
and I would, we'd map everything twice.

4108
03:20:34,860 --> 03:20:39,780
The first thing we'd do is I'd go in, find a building,

4109
03:20:39,780 --> 03:20:41,490
draw it on a piece of graph paper,

4110
03:20:41,490 --> 03:20:43,590
and I'd say like, you know, you guys go north,

4111
03:20:43,590 --> 03:20:46,500
you guys go east, west, find other buildings,

4112
03:20:46,500 --> 03:20:49,950
and when you find them pace back to this one.

4113
03:20:49,950 --> 03:20:51,990
And so I'd start making a map

4114
03:20:51,990 --> 03:20:55,260
and I'd make the whole, one piece of graph paper was enough

4115
03:20:55,260 --> 03:20:57,690
to then we'd bring the machine in,

4116
03:20:57,690 --> 03:20:59,280
we'd bring the laser theodolite

4117
03:20:59,280 --> 03:21:00,900
and get really accurate information.

4118
03:21:00,900 --> 03:21:04,410
But on that piece of paper, I would write like,

4119
03:21:04,410 --> 03:21:05,730
don't bring the machine this way.

4120
03:21:05,730 --> 03:21:08,520
There's a tree fall or stand on top of this building

4121
03:21:08,520 --> 03:21:10,260
and you'll see four different buildings

4122
03:21:10,260 --> 03:21:11,880
at once from this one.

4123
03:21:11,880 --> 03:21:14,370
- And all of this is in dense jungle.

4124
03:21:14,370 --> 03:21:17,550
- Right, and the deeper we got off the road,

4125
03:21:17,550 --> 03:21:20,250
the deeper it was, sometimes it would clear out,

4126
03:21:20,250 --> 03:21:22,230
but certain places, if it was low,

4127
03:21:22,230 --> 03:21:24,480
it would be such thick vegetation

4128
03:21:24,480 --> 03:21:27,570
and it would grow back so fast.

4129
03:21:27,570 --> 03:21:32,570
Sometimes we would cut just tunnels through tall grass

4130
03:21:34,170 --> 03:21:38,940
and we'd come back like five days later and they were gone.

4131
03:21:38,940 --> 03:21:41,010
We couldn't even find where our trails were.

4132
03:21:41,010 --> 03:21:43,440
They would grow back that fast.

4133
03:21:43,440 --> 03:21:45,540
- But you see the building so you could see.

4134
03:21:45,540 --> 03:21:46,920
- Right, and that was the fun part.

4135
03:21:46,920 --> 03:21:48,223
I mean, sometimes it would just be like

4136
03:21:48,223 --> 03:21:50,640
a little neighborhood with little low buildings,

4137
03:21:50,640 --> 03:21:53,460
no bigger than this table, but sometimes, you know,

4138
03:21:53,460 --> 03:21:55,140
just five more meters in.

4139
03:21:55,140 --> 03:21:57,360
And I'm standing under a pyramid

4140
03:21:57,360 --> 03:21:58,920
that nobody had ever mapped.

4141
03:21:58,920 --> 03:22:00,840
Like, wow, I've just found another one.

4142
03:22:00,840 --> 03:22:01,860
And some days, you know,

4143
03:22:01,860 --> 03:22:04,350
on good days we'd find three pyramids.

4144
03:22:04,350 --> 03:22:09,350
And I felt that's such a more exciting job

4145
03:22:09,510 --> 03:22:11,280
than the typical excavations.

4146
03:22:11,280 --> 03:22:14,430
Although my buddies were all just, you know, in a hole

4147
03:22:14,430 --> 03:22:16,320
for the whole week in the middle of the city

4148
03:22:16,320 --> 03:22:18,690
and where I'm dancing around through the jungle,

4149
03:22:18,690 --> 03:22:21,030
I could find, you know, 10 buildings today.

4150
03:22:21,030 --> 03:22:23,160
I might find a pyramid today, who knows.

4151
03:22:23,160 --> 03:22:25,110
- What's that feel like to find like a pyramid

4152
03:22:25,110 --> 03:22:28,230
or buildings that you are one of the only humans

4153
03:22:28,230 --> 03:22:32,040
that are not from that civilization to ever see this thing?

4154
03:22:32,040 --> 03:22:33,489
What's that feel like?

4155
03:22:33,489 --> 03:22:36,240
- It's great, I love that feeling.

4156
03:22:36,240 --> 03:22:39,240
I am, you know, I'm an explorer at heart,

4157
03:22:39,240 --> 03:22:42,142
so finding something like that, you know,

4158
03:22:42,142 --> 03:22:46,113
when I was 25 years old, I found a whole Maya city.

4159
03:22:47,160 --> 03:22:49,110
I got to name it, its name is Ma'ax Na,

4160
03:22:49,110 --> 03:22:52,080
it's off in the Belizean jungle.

4161
03:22:52,080 --> 03:22:54,690
And that was just, just outrageous.

4162
03:22:54,690 --> 03:22:57,993
I mean, it almost, that one almost depressed me.

4163
03:22:58,950 --> 03:23:03,060
My entire, like, I had this great life ambition

4164
03:23:03,060 --> 03:23:06,180
that I would find a lost city.

4165
03:23:06,180 --> 03:23:07,950
And then I did it at 25

4166
03:23:07,950 --> 03:23:10,259
and I was like, God, now what do I do?

4167
03:23:10,259 --> 03:23:12,150
I thought that was supposed to take me my whole life.

4168
03:23:12,150 --> 03:23:15,720
I actually, I wrote a bunch of letters to NASA trying

4169
03:23:15,720 --> 03:23:20,040
to get them to let me be the first archeologist on Mars.

4170
03:23:20,040 --> 03:23:21,630
I never got a single reply back.

4171
03:23:21,630 --> 03:23:24,003
I'm sure I'm on NASA's list as some weirdo.

4172
03:23:27,180 --> 03:23:29,280
- How'd you find a Mayan city?

4173
03:23:29,280 --> 03:23:33,570
- I used a topography map of the area

4174
03:23:33,570 --> 03:23:34,830
and I played the game.

4175
03:23:34,830 --> 03:23:37,380
If I was a Maya, where would my favorite place

4176
03:23:37,380 --> 03:23:39,884
to live in this big area be?

4177
03:23:39,884 --> 03:23:41,820
I looked for the biggest mountain

4178
03:23:41,820 --> 03:23:45,870
because they call all of their pyramids tunwits,

4179
03:23:45,870 --> 03:23:48,870
stone mountains, I knew they loved mountains.

4180
03:23:48,870 --> 03:23:50,010
And when I found that mountain,

4181
03:23:50,010 --> 03:23:53,130
there were two others right next to it that made a triangle.

4182
03:23:53,130 --> 03:23:54,630
And they loved those triads

4183
03:23:54,630 --> 03:23:56,220
and there were rivers in between them.

4184
03:23:56,220 --> 03:23:58,650
And I thought, that's it.

4185
03:23:58,650 --> 03:24:00,390
That's where I would build the city.

4186
03:24:00,390 --> 03:24:04,080
And I hiked out there over two seasons with students.

4187
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:06,180
The other grad students were like,

4188
03:24:06,180 --> 03:24:08,400
he's just having his students just wander

4189
03:24:08,400 --> 03:24:11,820
in the jungle all day, but I came back with the city.

4190
03:24:11,820 --> 03:24:14,490
- So given that you've looked

4191
03:24:14,490 --> 03:24:17,850
into the deep pasts of humanity,

4192
03:24:17,850 --> 03:24:20,250
what gives you hope about our future,

4193
03:24:20,250 --> 03:24:23,793
maybe our deep future of this human civilization?

4194
03:24:24,990 --> 03:24:27,420
- That's a good one, and I do have hope.

4195
03:24:27,420 --> 03:24:32,010
I do have hope, I believe in the spirit of humankind.

4196
03:24:32,010 --> 03:24:35,700
I, as a person who have studied history,

4197
03:24:35,700 --> 03:24:39,000
I kind of feel like history does kind of a sine wave.

4198
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:40,740
There's highs and there's lows,

4199
03:24:40,740 --> 03:24:43,620
but no matter how low we go,

4200
03:24:43,620 --> 03:24:47,370
we get up again and we climb.

4201
03:24:47,370 --> 03:24:50,550
And I think that humanity will continue that,

4202
03:24:50,550 --> 03:24:53,130
we will rise to the challenges.

4203
03:24:53,130 --> 03:24:56,640
Now, some of the challenges may be created by ourselves

4204
03:24:56,640 --> 03:24:59,220
as well, but we will adapt and overcome.

4205
03:24:59,220 --> 03:25:00,723
That's what we do.

4206
03:25:01,620 --> 03:25:03,840
- Yeah, humans find a way, right?

4207
03:25:03,840 --> 03:25:07,500
That's like, that's the thing you see with history,

4208
03:25:07,500 --> 03:25:10,023
even when the empires collapse.

4209
03:25:11,536 --> 03:25:14,070
The humans that come outta that,

4210
03:25:14,070 --> 03:25:17,372
they pick themselves up and find another way.

4211
03:25:17,372 --> 03:25:20,640
- And the people I study believe in the cyclical nature

4212
03:25:20,640 --> 03:25:22,860
of life that you really can't,

4213
03:25:22,860 --> 03:25:26,250
life can't continue without death being part of the cycle.

4214
03:25:26,250 --> 03:25:28,050
We get our lows, we get our highs,

4215
03:25:28,050 --> 03:25:31,350
but the cycle continues forever.

4216
03:25:31,350 --> 03:25:34,459
- I should mention that you have a lot of great lectures

4217
03:25:34,459 --> 03:25:39,459
on the great courses, but you have also an amazing podcast,

4218
03:25:40,980 --> 03:25:44,583
ArchaeoEd, if people wanna listen to it,

4219
03:25:45,573 --> 03:25:46,410
this is a tough question,

4220
03:25:46,410 --> 03:25:49,833
but what would you recommend,

4221
03:25:50,760 --> 03:25:54,771
what episodes should they listen to, what's the entry?

4222
03:25:54,771 --> 03:25:56,571
- Oh, that is a tough question.

4223
03:25:56,571 --> 03:25:58,440
- What is the sampling?

4224
03:25:58,440 --> 03:25:59,700
You know, it's like asking a chef,

4225
03:25:59,700 --> 03:26:01,650
like what's the best stuff on the menu?

4226
03:26:03,630 --> 03:26:05,340
- Well, different strokes for different folks.

4227
03:26:05,340 --> 03:26:07,530
You know, I do two different things on that podcast.

4228
03:26:07,530 --> 03:26:09,990
Sometimes I just teach about cultures

4229
03:26:09,990 --> 03:26:12,044
that you've never heard about.

4230
03:26:12,044 --> 03:26:14,520
I start off by saying it's my podcast

4231
03:26:14,520 --> 03:26:16,440
and I'll talk about whatever the heck I wanna talk about.

4232
03:26:16,440 --> 03:26:20,160
Sometimes I talk about really specific things

4233
03:26:20,160 --> 03:26:22,290
like a tool type or an animal type.

4234
03:26:22,290 --> 03:26:24,420
But my favorite ones have become,

4235
03:26:24,420 --> 03:26:27,420
when I just tell my stories of my adventures,

4236
03:26:27,420 --> 03:26:29,790
I've got a lot of weird adventure stories

4237
03:26:29,790 --> 03:26:33,840
and it's been fun and they've been very well received.

4238
03:26:33,840 --> 03:26:35,667
I've got, you know, I can put my humor in there

4239
03:26:35,667 --> 03:26:39,420
and I can talk about, you know, the things

4240
03:26:39,420 --> 03:26:41,790
that went right, the things that went wrong, the adventures

4241
03:26:41,790 --> 03:26:46,287
that I had are all part of this ArchaeoEd thing.

4242
03:26:46,287 --> 03:26:48,540
And ArchaeoEd's kind of a double entendre.

4243
03:26:48,540 --> 03:26:53,070
It's me, I'm just Ed, but it's also education.

4244
03:26:53,070 --> 03:26:54,900
You know what I'm really trying to do with this too,

4245
03:26:54,900 --> 03:26:57,300
it's specifically the Americas.

4246
03:26:57,300 --> 03:27:01,200
I want to be part of the reawakening

4247
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:03,420
that there were these great civilizations here,

4248
03:27:03,420 --> 03:27:05,670
especially North America.

4249
03:27:05,670 --> 03:27:08,640
I think that we have a group amnesia

4250
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:11,880
that there was no great civilizations here

4251
03:27:11,880 --> 03:27:15,150
before Europe showed up, that's simply not true.

4252
03:27:15,150 --> 03:27:18,180
I think it should be part of our history books.

4253
03:27:18,180 --> 03:27:22,590
In fact, I have a program called Before the Americas

4254
03:27:22,590 --> 03:27:27,540
that would introduce as part of American history,

4255
03:27:27,540 --> 03:27:29,820
the part before European contact.

4256
03:27:29,820 --> 03:27:31,410
And I think that kids

4257
03:27:31,410 --> 03:27:34,560
in the K through 12 level should grow up

4258
03:27:34,560 --> 03:27:36,750
not being told this fallacy

4259
03:27:36,750 --> 03:27:41,750
that no one was here before we showed up in 1492.

4260
03:27:42,150 --> 03:27:44,310
And one of these days I'm gonna find a funder

4261
03:27:44,310 --> 03:27:48,870
to help us put together Before the Americas

4262
03:27:48,870 --> 03:27:51,090
and we're gonna make it part of the curriculum

4263
03:27:51,090 --> 03:27:52,440
for every kid in the US

4264
03:27:52,440 --> 03:27:55,320
to know the full history of this country.

4265
03:27:55,320 --> 03:27:58,410
- That's a great project, Ed, thank you so much.

4266
03:27:58,410 --> 03:27:59,490
Thank you for talking today.

that you put out into the world

4269
03:28:04,110 --> 03:28:07,170

And now let me leave you some words from Joseph Campbell.

4276
03:28:21,817 --> 03:28:26,020
"Life is but a mask worn on the face of death

4277
03:28:26,940 --> 03:28:30,240
and is death then, but another mask,

4278
03:28:30,240 --> 03:28:33,960
how many can say asks the Aztec poet

4279
03:28:33,960 --> 03:28:37,257
that there is or is not a truth beyond?"

4280
03:28:38,490 --> 03:28:42,063
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
