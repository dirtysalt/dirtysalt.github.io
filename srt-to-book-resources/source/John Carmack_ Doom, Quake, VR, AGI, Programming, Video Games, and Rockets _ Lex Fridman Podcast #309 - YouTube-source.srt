1
00:00:01,287 --> 00:00:02,384
- I remember the reaction

2
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:03,810
where he had drawn these characters

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,450
and he was slowly moving around

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,154
and like people had no experience with 3D navigation,

5
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:09,316
it was all still keyboard.

6
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:11,868
We didn't even have mice set up at that time.

7
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:14,943
But slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,734
the wall disappears in a little animation

9
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:18,780
and there's a monster like right there.

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,830
And he practically fell out of his chair.

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,009
It was just like, ah.

12
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:24,960
And games just didn't do that.

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,973
The games were the god's eye view.

14
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,072
You were a little invested in your little guy.

15
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,472
You can be like happy or sad when things happen,

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:34,950
but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction.

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,787
- You weren't inside your game.

18
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:38,040
- Something in the back of your brain,

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,147
some reptile brain thing is just going,

20
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:42,450
"Oh, shit something just happened."

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,000
And that was one of those early points where it's like,

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,280
yeah, this is gonna make a difference.

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,043
This is going to be powerful and it's gonna matter.

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,170
- The following is a conversation with John Carmack,

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,063
widely considered

26
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:59,550
to be one of the greatest programmers ever.

27
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,010
He was the co-founder of id Software

28
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,930
and the lead programmer on several games

29
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,330
that revolutionized the technology,

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,840
the experience and the role of gaming in our society,

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,840
including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake.

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,980
He spent many years as the CTO of Oculus VR,

33
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,797
helping to create portals into virtual worlds

34
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:26,790
and to define the technological path to the Metaverse

35
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,170
at Meta.

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,960
And now he has been shifting some of his attention

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,860
to the problem of artificial general intelligence.

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,370
This was the longest conversation on this podcast

39
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,080
at over five hours,

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,770
and still I could talk to John many, many more times

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,543
and we hope to do just that.

42
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,660
This is the "Lex Fridman Podcast."

And now, dear friends, here's John Carmack.

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,060
What was the first program you've ever written?

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,230
Do you remember?

48
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,063
- Yeah, I do.

49
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:04,860
So, I remember being in a radio shack going up

50
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,810
to the TRS 80 computers

51
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,979
and learning just enough to be able to do 10 print,

52
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,810
John Carmack.

53
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,960
And it's kind of interesting how, of course I,

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,080
Carnegie and Richie kind of standardized hello world

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,913
as the first thing

56
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:21,446
that you do in every computer programming language

57
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:22,770
and every computer.

58
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,520
But not having any interaction with the cultures of Unix

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,230
or any other standardized things,

60
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,767
it was just like, "Well, what am I gonna say?"

61
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:32,377
"I'm gonna say my name and then you learn how to do,

62
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,950
"Go to 10 and have it scroll all off the screen."

63
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,290
And that was definitely the first thing

64
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,540
that I wound up doing on a computer.

65
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,310
- Can I ask you programming advice?

66
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,380
I was always told in the beginning that you're not allowed

67
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,400
to use Go-to statements.

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,540
That's really bad programming.

69
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,950
Is this correct or not?

70
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,131
Jumping around code?

71
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:50,310
Can we look at the philosophy

72
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,700
and the technical aspects of the Go-to statement

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,140
that seems so convenient,

74
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,678
but it's supposedly bad programming?

75
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:57,511
- Well, so certainly back in the day

76
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,980
in basic programming languages,

77
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,780
you didn't have proper loops.

78
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,760
You didn't have four while and repeats,

79
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,520
that was the land of Pascal for people that kind

80
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,380
of generally had access to it back then.

81
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,380
So, you had no choice but to use Go-tos.

82
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,500
And as you made, what were big programs back then,

83
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,333
which were a thousand line basic programs,

84
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,770
is a really big program,

85
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,010
they did tend to sort of degenerate into madness.

86
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,400
You didn't have good editors or code exploration tools,

87
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,220
so you would wind up fixing things in one place,

88
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,150
add a little patch.

89
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,700
And there's reasons why structured programming,

90
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,840
generally helps understanding, but go-tos aren't poisonous.

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,970
Sometimes they're the right thing to do.

92
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,140
Usually it's because

93
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,930
there's a language feature missing, like nested breaks

94
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,872
or something where,

95
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:44,580
it can sometimes be better to do a go-to cleanup

96
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,060
or go-to error rather than having multiple flags,

97
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,460
multiple if statements littered throughout things.

98
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,810
But it is rare.

99
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,331
I mean, if you grip through all of my code right now,

100
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:57,540
I don't think any of my current code bases,

101
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,980
would actually have a go-to,

102
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,670
but deep within sort of the technical underpinnings

103
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,750
of a major game engine,

104
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,860
you're gonna have some go-tos

105
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,230
in a couple places probably.

106
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,180
- Yeah, the infrastructure on top of,

107
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,250
like the closer you get to the machine code,

108
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,720
the more go-tos you're gonna see,

109
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,660
the more of these like hacks you're going to see,

110
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,240
because the set of features available to you

111
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,350
in low level programming languages is not, is limited.

112
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,950
So, print John Carmack,

113
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,000
when is the first time, if we could talk about love

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,620
that you fell in love with programming.

115
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,590
You said like this is really something special.

116
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,030
- It really was something

117
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,130
that was one of those love at first sight things

118
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,740
where just really from the time that I understood

119
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,170
what a computer was even, I mean,

120
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,450
I remember looking through old encyclopedias

121
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,600
at the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes

122
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,250
at the real tore tape decks.

123
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,320
And for people nowadays,

124
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,360
it can be a little hard to understand what the world

125
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,310
was like then from information gathering

126
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,710
where I would go to the libraries

127
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,080
and there would be a couple books on the shelf,

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,900
about computers and they would be very out of date,

129
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,630
even at that point, just not a lot of information,

130
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,150
but I would grab everything that I could find

131
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,590
and devour everything.

132
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,450
Whenever "Time" or "Newsweek"

133
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,190
had some article about computers,

134
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,980
I would like cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere.

135
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,950
It felt like this magical thing to me,

136
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,460
this idea that the computer would just do exactly

137
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,480
what you told it to.

138
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,410
I mean, and there's a little bit

139
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,690
of the Genie monkey's paw sort of issues there

140
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,730
where you'd better be really, really careful

141
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,080
with what you're telling it to do.

142
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,120
But it wasn't gonna backtalk you,

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,710
it wasn't gonna have a different point of view.

144
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,410
It was gonna carry out what you told it to do.

145
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,538
And if you had the right commands

146
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:43,639
you could make it do these pretty magical things.

147
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,990
- And so what kind of programs did you write at first?

148
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,300
So, beyond the print John Carmack.

149
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,810
- So, I can remember as going through the learning process

150
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,600
where you find at the start you're just learning how to do

151
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,400
the most basic possible things.

152
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,820
And I can remember stuff like a Superman Comic

153
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,253
that Radio Shack commissioned to have,

154
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,830
it's like Superman had lost some of his super brain

155
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,530
and kids had to use Radio Shack TRS 80 computers

156
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,970
to do calculations to help him kind of complete his heroics.

157
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,510
And I'd find little things like that

158
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,340
and then get a few basic books

159
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,160
to be able to kind of work my way up.

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,470
And again, it was so precious back then.

161
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,303
I had a couple books

162
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:25,920
that would teach me important things about it.

163
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,217
I had one book that I could start to learn

164
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,360
a little bit of assembly language from

165
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,715
and I'd have a few books on basic

166
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:34,285
and some things that I could get from the libraries.

167
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:37,200
But my goals in the early days

168
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,011
was almost always making games of various kinds.

169
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:44,940
I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2,600 games

170
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,760
and being able to do some of those things myself

171
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,177
on the computers was very much what I aspired to.

172
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,420
And it was a whole journey where if you learn normal, basic,

173
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,100
you can't do any kind of an action game.

174
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,420
You can write an adventure game,

175
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,277
you can write things where you say, "What do you do here?"

176
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:03,630
"I get sort, attack, troll," that type of thing.

177
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,394
And that can be done in the context of basic,

178
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:08,977
but to do things that had moving graphics

179
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:11,310
that were only the most limited things

180
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,270
you could possibly do.

181
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,000
You could maybe do breakout or pong or that sort of thing

182
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,980
in low resolution graphics.

183
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,760
And in fact, one of my first sort of major technical hacks

184
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,924
that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers.

185
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:28,830
They had a mode called low resolution graphics

186
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,440
where of course all graphics were low resolution back then,

187
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,140
but regular low resolution graphics.

188
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,593
It was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally,

189
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:39,510
but they could have 16 different colors.

190
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,340
And I wanted to make a game,

191
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,950
kind of like the arcade game Vanguard,

192
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,940
just a scrolling game.

193
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,400
And I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up

194
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,290
and I could move a little ship around you.

195
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,790
You could manage to do that in basic,

196
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,277
but there's no way you could redraw the whole screen.

197
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:55,290
And I remember at the time,

198
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,230
just coming up with what felt like a brainstorm to me

199
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,720
where I knew enough about the way

200
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,040
the hardware was controlled,

201
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,868
where the text screen and the low resolution graphic screen

202
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:06,930
were basically the same thing.

203
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,280
And all those computers,

204
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,230
could scroll their text screen reasonably.

205
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,720
You could do a listing and it would scroll things up

206
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,900
and I figured out that I could kind of tweak,

207
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,565
just a couple things that I barely understood

208
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,880
to put it into a graphics mode and I could draw graphics

209
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,670
and then I could just do a line feed at the very bottom

210
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,280
of the screen and then the system would scroll it all up,

211
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,050
using an assembly language routine

212
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,240
that I didn't know how to write back then.

213
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,330
So, that was like this first great hack

214
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,030
that sort of had analogs later on in my career

215
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,140
for a lot of different things.

216
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,419
So, I found out that I could draw a screen,

217
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,890
I could do a line feed at the bottom,

218
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,179
we would scroll it up once,

219
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,580
I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom.

220
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,820
And that was my first way to kind of scroll the screen,

221
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,980
which was interesting

222
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,660
in that that played a big part later on

223
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,250
in the id Software days as well.

224
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,170
- So, do efficient drawing

225
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,220
where you don't have to draw the whole screen,

226
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,890
but you draw from the bottom using the thing

227
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,530
that was designed in the hardware for text output.

228
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,363
- Yeah.

229
00:09:05,363 --> 00:09:06,570
Where so much of,

230
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,890
until recently game design was limited

231
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,200
by what you could actually get the computer to do,

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,737
where it's easy to say like,

233
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:15,990
"Okay, I wanna scroll the screen."

234
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,470
You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset.

235
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,570
And nowadays that works just fine.

236
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,328
Computers are ludicrously fast.

237
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:27,900
But up until a decade ago or so,

238
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,180
there were all these things everybody wanted to do,

239
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,920
but if they knew enough programming

240
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,540
to be able to make it happen,

241
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,510
it would happen too slow to be a good experience,

242
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,330
either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough

243
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,090
that it wasn't fun to experience it like that.

244
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,610
So, so much of kinda the first couple decades

245
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,230
of the programming work that I did

246
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,333
was largely figuring out how to do something

247
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,450
that everybody knows how they want it to to happen.

248
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,300
It just has to happen two to 10 times faster

249
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,310
than sort of the straightforward way

250
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,650
of doing things would make it happen.

251
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,530
And it's different now because at this point,

252
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,240
lots of things you can just do

253
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,946
in the most naive possible way and it still works out.

254
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:09,480
You don't have nearly the creative limitations

255
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,607
or the incentives for optimizing on that level.

256
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,430
And there's a lot of pros and cons to that.

257
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,110
But I do generally,

258
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,360
I'm not gonna do the angry old man,

259
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,010
shaking my fist at the clouds bit

260
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,256
where back in my day programmers had to do real programming.

261
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,670
It's amazing that you can just kind of pick an idea

262
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,870
and go do it right now.

263
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,690
And you don't have to be some assembly language wizard

264
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,309
or deep GPU arcane

265
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:35,190
to be able to figure out how to make your wishes happen.

266
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,900
- Well there's still,

267
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,400
see that's true,

268
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,280
but let me put on my old man with a fist hat

269
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,500
and say that probably the thing

270
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,240
that will define the future,

271
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,910
still requires you to operate

272
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,650
at the limits of the current system.

273
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,840
So, we'll probably talk about this,

274
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,300
but if you talk about building the metaverse

275
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,120
and building a VR experience that's compelling,

276
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,290
it probably requires you to not to go to assembly

277
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,660
or maybe not literally,

278
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,930
but sort of spiritually to go to the limits

279
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,157
of what the system is capable of.

280
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:10,830
- And that really was why virtual reality

281
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,650
was specifically interesting to me

282
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,000
where it had all the ties to,

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,100
you could say that even back in the early days,

284
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,170
I have some old magazine articles

285
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,170
that's talking about doom as a virtual reality experience,

286
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,589
back when just seeing anything in 3D.

287
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:26,940
So, you could say that we've been trying

288
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,640
to build those virtual experiences from the very beginning.

289
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,880
And in the modern era, virtual reality,

290
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,830
especially on the mobile side of things,

291
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,790
when it's standalone

292
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,920
and you're basically using a cell phone chip

293
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,820
to be able to produce these very immersive experiences,

294
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,650
it does require work.

295
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,610
It's not at the level

296
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,040
of what an old school console game programmer,

297
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
would have operated at

298
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,310
where you're looking at hardware registers

299
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,051
and you're scheduling all the DMA accesses,

300
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:55,530
but it is still definitely a different level

301
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,137
than what a web developer

302
00:11:57,137 --> 00:12:01,770
or even a PC steam game developer usually has to work at.

303
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,820
And again, it's great.

304
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,140
There's opportunities for people

305
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,390
that wanna operate at either end of that spectrum there

306
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,151
and still provide a lot of value to the world.

307
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:14,151
- Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference.

308
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,950
What would you say is the best programming language,

309
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,240
your favorite,

310
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,560
but also the best,

311
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,170
you've seen throughout your career?

312
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,190
You're considered by many

313
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,460
to be the greatest programmer ever.

314
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,340
I mean, it's so difficult to place that label on anyone,

315
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,990
but if you put it on anyone, it's you.

316
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,390
So, let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions

317
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,730
of what's the best band of all time,

318
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,520
but in your case, what's the best programming language?

319
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,177
- Everything has all the caveats about it,

320
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:45,090
but so what I use,

321
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,810
so nowadays I do program a reasonable amount of Python

322
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,150
for AI ML sorts of work.

323
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,450
I'm not a native Python programmer.

324
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,970
It's something I came to very late in my career.

325
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,497
I understand what it's good for.

326
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:00,090
- But you don't dream in Python.

327
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:00,930
- I do not.

328
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,400
And it has some of those things

329
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,200
where there's some amazing stats

330
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,880
when you say if you just start,

331
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,520
if you make a loop, a triply nested loop

332
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,980
and start doing operations in Python,

333
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,850
you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower

334
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,610
than a proper GPU tensor operation.

335
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,830
And these are staggering numbers,

336
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,180
you can be as much slower

337
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,230
as we've almost gotten faster in our pace of progress

338
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,910
and all this other miraculous stuff.

339
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,830
- So, your intuition's about inefficiencies

340
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,210
within the Python sort of-

341
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,100
- It keeps hitting me upside the face.

342
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,140
Where it's gotten to the point now I understand.

343
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,850
It's like, okay, you just can't do a loop

344
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,490
if you care about performance in Python.

345
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,370
You have to figure out how you can reformat this

346
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,080
into some big vector operation

347
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,910
or something that's going to be done completely,

348
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,070
within a C plus plus library.

349
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,920
But the other hand is it's amazingly convenient

350
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,210
and you just see stuff

351
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,340
that people are able to cobble together

352
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,470
by you just import a few different things

353
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,690
and you can do stuff that nobody on earth,

354
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,647
could do 10 years ago

355
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:00,153
and you can do it in a little cookbook thing

356
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:02,820
that you copy paste it out of a website.

357
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,830
So, that is really great.

358
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,090
When I'm sitting down to do

359
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,490
what I consider kind of serious programming.

360
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,440
It's still in C plus plus

361
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,950
and it's really kind of a C flavored C plus plus at that

362
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,510
where I'm not big

363
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,780
into the modern template meta programming sorts of things.

364
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,270
I see a lot of train wrecks coming from,

365
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,490
some of that over abstraction.

366
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,790
I spent a few years really going kind of deep

367
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,656
into the kinda the historical lisp work

368
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:31,020
and the Haskell

369
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,630
and some of the functional programming sides of things.

370
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,050
And there is a lot of value there

371
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,700
in the way you think about things.

372
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,440
And I changed a lot of the way I write

373
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,710
my C and C plus plus code based on what I learned about

374
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,650
the value that comes out of not having

375
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,250
this random mutable state that you kind of lose track of.

376
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,640
Because something that many people don't really appreciate,

377
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,500
till they've been at it for a long time

378
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,260
is that it's not the writing of the program initially,

379
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,470
it's the whole lifespan of the program and that's when,

380
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,750
it's not necessarily just how fast you wrote it

381
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,490
or how fast it operates,

382
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,360
but it's how can it bend and adapt as situations change.

383
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,160
And then the thing that I've really been learning

384
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,210
in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work is

385
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,980
it's also how well it hands off,

386
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,290
between a continuous kind of revolving door

387
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,960
of programmers taking over maintenance and different things

388
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,570
and how you get people up to speed in different areas

389
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,480
and there's all these other different aspects of it.

390
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,580
- Is C plus plus a good language

391
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,520
for handover between engineers?

392
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,134
- Probably not the best.

393
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,900
And there's some really interesting aspects to this

394
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,360
where in some cases languages

395
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,470
that are not generally thought well of for many reasons.

396
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,410
Like C is derided pretty broadly that yes,

397
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,150
obviously all of these security flaws

398
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,430
that happen with the memory and unsafeness

399
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,910
and buffer overruns and the things that you've got there.

400
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,350
But there is this underappreciated aspect to the language

401
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,470
is so simple.

402
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,320
Anyone can go and if you know C,

403
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,090
you can generally jump in someplace

404
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,550
and not have to learn what paradigms

405
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,340
they're using because there just aren't that many available.

406
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,207
I think there's,

407
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:12,420
and there's some really, really well-written C code,

408
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,510
like I find it great that if I'm messing around

409
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,787
with something in open BSD say,

410
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:19,680
I mean I can be walking around in the kernel and I'm like,

411
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,462
I understand everything that's going on here.

412
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:25,950
It's not hard for me to figure out what I need to do

413
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,790
to make whatever change that I need to,

414
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,820
while you can have more significant languages.

415
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,830
Like, it's a downside of lisp

416
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,350
where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp.

417
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,670
I think that it did help my thinking about programming

418
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,579
in some ways.

419
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:43,412
- Yes.

420
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:44,910
- But the people that are the biggest defenders

421
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,850
of Lisp are saying how malleable of a language it is

422
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,100
that if you write a huge Lisp program,

423
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,130
you've basically invented your own kind of language

424
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,470
and structure because it's not the primitives

425
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,000
of the language you're using very much.

426
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,490
It's all of the things you've built on top of that.

427
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,050
And then a language like Racket,

428
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,360
kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions,

429
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,339
it's essentially touted as a language

430
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,050
for building other languages.

431
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,772
And I understand the value of that

432
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,450
for a tiny little project,

433
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,359
but the idea of that for one of these long-term supported

434
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,030
by lots of people kind of horrifies me,

435
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,406
where all of those abstractions that you're like,

436
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,027
"Okay, you can't touch this code,

437
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:25,027
"till you educate yourself on all of these things

438
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,880
"that we've built on top of that."

439
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,420
And it was interesting to see how when Google made Go,

440
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,940
a lot of the criticisms of that are,

441
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,957
it's like, "Wow, this is not a state-of-the-art language.

442
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:38,100
"This language is just so simple and almost crude."

443
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,470
And you could see the programming language people,

444
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,940
just looking down at it,

445
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,100
but it does seem to be quite popular

446
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,220
as basically saying this is the good things about C.

447
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,380
Everybody can just jump right in and use it.

448
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,050
You don't need to restructure your brain

449
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,580
to write good code in it.

450
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,310
So, I wish that I had more opportunity

451
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,665
for doing some work in Go.

452
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:02,133
Rust is the other modern language that everybody talks about

453
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,200
that I'm not fit past judgment on.

454
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,630
I've done, a little bit beyond Hello World,

455
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,930
I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust,

456
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,690
just as an exercise, but that was a few years ago

457
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,610
and I haven't really used it since.

458
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,100
The best programming language is the one that works,

459
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,170
generally that you're currently using,

460
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,670
because that's another trap is

461
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,680
in almost every case I've seen

462
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,070
when people mixed languages on a project, that's a mistake.

463
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,010
I would rather stay just in one language,

464
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,680
so that everybody can work across the entire thing.

465
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,380
And we have, like at Meta, we have a lot of projects

466
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,360
that use kind of React framework.

467
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,890
So, you've got JavaScript here

468
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,950
and then you have C plus plus for real work,

469
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,720
and then you may have Java interfacing

470
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,730
with some other part of the Android system

471
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,917
and those are all kind of horrible things.

472
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,959
And that was one thing that,

473
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:53,730
I remember talking with with Boz at Facebook about it

474
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,040
where like, man, I wish we could have just said

475
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,187
we're only hiring C plus plus programmers.

476
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:02,700
And he just thought from the Facebook Meta perspective,

477
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,452
well we just wouldn't be able to find enough,

478
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:08,040
with the thousands of programmers they've got there.

479
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,800
It is not necessarily a dying breed,

480
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,940
but you can sure find a lot more JavaScript programmers

481
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,850
and I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time

482
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,120
and he was kind of flabbergasted about that.

483
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,170
It's like, well you just,

484
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,423
you go out and you find those programmers

485
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,500
and you don't hire the other programmers

486
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,410
that don't do the languages that you want to use.

487
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,340
But right now, I guess, yeah,

488
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,410
they're using JavaScript on a bunch of the,

489
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,750
the SpaceX work for the UI side of things.

490
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,430
When you go find UI programmers,

491
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,900
they're JavaScript programmers.

492
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,980
- I wonder if that's because

493
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,750
there's a lot of JavaScript programmers

494
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,700
because I do think that great programmers are rare,

495
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,700
that if you just look at statistics of how many people

496
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,210
are using different programming languages,

497
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,280
that doesn't tell you the story

498
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,800
of what the great programmers are using.

499
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,160
And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to,

500
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,810
which is the fundamentals of a language.

501
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,770
What does it encourage you?

502
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,300
How does it encourage you to think,

503
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,700
what kind of systems does it encourage you to build?

504
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,870
There is something about C plus plus

505
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,220
that has elements of creativity

506
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,970
but forces you to be an adult about your programming.

507
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,620
- [John] Is that it expects you to be an adult.

508
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,763
It does not forced you to.

509
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:23,310
- And so it brings out people

510
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,320
that are willing to be creative

511
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,330
in terms of building large systems

512
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,280
and coming up with interesting solutions,

513
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,600
but at the same time,

514
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,550
have the sort of the good software engineering practices

515
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,301
that amend themselves to real world systems.

516
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:42,183
Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript.

517
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,030
So, if aliens visit in thousands of years

518
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,070
and humans are long gone,

519
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,890
something tells me that most of the systems

520
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,020
they find will be running JavaScript.

521
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,145
I kind of think that if we're living this simulation,

522
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:00,003
it's written in JavaScript.

523
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,330
For the longest time,

524
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,130
even still JavaScript didn't get any respect

525
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,990
and yet it runs so much of the world

526
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,800
and an increasing number of the world.

527
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,180
Is it possible that all everything will be written

528
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,710
in JavaScript one day?

529
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,810
- So, the engineering under JavaScript

530
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,996
is really pretty phenomenal.

531
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:24,600
The systems that make JavaScript run as fast

532
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,616
as it does right now

533
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:29,970
are kind of miracles of modern engineering in many ways.

534
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,470
It does feel like it is not an optimal language

535
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,360
for all the things that it's being used for

536
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,020
or an optimal distribution system to build huge apps

537
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,259
in something like this without type systems and so on.

538
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:47,520
But I think for a lot of people

539
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,430
it does reasonably the necessary things.

540
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,290
It's still a C flavored language,

541
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,327
it's still a braces and semicolon language.

542
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:59,460
It's not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript

543
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,580
and then understand the roots of where it came from.

544
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,140
I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing

545
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,850
for most programs to be written in.

546
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,820
It's funny that I still just this morning I was on,

547
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,620
I was seeing a Twitter thread of a bunch

548
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,410
of really senior game dev people arguing about

549
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,870
the virtues and costs of garbage collection.

550
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,980
And you will run into some people

551
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,177
that are top-notch programmers that just say,

552
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:24,477
"No, this is literally not a good thing."

553
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:25,830
- Oh, because it makes you lazy?

554
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,440
- Yes, that it makes you not think about things.

555
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,640
And I do disagree.

556
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,330
I think that there is so much objective data

557
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,670
on the vulnerabilities that have happened

558
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,800
in C and C plus plus programs,

559
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,110
sometimes written by the best programmers in the world.

560
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,730
It's like nobody is good enough

561
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,220
to avoid ever shooting themselves in the foot with that.

562
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,540
You write enough C code,

563
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,610
you're going to shoot yourself in the foot

564
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,010
and garbage collection is a very great thing

565
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,750
for the vast majority of programs.

566
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,720
It's only when you get into the tightest of real time things

567
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,197
that you start saying, it's like,

568
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:58,207
"No, the garbage collection has more costs

569
00:22:58,207 --> 00:22:59,940
"than it has benefits for me there."

570
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,510
But that's not 99 plus percent of all the software

571
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,830
in the world.

572
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,360
So, JavaScript is not terrible in those ways

573
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,130
and so much of programming is not the language itself,

574
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,803
it's the infrastructure around,

575
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:17,400
that surrounds it.

576
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,020
All the libraries that you can get

577
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,430
and the different stuff that you can,

578
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,893
ways you can deploy it,

579
00:23:21,893 --> 00:23:24,180
the portability that it gives you.

580
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,060
And JavaScript is really strong on a lot of those things

581
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,777
where for a long time and it still does if I look at it,

582
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:33,990
but the web stack about everything that has to go

583
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,420
when you do something really trivial in JavaScript

584
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,370
and it shows up on a web browser

585
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,160
to kind of X-ray through that and see everything

586
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,670
that has to happen for your one little JavaScript statement

587
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,603
to turn into something visible in your web browser.

588
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:51,150
It's very, very disquieting,

589
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,370
just the depth of that stack

590
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,820
and the fact that so few people can even comprehend,

591
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,460
all of the levels that are going on there.

592
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,540
But it's, again, I have to caution myself to not be the,

593
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,550
in the good old days old man about it,

594
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,760
because clearly there's enormous value here.

595
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,190
The world does run on JavaScript

596
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,290
to a pretty good approximation there

597
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,730
and it's not falling apart.

598
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,110
There's a bunch of scary stuff

599
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,177
where you look at console logs

600
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:20,940
and you just see all of these bad things that are happening,

601
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,590
but it's still kind of limping along

602
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,780
and nobody really notices.

603
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,410
But so much of my systems design

604
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,720
and systems analysis goes around,

605
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,940
you should understand what the speed of light is,

606
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,120
like what would be the best you could possibly do here?

607
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,740
And it sounds horrible,

608
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,130
but in a lot of cases you can be a thousand times off

609
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,950
your speed of light velocity for something

610
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,510
and it still be okay.

611
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,360
And in fact it can even sometimes still be

612
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,120
the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint

613
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,710
where there's a lot of things

614
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,680
that you don't wanna have to parachute in someone like me

615
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,760
to go in and say,

616
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,560
make this webpage run a thousand times faster.

617
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,310
Make this web app into a hardcore native application

618
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,040
that starts up in 37 milliseconds

619
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,220
and everything responds in less than one frame latency.

620
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,690
That's just not necessary.

621
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,450
And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars

622
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,710
to do software like that,

623
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,357
when they can take somebody right out of a bootcamp and say,

624
00:25:19,357 --> 00:25:21,424
"Spin up an application for this,"

625
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:26,424
often being efficient is not really the best metric.

626
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,250
And that applies in a lot of areas

627
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,670
where it's kind of interesting how a lot of our appliances

628
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,360
and everything are all built around energy efficiency,

629
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,460
sometimes at the expense of robustness

630
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,160
in some other ways or higher costs in other ways

631
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,950
where there's interesting things where energy

632
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,040
or electricity could become much cheaper in a future world

633
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,020
and that could change our engineering trade-offs

634
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,520
for the way we build certain things

635
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,070
where you could throw away efficiency

636
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,280
and actually get more benefits that actually matter.

637
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,310
I mean that's one of the directions

638
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,760
I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy

639
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,620
when I was kind of like, what do I want to do next?

640
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,100
It was either gonna be cost effective nuclear fission

641
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,500
or artificial general intelligence.

642
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,331
And one of my pet ideas there is like,

643
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:18,360
people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is

644
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,890
and there would be ways that you could be a quarter

645
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,720
the efficiency or less,

646
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,690
but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper,

647
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,200
that could be a radical innovation in something like that.

648
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,820
So, there's like some of these thoughts around,

649
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,490
like direct fission energy conversion,

650
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,430
fission fragment conversion that maybe you build something

651
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,860
that doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything,

652
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,690
even if it winds up being less efficient.

653
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,830
So, that applies a lot in programming where there's always,

654
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,656
it's always good to know what you could do

655
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:51,990
if you really sat down and took it far,

656
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,700
because sometimes there's discontinuities,

657
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,100
like around user reaction times,

658
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,670
there are some points where the difference between operating

659
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,900
in one second and 750 milliseconds, not that huge.

660
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,640
You'll see it in webpage statistics,

661
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,220
but most of the usability stuff not that great.

662
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,980
But if you get down to 50 milliseconds,

663
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,170
then all of a sudden this just feels amazing.

664
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,450
It's just like doing your bidding instantly,

665
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,190
rather than you're giving it a command,

666
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,710
twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond.

667
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,070
So, sometimes it's important to really crunch hard

668
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,020
to get over some threshold,

669
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,860
but there are broad basins in the value metric

670
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,120
for lots of work

671
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,970
where it just doesn't pay to even go that extra mile.

672
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,623
And there are craftsmen that,

673
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:36,300
they just don't wanna buy that

674
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,860
and more power to them,

675
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,422
if somebody just wants to say, no, I'm going to be,

676
00:27:40,422 --> 00:27:42,720
my pride is in my work,

677
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,040
I'm never going to do something

678
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,350
that's not as good as I could possibly make it.

679
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,100
I respect that and sometimes I am that person,

680
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,820
but I try to focus more on the larger value picture

681
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,260
and you do pick your battles

682
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,360
and you deploy your resources in the play

683
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,640
that's going to give you sort of the best user value

684
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,690
in the end.

685
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,650
- Well if you look at the evolution of life on earth

686
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,613
as a kind of programming effort,

687
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:12,720
it seems like efficiency

688
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,180
isn't the thing that's being optimized for,

689
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,220
like natural selection is very inefficient,

690
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,700
but it kind of adapts

691
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,470
and through the process of adaptations,

692
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,700
building more and more complex systems

693
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,410
that are more and more intelligent,

694
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,077
the final result is kind of pretty interesting.

695
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:30,960
And so I think of JavaScript the same way.

696
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,020
It's like this giant mess that,

697
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,510
things naturally die off if they don't work

698
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,450
and if they're become useful to people,

699
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,920
they kind of naturally live.

700
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,870
And then you build this community,

701
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,930
large community of people that are jittering code

702
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,087
and some code is sticky, some is not,

703
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:51,660
and nobody knows the inefficiencies

704
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,550
or the efficiencies or the breaking points,

705
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,900
like how reliable this code is

706
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,810
and you kind of just run it, assume it works,

707
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,420
and then get unpleasantly surprised

708
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,180
and then that's very kind of the evolutionary process.

709
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,980
- So, that's a really good analogy

710
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,840
and we can go a lot of places with that

711
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,540
where in the earliest days of programming,

712
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,860
when you had finite,

713
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,080
you could count the bites that you had to work on this.

714
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,990
You had all the kind of hackers playing code golf

715
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,400
to be one less instruction

716
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,620
than the other person's multiply routine

717
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,453
to kind of get through.

718
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:22,890
And it was so perfectly crafted,

719
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,490
it was a crystal piece of artwork when you had a program,

720
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,440
because there just were not that many.

721
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,410
You couldn't afford to be lazy in different ways.

722
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,770
And in many ways I see that as akin to the symbolic AI work

723
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,407
where again, if you did not have the resources to just say,

724
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:40,537
"Well we're gonna do billions and billions

725
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:42,690
"of programmable weights here,"

726
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,900
you have to turn it down into something that is symbolic

727
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,400
and crafted like that.

728
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,150
But that's definitely not the way DNA and life

729
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,174
and biological evolution and things work.

730
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:58,380
On the one hand it's almost humbling

731
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,900
how little programming code is in our bodies.

732
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,520
We've got a couple billion base pairs

733
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,550
and it's like this all fits on a thumb drive for years now.

734
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,370
And then our brains are even a smaller section of that.

735
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,990
You've got maybe 50 megabytes

736
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,570
and this is not like Shannon limit,

737
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:17,490
perfectly information dense conveyances here.

738
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,470
It's like these are messy codes,

739
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,510
they're broken up into amino acids.

740
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,970
A lot of them don't do important things

741
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,340
or they do things in very awkward ways.

742
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,160
But it is this process of just accumulation

743
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,690
on top of things.

744
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,330
And you need scale,

745
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,730
both you need scale for sort of the population

746
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,020
for that to work out.

747
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,900
And in the early days in the 50s and 60s,

748
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,660
the kind of ancient era of computers

749
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,580
where you could count when they say like,

750
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,450
when the internet started,

751
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,340
even in the seventies there were like 18 hosts

752
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,180
or something on it.

753
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,430
It was this small finite number

754
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,260
and you were still optimizing everything

755
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,570
to be as good as you possibly could be.

756
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,780
But now it's billions and billions of devices

757
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,370
and everything going on

758
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,570
and you can have this very much natural evolution going on

759
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,000
where lots of things are tried,

760
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,380
lots of things are blowing up.

761
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,880
Venture capitalists lose their money

762
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,850
when a startup invested in the wrong tech stack

763
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,868
and things completely failed or failed to scale.

764
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:17,430
But good things do come out of it.

765
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:21,060
And it's interesting to see the mimetic evolution

766
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,680
of the way different things happen.

767
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,420
Like mentioning Hello World at the beginning,

768
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,630
it's funny how some little thing like that where everybody,

769
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,640
every programmer knows Hello World now.

770
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,160
And that was a completely arbitrary sort of decision

771
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,610
that just came out of the dominance of Unix and C

772
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,430
and early examples of things like that.

773
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,330
So, millions of experiments are going on all the time,

774
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,880
but some things do kind of rise to the top

775
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,240
and win the fitness war for whether it's mind space

776
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,400
or programming techniques or anything.

777
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,390
- Like, there's a site on stack exchange called Code Golf

778
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,960
where people compete to write the shortest possible program

779
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,340
for a particular task

780
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,350
in all the different kinds of languages.

781
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:06,063
And it's really interesting to see folks kind of,

782
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,343
that are masters of their craft really play

783
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:13,440
with the limits of programming languages.

784
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,610
It's really beautiful to see

785
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,040
and across all the different programming languages,

786
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,610
you get to see some of these weird programming languages

787
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,172
and mainstream ones,

788
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:25,080
difference between Python two and three.

789
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,210
You get to see the difference between C and C plus plus

790
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,030
and Java and you get to see JavaScript, all of that.

791
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,597
And it's kind of inspiring to see how much depth

792
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,762
of possibility there is within programming languages

793
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:44,190
that code golfed kind of tasks reveal.

794
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,590
Most of us, if you do any kind of programming,

795
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,867
you kind of do boring kind of very vanilla type of code.

796
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,860
That's the way to build large systems.

797
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,770
But it's nice to see that the possibility of creative genius

798
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,630
is still within those languages,

799
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,120
it's laden with in those languages.

800
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,713
So, given that you are once again

801
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:05,970
one of the greatest programmers ever,

802
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,340
what do you think makes a good programmer,

803
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,010
maybe a good modern programmer?

804
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,367
- So, I just gave a long rant/lecture at Meta

805
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,490
to the TPM organization

806
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,460
and my biggest point was,

807
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,280
everything that we're doing really should flow

808
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,390
from user value.

809
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,130
You know, all the good things that we're doing.

810
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,440
It's like we're not technical people.

811
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,960
It's like you shouldn't be taking pride,

812
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,100
just in the specific thing.

813
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,600
Like code golf is the sort of thing,

814
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,890
it's a fun puzzle game,

815
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,160
but that really should not be a major motivator for you.

816
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,260
It's like we're solving problems for people

817
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,970
or we're providing entertainment to people.

818
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,160
We're doing something of value to people

819
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,230
that's displacing something else in their life.

820
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,470
So, we want to be providing a net value over

821
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,763
what they could be doing,

822
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:53,550
but instead they're choosing to use our products.

823
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,793
And that's where,

824
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:56,640
I mean, it sounds trite or corny,

825
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,470
but I fundamentally do think

826
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,360
that's how you make the world a better place.

827
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,750
If you have given more value to people than it took you

828
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,730
and your team to create,

829
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,560
then the world's a better place.

830
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,699
People have,

831
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,500
they've gone from something of lesser value,

832
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,969
chosen to use your product

833
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,889
and their life feels better for that.

834
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,143
And if you've produced that economically,

835
00:34:16,143 --> 00:34:18,300
that's a really good thing.

836
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,190
On the other hand,

837
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,800
if you spent ridiculous amounts of money,

838
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,330
you've just kind of shoveled a lot of cash

839
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,710
into a wood chipper there

840
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,170
and you should maybe not feel so good,

841
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,277
about what you're doing.

842
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:33,570
So, being proud about like a specific architecture

843
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,980
or a specific technology

844
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,590
or a specific code sequence that you've done,

845
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,179
it's great to get a little smile,

846
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,130
like a tiny little dopamine hit for that.

847
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,320
But the top level metrics should be

848
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,449
that you're building things of value.

849
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:49,380
Now you can get into the argument about what is user value,

850
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,239
how do you actually quantify that?

851
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,370
And there can be big arguments about that,

852
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,027
but it's easy to be able to say,

853
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:57,817
"Okay, this off user there is not getting value

854
00:34:57,817 --> 00:34:59,017
"from what you're doing.

855
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:01,297
"This user over there with a big smile on their face.

856
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:04,147
"I am the moment of delight when something happened.

857
00:35:04,147 --> 00:35:05,910
"There's a value that's happened there."

858
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,740
I mean if you have to at least accept

859
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,840
that there is a concept of user value.

860
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,900
Even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it,

861
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,480
you can usually make relative arguments about it,

862
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,870
well this was better than this, we've improved things.

863
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:23,730
So, being a servant to the user is your job

864
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,155
when you're a developer.

865
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:27,480
You want to be producing something that

866
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,000
you know other people are gonna find valuable.

867
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,520
And if you are technically inclined,

868
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,760
then finding the right levers to be able to pull

869
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,830
to be able to make a design

870
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,990
that's going to produce the most value

871
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,700
for the least amount of effort.

872
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,010
And it always has to be kind of divide.

873
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,652
There's a ratio there where you,

874
00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:48,090
it's a problem at the big tech companies,

875
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,230
whether it's Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,

876
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,720
companies that have almost infinite money.

877
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,720
I mean, I know their CFO will complain

878
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,860
that it's not infinite money,

879
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,630
but from most developer standpoints

880
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,700
it really does feel like it.

881
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,890
And it's almost counterintuitive

882
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,950
that if you're working hard as a developer on something,

883
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,820
there's always this thought,

884
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,070
if only I had more resources,

885
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,682
more people, more RAM, more megahertz,

886
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:16,410
then my product will be better.

887
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,720
And that sense that at certain points,

888
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,830
it's certainly true that

889
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,110
if you are really hamstrung by this,

890
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,200
removing an obstacle will make a better product,

891
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,000
make more value.

892
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,120
But if you're not making your core design decisions

893
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,060
in this fiercely competitive way

894
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,790
where you're saying feature A or feature B,

895
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,141
you can't just say let's do both.

896
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:41,160
Because then you're not making a value judgment about them.

897
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,993
You're just saying,

898
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:42,937
"Well they both seem good.

899
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:44,317
"I don't wanna necessarily have

900
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:47,377
"to pick out which one is better or how much better

901
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:50,947
"and tell team B that, sorry, we're not gonna do this,

902
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:52,846
"because A is more important."

903
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:57,120
But that notion of always having to really critically value

904
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,021
what you're doing,

905
00:36:58,021 --> 00:36:59,700
the resources you expend,

906
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,610
even the opportunity cost of doing something else,

907
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,860
that's super important.

908
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,240
- Well let me ask you about this,

909
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,963
the debates that you're mentioning of how to measure value.

910
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,890
Is it possible to measure it kind of numerically

911
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,567
or can you do the sort of Johnny,

912
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:26,567
the design route of imagining sort of somebody using a thing

913
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,840
and imagining a smile on their face,

914
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,990
imagining the experience of love and joy

915
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,970
that you have when you use the thing,

916
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,320
that's from a design perspective

917
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,470
or if you're building more like a lower level thing

918
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,580
for like Linux,

919
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,730
you imagine a developer that might come across this

920
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:49,730
and use it and become happy and better off because of it.

921
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,620
So, where do you land on those things?

922
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,700
Is it measurable?

923
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,270
So, I imagine like Meta and Google,

924
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,920
will probably try to measure the thing,

925
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,753
they'll try to,

926
00:37:59,753 --> 00:38:01,980
it's like you try to optimize engagement or something,

927
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,270
let's measure engagement.

928
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,813
And then I think there is a kind of,

929
00:38:05,813 --> 00:38:09,390
I mean, I admire the designer ethic of like,

930
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,020
think of a future that's immeasurable

931
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,360
and you try to make somebody in that future

932
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,340
that's different from today happy.

933
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,460
- So, I do usually favor

934
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,820
if you can get any kind of a metric that's good,

935
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,890
by all means listen to the data.

936
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,270
But you can go too far there

937
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,107
where we've had problems where it's like,

938
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,577
"Hey, we had a performance regression,

939
00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:33,217
"because our fancy new telemetry system

940
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:35,977
"is doing a bazillion file rights

941
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:37,117
"to kind of archive this stuff,

942
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:38,707
"because we needed to collect information

943
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:42,660
"to determine if our plans were good."

944
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,570
So, when information is available,

945
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,010
you should never ignore it.

946
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,740
- From actual users using the thing,

947
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,420
human beings using the thing,

948
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,890
large number of human beings

949
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,218
and you get to see sort of at all large.

950
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:56,051
- So, there's zero to one problem

951
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:57,600
of when you're doing something really new,

952
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,310
you do kind of have to make a guess.

953
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,760
But one of the points that I've been making at Meta is

954
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,190
we have more than enough users now

955
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,490
that anything somebody wants to try in VR,

956
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,830
we have users that will be interested in that.

957
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,000
You do not get to make

958
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,870
a completely greenfield blue sky pitch and say,

959
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,950
I'm going to do this,

960
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,720
because I think it might be interesting.

961
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,160
I challenge everyone.

962
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,660
There are going to be people,

963
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,253
whether it's working in VR on your,

964
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:26,910
like on your desktop replacement

965
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,610
or communicating with people in different ways

966
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,189
or playing the games.

967
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:35,160
There are going to be probably millions of people

968
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,230
or at least if you pick some tiny niche

969
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,700
that we're not in right now,

970
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,425
there's still gonna be thousands of people out there

971
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,890
that have the headsets that would be your target market.

972
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,110
And I tell people, pay attention to them.

973
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,730
Don't invent fictional users,

974
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,280
don't make an Alice, Bob, Charlie

975
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,610
that fits whatever matrix of tendencies

976
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,410
that you want to break the market down to,

977
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,350
because it's a mistake to think about imaginary users

978
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,920
when you've got real users that you could be working with.

979
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,600
But on the other hand there is,

980
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,400
there is value to having a kind of wholeness of vision

981
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,540
for a product.

982
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,295
And companies like Meta have,

983
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:15,300
they understand the trade-offs

984
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,610
where you can have a company like SpaceX

985
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,250
or Apple in the Steve Jobs era

986
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,370
where you have a very powerful leading personality

987
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:26,700
that can micromanage at a very low level

988
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,370
and can say it's like, no, that handle needs to be different

989
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,640
or that icon needs to change the tint there.

990
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,980
And they clearly get a lot of value out of it.

991
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,230
They also burn through a lot of employees

992
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,700
that have horror stories

993
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,700
to tell about working there afterwards.

994
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,120
My position is that you are at your best

995
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,120
when you've got a leader that is at their limit

996
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,770
of what they can kind of comprehend

997
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,480
of everything below them

998
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,430
and they can have an informed opinion,

999
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,380
about everything that's going on.

1000
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,550
And you take somebody,

1001
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,850
you've gotta believe that somebody that has 30, 40 years

1002
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,110
of experience,

1003
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,700
you would hope that they've got wisdom

1004
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,550
that the the just out of bootcamp person,

1005
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,020
contributing doesn't have.

1006
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,150
And that if they're like, well that's wrong there,

1007
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,950
you probably shouldn't do it that way

1008
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,130
or even just don't do it that way, do it another way.

1009
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,510
So, there's value there,

1010
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,820
but it can't go beyond a certain level.

1011
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,090
I mean I have Steve Jobs stories of him saying,

1012
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,040
things that are just wrong right in front of me,

1013
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,210
about technical things,

1014
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,351
because he was not operating at that level.

1015
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,700
But when it does work

1016
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,010
and you do get that kind of passionate leader

1017
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,110
that's thinking about the entire product

1018
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,850
and just really deeply cares,

1019
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,580
about not letting anything slip through the cracks,

1020
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,590
I think that's got a lot of value.

1021
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,457
But the other side of that is the people saying that,

1022
00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:44,437
"Well, we wanna have these independent teams

1023
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:46,467
"that are bubbling up the ideas because"

1024
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:49,470
and like it's almost, it's anti-capitalist

1025
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,410
or anti-free market to say it's like I want my grand,

1026
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,790
my great leader to go ahead

1027
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,230
and dictate all these points there

1028
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:58,080
where clearly free markets bring up things that,

1029
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,340
you don't expect.

1030
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,800
Like in VR we saw a bunch of things,

1031
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,120
like it didn't turn out at all

1032
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,350
the way the early people thought

1033
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,060
were gonna be the key applications

1034
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,150
and things that would not have been approved by

1035
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,510
the dark cabal making the decisions about

1036
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,630
what gets into the store turn out to,

1037
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,039
in some cases be extremely successful.

1038
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,190
So yeah, I definitely kind of wanted

1039
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,200
to be there as a point where I did make a pitch.

1040
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,767
It's like, "Hey, make me VR dictator

1041
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:25,170
"and I'll go and get shit done."

1042
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,890
And it's not in the culture at Meta,

1043
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,657
they understand the trade offs.

1044
00:42:30,657 --> 00:42:33,000
And that's just not the way,

1045
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,530
that's not the company that they want,

1046
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,700
the team that they want to do.

1047
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,610
- Yeah, it's fascinating 'cause VR

1048
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,842
and we'll talk about it more.

1049
00:42:39,842 --> 00:42:43,030
It's still unclear to me

1050
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,920
in what way VR will change the world,

1051
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,000
because it does seem clear

1052
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,750
that VR will somehow fundamentally transform this world.

1053
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,880
And it's unclear to me how.

1054
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,601
- [John] Yeah, let me know when you wanna get into that.

1055
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:58,230
- We will, well hold on a second.

1056
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,790
So, stick to the, you being the best programmer ever,

1057
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,020
okay, in the early days

1058
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:08,010
when you didn't have adult responsibilities of leading teams

1059
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,360
and all that kind of stuff

1060
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,200
and you can focus on just being a programmer,

1061
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,150
what did the productive day

1062
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,790
in the life of John Carmack look like?

1063
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,550
How many hours of the keyboard, how much sleep?

1064
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,021
What was the source of calories that fueled the brain?

1065
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:26,473
What was it like, what time did you wake up?

1066
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:30,030
- So, I was able to be remarkably consistent about

1067
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,130
what was good working conditions for me

1068
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,973
for a very long time.

1069
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:37,830
I was never one of the programmers that I,

1070
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,330
that would do all-nighters,

1071
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,250
going through work for 20 hours straight.

1072
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,470
It's like my brain generally starts turning

1073
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,950
to mush after 12 hours or so,

1074
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,980
but the hard work is really important

1075
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,200
and I would work for decades.

1076
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,730
I would work 60 hours a week.

1077
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,110
I would work a 10 hour day,

1078
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,040
six days a week and try to be productive at that.

1079
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,140
Now, my schedule shifted around a fair amount

1080
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,759
when I was young without any kids,

1081
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:05,100
I am any other responsibilities,

1082
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,290
I was on one of those cycling schedules

1083
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,690
where I'd kind of get in an hour later each day

1084
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,180
and roll around through the entire time

1085
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,880
and I'd wind up kind of pulling in at two or three

1086
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,290
in the afternoon sometimes

1087
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,100
and then working again past midnight or two in the morning.

1088
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,765
And that was

1089
00:44:21,765 --> 00:44:25,260
when it was just me trying to make things happen

1090
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,290
and I was usually isolated off in my office.

1091
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,020
People generally didn't bother me much at it

1092
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,070
and I could get a lot of programming work done that way.

1093
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,350
I did settle into a more normal schedule

1094
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,410
when I was taking kids to school and things like that.

1095
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,717
- So, kids were the forcing function that got you to wake up

1096
00:44:42,717 --> 00:44:44,765
and at the same time these-

1097
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,720
- And it's not clear to me that

1098
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,338
there was a much of a difference in the productivity

1099
00:44:48,338 --> 00:44:52,200
with that where I kind of feel if I just get up

1100
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,190
when I feel like it,

1101
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,110
it's usually a little later each day.

1102
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,260
But I just recently made the focusing decision

1103
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,630
to try to push my schedule back a little bit earlier

1104
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,670
to getting up at eight in the morning

1105
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,860
and trying to shift things around.

1106
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,340
Like I'm often doing experiments with myself about

1107
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,890
what should I be doing to be more productive.

1108
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,320
And one of the things that I did realize

1109
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,060
was happening in recent months

1110
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,140
where I would go for a walk or a run.

1111
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:23,250
I cover like four miles a day and I would usually do that,

1112
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,190
just as the sun's going down at here in Texas now

1113
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,690
and it's still really damn hot.

1114
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,240
But I'd go out at 8:30 or something

1115
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,970
and cover the time there and then the showering

1116
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,680
and it was putting a hole in my day

1117
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,590
where I would have still a couple hours after that

1118
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,480
and sometimes my best hours were at night

1119
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,000
when nobody else is around, nobody's bothering me.

1120
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,100
But that hole in the day was a problem.

1121
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,490
So, just a couple weeks ago I made the change

1122
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,323
to go ahead and say,

1123
00:45:48,323 --> 00:45:49,387
"All right, I'm gonna get up a little earlier,

1124
00:45:49,387 --> 00:45:51,757
"I'm gonna do a walk or get out there first

1125
00:45:51,757 --> 00:45:54,000
"so I can have more uninterrupted time."

1126
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,130
So, I'm still playing with factors like this

1127
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,589
as I kind of optimize my work efforts.

1128
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:01,893
But it's always been,

1129
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:05,010
it was 60 hours a week for a very long time.

1130
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,290
To some degree I had a little thing in the back of my head

1131
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,630
where I was almost jealous of some of the programmers

1132
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,485
that would do these marathon sessions

1133
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:14,040
and I had like Dave Taylor, one of the guys that he had,

1134
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,210
he would be one of those people

1135
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,977
that would fall asleep under his desk sometimes

1136
00:46:16,977 --> 00:46:20,307
and all the kind of classic hacker tropes about things.

1137
00:46:20,307 --> 00:46:22,830
And a part of me was like always a little bothered

1138
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:23,730
that that wasn't me.

1139
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,210
That I wouldn't go program 20 hours straight,

1140
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,980
because I'm falling apart

1141
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,860
and not being very effective after 12 hours.

1142
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,450
I mean, yeah, a 12 hour programming,

1143
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,830
that's fine when you're doing that,

1144
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,640
but you're not doing smart work much after,

1145
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,010
at least I'm not, but there's a range of people.

1146
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:42,570
I mean that's something that a lot of people,

1147
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,430
don't really get in their gut

1148
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,310
where there are people that work on four hours of sleep

1149
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,530
and are smart and can continue to do good work,

1150
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,140
but then there's a lot of people that just fall apart.

1151
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,820
So, I do tell people

1152
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,400
that I always try to get eight hours of sleep.

1153
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,930
It's not this,

1154
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,970
push yourself harder, get up earlier.

1155
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,623
I just do worse work,

1156
00:47:02,795 --> 00:47:04,650
you can work a hundred hours a week

1157
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,240
and still get eight hours of sleep

1158
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,790
if you just kind of prioritize things correctly.

1159
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,950
But I do believe in working hard, working a lot.

1160
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:16,007
There was a comment that a game dev made that,

1161
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:19,440
that I know there's a backlash against really hard work

1162
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,580
in a lot of cases,

1163
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,820
and I get into online arguments about this all the time.

1164
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,960
But it was basically saying,

1165
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,810
yeah, 40 hours a week, that's kind of a part-time job

1166
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,850
and if are really in it,

1167
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,770
you're doing what you think is important,

1168
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:33,510
what you're passionate about,

1169
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,430
working more gets more done.

1170
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,730
And it's just really not possible

1171
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,980
to argue with that if you've been around the people

1172
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,200
that work with that level of intensity

1173
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,320
and just say it's like, no, they should just stop.

1174
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,391
And we had,

1175
00:47:47,391 --> 00:47:50,640
I kind of came back around to that a couple years ago

1176
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,060
where I was using the fictional example of,

1177
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,880
alright, some people say, they'll say with a straight face,

1178
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,950
they think no, you are less productive

1179
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,290
if you work more than 40 hours a week.

1180
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,210
And they're generally misinterpreting things

1181
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,030
where you're marginal productivity for an hour,

1182
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,120
after eight hours is less than in one of your peak hours,

1183
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,860
but you're not literally getting less done.

1184
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,410
There is a point where you start breaking things

1185
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,740
and getting worse behavior and everything out of it

1186
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,540
where you're literally going backwards,

1187
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,450
but it's not at eight or 10 or 12 hours.

1188
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,820
And the fictional example I would use was,

1189
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,885
imagine there's an asteroid coming to impact,

1190
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:29,909
to crash into earth destroy all of human life.

1191
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:34,320
Do you want Elon Musk or the people working at SpaceX

1192
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,790
that are building the interceptor

1193
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,610
that's going to deflect the asteroid?

1194
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,350
Do you want them to clock out at five,

1195
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,870
because damn it they're just gonna go do worse work

1196
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,597
if they work another couple hours.

1197
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:46,864
And it seems absurd

1198
00:48:46,864 --> 00:48:48,750
and that's a hypothetical though

1199
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,100
and everyone can dismiss that.

1200
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,200
But then when Coronavirus was hitting

1201
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,780
and you have all of these medical personnel

1202
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,230
that are clearly pushing themselves really, really hard.

1203
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,460
And I'd say it's like,

1204
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,130
okay, do you want all of these scientists,

1205
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:04,080
working on treatments and vaccines

1206
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,850
and caring for all of these people?

1207
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,890
Are they really screwing everything up

1208
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,960
by working more than eight hours a day?

1209
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,793
And of course people say,

1210
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:12,780
"I'm just an to say something like that,"

1211
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,360
but it's the truth.

1212
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,842
Working longer gets more done.

1213
00:49:17,842 --> 00:49:20,730
- So, that's kind of the layer one.

1214
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,630
But I'd like to also say that

1215
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,950
at least I believe depending on the person,

1216
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,840
depending on the task,

1217
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,637
working more and harder will make you better

1218
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:37,680
for the next week in those peak hours.

1219
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,380
So, there's something about a deep dedication to a thing

1220
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,850
that kind of gets deep in you.

1221
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,620
So, it's the hard work

1222
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,410
isn't just about the raw hours of productivity.

1223
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,350
It's the thing it does to you

1224
00:49:54,316 --> 00:49:56,447
in the weeks and months after too.

1225
00:49:56,447 --> 00:49:59,070
- You're tempering yourself in some ways.

1226
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,950
- And I think, it's like the "Jiro Dreams of Sushi."

1227
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,810
If you really dedicate yourself completely

1228
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,930
to making the sushi like to really putting in

1229
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:10,359
the long hours day after day after day,

1230
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:14,400
you become a true craftsman of the thing you're doing.

1231
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,290
Now there's of course discussions about

1232
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,930
are you sacrificing a lot of personal relationships?

1233
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:19,980
Are you sacrificing a lot

1234
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,740
of other possible things you could do with that time?

1235
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:27,740
But if you're talking about purely being a master

1236
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,630
or a craftsman of your art,

1237
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,920
that more hours isn't just about doing more,

1238
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,660
it's about becoming better at the thing you're doing.

1239
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,270
- Yeah and I don't gain say anybody that

1240
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,130
wants to work the minimum amount,

1241
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:42,930
they've got other priorities in their life.

1242
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,640
My only argument that I'm making,

1243
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,980
it's not that everybody should work hard,

1244
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,380
it's that if you want to accomplish something,

1245
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,820
working longer and harder

1246
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,310
is the path to getting it accomplished.

1247
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,280
- Well, let me ask you about this then.

1248
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,863
The mythical work-life balance,

1249
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:02,220
for an engineer,

1250
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:07,220
it seems like that's one of the professions for programmer

1251
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,260
where working hard does lead to greater productivity

1252
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,783
and but it also raises the question of,

1253
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,680
sort of personal relationships and all that kind of stuff,

1254
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,330
family and how are you able to find work-life balance?

1255
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:27,151
Is there advice you can give, maybe even outside yourself?

1256
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:29,880
Have you been able to arrive at any wisdom

1257
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,987
on this part in your years of life now?

1258
00:51:31,987 --> 00:51:34,560
- So, I do think that there's a wide range of people

1259
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,750
where different people have different needs.

1260
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,730
It's not a one size fits all.

1261
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,770
I am certainly what works for me.

1262
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,780
I can tell enough

1263
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,650
that I'm different than a typical average person

1264
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,052
in the way things impact me.

1265
00:51:48,052 --> 00:51:50,310
The things that I want to do,

1266
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,400
my goals are different and sort of the levers

1267
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,170
to impact things are different

1268
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:59,550
where I have literally never felt burnout.

1269
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,260
And I know there's lots of brilliant,

1270
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,370
smart people that do world leading work that get burned out

1271
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,720
and it's never hit me.

1272
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,942
I've never been at a point where I'm like,

1273
00:52:10,942 --> 00:52:13,200
I just don't care about this.

1274
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,790
I don't wanna do this anymore.

1275
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,410
But I've always had the flexibility

1276
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:18,930
to work on lots of interesting things.

1277
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:21,480
I can always just turn my gaze to something else

1278
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,550
and have a great time working on that.

1279
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,290
And so much of that,

1280
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:27,150
so much of the ability to actually work hard

1281
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,640
is the ability to have multiple things to choose from

1282
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,910
and to use your time on the most appropriate thing.

1283
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,150
Like there are time periods where I am,

1284
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,430
it's the best time for me to read a new research paper

1285
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,340
that I need to really be thinking hard about it.

1286
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,410
Then there's a time that maybe I should just scan

1287
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,730
and organize my old notes

1288
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:47,130
because I'm just not on top of things.

1289
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,360
Then there's the time that,

1290
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,480
alright, let's go,

1291
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,680
bang out a few hundred lines of code for something.

1292
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,620
So, switching between them has been,

1293
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,120
real valuable.

1294
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,730
- So, you always have kind of joy in your heart

1295
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,960
for all the things you're doing

1296
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,240
and that is a kind of work life balance

1297
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,808
as a first sort of step.

1298
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:06,360
So you're always happy?

1299
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,193
- I do.

1300
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:08,529
I mean it's like I,

1301
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:10,530
a lot of people would say that,

1302
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,840
often I look like kind of a grim person

1303
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,120
with just sitting there with a neutral expression

1304
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,380
or even like knitted brows

1305
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,810
and a frown on my face as I'm staring at something.

1306
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,640
- That's what happiness looks like for you.

1307
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,030
- Yeah, it's kind of true where that it's like,

1308
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:27,300
okay, I'm pushing this, I'm making progress here.

1309
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,120
I know that doesn't work for everyone.

1310
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,222
I know it doesn't work for most people.

1311
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:35,760
But what I am always trying to do in those cases is,

1312
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,090
I don't wanna let somebody that might be a person like that,

1313
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,627
be told by someone else that,

1314
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:44,220
"No, don't even try that out as an option,"

1315
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,780
where work life-balance versus kind of your life's work

1316
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,750
where there's a small subset of the people

1317
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,530
that can be very happy being obsessive about things

1318
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,950
and obsession can often get things done

1319
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,210
that just practical, prudent pedestrian work won't

1320
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,910
or at least won't for a very long time.

1321
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,950
- There's legends of your nutritional intake

1322
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,179
in the early days.

1323
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:16,179
What can you say about sort of as a being a programmer,

1324
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,393
as a kind of athlete?

1325
00:54:17,393 --> 00:54:21,240
So, what was the nutrition that fueled?

1326
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,271
- So, I have never been that great

1327
00:54:23,271 --> 00:54:26,160
on really paying attention to it

1328
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,580
where I'm good enough that I don't eat a lot,

1329
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,650
I've never been like a big heavy guy.

1330
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,290
But it was interesting where one of the things

1331
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,690
that I can remember being an unhappy teenager,

1332
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,647
not having enough money

1333
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:39,300
and like, one of the things

1334
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,160
that bothered me about not having enough money

1335
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,730
is I couldn't buy pizza whenever I wanted to.

1336
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,110
So I got rich and then I bought a whole lot of pizza.

1337
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:47,970
- So, that was defining,

1338
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,969
like that's what being rich felt like.

1339
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:51,104
You could buy Pizza.

1340
00:54:51,104 --> 00:54:51,937
- There was a lot pizza of the little things.

1341
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:53,190
Like I could buy all the pizza and comic books

1342
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,740
and video games that I wanted to,

1343
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,860
and it really didn't take that much.

1344
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,777
But the pizza was one of those things

1345
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:02,400
and it's absolutely true

1346
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,470
that for a long time it did software.

1347
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,690
I had a pizza delivered every single day.

1348
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:09,030
The delivery guy knew my name,

1349
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,670
and I didn't find out until years later

1350
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,890
that apparently I was such a good customer

1351
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,810
that they just never raised the price on me.

1352
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:18,840
And I was using this 6-year-old price for the pizzas

1353
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,510
that they were still kind of sending my way every day.

1354
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:25,440
- So, you were doing eating once a day or were you-

1355
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,430
- It would be spread out.

1356
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,340
You have a few pieces of pizza, you have some more later on,

1357
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,293
and I'd maybe have something at home.

1358
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:35,820
It was one of the nice things that Facebook Meta is they do,

1359
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,870
they feed you quite well.

1360
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,340
You get a different,

1361
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,650
I guess now it's DoorDash sorts of things delivered,

1362
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,600
but they take care of making sure

1363
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,370
that everybody does get well fed.

1364
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,490
And I probably had better food those six years

1365
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:49,560
that I was working in the Meta office there

1366
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,630
than I used to before.

1367
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,880
But it's worked out okay for me.

1368
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,260
My health has always been good.

1369
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,400
I get a pretty good amount of exercise

1370
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,650
and I don't eat to excess and I avoid a lot of other,

1371
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,690
kind of not so good for you things.

1372
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,610
So, I'm still doing quite well at my age.

1373
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,035
- Did you have a kind of,

1374
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:13,035
I don't know, spiritual experience with food or coffee

1375
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,090
or any of that kind of stuff?

1376
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:18,545
I mean, the programming experience with music,

1377
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:22,080
or like I listen to brown noise in a program

1378
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,510
or like creating an environment

1379
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,100
and the things you take into your body.

1380
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,580
Just everything you construct can become a kind of ritual

1381
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,190
that empowers the whole process of the program.

1382
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,964
Did you have that relationship with pizza?

1383
00:56:33,964 --> 00:56:36,117
- It would really be with Diet Coke.

1384
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:39,000
I mean, there still is that sense of drop the can down,

1385
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,530
crack open the can of Diet Coke.

1386
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,530
All right now, I mean business, we're getting to work here.

1387
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,277
- But still to this day,

1388
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,890
diet Coke is still part.

1389
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,530
- Yeah, probably eight, eight or nine a day.

1390
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:50,491
- Nice, okay.

1391
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:52,080
What about your setup?

1392
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,000
How many screens,

1393
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,070
what kind of keyboard is there something interesting,

1394
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:59,760
what kind of IDE, Emacs, Vim

1395
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,143
or something modern.

1396
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,110
Linux, what operating system laptop

1397
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,990
or any interesting thing that brings you joy?

1398
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,150
- So, I kind of migrated cultures

1399
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,400
where early on through all of game dev

1400
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,170
there was sort of one culture there,

1401
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,610
which was really quite distinct

1402
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:19,200
from the Silicon Valley venture culture for things.

1403
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,160
They're different groups

1404
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,650
and they have pretty different mos in the way they think

1405
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,513
about things where,

1406
00:57:23,513 --> 00:57:26,520
and I still do think a lot of the big companies

1407
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,560
can learn things

1408
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,200
from the hardcore game development side of things

1409
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,940
where it still boggles my mind

1410
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,940
how hostile to debuggers and IDEs that so much of them,

1411
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:40,920
the kind of big money get billions

1412
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,370
of dollars Silicon Valley venture backed funds are.

1413
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:45,203
- Oh, that's interesting.

1414
00:57:45,203 --> 00:57:48,090
Sorry, so you're saying like big companies

1415
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,160
at Google and Meta are hostile to-

1416
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,770
- They are not big on debuggers and IDEs.

1417
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,710
Like so much of it is like Emacs, Vim for things

1418
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,960
and we just assume that debuggers,

1419
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,178
don't work most of the time for the systems.

1420
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:03,780
And a lot of this comes from a sort of Linux bias

1421
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,420
on a lot of things where I did come up,

1422
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,060
through the personal computers and then the DOS,

1423
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,906
and then Windows

1424
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:15,573
and it was Borland tools and then Visual Studio.

1425
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,510
- [Lex] Do you appreciate debuggers?

1426
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:19,350
- Very much so.

1427
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:22,050
I mean, a debugger is how you get a view into a system

1428
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,880
that's too complicated to understand.

1429
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,830
I mean, anybody that thinks just read the code

1430
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,280
and think about it, that's an insane statement,

1431
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,050
you can't even read all the code on a big system.

1432
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,793
You have to do experiments on the system.

1433
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:36,960
And doing that by adding log statements,

1434
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,090
recompiling and rerunning it,

1435
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,160
is an incredibly inefficient way of doing it.

1436
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,530
I mean, yes, you can always get things done,

1437
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,458
even if you're working with stone knives and bare skins.

1438
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:49,320
That is the mark of a good programmer is that,

1439
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,530
given any tools, you will figure out a way to get it done.

1440
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,840
But it's amazing what you can do

1441
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,210
with sometimes much, much better tools

1442
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,910
where instead of just going through this iterative,

1443
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,130
compile, run debug cycle,

1444
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:05,760
you have the old Lips direction of like you've got a riple

1445
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,050
and you're working interactively

1446
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,370
and doing amazing things there,

1447
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,410
but in many cases a debugger

1448
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:13,440
as a very powerful user interface that can stop,

1449
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,540
examine all the different things in your program,

1450
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,980
set all of these different break points.

1451
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,220
And of course you can do that with GDB or whatever there,

1452
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:24,030
but this is one of the user interface fundamental principles

1453
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,670
where when something is complicated to do,

1454
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,500
you won't use it very often.

1455
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,660
There's people that will break out GDB

1456
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,980
when they're at their wits end

1457
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,050
and they just have beat their head against a problem

1458
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,190
for so long.

1459
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:37,890
But for somebody that kind of grew up in game dev,

1460
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:40,110
it's like they were running into the debugger anyways,

1461
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,180
before they even knew there was a problem.

1462
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,850
And you would just stop and see what was happening.

1463
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,410
And sometimes you could fix things,

1464
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:50,610
even before you know, even before you did one compile cycle,

1465
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,200
you could be in the debugger and you could say,

1466
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,720
well, I'm just going to change this right here and yep,

1467
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,000
that did the job and fix it and go on.

1468
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,260
- And for people don't know,

1469
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,000
GDB is a sort of popular,

1470
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I guess Linux debugger primarily for C plus plus.

1471
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,190
- They handle most of the languages.

1472
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:08,600
Okay, but it's based on C

1473
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,440
as the original kind of Unix heritage.

1474
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,790
- And it's kind of like command line,

1475
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:12,870
it's not user friendly.

1476
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:15,540
It doesn't allow for clean visualizations

1477
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,250
and you're exactly right.

1478
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,990
So, you're using this kind of debugger,

1479
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,060
usually when you're at what's end

1480
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,430
and there's a problem that you can't figure out why

1481
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:26,010
by just looking at the codes they have to find it.

1482
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,620
That's how, I guess normal programmers use it.

1483
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,090
But you're saying there should be tools

1484
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,980
that kind of visualize

1485
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,340
and help you as part of the programming process,

1486
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,037
just a normal programming process

1487
01:00:37,037 --> 01:00:39,960
to understand the code deeper?

1488
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,930
- Yeah, when I'm working on like my C, C plus plus code,

1489
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,600
I'm always running it from the debugger,

1490
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,480
just I type in the code, I run it many times.

1491
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,280
The first thing I do after writing code

1492
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,070
is set a break point and step through the function.

1493
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:53,940
Now other people will say,

1494
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,530
it's like, "Oh, I do that in my head."

1495
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:57,840
Well, your head is a faulty interpreter

1496
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,130
of all those things there

1497
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,080
and I've written brand new code,

1498
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,040
I wanna step in there

1499
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,510
and I'm gonna single step through that,

1500
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:06,390
examine lots of things and see if it's actually doing

1501
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:07,951
what I expected it to.

1502
01:01:07,951 --> 01:01:12,210
- It it is a kind of companion, the debugger,

1503
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,880
like you're now coding in an interactive way

1504
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,980
with another being,

1505
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,470
the debugger is a kind of dumb being,

1506
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:21,075
but it's a reliable being.

1507
01:01:21,075 --> 01:01:24,210
That is an interesting question of what role does AI play

1508
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:26,670
in that kind of with Codex

1509
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:30,630
and these kind of ability to generate code might be,

1510
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,290
you might start having tools that understand the code

1511
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,163
in interesting deep ways that can work with you.

1512
01:01:37,163 --> 01:01:39,060
- Because there's a whole spectrum there

1513
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,340
from static code analyzers

1514
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:44,490
and various kind of dynamic tools there up to AI

1515
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:46,680
that can conceivably grok these programs

1516
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,080
that literally no human can understand.

1517
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,990
There are two big too intertwined and too interconnected,

1518
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,960
but it's not beyond the possibility of understanding.

1519
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,840
It's just beyond what we can hold in our heads

1520
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,900
as kind of mutable state while we're working on things.

1521
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,270
And I'm a big proponent again

1522
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:06,180
of things like static analyzers and some of that stuff

1523
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,310
where you'll find some people

1524
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:11,280
that don't like being scolded by a program

1525
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,690
for how they've written something

1526
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:14,160
where it's like, "Oh, I know better."

1527
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,450
And sometimes you do.

1528
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,970
But that was something that I was,

1529
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:21,630
it was very, very valuable for me when

1530
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,670
and not too many people get an opportunity like this

1531
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:26,100
to have, this is almost one of those spiritual experiences

1532
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,521
as a programmer and awakening to,

1533
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:30,360
be it in software code bases

1534
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,280
were a couple million lines of code.

1535
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,740
And at one point I had used a few

1536
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,360
of the different analysis tools,

1537
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,630
but I made a point to really go through

1538
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,987
and scrub the code base using every tool that I could find.

1539
01:02:42,987 --> 01:02:45,660
And it was eye-opening where we had a reputation

1540
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,580
for having some of the, the most robust, strongest code,

1541
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,760
where there were some great things

1542
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,750
that I remember hearing

1543
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:55,020
from like Microsoft telling us about crashes on Xbox

1544
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,850
and we had this tiny number that they said

1545
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:59,430
were probably literally hardware errors.

1546
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,440
And then you have other significant titles

1547
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,450
that just have millions of faults

1548
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,950
that are getting recorded all the time.

1549
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,650
So, I was proud of our code on a lot of levels,

1550
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,740
but when I took this code analysis squeegee,

1551
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:11,814
through everything,

1552
01:03:11,814 --> 01:03:16,770
it was shocking how many errors there were in there.

1553
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:17,767
Things that you can say,

1554
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:19,747
"Okay, this was a copy paste,

1555
01:03:19,747 --> 01:03:21,750
"not changing something right here."

1556
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,310
Lots of things that were,

1557
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,010
the most common problem was something

1558
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,160
in a print F format string that was the wrong data type

1559
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,510
that could cause crashes there

1560
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:33,390
and you really want the warnings for things like that.

1561
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:36,210
Then the next most common was missing a check for null

1562
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,490
that could actually happen that could blow things up.

1563
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:41,640
And those are obviously like top C, C plus plus things.

1564
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,410
Everybody has those problems,

1565
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:46,260
but the long tail of all of the different little things

1566
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,550
that could go wrong there.

1567
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,620
And we had good programmers and my own code,

1568
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,090
it's not that I'd be looking at,

1569
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,790
it's like, "Oh, I wrote that code, that's definitely wrong."

1570
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,190
We've been using this for a year

1571
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,530
and it's this submarine,

1572
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:01,740
this mind sitting there waiting for us to step on.

1573
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,889
And it was humbling.

1574
01:04:03,889 --> 01:04:07,560
And I reached the conclusion that anything

1575
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,800
that can be syntactically allowed in your language,

1576
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,440
if it's gonna show up eventually

1577
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,809
in a large enough code base,

1578
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,080
you're not gonna,

1579
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,780
good intentions aren't going to keep it from happening.

1580
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,810
You need automated tools and guardrails for things.

1581
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,090
And those start with things like static types

1582
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:27,000
and or even type hints in the more dynamic languages.

1583
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,890
But the people that rebel against that basically say,

1584
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,660
that slows me down doing that.

1585
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,000
There's something to that I get that I've written,

1586
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,070
I've cobbled things together in a notebook.

1587
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:41,010
I'm like, "Wow, this is great that it just happened,"

1588
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,410
but yeah, that's kind of sketchy, but it's working fine.

1589
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:44,243
I don't care.

1590
01:04:44,243 --> 01:04:47,130
It does come back to that value analysis

1591
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,770
where sometimes it's right to not care,

1592
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:51,390
but when you do care,

1593
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,880
if it's going to be something that's going to live for years

1594
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,003
and it's gonna have other people working on it

1595
01:04:56,003 --> 01:04:59,040
and it's gonna be deployed to millions of people,

1596
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,280
then you want to use all of these tools you want to be told.

1597
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,350
It's like, no, you've screwed up here, here and here.

1598
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:08,040
And that does require kind of an ego check about things

1599
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,760
where you have to be open to the fact that everything

1600
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,040
that you're doing is just littered with flaws.

1601
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,380
It's not that, "Oh, you occasionally have a bad day,"

1602
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,200
it's just whatever stream of code you output

1603
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,780
there is going to be a statistical regularity of things

1604
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,150
that you just make mistakes on.

1605
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:27,840
And I do think there's the whole argument about,

1606
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,720
test driven design and unit testing versus,

1607
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,030
kind of analysis and different things.

1608
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:36,030
I am more in favor of the analysis and the stuff

1609
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:36,863
that just like,

1610
01:05:36,863 --> 01:05:38,700
you can't run your program until you fix this,

1611
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,230
rather than you can run it

1612
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:42,460
and hopefully a unit test will catch it in some way.

1613
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,680
- Yeah, in my private code I have asserts everywhere.

1614
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,790
- [John] Yeah.

1615
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:51,240
- It just, there's something pleasant to me,

1616
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,350
pleasurable to me,

1617
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:55,290
about sort of the dictatorial rule of like,

1618
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,333
this should be true at this point.

1619
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,853
And too many times,

1620
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:05,100
I've made mistakes that shouldn't have been made

1621
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,460
and I would assume I wouldn't be the kind of person

1622
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,360
that would make that mistake,

1623
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,590
but I keep making that mistake.

1624
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:13,950
Therefore, an assert really catches me,

1625
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,390
really helps all the time.

1626
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:19,020
So, I would say like 10 to 20% of my private code,

1627
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,390
just for personal use is probably a service.

1628
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:22,650
- And they're active comments.

1629
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,196
It's one of those things that in theory

1630
01:06:24,196 --> 01:06:27,210
they don't make any difference to the program.

1631
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,590
And if it was all operating

1632
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:30,180
the way you expected it would be,

1633
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,730
then they will never fire.

1634
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,650
But even if you have it right

1635
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,810
and you wrote the code right initially,

1636
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:38,370
then circumstances change.

1637
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,830
The world outside your program changes.

1638
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,900
And in fact that's one of the things

1639
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,480
where I'm kind of fond in a lot of cases

1640
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,550
of static erase size declarations

1641
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,860
where I went through this period where it's like,

1642
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,960
okay, now we have general collection classes,

1643
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,097
we should just make everything variable,

1644
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:56,250
because I had this history of,

1645
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,350
in the early days you get Doom,

1646
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,823
which had some fixed limits on it,

1647
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:02,550
then everybody started making crazier and crazier things

1648
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:04,200
and they kept bumping up the different limits,

1649
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,780
this many lines, this many sectors.

1650
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,030
And it seemed like a good idea.

1651
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,890
Well, we should just make this completely generic.

1652
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:13,770
It can go kind of go up to whatever

1653
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:17,340
and there's cases where that's the right thing to do.

1654
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,630
But it also,

1655
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:21,570
the other aspect of the world changing around you is

1656
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,610
it's good to be informed when the world

1657
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:25,710
has changed more than you thought it would.

1658
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,410
And if you've got a continuously growing collection,

1659
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:29,550
you're never gonna find out.

1660
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:32,190
You might have this quadratic slowdown on something

1661
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,157
where you thought,

1662
01:07:33,157 --> 01:07:35,677
"Oh, I'm only ever gonna have a handful of these,

1663
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:38,167
"but something changes and there's a new design style

1664
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:40,800
"and all of a sudden you've got 10,000 of them."

1665
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,910
So, I kind like in many cases picking a number,

1666
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:47,550
some nice round power of two number

1667
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:48,810
and sending it up in there

1668
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:50,107
and having an assert saying it's like,

1669
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:52,170
"Hey, you hit this limit."

1670
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,360
You should probably think about the choices

1671
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,940
that you've made around all of this still relevant

1672
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,460
if somebody's using 10 times more than

1673
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,360
you thought they would?

1674
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,640
- Yeah, this code was originally written

1675
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,410
with this kind of worldview,

1676
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,188
with this kind of set of constraints.

1677
01:08:06,188 --> 01:08:09,390
You were thinking of the world in this way.

1678
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:10,470
If something breaks,

1679
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:12,780
that means you gotta rethink the initial stuff.

1680
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:16,500
And it's nice for it to for it to do that.

1681
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,741
Is there any stuff like keyboard or monitors?

1682
01:08:20,741 --> 01:08:23,850
- I'm fairly pedestrian on a lot of that

1683
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,189
where I did move to triple monitors,

1684
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:27,720
like in the last several years ago.

1685
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,272
I had been dual monitor for a very long time

1686
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,790
and it was one of those things

1687
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:35,700
where probably years later than I should have,

1688
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,533
I'm just like,

1689
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:38,729
well the video cards now generally have three output ports.

1690
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:40,439
I should just put the third monitor up there.

1691
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:41,939
That's been a pure win.

1692
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:43,943
I've been very happy with that.

1693
01:08:43,943 --> 01:08:45,060
But no,

1694
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,220
I don't have fancy keyboard or mouse

1695
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,810
or anything really going on.

1696
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:50,279
- The key things is an ID

1697
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:54,120
that has helpful debuggers has helpful tools,

1698
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,000
so it's not the Emacs, Vim route and then Diet Coke.

1699
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,830
- Yeah, so I did spend,

1700
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,979
I spent one of my week-long retreats where I'm like,

1701
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:03,986
okay, I'm gonna make myself use,

1702
01:09:03,986 --> 01:09:05,580
it was actually classic VI,

1703
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,479
which I know people will say

1704
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:07,410
you should never have done that.

1705
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:09,359
You should have just used Vim directly.

1706
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,370
But I gave it the good try.

1707
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:13,529
It's like, okay, I'm being in kind of,

1708
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:15,779
classic Unix developer mode here

1709
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:18,630
and I worked for a week on it.

1710
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:20,328
I used end key to like teach myself

1711
01:09:20,328 --> 01:09:24,029
the different little key combinations for things like that.

1712
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:25,710
And in the end it was just like,

1713
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:26,542
alright,

1714
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:29,010
this was kind of like my civil war reenactment phase,

1715
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:30,029
it's like I'm going out there,

1716
01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:32,010
doing it like they used to in the old days.

1717
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,660
And it was kind of fun in that regard.

1718
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:36,216
- You're offending so many people right now,

1719
01:09:36,216 --> 01:09:38,716
they're screaming as they're listening to this.

1720
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,250
- So again, the out is that this was not modern Vim,

1721
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:44,670
but still yes, I was very happy to get back

1722
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:46,859
to my visual studio at the end.

1723
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:49,590
- Yeah, I'm actually, I struggle with this a lot,

1724
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:52,140
because, so I use a Kinesis keyboard

1725
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:55,233
and I use Emacs primarily,

1726
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:59,160
and I feel like I can exactly as you said,

1727
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,863
I can understand the code, I can navigate the code.

1728
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,750
There's a lot of stuff you could build within Emacs

1729
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:04,860
with using Lisp.

1730
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,320
You can customize a lot of things for yourself

1731
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,930
to help you introspect the code,

1732
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:11,640
like to help you understand the code

1733
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,080
and visualize different aspects of the code.

1734
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,550
You can even run debuggers,

1735
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:18,960
but it's work and the world moves past you

1736
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,930
and the better and better ideas are constantly being built.

1737
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,440
And that puts a kind of,

1738
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,240
I need to take the same kind of retreat

1739
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,320
as you're talking about,

1740
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,870
but now I'm still fighting the Civil War.

1741
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:32,807
I need to kind of move into the 21st century.

1742
01:10:32,807 --> 01:10:35,360
- And it does seem like the world is

1743
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,720
or a large chunk of the world

1744
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,670
is moving towards Visual Studio Code,

1745
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,410
which is kind of interesting to me,

1746
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:43,230
against the JavaScript ecosystem on the one hand

1747
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:45,420
and IDEs are one of those things

1748
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,880
that you want to be infinitely fast.

1749
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:51,000
You want them to just kind of immediately respond.

1750
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,433
And like, I mean, heck, I've got, there's someone I know,

1751
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:55,170
I am an old school game dev guy

1752
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:57,450
that still uses Visual Studio Six

1753
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,142
and on a modern computer,

1754
01:10:59,142 --> 01:11:03,000
everything is just absolutely instant on something like that

1755
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,680
because it was made to work on a computer

1756
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,860
that's 10,000 or a hundred thousand times slower.

1757
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,440
So, just everything happens immediately

1758
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,560
and all the modern systems just feel,

1759
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,277
they feel so crufty when it's like,

1760
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:18,127
"Oh, why is this refreshing the screen and moving around

1761
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:20,587
"and updating over here and something blinks down there

1762
01:11:20,587 --> 01:11:21,870
"and you should update this."

1763
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:25,710
And there are things that we've lost

1764
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,420
with that incredible flexibility,

1765
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,080
but lots of people get tons of value from it.

1766
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,090
And I am super happy that that seems

1767
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:35,130
to be winning over even a lot of the old Vim

1768
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,057
and Emacs people that they're kind of like,

1769
01:11:37,057 --> 01:11:40,110
"Hey, Visual Studio code is may be not so bad."

1770
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:43,245
I am that may be the final peacekeeping solution

1771
01:11:43,245 --> 01:11:45,630
where everybody is reasonably happy

1772
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,355
with something like that.

1773
01:11:47,355 --> 01:11:50,550
- So, can you explain what a dot plan file is

1774
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,400
and what role that played in your life?

1775
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,530
Does it still continue to play a role?

1776
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:57,910
- Back in the early, early days of id Software,

1777
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:01,200
one of our big things that was unique with what we did

1778
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,020
is I had adopted next stations

1779
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,304
or kind of next steps systems

1780
01:12:05,304 --> 01:12:10,304
from Steve Jobs's out in the woods way from Apple Company.

1781
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:15,210
And they were basically, it was kind of interesting,

1782
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,190
because I did not really have a background

1783
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,060
with the Unix system.

1784
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,020
So, many of the people,

1785
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,434
they get immersed in that in college

1786
01:12:21,434 --> 01:12:26,434
and that sets a lot of cultural expectations for them.

1787
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,310
And I didn't have any of that,

1788
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:31,630
but I knew that my background was,

1789
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:33,780
I was a huge Apple II fan, boy,

1790
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,480
I was always a little suspicious of the Mac.

1791
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,830
I was not really

1792
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:41,430
what kind of I wanted to to go with.

1793
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:44,251
But when Steve Jobs left Apple and started NeXT,

1794
01:12:44,251 --> 01:12:45,990
this computer did just seem like one

1795
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,820
of those amazing things from the future

1796
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,490
where it had all of this cool stuff in it.

1797
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:52,380
And we were still back in those days,

1798
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,270
working on DOS, everything blew up.

1799
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,590
You had reset buttons,

1800
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:57,060
because your computer would just freeze

1801
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:58,440
if you're doing development work,

1802
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,970
literally dozens of times a day.

1803
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:02,460
Your computer was just rebooting constantly.

1804
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,870
And so this idea of,

1805
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:06,450
yes, any of the Unix workstations,

1806
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:08,670
would've given a stable development platform

1807
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:11,460
where you don't crash and reboot all the time.

1808
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,600
But NeXT also had this really amazing graphical interface

1809
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,490
and it was great for building tools

1810
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:21,480
and it used objective C as the kind of an interesting.

1811
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,664
- [Lex] Oh wow.

1812
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:26,160
So, NeXT was Unix based, instead objective C.

1813
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,810
So, it has a lot of the elements.

1814
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:28,740
- That became Mac,

1815
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,470
I mean the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple by NeXT,

1816
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:32,820
where that took over

1817
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:35,280
and became what the modern Mac system is.

1818
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,960
- And defined some of the developer like the tools

1819
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,080
and the whole community.

1820
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,270
- Yeah, you've still got,

1821
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:43,313
if you're programming on Apple stuff now,

1822
01:13:43,313 --> 01:13:45,660
there's still all these Ns somethings

1823
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,670
which was originally next step objects

1824
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,440
of different kinds of things.

1825
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,920
But one of the aspects of those Unix systems

1826
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,503
was they had this notion of a dot plan file where,

1827
01:13:56,503 --> 01:13:58,136
a dot file is an invisible file,

1828
01:13:58,136 --> 01:14:02,040
usually in your home directory or something.

1829
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,390
And there was a trivial server,

1830
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:05,905
running on most Unix systems at the time that,

1831
01:14:05,905 --> 01:14:09,630
that when somebody ran a trivial little command,

1832
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:10,680
called finger,

1833
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,530
you could a finger and then somebody's address,

1834
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,150
it could be anywhere on the internet

1835
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,770
if you were connected correctly,

1836
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:20,730
then all that server would do was read the dot plan file

1837
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,500
in that user's home directory

1838
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,480
and then just spit it out to you.

1839
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,621
And originally the idea was that could be,

1840
01:14:26,621 --> 01:14:30,060
whether you're on vacation, what your current project was,

1841
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,280
it's supposed to be like the plan of what you're doing

1842
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,700
and people would use it for, various purposes.

1843
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:38,430
But all it did was dump that file,

1844
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:42,220
over to the terminal of whoever issued the finger command.

1845
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:47,130
And at one point I started just keeping a list of

1846
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:48,870
what I was doing in there,

1847
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:51,060
which would be what I was working on in the day.

1848
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,610
And I would have this little syntax,

1849
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:55,740
I kind of got to myself about,

1850
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:57,150
here's something that I'm working on,

1851
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:58,710
I put a star when I finish it,

1852
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:01,410
I could have a few other little bits of punctuation.

1853
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,910
And at the time it was,

1854
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:05,550
it started off as being just like my to-do list

1855
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:08,793
and it would be these trivial obscure little things,

1856
01:15:10,054 --> 01:15:12,750
like I fixed something with collision detection code,

1857
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,910
made Fireball do something different

1858
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,710
and just little one-liners that people

1859
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:20,070
that were following the games could kind of decipher.

1860
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:22,350
But I did wind up starting

1861
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,240
to write much more in depth things.

1862
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:28,500
I would have little notes of thoughts and insights

1863
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,450
and then I would eventually start having little essays.

1864
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:33,060
I would sometimes dump into the dot plan files,

1865
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,240
interspersed with the work logs of things that I was doing.

1866
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,630
So, in some ways it was like a super early proto blog

1867
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:42,690
where I was just kind of dumping out what I was working on.

1868
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:44,250
But it was interesting enough

1869
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,869
that there were a lot of people

1870
01:15:45,869 --> 01:15:48,780
that were interested in this.

1871
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,300
So, most of the people didn't have Unix workstations.

1872
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,340
So, there were the websites back in the day

1873
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,530
that would follow the Doom and Quake development

1874
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:58,410
that would basically make a little service

1875
01:15:58,410 --> 01:15:59,820
that would go grab all the changes

1876
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,250
and then people could just get it with a web browser.

1877
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,150
And there was a period

1878
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:06,930
where like all of the little kind of Dallas gaming diaspora

1879
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:09,390
of people that were at all in that orbit,

1880
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:12,270
there were a couple dozen plan files going on,

1881
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:14,640
which was, and this was some years,

1882
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,220
before blogging really became kind of a thing.

1883
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:20,460
And it was kind of a premonition

1884
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,260
of sort of the way things would go.

1885
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,689
And there was,

1886
01:16:23,689 --> 01:16:25,080
it's all been collected,

1887
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,120
it's available online in different places

1888
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,320
and it's kind of fun to go back

1889
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,435
and look through what I was thinking,

1890
01:16:30,435 --> 01:16:32,460
what I was doing in the different areas.

1891
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,740
- Have you had a chance to look back?

1892
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:34,717
Is there some interesting,

1893
01:16:34,717 --> 01:16:38,760
very low level specific to-do items,

1894
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,440
maybe things you've never completed,

1895
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,490
all that kind of stuff

1896
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:45,030
and high level philosophical essay type of stuff

1897
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:46,350
that stands out.

1898
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:48,420
- Yeah, there's some good stuff on both,

1899
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,020
where a lot of it was low level nitpicky details,

1900
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:55,860
about game dev and I've learned enough things

1901
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,320
where there's no project that I worked on

1902
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,630
that I couldn't go back and do a better job on now.

1903
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:03,870
I mean you learn things hopefully if you're doing it right,

1904
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:05,370
you learn things as you get older

1905
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,350
and you should be able to do a better job

1906
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:08,427
at all of the early things.

1907
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:12,187
And there's stuff in Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake that like,

1908
01:17:12,187 --> 01:17:15,810
"Oh, clearly I could go back and do a better job at this."

1909
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:17,577
Whether it's something in the rendering engine side

1910
01:17:17,577 --> 01:17:20,970
or how I implemented the monster behaviors

1911
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,650
or managed resources.

1912
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:25,377
- Do you see flaws in your thinking now looking back?

1913
01:17:25,377 --> 01:17:27,000
- Yeah, I do.

1914
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,070
I mean sometimes I'll get the,

1915
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:29,903
I'll look at it and say,

1916
01:17:29,903 --> 01:17:31,687
"Yeah, I had a pretty clear view of,

1917
01:17:31,687 --> 01:17:33,990
"I was doing good work there"

1918
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:35,970
and I haven't really hit the point

1919
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:38,820
where there was another programmer, Graham Devine,

1920
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,837
he had worked at id and 7th Guest

1921
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:44,190
and he made some comment one time where he said,

1922
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:45,750
he looked back at some of his old notes

1923
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:48,810
and he was like, "Wow, I was really smart back then."

1924
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:51,533
And I don't hit that so much where,

1925
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:54,330
I mean, I look at it and I always know that,

1926
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:56,010
yeah, there's all the,

1927
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,630
with aging you get certain changes

1928
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:00,090
in how you're able to work problems.

1929
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:02,194
But all of the problems that I've worked,

1930
01:18:02,194 --> 01:18:06,300
I'm sure that I could do a better job on all of them.

1931
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,133
- Oh wow.

1932
01:18:07,133 --> 01:18:08,430
- So, you can still step right in.

1933
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:10,950
If you could travel back in time and talk to that guy,

1934
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:12,120
you would teach him a few things.

1935
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,250
- [John] Yeah, absolutely.

1936
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,302
- That's awesome.

1937
01:18:15,302 --> 01:18:18,030
What about the high level philosophical stuff?

1938
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:20,640
Is there some insights that stand out that you remember?

1939
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,410
- There's things that I was understanding about development

1940
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,510
and the industry

1941
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:31,380
and so on that we're in a more primitive stage,

1942
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:35,490
where I definitely learned a lot more

1943
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:38,040
in the later years about business

1944
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,370
and organization and team structure.

1945
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:43,239
There were, I mean,

1946
01:18:43,239 --> 01:18:46,890
there were definitely things that I was not the best person

1947
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:48,960
or even a very good person about managing,

1948
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,630
like how a a team should operate internally,

1949
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:53,490
how people should work together.

1950
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:54,510
I was just,

1951
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:58,740
the just get outta my way and let me work on the code

1952
01:18:58,740 --> 01:18:59,573
and do this.

1953
01:18:59,573 --> 01:19:02,460
And more and more I've learned how

1954
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:05,010
in the larger scheme of things,

1955
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:07,260
how sometimes relatively unimportant,

1956
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:08,400
some of those things are

1957
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,070
where it is this user value generation.

1958
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:14,182
That's the overarching importance for all of that.

1959
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:18,000
And I didn't necessarily have my eye on that ball correctly

1960
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,775
through a lot of my earlier years.

1961
01:19:20,775 --> 01:19:23,400
And there's things that,

1962
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,370
I could have gotten more out of people handling things

1963
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:27,537
in different ways.

1964
01:19:27,537 --> 01:19:32,040
I could have made in some ways more successful products

1965
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,840
by following things in different ways.

1966
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,370
There's mistakes that we made

1967
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:37,200
that we couldn't really have known

1968
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,550
how things would've worked out.

1969
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:40,740
But it was interesting to see in later years,

1970
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,450
companies like Activision showing that,

1971
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:45,000
hey, you really can just do the same game,

1972
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,620
make it better every year.

1973
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,630
And you can look at that from a negative standpoint

1974
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:49,463
and say it's like,

1975
01:19:49,463 --> 01:19:51,540
"Oh, that's just being derivative and all that."

1976
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,430
But if you step back again and say it's like,

1977
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,317
no, are the people buying it still enjoying it?

1978
01:19:55,317 --> 01:19:56,790
Are they enjoying it more than

1979
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:59,130
what they might have bought otherwise?

1980
01:19:59,130 --> 01:19:59,963
And you can say,

1981
01:19:59,963 --> 01:20:03,127
"No, that's actually a great value creation engine

1982
01:20:03,127 --> 01:20:05,839
"to do that if you're in a position where you can."

1983
01:20:05,839 --> 01:20:09,330
Don't be forced into reinventing everything,

1984
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:12,106
just because you think that you need to,

1985
01:20:12,106 --> 01:20:15,270
lots of things about business

1986
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,040
and team stuff that could be done better.

1987
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,093
But the technical work

1988
01:20:18,093 --> 01:20:20,760
that the kind of technical visionary type stuff

1989
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,910
that I laid out, I still feel pretty good about.

1990
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:27,390
There are some classical ones about my defending of OpenGL,

1991
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:32,220
versus D3D, which turned out to be one of the more,

1992
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:36,510
probably important momentous things there where it never,

1993
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:38,880
it was always a rear guard action on Windows

1994
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,300
where Microsoft was just not gonna let that win.

1995
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,370
But when I look back on it now,

1996
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,710
that fight to keep OpenGL relevant

1997
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:50,250
for a number of years there meant that OpenGL

1998
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,590
was there when mobile started happening.

1999
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:55,620
And OpenGL ES was the thing that drove,

2000
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:58,560
all of the acceleration of the mobile industry.

2001
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,930
And it's really only in the last few years

2002
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,520
as Apple has moved to Metal

2003
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,010
and some of the other companies have moved to Vulcan,

2004
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:06,750
that that's moved away.

2005
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:09,420
But really stepping back and looking at it,

2006
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,940
it's like, yeah, I sold tens of millions of games

2007
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,620
for different things,

2008
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:17,400
but billions and billions of devices wound up

2009
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,600
with an appropriate capable graphics API

2010
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,400
in no small part to me,

2011
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,200
thinking that that was really important

2012
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:29,193
that we not just give up and use Microsoft's,

2013
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:32,667
at that time really terrible, API.

2014
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:35,850
The thing about Microsoft is the APIs don't stay terrible.

2015
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,590
They were terrible at the start,

2016
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:40,080
but a few versions on they were actually quite good.

2017
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,480
And there was a completely fair argument to be made

2018
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,060
that by the time DX9 was out,

2019
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:47,250
it was probably a better programming environment

2020
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,450
than OpenGL.

2021
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:51,120
But it was still a wonderful good thing

2022
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,270
that we had an open standard that could show up on Linux

2023
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:58,650
and Android and iOS and eventually WebGL still to this day.

2024
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:02,670
So, that was one that would be on my greatest hits list

2025
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:04,263
of things that I kind of pushed-

2026
01:22:04,263 --> 01:22:07,710
- Impact it had on billions of devices, yes.

2027
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,940
So, let's talk about it.

2028
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:12,420
Can you tell the origin story of id Software,

2029
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,350
again, one of the greatest game developer companies ever.

2030
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:18,510
It created Wolfenstein 3D,

2031
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:22,590
games that define my life also in many ways

2032
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:24,810
as a thing that made me realize what computers

2033
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:26,327
are capable of in terms of graphics,

2034
01:22:26,327 --> 01:22:28,380
in terms of performance.

2035
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:32,040
It just unlocks something deep in me

2036
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,230
and understanding what these machines are all about,

2037
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,160
as games can do that.

2038
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,120
So, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake

2039
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,710
and just all the incredible engineering innovation

2040
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:41,907
that went into that.

2041
01:22:41,907 --> 01:22:44,310
So, how did it all start?

2042
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,930
- So, I'll caveat upfront

2043
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:49,470
that I usually don't consider myself the historian

2044
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:51,480
of the software side of things.

2045
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,620
I usually do.

2046
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:55,020
I kind of point people at John Romero

2047
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:00,020
for stories about the early days where I've never been,

2048
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:00,983
like I've commented

2049
01:23:00,983 --> 01:23:03,423
that I'm a remarkably unsentimental person in some ways

2050
01:23:03,423 --> 01:23:05,790
where I don't really spend a lot of time

2051
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:07,438
unless I'm explicitly prodded to go back

2052
01:23:07,438 --> 01:23:10,320
and think about the early days of things.

2053
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,670
And I didn't necessarily make the effort

2054
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:17,130
to archive everything exactly in my brain.

2055
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:19,500
And the more that I work on machine learning and AI

2056
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,910
and the aspects of memory

2057
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:23,400
and how when you go back and polish certain things,

2058
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,950
it's not necessarily exactly the way it happened.

2059
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:29,580
But having said all of that from my view,

2060
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,230
the way everything happened

2061
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:36,180
that led up to that was after I was an adult

2062
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:38,190
and kind of taking a few college classes,

2063
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:39,600
deciding to drop out,

2064
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,650
I was doing, I was hard scrabble contract programming work,

2065
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:46,230
really struggling to kind of keep groceries

2066
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,150
and pay my rent and things.

2067
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:50,580
And the company that I was doing the most work for

2068
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:53,190
was a company called Soft Disc Publishing,

2069
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:57,120
which had the sounds bizarre now business model

2070
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,790
of monthly subscription software.

2071
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,310
Before there was an internet that people could connect to

2072
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:05,790
and get software you would pay a certain amount

2073
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,530
and every month they would send you a disc

2074
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:09,750
that had some random software on it.

2075
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,460
And people that were into computers

2076
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,690
thought this was kind of cool.

2077
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:15,098
And they had different ones for the Apple II,

2078
01:24:15,098 --> 01:24:18,900
the 2GS, the PC, the Mac, the Omega,

2079
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,070
lots of different things here.

2080
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:21,450
So, quirky little business.

2081
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:24,570
But I was doing a lot of contract programming for them

2082
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:26,430
where I'd write tiny little games

2083
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:29,559
and sell them for 300, $500.

2084
01:24:29,559 --> 01:24:32,940
And one of the things that I was doing, again,

2085
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:34,440
to keep my head above water here

2086
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,010
was I decided that I could make one program

2087
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:41,040
and I could port it to multiple systems.

2088
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,910
So, I would write a game like Dark Designs or Catacombs

2089
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:47,981
and I would develop it on the Apple II, the 2GS

2090
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:49,860
and the IBM PC,

2091
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:51,750
which apparently was the thing

2092
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,330
that really kind of peaked the attention

2093
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,430
of the people working down there.

2094
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:58,530
Like Jay Wilber was my primary editor

2095
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:02,400
and Tom Hall was a secondary editor and they kept asking me,

2096
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,030
it's like, "Hey, you should come down and work for us here."

2097
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:08,280
And I pushed it off a couple times,

2098
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,260
because I was really enjoying my freedom

2099
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:11,790
of kind of being off on my own,

2100
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:14,040
even if I was barely getting by.

2101
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,873
I loved it.

2102
01:25:14,873 --> 01:25:17,274
I was doing nothing but programming all day.

2103
01:25:17,274 --> 01:25:20,730
But I did have enough close scrapes with like,

2104
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:21,960
I'm just really outta money

2105
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,990
that maybe I should get an actual job,

2106
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:27,870
rather than contracting these kind of one at a time things.

2107
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:29,370
And Jay Wilbur was great.

2108
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:31,980
He was like FedExing me the checks when I would need them

2109
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:35,700
to kind of get over whatever hump I was at.

2110
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,320
So, I took the,

2111
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,730
I finally took 'em up on their offer

2112
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:41,250
to come down to Shreveport, Louisiana.

2113
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,830
I was in Kansas City at the time,

2114
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:46,770
drove down to through the Ozarks

2115
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:49,380
and everything down to Louisiana

2116
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:51,810
and saw the Soft Disc Offices.

2117
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,730
Went through, talked to a bunch of people,

2118
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:56,520
met the people I had been working with remotely

2119
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,810
at that time.

2120
01:25:57,810 --> 01:25:59,550
But the most important thing for me was,

2121
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:03,300
I met two programmers there, John Romero and Lane Roth,

2122
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,940
that for the first time ever I had met programmers

2123
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:08,490
that knew more cool stuff than I did,

2124
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:11,010
where the world was just different back then.

2125
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,390
I was in Kansas City,

2126
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:14,610
it was one of those smartest kid in the school,

2127
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:15,960
does all the computer stuff,

2128
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,120
the teachers don't have anything to teach him.

2129
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,350
But all I had to learn from

2130
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:21,210
was these few books at the library.

2131
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,040
It was not much at all.

2132
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,200
And there were some aspects of programming

2133
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,210
that were kind of black magic to me.

2134
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:28,043
Like it's like,

2135
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:29,755
"Oh, he knows how to format a track

2136
01:26:29,755 --> 01:26:34,320
"on a low level drive programming interface."

2137
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,940
And this was,

2138
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,580
I was still not at all sure I was gonna take the job,

2139
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,830
but I met these awesome programmers

2140
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:41,997
that were doing cool stuff.

2141
01:26:41,997 --> 01:26:44,370
And like Romero had worked at Origin Systems

2142
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:49,020
and he had done like so many different games ahead of time

2143
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:50,700
that I did kind of quickly decide.

2144
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,220
It's like, yeah, I'll go take the job down there.

2145
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:57,090
And I settled down there, moved in

2146
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:59,820
and started working on more little projects.

2147
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:03,090
And the first kind of big change that happened down there

2148
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,586
was the company wanted to make

2149
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:08,250
a PC gaming focused subscription,

2150
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:09,330
just like all their others.

2151
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:11,880
The same formula that they used for everything,

2152
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,760
pay a monthly fee and you'll get a disc

2153
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,920
with one or two games just every month

2154
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,330
and no choice in what you get,

2155
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:19,733
but we think it'll be fun.

2156
01:27:19,733 --> 01:27:22,237
And that was the model they were comfortable with and said,

2157
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:25,140
"All right, we're gonna start this Gamers' Edge Department."

2158
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,840
And all of us that were interested in that,

2159
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,299
like me and Romero,

2160
01:27:29,299 --> 01:27:33,150
Tom Hall was kind of helping us from his side of things.

2161
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:34,110
Jay would peek in

2162
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:36,870
and we had a few other programmers working

2163
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,220
with us at the time

2164
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:41,250
and we were going to just start making games.

2165
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,605
Just the same model.

2166
01:27:42,605 --> 01:27:45,960
And we dived in and it was fantastic.

2167
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,550
- So, you have to make new games.

2168
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:48,383
- [John] Every month.

2169
01:27:48,383 --> 01:27:49,216
- Every month.

2170
01:27:49,216 --> 01:27:50,049
- Yeah.

2171
01:27:50,049 --> 01:27:51,690
And this, in retrospect,

2172
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:52,740
looking back at it,

2173
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:55,380
that sense that I had done all this contract programming

2174
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:58,050
and John Romero had done like far more of this

2175
01:27:58,050 --> 01:28:00,870
where he had done one of his teaching himself efforts

2176
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:03,420
was he made a game for every letter of the alphabet.

2177
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,253
It's that sense of like,

2178
01:28:04,253 --> 01:28:06,240
I'm just gonna go make 26 different games,

2179
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,680
give him a different theme.

2180
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,320
And you learn so much when you go through

2181
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,620
and you crank these things out like on a biweekly,

2182
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:15,060
monthly basis, something like that.

2183
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:16,127
- From start to finish.

2184
01:28:16,127 --> 01:28:17,850
So, it's not like an I just an idea.

2185
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:19,320
It's not just,

2186
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,750
from the very beginning to the very end.

2187
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:24,300
It's done, it has to be done,

2188
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,437
there's no delaying, it's done.

2189
01:28:25,437 --> 01:28:27,210
- Yep and you've got deadlines.

2190
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:32,130
And that kind of rapid iteration pressure cooker environment

2191
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:35,340
was super important for all of us developing the skills

2192
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:38,520
that brought us to where we eventually went to,

2193
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,190
I mean people would say like in the history of the Beatles,

2194
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:43,140
like it wasn't them being the Beatles,

2195
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,110
it was them playing all of these other early works

2196
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:48,360
that that opportunity to craft all of their skills,

2197
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,860
before they were famous

2198
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:53,040
that was very critical to their later successes.

2199
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,960
And I think there's a lot of that here

2200
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,283
where we did these games that nobody remembers.

2201
01:28:58,283 --> 01:29:00,990
Lots of little things that contributed

2202
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,940
to building up the skillset for the things

2203
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:05,040
that eventually did make us famous.

2204
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,542
- Fyodor Dostoevsky wrote "The Gambler,"

2205
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:12,480
he had to write it in a month, just make money.

2206
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,670
And nobody remembers that probably,

2207
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:15,870
'cause he had to figure out,

2208
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:19,470
'cause it's literally he didn't have enough time

2209
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:21,027
to write it fast enough.

2210
01:29:21,027 --> 01:29:22,830
So, to come up with hacks,

2211
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:24,842
to actually literally write it faster.

2212
01:29:24,842 --> 01:29:25,675
- It gain comes down that point

2213
01:29:25,675 --> 01:29:28,290
where pressure and limitation of resources

2214
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:30,014
is surprisingly important.

2215
01:29:30,014 --> 01:29:30,847
- [Lex] Yeah.

2216
01:29:30,847 --> 01:29:32,610
- And it's counterintuitive in a lot of ways

2217
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:34,380
where you just think that if you've got all the time

2218
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,630
in the world and you've got all the resources in the world,

2219
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,460
of course you're gonna get something better.

2220
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,650
But sometimes it really does work out that

2221
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:44,100
the innovations mother necessity

2222
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,470
and you know where you can or resource constraints

2223
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:49,320
and you have to do things when you don't have a choice.

2224
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,760
It's surprising what you can do.

2225
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,710
- Is there any good games written in that time,

2226
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:53,720
would you say?

2227
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,080
- Some of them are still fun to go back

2228
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,410
and play where you get the,

2229
01:29:57,410 --> 01:30:01,020
they were all about kind of the more modern term

2230
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:04,200
is game feel about how just the exact feel that things,

2231
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,300
it's not the grand strategy of the design,

2232
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,880
but how running and jumping and shooting

2233
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,030
and those things feel in the moment.

2234
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:14,457
And some of those are still you sat down at 'em,

2235
01:30:14,457 --> 01:30:16,080
you kind of go, it's a little bit different.

2236
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,820
It doesn't have the same movement feel,

2237
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:20,670
but you move over and you're like bang, jump bang.

2238
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:23,220
It's like, "Hey, that's kind of cool still."

2239
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,350
- So, you can get lost in the rhythm of the game.

2240
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,380
Like is that what you mean by feel?

2241
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:31,410
Just like there's something about it that pulls you in.

2242
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:33,870
- Nowadays, again, people talk about compulsion loops

2243
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:37,290
and things where it's that that sense of exactly

2244
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:38,123
what you're doing,

2245
01:30:38,123 --> 01:30:39,690
what your fingers are doing on the keyboard,

2246
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:41,190
what your eyes are seeing.

2247
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:43,350
And there are gonna be these sequences of things.

2248
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:45,990
Grab the loot, shoot the monster, jump over the obstacle,

2249
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:47,040
get to the end of the level.

2250
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:50,670
These are eternal aspects of game design in a lot of ways.

2251
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:53,340
But there are better and worse ways to do all of them.

2252
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:56,730
And we did so many of these games that it was,

2253
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:58,860
we got a lot of practice with it.

2254
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,080
So, one of the kind of weird things

2255
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,510
that was happening at this time is John Romero

2256
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:06,750
was getting some strange fan mail.

2257
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:09,150
And back in the days, this is before email,

2258
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:11,340
so we literally got letters sometimes

2259
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:12,667
and telling him, it's like,

2260
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:14,317
"Oh, I wanna talk to you about your games.

2261
01:31:14,317 --> 01:31:16,578
"I wanna reach out different things."

2262
01:31:16,578 --> 01:31:19,680
And eventually it turned out

2263
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,020
that these were all coming from Scott Miller

2264
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:26,340
at Apogee Software and he was reaching out through,

2265
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,320
he didn't think he could contact John directly

2266
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,580
that he would get intercepted.

2267
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:32,070
So, he was trying to get him to contact him through,

2268
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:35,437
like back channel fan mail because he basically was saying,

2269
01:31:35,437 --> 01:31:38,497
"Hey, I'm making all this money on shareware games.

2270
01:31:38,497 --> 01:31:40,890
"I want you to make Shareware games."

2271
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:44,098
Because he had seen some of the games that Romero had done

2272
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:47,820
and we looked at Scott Miller's games

2273
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,757
and we didn't think they were very good.

2274
01:31:49,757 --> 01:31:53,130
We're like, that can't be making the kind of money

2275
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:55,350
that he's saying he's making 10 grand or something.

2276
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:57,180
I am off of this game.

2277
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,430
We really thought that he was full of shit.

2278
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:03,390
That it was a lie trying to get to get him into this.

2279
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:07,170
So that was kind of going on at one level,

2280
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:10,230
and it was funny the moment when Romero realized

2281
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:12,320
that he had some of these letters pinned up on his wall

2282
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,590
of like all of his fans.

2283
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:14,423
And then we noticed

2284
01:32:14,423 --> 01:32:15,780
that they all had the same return address

2285
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,370
with different names on them,

2286
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:20,700
which was a little bit of a two-edged sword there.

2287
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:23,460
- But trying to figure out the puzzle laid out before him.

2288
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:26,190
- Yeah, what happened after I kind of coincident

2289
01:32:26,190 --> 01:32:29,880
with that was I was working on a lot of the new technologies

2290
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,900
where I was now full on the IBM PC for the first time

2291
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:37,290
where I was really a long hold out on Apple II forever.

2292
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:38,597
And I loved my Apple II,

2293
01:32:38,597 --> 01:32:40,710
it was the computer I always wished I had

2294
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:41,730
when I was growing up.

2295
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:43,170
And when I finally did have one,

2296
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:46,200
I was kind of clinging onto that well past it,

2297
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,610
sort of good use by day.

2298
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:49,798
- Was it the best computer I ever made you, would you say?

2299
01:32:49,798 --> 01:32:53,190
- I wouldn't make judgments like that about it.

2300
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:54,750
But it was positioned in such a way,

2301
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:56,310
especially in the school systems,

2302
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:59,940
that it impacted a whole lot of American programmers

2303
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:02,160
at least where there was programs

2304
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,020
that the Apple IIs got into the schools

2305
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,000
and they had enough capability

2306
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,760
that lots of interesting things happened with them.

2307
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:09,840
In Europe it was different.

2308
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,498
You had your Omegas and Ataris

2309
01:33:11,498 --> 01:33:13,980
and Acorns in the UK

2310
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:16,110
and things that that had different things.

2311
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:18,480
But in the United States it was probably the Apple II,

2312
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,600
made the most impact for a lot of programmers

2313
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,310
of my generation.

2314
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:26,100
But, so I was really digging into the IBM

2315
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:29,340
and this was even more so with the total focus,

2316
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:30,780
because I had moved to another city

2317
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:33,840
where I didn't know anybody that I wasn't working with.

2318
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,420
I had a little apartment and then at Soft Disk,

2319
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:38,790
again, the things that that drew me to it,

2320
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:41,754
I had a couple programmers that knew more than I did

2321
01:33:41,754 --> 01:33:43,560
and they had a library,

2322
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,050
they had a set of books and a set of magazines.

2323
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:47,670
They had a couple years of magazines,

2324
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:50,730
the old "Dr. Dobbs Journal" and all of these magazines

2325
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:53,160
that had information about things.

2326
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,490
And so I was just in total immersion mode.

2327
01:33:56,490 --> 01:33:59,490
It was eat, breathe, sleep, computer programming,

2328
01:33:59,490 --> 01:34:03,300
particularly the IBM for everything that I was doing.

2329
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,500
And I was digging into

2330
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,600
a lot of these low level hardware details

2331
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,880
that people weren't usually paying attention to.

2332
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:12,093
The way the IBM EGA cards worked,

2333
01:34:12,093 --> 01:34:14,310
which was fun for me.

2334
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:16,675
I hadn't had experience with things at that level.

2335
01:34:16,675 --> 01:34:20,070
And back then you could get hardware documentation,

2336
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:21,510
just down at the register levels.

2337
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:23,940
This is where the CRTC register is,

2338
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:26,100
this is how the color registers work

2339
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,900
and how the different things are applied.

2340
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,270
And they were designed for a certain reason.

2341
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:31,890
They were designed for an application.

2342
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:33,626
They had an intended use in mind,

2343
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:37,290
but I was starting to look at other ways

2344
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:38,730
that they could perhaps be exploited

2345
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:40,650
that they weren't initially intended for.

2346
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:42,390
- Could you comment on like,

2347
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:44,370
first of all, what operating system was there?

2348
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:45,870
What instruction set was it?

2349
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:48,600
Like what are we talking about?

2350
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,520
- So, this was Dawson X86.

2351
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:55,500
So 16 bit 8086, the 286s were there and 386s existed.

2352
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,396
They were rare.

2353
01:34:56,396 --> 01:34:59,400
We a couple for our development systems,

2354
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,937
but we were still targeting the more broad,

2355
01:35:01,937 --> 01:35:04,950
it was all DOS 16 bit.

2356
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:07,530
None of this was kind of DOS extenders and things.

2357
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:09,450
- How different is it from the systems of today,

2358
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:12,360
is it kind of the a precursor that's similar?

2359
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:17,360
- Very little if you open up command.com on Windows,

2360
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,740
you see some of the remnants of all of that.

2361
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:20,573
But it was a different world.

2362
01:35:20,573 --> 01:35:25,573
It was the 640K is enough world and nothing was protected.

2363
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:26,760
It crashed all the time.

2364
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,770
You had TSRs or terminate

2365
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:31,020
and stay resident hacks on top of things

2366
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:33,180
that would cause configuration problems.

2367
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:37,530
All the hardware was manually configured in your auto exec.

2368
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:39,510
So, it was a very different world.

2369
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:40,772
- The code is still the same.

2370
01:35:40,772 --> 01:35:42,600
- You could still write it.

2371
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,730
My earliest code there was written in Pascal.

2372
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:47,760
That was what I had learned kind of at an earlier point.

2373
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:51,057
- So, between Basic and C plus plus there was Pascal.

2374
01:35:51,057 --> 01:35:54,330
- So, when basic assembly language and some of my-

2375
01:35:54,330 --> 01:35:55,163
- [Lex] Take a step back.

2376
01:35:55,163 --> 01:35:55,996
- Yeah, my intermediate stuff was,

2377
01:35:55,996 --> 01:35:57,060
well you had to for performance,

2378
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,410
basic was just too slow.

2379
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:00,510
So, most of the work that I was doing

2380
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:02,880
as a contract programmer in my teenage years

2381
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,247
was assembly language.

2382
01:36:05,247 --> 01:36:07,290
- You wrote games in assembly?

2383
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:10,800
- Yeah, complete games in assembly language.

2384
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,750
And it's thousands and thousands of lines

2385
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:16,620
of three letter acronyms for the instructions.

2386
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:18,360
- You don't earn

2387
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,120
the once again greatest programmer ever label

2388
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,692
without being able to write a game in assembly, okay.

2389
01:36:23,692 --> 01:36:25,020
- But that's again, everybody wrote their,

2390
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:27,450
everybody serious wrote their games in assembly language.

2391
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:29,790
- Pretty serious, you see what he said?

2392
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:30,697
Everybody's serious.

2393
01:36:30,697 --> 01:36:34,020
- It was an outlier to use Pascal a little bit

2394
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,480
where there was one famous program called Wizardry.

2395
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,510
It was one, like one of the great early role playing games.

2396
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:40,920
That was written in Pascal,

2397
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,530
but it was almost nothing used Pascal there.

2398
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:45,210
But I did learn Pascal

2399
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:47,040
and I remember doing all of my,

2400
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:47,873
like to this day,

2401
01:36:47,873 --> 01:36:49,290
I sketch in data structures

2402
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:50,610
when I'm thinking about something,

2403
01:36:50,610 --> 01:36:52,680
I'll open up a file

2404
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,750
and I'll start writing struct definitions

2405
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:56,970
for how data is gonna be laid out.

2406
01:36:56,970 --> 01:36:58,950
And Pascal was kind of formative to that,

2407
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:01,170
because I remember designing my RPGs

2408
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:04,080
in Pascal records structures and things like that.

2409
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,840
And so I had gotten a Pascal compiler

2410
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:08,790
for the Apple IIGS that I could work on.

2411
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:12,240
And the first IBM game that I developed, I did in Pascal.

2412
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,910
And, and that's actually kind of an interesting story,

2413
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:17,504
again, talking about the constraints and resources

2414
01:37:17,504 --> 01:37:20,010
where I had an Apple IIGS,

2415
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:21,540
I didn't have an IBM PC.

2416
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:24,600
I wanted to port my applications to IBM,

2417
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,000
because I thought I could make more money on it.

2418
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,211
So, what I wound up doing is I rented a PC for a week

2419
01:37:31,211 --> 01:37:33,960
and bought a copy of Turbo Pascal.

2420
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,970
And so I had a hard one week

2421
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:37,883
and this was cutting into what minimal profit margin

2422
01:37:37,883 --> 01:37:38,940
I had there.

2423
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,350
But I had this computer for a week.

2424
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:42,240
I had to get my program ported,

2425
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,156
before I had to return the PC.

2426
01:37:44,156 --> 01:37:44,989
- Yeah.

2427
01:37:44,989 --> 01:37:46,800
- And that was kind of what the first thing

2428
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,540
that I had done on the IBM PC

2429
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:51,630
and what led me to the taking the job at Soft Disk.

2430
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:53,790
- And Turbo Pascal.

2431
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:55,260
How's that different from regular Pascal?

2432
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,790
Is it different compiler or something like that?

2433
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,650
- So, it was a product of Borland,

2434
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,990
which before Microsoft kind of killed them,

2435
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:04,200
they were the hot stuff developer tools company.

2436
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:08,010
You had Borland Turbo Pascal and Turbo C and Turbo Prologue,

2437
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:09,570
I mean all the different things.

2438
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:11,100
But what they did was

2439
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,260
they took a supremely pragmatic approach

2440
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:14,550
of making something useful.

2441
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:16,200
It was one of these great examples

2442
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,870
where Pascal was an academic language

2443
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:21,810
and you had things like the UCSDP system

2444
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:23,820
that Wizardry was actually written in

2445
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:27,090
that they did manage to make a game with that.

2446
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:30,900
But it was not a super practical system.

2447
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,820
While Turbo Pascal was,

2448
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,950
it was called Turbo because it was blazingly fast

2449
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:35,783
to compile,

2450
01:38:35,783 --> 01:38:39,450
I mean really ridiculously 10 to 20 times faster

2451
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:41,640
than most other compilers at the time.

2452
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,370
But it also had very pragmatic access to look,

2453
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:46,830
you can just poke at the hardware in these different ways.

2454
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:49,260
And we have libraries that let you do things.

2455
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:52,500
And it was a perfectly good way to write games.

2456
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,700
And this is one of those things

2457
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,490
where people have talked about different paths

2458
01:38:56,490 --> 01:38:58,650
that computer development could have taken

2459
01:38:58,650 --> 01:39:01,920
where C took over the world for reasons

2460
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,380
that came out of Unix and eventually Linux.

2461
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:07,260
And that was not a foregone conclusion at all.

2462
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:10,860
And people can make real reasoned, rational arguments

2463
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,450
that the world might've been better

2464
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:14,430
if it had gone a Pascal route.

2465
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:16,290
I'm somewhat agnostic on that,

2466
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:18,630
where I do know from experience

2467
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:21,240
it was perfectly good enough to do that.

2468
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,190
And it had some fundamental improvements.

2469
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:26,070
Like it had range checked arrays as an option there,

2470
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:29,640
which could avoid many of C's real hazards

2471
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,560
that happened in a security space.

2472
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,580
But C one,

2473
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,630
they were basically operating

2474
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:35,580
at about the same level of abstraction.

2475
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:38,188
It was a systems programming language.

2476
01:39:38,188 --> 01:39:40,350
- But you said Pascal had a more emphasis

2477
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:41,400
on data structures.

2478
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:42,298
I actually,

2479
01:39:42,298 --> 01:39:47,298
in the tree of languages the Pascal come before C,

2480
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:48,930
did it inspire a lot-

2481
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:49,763
- They were pretty contemporaneous.

2482
01:39:49,763 --> 01:39:52,200
So, Pascal's Lineage went to modular two

2483
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,240
and eventually Oberon which was another Niklaus Wirth

2484
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:58,740
kind of experimental language.

2485
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:01,380
But they were all good enough at that level.

2486
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:04,350
Now some of the classic academic oriented Pascals

2487
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,700
were just missing fundamental things.

2488
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,040
Like, oh, you can't access this core system thing,

2489
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,320
because we're just using it to teach students.

2490
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,410
But Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes

2491
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:17,100
to it really did make it a completely capable language

2492
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:19,620
and it had some reasons why you could implement it

2493
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,970
as a single pass compiler.

2494
01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:22,560
So, it could be way, way faster,

2495
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,796
although less scope for optimizations if you do it that way.

2496
01:40:25,796 --> 01:40:28,320
And it did have some range checking options.

2497
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,750
It had a little bit better typing capability.

2498
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:33,180
You'd have properly typed enums sorts of things

2499
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:35,220
and other stuff that C lacked.

2500
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,890
But C was also clearly good enough

2501
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:39,690
and it wound up with a huge inertia

2502
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:42,780
from the Unix ecosystem and everything that came with that.

2503
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:43,980
- Garbage collection.

2504
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,330
- [John] No, it was not garbage collected.

2505
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:46,530
- It's the same kind of thing as C.

2506
01:40:46,530 --> 01:40:47,363
- Same manual.

2507
01:40:47,363 --> 01:40:49,110
So, you could still have your use after freeze

2508
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:50,340
and all those other problems,

2509
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:53,820
but just getting rid of array overruns,

2510
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:56,130
at least if you were compiled with that debugging option,

2511
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:57,886
certainly would've avoided a lot of problems

2512
01:40:57,886 --> 01:40:59,790
and could have a lot of benefits.

2513
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:01,320
But, so anyways, that was the next thing,

2514
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,153
I had to learn C,

2515
01:41:02,153 --> 01:41:04,502
because C was where it seemed like,

2516
01:41:04,502 --> 01:41:07,050
most of the things were going.

2517
01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:09,600
So, I abandoned Pascal and I started working in C.

2518
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,640
I started hacking on these hardware things,

2519
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:14,310
dealing with the graphics controllers

2520
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:18,240
and the EGA systems and what we most wanted to do.

2521
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,818
So, at that time we had,

2522
01:41:19,818 --> 01:41:22,860
we were sitting in our darkened office playing,

2523
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:24,507
all the different console video games

2524
01:41:24,507 --> 01:41:27,120
and we're figuring out what do we want to kind of,

2525
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,350
what games do we want to make

2526
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:30,357
for our Gamers Edge product there?

2527
01:41:30,357 --> 01:41:34,230
And so we had one of the first super Nintendos sitting there

2528
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:36,030
and we had an older Nintendo

2529
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:37,530
and we were looking at all those games.

2530
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:39,630
And the core thing that those consoles did

2531
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:41,516
that you just didn't get on the PC games

2532
01:41:41,516 --> 01:41:44,880
was this ability to have a massive scrolling world

2533
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,561
where most of the games that you would make on the PC

2534
01:41:47,561 --> 01:41:51,540
and earlier personal computers would be a static screen.

2535
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,880
You move little things around on it

2536
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,050
and you interact like that,

2537
01:41:55,050 --> 01:41:58,320
maybe you go to additional screens as you move.

2538
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,330
But arcade games and consoles

2539
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:03,570
had this wonderful ability to just have a big world

2540
01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:06,000
that you're slowly moving your window through.

2541
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,337
And that was for those types of games,

2542
01:42:08,337 --> 01:42:10,830
the kind of action exploration, adventure games,

2543
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:13,140
that was a super, super important thing.

2544
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:15,640
And PC games just didn't do that.

2545
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:18,150
And what I had had come across

2546
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:19,890
was a couple different techniques

2547
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:22,140
for implementing that on the PC.

2548
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:24,993
And they're not hard complicated things.

2549
01:42:24,993 --> 01:42:26,220
When I explained 'em now,

2550
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:28,170
they're pretty straightforward,

2551
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:29,310
but just nobody was doing it.

2552
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:31,920
- You sound like Einstein describing his five papers

2553
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,120
as pretty straightforward.

2554
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:34,050
I understand.

2555
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:36,060
But they're nevertheless revolutionary.

2556
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:38,490
So, side scrolling is a game changer.

2557
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:39,323
- [John] Yeah, it's scrolling-

2558
01:42:39,323 --> 01:42:40,410
- It's a genius invention.

2559
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:41,243
- There's tighter vertical.

2560
01:42:41,243 --> 01:42:43,680
And some of the consoles had different limitations,

2561
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,427
about you could do one but not the other.

2562
01:42:45,427 --> 01:42:48,420
And there were similar things going on as advancements,

2563
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:49,650
even in the console space

2564
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:52,140
where you'd have like the original Mario game

2565
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:54,600
was like just horizontal scrolling.

2566
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,057
And then later Mario Games added vertical aspects to it

2567
01:42:57,057 --> 01:43:01,290
and different things that you were doing to explore,

2568
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:02,970
kind of expand the capabilities there.

2569
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:05,520
And so much of the early game design for decades

2570
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,650
was removing limitations,

2571
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:10,110
letting you do things that you envisioned as a designer,

2572
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:11,970
you wanted the player to experience,

2573
01:43:11,970 --> 01:43:14,042
but the hardware just couldn't really

2574
01:43:14,042 --> 01:43:16,620
or you didn't know how to make it happen.

2575
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:17,760
It felt impossible.

2576
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,100
- You can imagine that you want to create,

2577
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:23,970
like this big world through which you can side scroll,

2578
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:25,969
like through which you can walk

2579
01:43:25,969 --> 01:43:28,140
and then you ask yourself a question,

2580
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:30,635
how do I actually build that in a way that's,

2581
01:43:30,635 --> 01:43:33,675
like the latency is low enough,

2582
01:43:33,675 --> 01:43:36,892
the hard work can actually deliver that

2583
01:43:36,892 --> 01:43:38,910
in such a way that's a compelling experience.

2584
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:40,373
- Yeah and we knew what we wanted to do,

2585
01:43:40,373 --> 01:43:42,750
because we were playing all of these console games,

2586
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:45,180
playing all these Nintendo games and arcade games.

2587
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:47,490
Clearly there was a whole world of awesome things there

2588
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:49,650
that we just couldn't do on the PC,

2589
01:43:49,650 --> 01:43:52,890
at least initially because every programmer can tell,

2590
01:43:52,890 --> 01:43:53,910
it's like if you wanna scroll,

2591
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,470
you can just redraw the whole screen.

2592
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:56,460
But then it turns out,

2593
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:58,371
well, you're going five frames per second.

2594
01:43:58,371 --> 01:44:01,020
That's not an interactive fun experience.

2595
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:04,800
You wanna be going 30 or 60 frames per second or something.

2596
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,900
And it just didn't feel like that was possible.

2597
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:10,110
It felt like the PCs had to get five times faster

2598
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:12,720
for you to make a playable game there.

2599
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,070
And interestingly,

2600
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:16,980
I wound up with two completely different solutions

2601
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:18,429
for the scrolling problem.

2602
01:44:18,429 --> 01:44:22,498
And this is a theme that runs through everything

2603
01:44:22,498 --> 01:44:25,320
where all of these big technical advancements,

2604
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,360
it turns out there's always a couple different ways

2605
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,440
of doing them.

2606
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:31,740
And it's not like you found the one true way of doing it.

2607
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:35,250
And we'll see this as we go into 3D games and things later.

2608
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:36,840
But, so the scrolling,

2609
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,240
the first set of scrolling tricks that I got

2610
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:43,650
was the hardware had this ability to,

2611
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:46,651
you could shift like inside the window of memory.

2612
01:44:46,651 --> 01:44:51,651
So, the EGA cards at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory.

2613
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:55,380
And it was awkwardly set up in this planer format

2614
01:44:55,380 --> 01:45:00,380
where instead of having 256 or 24 million colors,

2615
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:03,450
you had 16 colors, which is four bits.

2616
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:06,330
So you had four bit planes, 64K a piece.

2617
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:08,460
Of course 60 4K is a nice round number

2618
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:10,410
for 16 bit of dressing.

2619
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:13,920
So, your graphics card had a 16 bit window

2620
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,270
that you could look at

2621
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:16,130
and you could tell it

2622
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:18,986
to start the video scan out anywhere inside there.

2623
01:45:18,986 --> 01:45:22,170
So, there were a couple games that had taken this approach.

2624
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:23,910
If you could make a two by two screen

2625
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:25,800
or a one by four screen

2626
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,170
and you could do scrolling really easily like that,

2627
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:31,080
you could just lay it all out and just pan around there,

2628
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:32,670
but you just couldn't make it any bigger,

2629
01:45:32,670 --> 01:45:34,797
because that's all the memory that was there.

2630
01:45:34,797 --> 01:45:38,250
The first insight to the scrolling that I had was,

2631
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:42,300
well, if we make a screen that's just one tile larger,

2632
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:45,840
and we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels by 16 pixels,

2633
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,960
the little classic Mario block that you run into,

2634
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,910
lots of art gets drawn that way

2635
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:52,890
and your screen is a certain number of tiles.

2636
01:45:52,890 --> 01:45:56,700
But if you had one little buffer region outside of that,

2637
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:00,000
you could easily pan around inside that 16 pixel region

2638
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,830
that could be perfectly smooth.

2639
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:04,050
But then what happens if you get to the edge

2640
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:06,000
and you want to keep going?

2641
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,460
The first way we did scrolling was

2642
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,800
what I call the adaptive tile refresh,

2643
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,710
which was really just a matter of you get to the edge

2644
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:16,140
and then you go back to the original point

2645
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:19,470
and then only change the tiles that have actually,

2646
01:46:19,470 --> 01:46:21,630
that are different between where it was.

2647
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:23,280
In most of the games at the time

2648
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,320
if you think about sort of your classic,

2649
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:26,940
Super Mario Brothers game,

2650
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:29,480
you've got big fields of blue sky,

2651
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,694
long rows of the same brick texture

2652
01:46:32,694 --> 01:46:34,980
and there's a lot of commonality.

2653
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:36,570
It's kind of like a data compression thing.

2654
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:37,830
If you take the screen

2655
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:40,230
and you set it down on top of each other,

2656
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:43,350
in general, only about 10% of the tiles

2657
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:45,210
were actually different there.

2658
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:48,060
So, this was a way to go ahead and say,

2659
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:49,200
well, I'm gonna move it back

2660
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:52,230
and then I'm only going to change those 10, 20,

2661
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:54,150
whatever percent tiles there.

2662
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:57,540
And that meant that it was essentially five times faster

2663
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:59,910
than if you were redrawing all of the tiles.

2664
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:02,100
And that worked well enough for us to do a bunch

2665
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:04,860
of these games for Gamers Edge,

2666
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,330
we had a lot of these scrolling games,

2667
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:09,300
like slurred acts and shadow nights and things like that,

2668
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:11,280
that we were cranking out at this high rate

2669
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,650
that had this scrolling effect on it.

2670
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:14,640
And it worked well enough.

2671
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:16,140
There were design challenges there

2672
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:18,210
where if you made the worst case,

2673
01:47:18,210 --> 01:47:20,490
if you made a checkerboard over the entire screen,

2674
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:23,220
you scroll over one and every single tile changes

2675
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:25,110
and your frame rates now five frames per second,

2676
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:27,180
because it had to redraw everything.

2677
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:28,740
So, the designers had a little bit

2678
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:29,820
that they had to worry about,

2679
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:32,850
they had to make these relatively plain looking levels,

2680
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:34,890
but it was still pretty magical.

2681
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:36,855
It was something that we hadn't seen before.

2682
01:47:36,855 --> 01:47:41,575
And the first thing that we wound up doing with that was,

2683
01:47:41,575 --> 01:47:43,710
I had just gotten this working

2684
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:46,320
and Tom Hall was sitting there with me

2685
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:49,230
and we were looking over at our Super Nintendo

2686
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:52,560
on the side there with Super Mario three running,

2687
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,340
and we had the technology, we had the tools set up there

2688
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:57,840
and we stayed up all night

2689
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,880
and we basically cloned the first level

2690
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,440
of Super Mario Brothers.

2691
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,550
- Performance wise as well?

2692
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:05,100
- Yeah and so and we had our little character running

2693
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:06,027
and jumping in there.

2694
01:48:06,027 --> 01:48:08,850
It was close to pixel accurate

2695
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:11,310
as far as all of the backgrounds and everything,

2696
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:13,560
but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled together

2697
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,360
from previous games that I had written.

2698
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:17,130
I just kind of like really kitbashed

2699
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:19,530
the whole thing together to make this demo.

2700
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:21,900
And that was one of the rare cases when I said I,

2701
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:24,900
I don't usually do these all night programming things.

2702
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,910
There's probably only two memorable ones

2703
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:28,620
that I can think about.

2704
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:30,690
One was the all-nighter to go ahead

2705
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:34,530
and to get our Dangerous Dave in copyright infringement

2706
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:35,460
is how we titled it,

2707
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:37,170
because we had a game called Dangerous Dave,

2708
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:39,827
which was running around with the shotgun shooting things.

2709
01:48:39,827 --> 01:48:42,540
And we were just taking our most beloved game

2710
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:44,910
at the time there, the Super Mario Three,

2711
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:46,830
and sort of sticking Dave inside that

2712
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:48,780
with this new scrolling technology

2713
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:53,097
that was going perfectly smooth for him as it ran.

2714
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:57,720
And Tom and I just kind of literally the next morning,

2715
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:01,230
kind of left and we left a disc on the desk

2716
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:04,170
for John Romero and Jay Wilbur to see and just said,

2717
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:05,340
run this.

2718
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:08,460
And we eventually made it back in later in the day.

2719
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:10,050
And it was,

2720
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:12,237
like they grabbed us and pulled us in pulled us

2721
01:49:12,237 --> 01:49:13,320
into the room.

2722
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:15,720
And that was the point where they were like,

2723
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,790
we gotta do something with this.

2724
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:19,320
We're gonna make a company,

2725
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,330
we're gonna go make our own games.

2726
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:23,190
Where this was something that

2727
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:25,050
we were able to just kind of hit them

2728
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:26,527
with a hammer of an experience like,

2729
01:49:26,527 --> 01:49:29,347
"Wow, this is just like so much cooler than

2730
01:49:29,347 --> 01:49:31,740
"what we thought was possible there."

2731
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:33,900
And initially we tried to get Nintendo

2732
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:36,900
to let us make Super Mario three on the PC.

2733
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,943
That's really what we wanted to do.

2734
01:49:37,943 --> 01:49:40,177
We were like, "Hey, we can finish this.

2735
01:49:40,177 --> 01:49:42,720
"It's line of sight for this'll be great."

2736
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,180
And we sent something to Nintendo

2737
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:48,240
and we heard that it did get looked at in Japan

2738
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,070
and they just weren't interested in that.

2739
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:52,500
But that's another one of those life could have gone

2740
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,490
a very different way

2741
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:56,805
where we could have been like Nintendo's House PC team

2742
01:49:56,805 --> 01:49:58,726
at that point.

2743
01:49:58,726 --> 01:50:03,726
- And to find the direction of Wolfenstein

2744
01:50:03,941 --> 01:50:08,941
and Doom and Quake could have been a Nintendo creation.

2745
01:50:08,970 --> 01:50:10,770
- Yeah, so at the same time

2746
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:13,588
that we were just doing our first scrolling demos,

2747
01:50:13,588 --> 01:50:17,700
we reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee and said,

2748
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:20,190
it's like, "Hey, we do wanna make some games."

2749
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:21,583
These things that you think you want,

2750
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:22,680
those are nothing,

2751
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:24,555
what do you see what we can actually do now?

2752
01:50:24,555 --> 01:50:26,280
This is gonna be amazing.

2753
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,320
And he just like popped right up

2754
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,810
and sent a check to us where we at that point

2755
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:32,610
we still thought he might be a fraud,

2756
01:50:32,610 --> 01:50:34,500
that he was just lying about all of this.

2757
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,560
But he was totally correct on how much money he was making

2758
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:39,420
with his shareware titles.

2759
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:43,200
And this was his kind of real brainstorm about this,

2760
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,030
where Shareware was this idea

2761
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:47,220
that software doesn't have a fixed price.

2762
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:48,053
If you use it,

2763
01:50:48,053 --> 01:50:50,340
you send outta the goodness of your heart some money

2764
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:51,720
to the creator.

2765
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:53,340
And there were a couple utilities

2766
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:55,950
that did make some significant success like that,

2767
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:58,470
but for the most part it didn't really work.

2768
01:50:58,470 --> 01:51:00,120
Now, there wasn't much software

2769
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:03,870
in a pure shareware model that was successful.

2770
01:51:03,870 --> 01:51:07,710
The Apogee innovation was to take something,

2771
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:10,170
call it shareware, split it into three pieces.

2772
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:11,671
You always made a trilogy

2773
01:51:11,671 --> 01:51:14,400
and you would put the first piece out,

2774
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,200
but then you buy the whole trilogy

2775
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:19,440
for some shareware amount, which in reality,

2776
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,330
it meant that the first part was a demo

2777
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:24,090
where you kind of like the demo went everywhere for free

2778
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:26,640
and you paid money to get the whole set,

2779
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:28,680
but it was still played as shareware.

2780
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,080
And we were happy to have the first one go everywhere.

2781
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:32,520
And it wasn't a crippled demo

2782
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:35,010
where the first episode of all of these trilogies,

2783
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:36,450
it was a real complete game

2784
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:39,180
and probably 20 times as many people played

2785
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:41,250
that part of it thought they had a great game,

2786
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:45,420
had found fond memories of it but never paid us a dime.

2787
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:48,240
But enough people were happy with that,

2788
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,730
where it was really quite successful.

2789
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:53,250
And these early games that we didn't think very much of,

2790
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:55,830
compared to commercial quality games,

2791
01:51:55,830 --> 01:51:57,780
but they were doing really good business,

2792
01:51:57,780 --> 01:52:00,390
some fairly crude things and people,

2793
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:02,340
it was good business people enjoyed it.

2794
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:04,740
And it wasn't like you were taking a crapshoot

2795
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:05,573
on what you were getting.

2796
01:52:05,573 --> 01:52:07,770
You just played a third of the experience

2797
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:10,860
and you loved it enough to hand write out a check

2798
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:13,170
and put it in an envelope and address it

2799
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:16,650
and send it out to Apogee to get the rest of them.

2800
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:20,640
So, it was a really pretty feel good business prospect there

2801
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:22,820
because everybody was happy,

2802
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:26,010
they knew what they were getting when they send it in.

2803
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:27,180
And they would send in fan mail

2804
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:29,520
if you're going into the trouble of addressing a letter

2805
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,590
and filling out an envelope,

2806
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:32,670
you write something in it.

2807
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:35,430
And there were just the literal bags of fan mail

2808
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:37,890
for the shareware games.

2809
01:52:37,890 --> 01:52:38,910
So, people loved them.

2810
01:52:38,910 --> 01:52:41,310
- I should mention that for you,

2811
01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:42,570
the definition of wealth

2812
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:46,590
is being able to have pizza whenever you want.

2813
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:49,020
For me, there was a dream,

2814
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:51,390
because I would play shareware games over and over,

2815
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:53,850
the part that's free over and over.

2816
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:56,520
And it was very deeply fulfilling experience.

2817
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,680
But, I dreamed of a time

2818
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:02,160
when I could actually afford the full experience.

2819
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:05,910
And this is kind of this dream land beyond the horizon

2820
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:09,360
where you could find out what else is there.

2821
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:14,360
In some sense, even just playing the shareware was,

2822
01:53:15,148 --> 01:53:18,270
it's the limitation of that,

2823
01:53:18,270 --> 01:53:21,510
life is limited, eventually all die.

2824
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:26,510
In that way, shareware was like somehow really fulfilling

2825
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:30,270
to have this kind of mysterious thing beyond

2826
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:32,190
what's free always there.

2827
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:33,767
It's kind of, I don't know,

2828
01:53:33,767 --> 01:53:36,360
maybe it's because a part of my childhood

2829
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:37,590
is playing shareware games.

2830
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:39,540
That was a really fulfilling experience.

2831
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:42,582
It's so interesting how that model still brought joy

2832
01:53:42,582 --> 01:53:44,050
to so many people.

2833
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:45,460
20x people that played it.

2834
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:46,990
- Yeah, I felt very good about that.

2835
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:48,420
And I would run into people,

2836
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:50,760
it's like that would say, oh, I loved that game,

2837
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:53,490
that you had early on Commander Keen whatever.

2838
01:53:53,490 --> 01:53:57,510
And they meant just the first episode

2839
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:58,710
that they got to see everywhere.

2840
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:01,198
- That's me, I played the crap outta Commander Keen.

2841
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:03,240
- And that was all good.

2842
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,410
- Yeah, yeah.

2843
01:54:04,410 --> 01:54:06,780
- But so we were in this position where Scott Miller

2844
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:08,460
was just fronting us cash saying,

2845
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:10,440
yeah, make a game.

2846
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:14,047
But we did not properly pull the trigger and say,

2847
01:54:14,047 --> 01:54:16,380
"All right, we're quitting our jobs."

2848
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:17,940
We were like, we're gonna do both.

2849
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:21,270
We're gonna keep working at Soft Disc working on this

2850
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:23,220
and then we're going to go ahead

2851
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:26,619
and make a new game for Apogee at the same time.

2852
01:54:26,619 --> 01:54:29,580
And this eventually did lead to some legal problems

2853
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,110
and we had trouble.

2854
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:32,820
It all got worked out in the end,

2855
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:35,850
but it was not a good call at the time there.

2856
01:54:35,850 --> 01:54:39,053
- And your legal mind at the time was not stellar.

2857
01:54:39,053 --> 01:54:42,360
You were not thinking in terms in legal terms.

2858
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:44,040
- No, I definitely wasn't.

2859
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:45,120
None of us were.

2860
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,400
And in hindsight, yeah,

2861
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,960
it's like how did we think we were gonna get away

2862
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,077
with like even using our work computers

2863
01:54:51,077 --> 01:54:56,077
to write software for our breakaway new company.

2864
01:54:56,850 --> 01:54:58,380
It was not a good plan.

2865
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:00,960
- How did Commander Keen come to be?

2866
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,753
- So, the design process,

2867
01:55:02,753 --> 01:55:04,110
we would start from,

2868
01:55:04,110 --> 01:55:05,910
we had some idea of what we wanted to do.

2869
01:55:05,910 --> 01:55:08,340
We wanted to do a Mario-like game.

2870
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,140
It was gonna be a side scroller,

2871
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:11,790
it was gonna use the technology.

2872
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:14,340
We had some sense of what it would have to look like,

2873
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:15,510
because of the limitations

2874
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:17,970
of this adaptive tile refresh technology.

2875
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:21,270
It had to have fields of relatively constant tiles.

2876
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:23,520
You couldn't just paint up a background

2877
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,111
and then move that around.

2878
01:55:25,111 --> 01:55:26,940
The early design

2879
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:29,130
or all the design for Commander Keen really came

2880
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:34,130
from Tom Hall where he was kind of the main creative mind

2881
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:36,960
for the early id Software stuff

2882
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,650
where we had an interesting division of things

2883
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:42,240
where Tom was all creative in design.

2884
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:45,540
I was all programming, John Romero was an interesting bridge

2885
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,730
where he was both a very good programmer

2886
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:50,160
and also a very good designer and artist

2887
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,500
and kind of straddled between the areas.

2888
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:55,560
But Commander Keen was very much Tom Hall's baby

2889
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,787
and he came up with all the design

2890
01:55:57,787 --> 01:56:00,303
and backstory for the different things of kind of,

2891
01:56:00,303 --> 01:56:04,347
a mad scientist little kid with I am,

2892
01:56:04,347 --> 01:56:07,290
building a rocket ship and a zap gun

2893
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:09,150
and visiting alien worlds

2894
01:56:09,150 --> 01:56:11,550
and doing all of this that the background

2895
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:13,620
that we lay the game inside of.

2896
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:16,770
And there's not a whole lot to any of these things.

2897
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:19,560
Design for us was always just what we needed to do

2898
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:23,070
to make the game that was gonna be so much fun to play.

2899
01:56:23,070 --> 01:56:26,431
And we made our, we laid out our first trilogy of games,

2900
01:56:26,431 --> 01:56:27,930
the shareware formula.

2901
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:29,460
It was gonna be three pieces.

2902
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:31,770
We would make Commander Keen one, two, and three.

2903
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:35,850
And we just really started busting on all that work.

2904
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:37,680
And it went together really quickly.

2905
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:39,570
It was like three months or something

2906
01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:41,940
that while we were still making games every month

2907
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:45,480
for Gamers' Edge, we were sharing technology between that.

2908
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:46,830
I'd write a bunch of code for this

2909
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:48,840
and we'd just kind of use it for both.

2910
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:50,880
Again, not a particularly good idea there

2911
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:53,010
that had consequences for us.

2912
01:56:53,010 --> 01:56:57,210
But in three months we got our first game out

2913
01:56:57,210 --> 01:57:00,660
and all of a sudden it was three times as successful

2914
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:03,060
as the most successful thing Apogee had had before.

2915
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:05,919
And we were making like $30,000 a month,

2916
01:57:05,919 --> 01:57:09,060
immediately from the Commander Keen stuff.

2917
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:11,700
And that was again, a surprise to us.

2918
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:15,300
It was more than we thought that was gonna make.

2919
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:16,410
And we said, well,

2920
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:19,080
we're gonna certainly roll into another set of titles

2921
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:19,980
from this.

2922
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:21,270
And in that three months,

2923
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:23,100
I had come up with a much better way

2924
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:24,870
of doing the scrolling technology

2925
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:27,210
that was not the adaptive tile refresh,

2926
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:29,190
which in some ways was even simpler.

2927
01:57:29,190 --> 01:57:30,391
And these things,

2928
01:57:30,391 --> 01:57:33,900
so many of the great ideas of technology are things

2929
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:36,300
that are back of the envelope designs.

2930
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:38,400
I make this comment about modern machine learning

2931
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:41,310
where all the things that are really important practically

2932
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:42,720
in the last decade are,

2933
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,460
each of them fits on the back of an envelope.

2934
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:46,350
There are these simple little things,

2935
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:51,350
they're not super dense, hard to understand technologies.

2936
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:55,080
And so the second scrolling trick was just a matter of like,

2937
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:58,560
okay, we know we've got this 64K window

2938
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,030
and the question was always like,

2939
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:02,250
well you could make a two by two

2940
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:04,711
but you can't go off the edge.

2941
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:06,420
But I finally asked,

2942
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:09,630
well what actually happens if you just go off the edge?

2943
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:12,355
If you take your start and you say it's like, okay,

2944
01:58:12,355 --> 01:58:13,800
I can move over.

2945
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,900
I'm scrolling, I can move over, I can move down.

2946
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:16,920
I'm scrolling.

2947
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:19,770
I get to what should be the bottom of the memory window?

2948
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:21,630
It's like, well what if I just keep going

2949
01:58:21,630 --> 01:58:24,060
and I say I'm gonna start at,

2950
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:27,360
what happens if I start at FFFE at the very end

2951
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:31,950
of the 64K block and it turns out it just wraps back around

2952
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:33,270
to the top of the block.

2953
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:35,850
And I'm like, "Oh well this makes everything easy."

2954
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:37,377
You can just scroll the screen everywhere

2955
01:58:37,377 --> 01:58:40,410
and all you have to draw is just one new line of tiles,

2956
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:42,090
which everything you expose,

2957
01:58:42,090 --> 01:58:44,670
it might be unaligned off various parts

2958
01:58:44,670 --> 01:58:48,180
of the screen memory, but it just works.

2959
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:49,860
That no longer had the problem of,

2960
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:52,230
you had to have fields of the similar colors,

2961
01:58:52,230 --> 01:58:54,300
because it doesn't matter what you're doing,

2962
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:56,820
you could be having a completely unique world

2963
01:58:56,820 --> 01:58:59,460
and you're just drawing the new strip as it comes on.

2964
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:02,190
- But it might be like you said unaligned,

2965
01:59:02,190 --> 01:59:03,090
so it can be all over the place.

2966
01:59:03,090 --> 01:59:04,950
- Yeah and it turns out it doesn't matter.

2967
01:59:04,950 --> 01:59:06,690
I would have two page flipped screens.

2968
01:59:06,690 --> 01:59:07,980
As long as they didn't overlap,

2969
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:11,730
they moved in series through this two dimensional window

2970
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:12,900
of graphics.

2971
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:14,340
And that was one of those like,

2972
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:17,880
well this is so simple, this just works.

2973
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,560
It's faster there.

2974
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:21,750
It seemed like there was no downside.

2975
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:23,520
Funny thing was,

2976
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:26,370
it turned out after we shipped titles with this,

2977
01:59:26,370 --> 01:59:29,670
there were what they called super VGA cards,

2978
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:31,920
the cards that would allow higher resolutions

2979
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:35,730
and different features that the standard ones didn't.

2980
01:59:35,730 --> 01:59:38,010
And on some of those cards,

2981
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:40,350
this was a weird compatibility quirk again,

2982
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:41,370
because nobody thought

2983
01:59:41,370 --> 01:59:43,590
this was not what it was designed to do.

2984
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:45,600
And some of those cards had more memory,

2985
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:48,810
they had more than just 256K in four planes.

2986
01:59:48,810 --> 01:59:51,480
They had five 12K or a megabyte.

2987
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:53,262
And on some of those cards,

2988
01:59:53,262 --> 01:59:55,560
I scroll my window down

2989
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:57,870
and then it goes into initialized memory

2990
01:59:57,870 --> 01:59:59,070
that actually exists there,

2991
01:59:59,070 --> 02:00:01,740
rather than wrapping back around to the top.

2992
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:04,290
And then I was in the tough position of,

2993
02:00:04,290 --> 02:00:06,270
do I have to track every single one of these?

2994
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:08,370
And it was a madhouse back then with,

2995
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:10,710
there were 20 different video card vendors

2996
02:00:10,710 --> 02:00:12,690
with all slightly different implementations

2997
02:00:12,690 --> 02:00:14,820
of their non-standard functionality.

2998
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:19,710
So, either I needed to natively program all of the VGA cards

2999
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:22,080
there to map in that memory

3000
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,330
and keep scrolling down through all of that.

3001
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:27,180
Or I kind of punted and took the easy solution

3002
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:30,300
of when you finally did run to the edge of the screen,

3003
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:31,410
I accepted a hitch

3004
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:33,330
and just copied the whole screen up there.

3005
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:38,310
So, on some of those cards, it was a compatibility mode.

3006
02:00:38,310 --> 02:00:40,140
In the normal ones, when it all worked fine,

3007
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:42,060
everything was just beautifully smooth.

3008
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:43,440
But if you had one of those cards

3009
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:46,350
where it did not wrap the way I wanted it to,

3010
02:00:46,350 --> 02:00:48,840
you'd be scrolling around, scrolling around

3011
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,580
and then eventually you'd have a little hitch

3012
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:52,890
where 200 milliseconds or something

3013
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:54,540
that was not super smooth.

3014
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:55,620
- Yeah, it froze a little bit.

3015
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:57,840
And it's a binary thing.

3016
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,670
Is it one of the standard screens

3017
02:00:59,670 --> 02:01:00,990
or is it one of the weird ones?

3018
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:02,040
The super VGA ones.

3019
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:03,030
- Yeah. - Okay.

3020
02:01:03,030 --> 02:01:04,620
- And so we would default to,

3021
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:06,810
and I think that was one of those that changed,

3022
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:09,000
over the kind of course of deployment

3023
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,070
where early on we would have a normal mode

3024
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:13,500
and then you would enable the compatibility flag

3025
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:16,140
if your screen did this crazy flickery thing

3026
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:18,330
when you got to a certain point in the game.

3027
02:01:18,330 --> 02:01:21,420
And then later I think it probably got enabled by default

3028
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:23,240
as just more and more of the cards.

3029
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:26,160
It kind of did not do exactly the right thing.

3030
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:27,540
And that's the two-edged sword

3031
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:30,330
of doing unconventional things with technology

3032
02:01:30,330 --> 02:01:33,360
where you can find something that nobody thought about doing

3033
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:36,780
that kind of scrolling trick when they set up those cards.

3034
02:01:36,780 --> 02:01:37,920
But the fact that nobody thought

3035
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,623
that was the primary reason when I was relying on that,

3036
02:01:40,623 --> 02:01:44,040
then I wound up being broken on some of the later cards.

3037
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:45,750
- Let me take a bit of a tangent,

3038
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:49,773
but ask you about the hacker ethic,

3039
02:01:49,773 --> 02:01:51,780
'cause you mentioned shareware,

3040
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:53,190
it's an interesting world,

3041
02:01:53,190 --> 02:01:56,700
the world of people that make money,

3042
02:01:56,700 --> 02:02:00,480
the business and the people that build systems,

3043
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,040
the engineers.

3044
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:05,970
And what is the hacker ethic?

3045
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:07,845
You've been a man of the people

3046
02:02:07,845 --> 02:02:12,032
and you've embodied at least the part of that ethic.

3047
02:02:12,032 --> 02:02:13,200
What does it mean?

3048
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,460
What did it mean to you at the time?

3049
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:15,810
What does it mean to you today?

3050
02:02:15,810 --> 02:02:17,880
- So, Stephen Levy's book "Hackers"

3051
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:21,600
was a really formative book for me as a teenager.

3052
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:23,610
I mean I read it several times

3053
02:02:23,610 --> 02:02:25,980
and there was all of the great lore

3054
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:28,950
of the early MIT era of hackers

3055
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:30,960
and ending up at the end with,

3056
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,080
it kind of went through the early MIT hackers

3057
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:36,090
and then the Silicon Valley hardware hackers

3058
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:39,420
and then the game hackers in part three.

3059
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:41,356
And at that time as a teenager,

3060
02:02:41,356 --> 02:02:44,490
I really was kind of bitter in some ways.

3061
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:46,290
Like I thought I was born too late,

3062
02:02:46,290 --> 02:02:49,020
I thought I missed the window there

3063
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:52,050
and I really thought I belonged in that third section

3064
02:02:52,050 --> 02:02:53,610
of that book with the game hackers.

3065
02:02:53,610 --> 02:02:56,730
And they were talking about the Williams at Sierra

3066
02:02:56,730 --> 02:02:58,860
and Origin Systems with Richard Garriott,

3067
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:02,550
and it's like, I really wanted to be there.

3068
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:06,648
And I knew that was now a few years in the past it,

3069
02:03:06,648 --> 02:03:08,700
it was not to be,

3070
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:12,510
but the early days, especially the early MIT hacker days,

3071
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:16,110
talking a lot about this sense of the hacker ethic,

3072
02:03:16,110 --> 02:03:18,000
that there was this sense that

3073
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,730
it was about sharing information, being good,

3074
02:03:20,730 --> 02:03:22,440
not keeping it to yourself

3075
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:24,720
and that it's not a zero sum game

3076
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:28,410
that you can share something with another programmer

3077
02:03:28,410 --> 02:03:30,328
and it doesn't take it away from you.

3078
02:03:30,328 --> 02:03:33,120
You then have somebody else doing something.

3079
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:35,910
And I also think that there's an aspect of it

3080
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:39,150
where it's this ability to take joy

3081
02:03:39,150 --> 02:03:41,220
in other people's accomplishments

3082
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:44,100
where it's not the cutthroat bit of like I have to be first,

3083
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:45,420
I have to be recognized

3084
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:48,240
as the one that did this in some way.

3085
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:51,877
But being able to see somebody do something and say,

3086
02:03:51,877 --> 02:03:53,219
"Holy shit, that's amazing."

3087
02:03:53,219 --> 02:03:56,555
And just taking joy in the ability of something amazing

3088
02:03:56,555 --> 02:03:58,800
that somebody else does.

3089
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:02,670
And the big thing that I was able to do

3090
02:04:02,670 --> 02:04:04,020
through id Software

3091
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:07,170
was this ability to eventually release the source code

3092
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:08,070
for most of our,

3093
02:04:08,070 --> 02:04:10,710
like all of our really seminal game titles.

3094
02:04:10,710 --> 02:04:11,990
And that was a,

3095
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:13,650
it was a stepping stone process

3096
02:04:13,650 --> 02:04:16,500
where we were kind of surprised early on

3097
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:19,797
where people were able to hack the existing games.

3098
02:04:19,797 --> 02:04:21,540
And of course I had experience with that.

3099
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:23,520
I remember hacking my copies of Ultima,

3100
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:27,090
so I'd give myself, 9999 gold and raise my levels

3101
02:04:27,090 --> 02:04:29,100
and break out the sector editor.

3102
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:31,050
And so I was familiar with all of that.

3103
02:04:31,050 --> 02:04:33,000
So, it was just, it was with a smile

3104
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,548
when I started to see people doing that to our games.

3105
02:04:35,548 --> 02:04:38,940
Making level editors for Commander Keen

3106
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:41,820
or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D

3107
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:44,940
but I made the pitch internally

3108
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:47,550
that we should actually release our own tools

3109
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:48,764
for like what we did,

3110
02:04:48,764 --> 02:04:51,420
what we used to create the games.

3111
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:55,546
And that was a little bit debatable about well,

3112
02:04:55,546 --> 02:04:57,930
we'll give people a leg up.

3113
02:04:57,930 --> 02:04:58,763
It's always like,

3114
02:04:58,763 --> 02:05:00,480
what's that gonna mean for the competition?

3115
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:01,313
- [Lex] Yeah.

3116
02:05:01,313 --> 02:05:03,000
- But the really hard pitch

3117
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,750
was to actually release the full source code for the games

3118
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:08,580
and it was a balancing act

3119
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:11,340
with the other people inside the company

3120
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:15,150
where, it's interesting how the programmers,

3121
02:05:15,150 --> 02:05:17,070
generally did get,

3122
02:05:17,070 --> 02:05:20,400
certainly the people that I worked closely with,

3123
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,620
they did kind of get that hacker ethic bit

3124
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:24,686
where you wanted to share your code,

3125
02:05:24,686 --> 02:05:25,770
you were proud of it,

3126
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:26,817
you wanted other people to take it

3127
02:05:26,817 --> 02:05:28,950
and do cool things with it.

3128
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:33,870
But interestingly, the broader game industry

3129
02:05:33,870 --> 02:05:36,540
is a little more hesitant to embrace that

3130
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:39,030
than like the group of people that we happen to have

3131
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:40,170
at id Software.

3132
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:42,540
Where it was always a little interesting to me,

3133
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,920
seeing how a lot

3134
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,600
of people in the game modding community

3135
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,640
were very possessive of their code.

3136
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,320
They did not want to share their code,

3137
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:50,550
they wanted it to be theirs,

3138
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:52,620
it was their claim to fame.

3139
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:55,410
And that was much more like what we tended to see

3140
02:05:55,410 --> 02:05:56,243
with artists

3141
02:05:56,243 --> 02:05:59,190
where the artists understand something about credit

3142
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:02,220
and wanting it to be known as their work.

3143
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:04,699
And a lot of the game programmers,

3144
02:06:04,699 --> 02:06:07,020
felt a little bit more like artists

3145
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:08,580
than like hacker programmers

3146
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:11,010
in that it was about building something

3147
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:13,020
that maybe felt more like art to them

3148
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:16,740
than the more tool-based and exploration-based,

3149
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:19,114
kind of hacking culture side of things.

3150
02:06:19,114 --> 02:06:19,947
- Yeah.

3151
02:06:19,947 --> 02:06:23,760
So, it's so interesting that this kind of fear

3152
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,840
that credit will not be sufficiently attributed to you.

3153
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,390
- And that's one of the things that I do bump into a lot,

3154
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:34,260
because I try not to go clean.

3155
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,400
I mean, it's easy for me to say,

3156
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:37,230
because so much credit is heaped on me

3157
02:06:37,230 --> 02:06:39,360
for the the id Software side of things.

3158
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,210
But when people come up and they want to pick a fight

3159
02:06:42,210 --> 02:06:43,620
and say no, it's like that wasn't

3160
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:45,720
where first person gaming came from.

3161
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:50,250
And you can point to some of like things on obscure titles

3162
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:53,340
that I was never aware of or like the old Plato systems

3163
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:55,860
or each personal computer had something

3164
02:06:55,860 --> 02:06:58,350
that was 3D-ish and moving around

3165
02:06:58,350 --> 02:07:00,617
and I'm happy to say it's like no,

3166
02:07:00,617 --> 02:07:03,900
I mean I saw Battle Zone and Star Wars in the arcades.

3167
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:05,340
I had seen 3D graphics,

3168
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:06,423
I had seen all these things

3169
02:07:06,423 --> 02:07:09,090
that I'm standing on the shoulders of lots of other people,

3170
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:10,860
but sometimes these examples they pull out,

3171
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:12,540
it's like, "Nah, I didn't know that existed."

3172
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:13,410
I mean there,

3173
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:15,300
I had never heard of that before then

3174
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:17,850
that didn't contribute to what I made.

3175
02:07:17,850 --> 02:07:19,500
But there's plenty of stuff that did.

3176
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:23,310
And I think there's good cases to be made

3177
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:26,190
that obviously Doom and Quake and Wolfenstein

3178
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:27,960
were were formative examples

3179
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:31,740
for what everything that came after that.

3180
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:34,200
But I don't feel the need to go fight

3181
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:37,500
and say claim primacy or initial invention

3182
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:38,333
of anything like that.

3183
02:07:38,333 --> 02:07:40,470
But a lot of people do want to.

3184
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:42,897
- I think when you fight for the credit in that way

3185
02:07:42,897 --> 02:07:45,268
and it does go against the hacker ethic,

3186
02:07:45,268 --> 02:07:48,810
you destroy something fundamental about the culture,

3187
02:07:48,810 --> 02:07:51,810
about the community that builds cool stuff.

3188
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:53,793
I think credit ultimately,

3189
02:07:55,514 --> 02:07:58,410
I had this sort of,

3190
02:07:58,410 --> 02:08:00,990
there's a famous wrestler and freestyle wrestling,

3191
02:08:00,990 --> 02:08:03,542
called Tatsuhiro Saito,

3192
02:08:03,542 --> 02:08:07,770
and he always preached that you should just focus

3193
02:08:07,770 --> 02:08:09,510
on the art of the wrestling

3194
02:08:09,510 --> 02:08:14,510
and let people write your story however they want.

3195
02:08:16,043 --> 02:08:20,100
Te highest form of the art is just focusing on the art.

3196
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:22,050
And that's something that is something,

3197
02:08:22,050 --> 02:08:23,790
about the hacker ethic

3198
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:26,940
is just focused on building cool stuff,

3199
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:29,400
sharing it with other cool people

3200
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:32,560
and credit will get assigned correctly

3201
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:37,260
in the long arc of history.

3202
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,314
- Yeah.

3203
02:08:38,314 --> 02:08:40,960
And I generally think that's true and you've got,

3204
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:43,050
like there's some things there's,

3205
02:08:43,050 --> 02:08:44,250
there's the graphics technique

3206
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:46,929
that got labeled CarMax Reverse,

3207
02:08:46,929 --> 02:08:49,080
literally named and it turned out

3208
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:51,690
that I wasn't the first person to figure that out.

3209
02:08:51,690 --> 02:08:54,360
Like most scientific things or mathematical things,

3210
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:55,193
you wind up, it's like,

3211
02:08:55,193 --> 02:08:57,127
"Oh this other person had actually done that,

3212
02:08:57,127 --> 02:08:58,590
"somewhat before."

3213
02:08:58,590 --> 02:09:00,300
And then there's things that get attributed to me,

3214
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:03,300
like the inverse square root hack that I actually didn't do.

3215
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:04,180
I flat out that wasn't me.

3216
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:06,060
And it's like, it's weird

3217
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:07,890
how the mimetic power of the internet.

3218
02:09:07,890 --> 02:09:11,977
I cannot convince people of that, yes.

3219
02:09:11,977 --> 02:09:14,070
- It's just everything just gets attributed to you now,

3220
02:09:14,070 --> 02:09:17,250
even though you've never sought the credit of things.

3221
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:21,210
I mean, but part of the fact that humility behind that

3222
02:09:21,210 --> 02:09:24,063
is what attracts the attributions.

3223
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:27,000
Let's talk about a game,

3224
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,520
to me one of the greatest games ever made.

3225
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:31,287
I know you could talk about Doom and Quake and so on,

3226
02:09:31,287 --> 02:09:33,783
but to me Wolfenstein 3D was like, whoa,

3227
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:38,160
it blew my mind that that world like this could exist.

3228
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:40,901
So, how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be

3229
02:09:40,901 --> 02:09:43,200
in terms of the programming,

3230
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:44,250
in terms of the design,

3231
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:47,110
in terms of some of the memorable technical challenges

3232
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:50,790
And also actually just something you haven't mentioned

3233
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:55,790
is how do these ideas come to be inside your mind,

3234
02:09:58,170 --> 02:10:00,135
the adaptive side scrolling.

3235
02:10:00,135 --> 02:10:03,570
So, the solutions to these technical challenges.

3236
02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:06,930
- So, I usually can introspectively pull back,

3237
02:10:06,930 --> 02:10:11,370
pretty detailed accounts of how technology solutions

3238
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:14,010
and design choices on my part came to be.

3239
02:10:14,010 --> 02:10:17,460
Where technically we had done two games,

3240
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:19,230
3D games like that before

3241
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:21,000
where Hover Tank was the first one

3242
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,800
which had flat shaded walls

3243
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:25,260
but did have the scaled enemies inside it.

3244
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:28,950
And then Catacombs 3D which had textured walls,

3245
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:33,180
scaled enemies and some more functionality,

3246
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:37,200
like the disappearing walls and some other stuff.

3247
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:38,700
But what's really interesting

3248
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:41,190
from a game development standpoint is

3249
02:10:41,190 --> 02:10:45,060
those games Catacombs 3D, Hover Tank and Wolfenstein,

3250
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:48,300
they literally used the same code

3251
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:51,420
for a lot of the character behavior that a 2D game

3252
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:54,180
that I had made earlier called Catacombs did,

3253
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:55,860
where it was an overhead view game,

3254
02:10:55,860 --> 02:10:56,790
kind of like gauntlet,

3255
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:58,860
you're running around and you can open up doors,

3256
02:10:58,860 --> 02:11:01,350
pick up items, basic game stuff.

3257
02:11:01,350 --> 02:11:03,870
And the thought was that

3258
02:11:03,870 --> 02:11:07,560
this exact same game experience just presented

3259
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:09,120
in a different perspective.

3260
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:11,400
It could be literally the same game,

3261
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,500
just with a different view into it,

3262
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:16,920
would have a dramatically different impact on the players.

3263
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:20,340
- So, it wasn't a true 3D,

3264
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:22,313
you're saying that you could kind of fake it.

3265
02:11:22,313 --> 02:11:24,210
You can like scale enemies,

3266
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:25,770
meaning things that are farther away,

3267
02:11:25,770 --> 02:11:27,480
you can make 'em smaller.

3268
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:29,820
- So, from the game was a 2D map,

3269
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:33,060
like all of our games used the same tool for creation.

3270
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:35,400
We used the same map editor for creating Keen,

3271
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,950
as Wolfenstein and Hover Tank and Catacombs

3272
02:11:37,950 --> 02:11:39,150
and all this stuff.

3273
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:42,720
So the game was a 2D grid made outta blocks

3274
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:44,520
and you could say, well these are walls,

3275
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:45,900
these are where the enemies start.

3276
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,730
Then they start moving around.

3277
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:49,650
And these early games like Catacombs,

3278
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:51,630
you played it strictly in a 2D view.

3279
02:11:51,630 --> 02:11:52,947
It was a scrolling 2D view

3280
02:11:52,947 --> 02:11:55,350
and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh

3281
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:57,865
at the time to be able to do something like that.

3282
02:11:57,865 --> 02:12:01,650
And then the thought that these early games,

3283
02:12:01,650 --> 02:12:04,650
all it did was take the same basic enemy logic,

3284
02:12:04,650 --> 02:12:07,740
but instead of seeing it from the god's eye view on top,

3285
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:08,910
you are inside it

3286
02:12:08,910 --> 02:12:11,310
and turning from side to side yawing your view

3287
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:13,862
and moving forwards and backwards and side to side.

3288
02:12:13,862 --> 02:12:16,200
And it's a striking thing

3289
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:18,060
where you always talk about wanting to isolate

3290
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:20,100
and factor changes in values.

3291
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:22,380
And this was one of those most pure cases there

3292
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:25,080
where the rest of the game changed very little.

3293
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,840
It was our normal kind of change the colors on something

3294
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,220
and draw a different picture for it,

3295
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:30,900
but it's kind of the same thing.

3296
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:33,990
But the perspective changed in a really fundamental way

3297
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:36,330
and it was dramatically different.

3298
02:12:36,330 --> 02:12:40,650
I can remember the reactions where the artist Adrian

3299
02:12:40,650 --> 02:12:42,120
that had been drawing the pictures for it,

3300
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:44,880
we had a cool big troll thing in Catacombs 3D

3301
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:47,760
and we had these walls that you could get a key

3302
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:49,950
and you could make the blocks disappear

3303
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:51,030
and really simple stuff,

3304
02:12:51,030 --> 02:12:52,950
blocks could either be there or not there.

3305
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:54,480
So, our idea of a door

3306
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:57,330
was being able to make a set of blocks just disappear.

3307
02:12:57,330 --> 02:12:58,680
And I remember the reaction

3308
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:00,120
where he had drawn these characters

3309
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:01,770
and he was slowly moving around

3310
02:13:01,770 --> 02:13:04,530
and like people had no experience with 3D navigation,

3311
02:13:04,530 --> 02:13:05,490
it was all still keyboard.

3312
02:13:05,490 --> 02:13:08,520
We didn't even have mice set up at that time.

3313
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:12,300
But slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall,

3314
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:14,370
the wall disappears in a little animation

3315
02:13:14,370 --> 02:13:16,320
and there's a monster like right there.

3316
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,030
And he practically fell out of his chair.

3317
02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:19,260
It was just like, ah.

3318
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:22,500
And games just didn't do that.

3319
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:24,360
The games were the god's eye view.

3320
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:26,310
You were a little invested in your little guy,

3321
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:29,760
you can be like happy or sad when things happen,

3322
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,460
but you just did not get that of startle reaction.

3323
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:33,930
- You weren't inside your game.

3324
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:35,580
- Something in the back of your brain.

3325
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:37,687
Some reptile brain thing is just going,

3326
02:13:37,687 --> 02:13:39,407
"Oh, shit something just happened."

3327
02:13:39,407 --> 02:13:42,510
And that was one of those early points where it's like,

3328
02:13:42,510 --> 02:13:44,790
yeah, this is gonna make a difference.

3329
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:47,400
This is going to be powerful and it's gonna matter.

3330
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:51,090
- Were you able to imagine that in the idea stage or no?

3331
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:53,730
- So not that exact thing.

3332
02:13:53,730 --> 02:13:56,490
So again, we had cases like the arcade games,

3333
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:58,020
Battle Zone and Star Wars

3334
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:00,150
that you could kind of see a 3D world

3335
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:03,480
and things coming at you and you get some sense of it.

3336
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:05,580
But nothing had done the kind of worlds

3337
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:08,490
that we were doing and the sort of action based things.

3338
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:12,390
3D at the time was really largely about

3339
02:14:12,390 --> 02:14:13,864
the simulation thoughts.

3340
02:14:13,864 --> 02:14:15,930
And this is something that,

3341
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:18,120
really might have trended differently

3342
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:20,970
if not for the id Software approach in the games

3343
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:23,580
where there were flight simulators,

3344
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:24,960
there were driving simulators,

3345
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:28,440
you had like hard drive in and Microsoft Flight Simulator

3346
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:31,380
and these were doing 3D and general purpose 3D

3347
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:33,750
and ways that were more flexible

3348
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:35,460
than what we were doing with our games.

3349
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:38,010
But they were looked at as simulations.

3350
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:42,030
They weren't trying to necessarily be fast or responsive

3351
02:14:42,030 --> 02:14:44,850
or letting you do kind of exciting maneuvers,

3352
02:14:44,850 --> 02:14:46,800
because they were trying to simulate reality

3353
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:49,290
and they were taking their cues from the big systems,

3354
02:14:49,290 --> 02:14:50,400
the Evans and Sutherlands

3355
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,860
and the Silicon Graphics that were doing things.

3356
02:14:52,860 --> 02:14:54,600
But we were taking our cues

3357
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:56,550
from the console and arcade games,

3358
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:59,490
we wanted things that were sort of quarter eaters

3359
02:14:59,490 --> 02:15:01,185
that were doing fast paced things

3360
02:15:01,185 --> 02:15:02,790
that you could smack you around,

3361
02:15:02,790 --> 02:15:06,180
rather than just smoothly gliding you from place to place.

3362
02:15:06,180 --> 02:15:07,590
- So, quarter years.

3363
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:10,200
- And a funny thing is,

3364
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:13,650
so much that that built into us that Wolfenstein,

3365
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:14,787
still had lives

3366
02:15:14,787 --> 02:15:16,560
and you had like one of the biggest power ups

3367
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:18,810
in all these games, like was an extra life,

3368
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:20,550
because you started off with three lives

3369
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:23,070
and you lose your lives and then it's game over

3370
02:15:23,070 --> 02:15:26,356
and there weren't save games in most of this stuff.

3371
02:15:26,356 --> 02:15:28,770
It sounds almost crazy to say this,

3372
02:15:28,770 --> 02:15:32,160
but it was an innovation in Doom to not have lives.

3373
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:33,870
You could just play doom as long as you wanted.

3374
02:15:33,870 --> 02:15:36,780
You just restart at the the start of the level and why not?

3375
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:39,750
This is like we aren't trying to take people's quarters,

3376
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:41,370
they've already paid for the entire game.

3377
02:15:41,370 --> 02:15:43,380
We want them to have a good time

3378
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:45,510
and you would have some,

3379
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:47,250
some old timer purists that might think

3380
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:48,930
that there's something to the epic journey

3381
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:50,040
of making it to the end,

3382
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:52,050
having to restart all the way from the beginning

3383
02:15:52,050 --> 02:15:53,460
after a certain number of tries.

3384
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:55,140
But now more fun is had

3385
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:57,240
when you just let people kind of keep trying

3386
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:59,802
when they're stuck rather than having to go all the way back

3387
02:15:59,802 --> 02:16:01,920
and learn different things.

3388
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:03,217
- So, you've recommended the book,

3389
02:16:03,217 --> 02:16:05,760
"Game Engine Black Book Wolfenstein 3D"

3390
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:07,590
for technical exploration of the game.

3391
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:10,560
So looking back 30 years,

3392
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,260
what are some memorable technical innovations

3393
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:16,457
that made this perspective shift into this world

3394
02:16:16,457 --> 02:16:20,160
that's so immersive that scares you when a monster appears?

3395
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,260
What were some things you had to solve?

3396
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:24,150
- So, one of the interesting things

3397
02:16:24,150 --> 02:16:26,310
that come back to the theme of deadlines

3398
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:27,858
and resource constraints,

3399
02:16:27,858 --> 02:16:32,100
the game Catacombs 3D we shipped,

3400
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:33,959
we were supposed to be shipping this for Gamers' Edge

3401
02:16:33,959 --> 02:16:36,420
on a monthly cadence and I had slipped,

3402
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:37,830
I was actually late,

3403
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:39,270
it slipped like six weeks,

3404
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:42,240
because this was texture mapped walls doing stuff

3405
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:44,760
that I hadn't done before.

3406
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:46,770
And at the six week point,

3407
02:16:46,770 --> 02:16:48,990
it was still kind of glitchy and buggy.

3408
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:50,639
There were things that I knew that

3409
02:16:50,639 --> 02:16:53,190
if you had a wall that was like almost edge on,

3410
02:16:53,190 --> 02:16:54,297
you could slide over to it

3411
02:16:54,297 --> 02:16:56,040
and you could see some things freak out

3412
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,660
or vanish or not work.

3413
02:16:57,660 --> 02:17:01,500
And I hated that, but I was up against the wall.

3414
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:03,000
We had to ship the game.

3415
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,709
It was still a lot of fun to play.

3416
02:17:04,709 --> 02:17:05,780
It was novel, nobody had seen it.

3417
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:09,059
It gave you that startle reflex reaction.

3418
02:17:09,059 --> 02:17:11,040
So, it was worth shipping,

3419
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,980
but it had these things that I knew were kind of flaky

3420
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:17,430
and janky and not what I was really proud of.

3421
02:17:17,430 --> 02:17:20,760
So, one of the things that I did very differently

3422
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:24,090
in Wolfenstein, I was went,

3423
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:27,209
Catacombs used almost a conventional thing

3424
02:17:27,209 --> 02:17:28,379
where you had segments

3425
02:17:28,379 --> 02:17:30,660
that were one dimensional polygons basically,

3426
02:17:30,660 --> 02:17:33,090
that were clipped and back faced

3427
02:17:33,090 --> 02:17:36,330
and done kind of like a very crude 3D engine

3428
02:17:36,330 --> 02:17:37,350
from the professionals.

3429
02:17:37,350 --> 02:17:39,510
But I wasn't getting it done right.

3430
02:17:39,510 --> 02:17:41,549
I was not doing a good enough job.

3431
02:17:41,549 --> 02:17:45,510
I didn't really have line of sight to fix it, right?

3432
02:17:45,510 --> 02:17:46,920
There's stuff that of course I look back,

3433
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:48,357
it's like, oh it's obvious how to do this

3434
02:17:48,357 --> 02:17:49,530
and do the math right?

3435
02:17:49,530 --> 02:17:50,600
Do your clipping right,

3436
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:53,250
check all of this, how you handle the precision.

3437
02:17:53,250 --> 02:17:55,716
But I did not know how to do that at that time.

3438
02:17:55,716 --> 02:17:59,142
- Was that the first 3D engine you wrote Catacombs 3D?

3439
02:17:59,142 --> 02:18:00,870
- And Hover Tank had been a little bit before that,

3440
02:18:00,870 --> 02:18:02,490
but that had the flat shaded walls.

3441
02:18:02,490 --> 02:18:04,770
So the texture mapping on the walls was

3442
02:18:04,770 --> 02:18:06,900
what was bringing in some of these challenges.

3443
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:08,727
That was hard for me

3444
02:18:08,727 --> 02:18:11,100
and I couldn't solve it right at the time.

3445
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:13,469
- Can you describe what flat shading is and texture mapping?

3446
02:18:13,469 --> 02:18:16,049
- So, the walls were solid color,

3447
02:18:16,049 --> 02:18:19,320
one of 16 colors in Hover Tank.

3448
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:20,850
So, that's easy, it's fast.

3449
02:18:20,850 --> 02:18:23,670
You just draw the solid color for everything.

3450
02:18:23,670 --> 02:18:25,590
Texture mapping is what we all see today

3451
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:27,389
where you have an image that is stretched

3452
02:18:27,389 --> 02:18:29,129
and distorted onto the walls

3453
02:18:29,129 --> 02:18:31,242
or the surfaces that you're working with.

3454
02:18:31,242 --> 02:18:35,820
And it was a long time for me to just figure out how to do

3455
02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:38,475
that without it distorting in the wrong ways

3456
02:18:38,475 --> 02:18:42,420
and I did not get it all exactly right in Catacombs

3457
02:18:42,420 --> 02:18:44,850
and I had these flaws.

3458
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:46,770
So, that was important enough to me

3459
02:18:46,770 --> 02:18:49,410
that rather than continuing to bang my head on that

3460
02:18:49,410 --> 02:18:51,870
when I wasn't positive I was gonna get it,

3461
02:18:51,870 --> 02:18:54,540
I went with a completely different approach for drawing,

3462
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:56,459
for figuring out where the walls were,

3463
02:18:56,459 --> 02:18:58,620
which was a ray casting approach,

3464
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:00,870
which I had done in Catacombs 3D,

3465
02:19:00,870 --> 02:19:04,020
I had a bunch of C code trying to make this work right

3466
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:05,879
and it wasn't working right.

3467
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:06,809
In Wolfenstein,

3468
02:19:06,809 --> 02:19:11,190
I wound up going to a very small amount of assembly code.

3469
02:19:11,190 --> 02:19:14,400
So, in some ways this should be a slower way of doing it,

3470
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:16,590
but by making it a smaller amount of work

3471
02:19:16,590 --> 02:19:19,320
that I could more tightly optimize, it worked out.

3472
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:22,830
And Wolfenstein 3D was just absolutely rock solid.

3473
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:25,530
It was nothing glitched in there.

3474
02:19:25,530 --> 02:19:28,290
The game just was pretty much through all of that

3475
02:19:28,290 --> 02:19:29,993
and I was super proud of that.

3476
02:19:29,993 --> 02:19:33,270
But eventually, like in the later games,

3477
02:19:33,270 --> 02:19:35,670
I went back to the more span based things

3478
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:37,650
where I could get more total efficiency,

3479
02:19:37,650 --> 02:19:40,139
once I really did figure out how to do it.

3480
02:19:40,139 --> 02:19:42,690
So, there were two sort of key technical things

3481
02:19:42,690 --> 02:19:43,559
to Wolfenstein.

3482
02:19:43,559 --> 02:19:45,870
One will this ray casting approach,

3483
02:19:45,870 --> 02:19:47,549
which you still to this day,

3484
02:19:47,549 --> 02:19:50,520
you see people go and say let's write a ray casting engine

3485
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:53,190
because it's an understandable way of doing things

3486
02:19:53,190 --> 02:19:55,740
that lets you make games very much like that.

3487
02:19:55,740 --> 02:19:57,660
So, you see ray casters in JavaScript,

3488
02:19:57,660 --> 02:19:58,920
ray casters in Python,

3489
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:00,690
people that are basically going

3490
02:20:00,690 --> 02:20:03,480
and reimplementing that approach

3491
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:06,540
to taking a tiled world and casting out into it.

3492
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:07,380
It works pretty well,

3493
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:08,847
but it's not the fastest way of doing it.

3494
02:20:08,847 --> 02:20:11,028
- Can you describe what ray casting is?

3495
02:20:11,028 --> 02:20:13,470
- So you start off and you've got your screen,

3496
02:20:13,470 --> 02:20:15,810
which is 320 pixels across at the time

3497
02:20:15,810 --> 02:20:19,800
if you haven't sized down in the window for greater speed.

3498
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:22,860
And at every pixel there's gonna be an angle from,

3499
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:24,540
you've got your position in the world

3500
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:26,940
and you're gonna just run along that angle

3501
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:28,691
and keep going until you hit a block.

3502
02:20:28,691 --> 02:20:32,070
So, up to 320 times across there,

3503
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:35,550
it's gonna throw a cast array out into the world

3504
02:20:35,550 --> 02:20:38,700
from wherever your origin is until it runs into a wall

3505
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:40,050
and then it can figure out exactly

3506
02:20:40,050 --> 02:20:42,180
where on the wall it hits.

3507
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:44,280
The performance challenge of that is

3508
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:47,490
as it's going out every block it's crossing it checks,

3509
02:20:47,490 --> 02:20:49,290
is this a solid wall?

3510
02:20:49,290 --> 02:20:52,500
So, that means that in like the early Wolfenstein levels,

3511
02:20:52,500 --> 02:20:55,890
you're in a small jail cell going out into a small hallway,

3512
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:57,210
it's super efficient for that,

3513
02:20:57,210 --> 02:21:00,240
because you're only stepping across three or four blocks.

3514
02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:02,520
But then if somebody makes a room that covers,

3515
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:05,520
our maps we're limited to 64 by 64 blocks.

3516
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:08,010
If you made one room that was nothing

3517
02:21:08,010 --> 02:21:09,900
but walls at the far space,

3518
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:11,040
it would go pretty slow,

3519
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:14,460
because it would be stepping across 80 tile tests

3520
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:16,045
or something along the way.

3521
02:21:16,045 --> 02:21:16,878
- By the way

3522
02:21:16,878 --> 02:21:18,360
the physics of our universe seems to be competing

3523
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:19,193
in this very thing.

3524
02:21:19,193 --> 02:21:23,100
So, this maps nicely to the actual physics of our world.

3525
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:23,933
- Yeah, you get like-

3526
02:21:23,933 --> 02:21:24,766
- Intuitively

3527
02:21:24,766 --> 02:21:25,599
- I follow a little bit of something,

3528
02:21:25,599 --> 02:21:27,109
like Stephen Wolfram's work on,

3529
02:21:27,109 --> 02:21:30,630
interconnected network information states of that

3530
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:35,040
and it's beyond what I can have an informed opinion on.

3531
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:36,870
But it's interesting that people

3532
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:38,640
are considering things like that

3533
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:41,599
and have and have things that can back it up.

3534
02:21:41,599 --> 02:21:44,220
Yeah, there's whole different sets

3535
02:21:44,220 --> 02:21:45,750
of interesting stuff there.

3536
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:48,180
- So, Wolfenstein 3D had ray casting.

3537
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:49,020
- So, ray casting

3538
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:51,780
and then the other kind of key aspect was

3539
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:54,000
what I called compiled scalers,

3540
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,759
where the idea of,

3541
02:21:56,759 --> 02:21:59,820
you saw this in the earlier classic arcade games,

3542
02:21:59,820 --> 02:22:01,377
like Space Harrier and stuff where,

3543
02:22:01,377 --> 02:22:02,820
you would take a picture

3544
02:22:02,820 --> 02:22:05,760
which is normally drawn directly on the screen

3545
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:06,900
and then if you have the ability

3546
02:22:06,900 --> 02:22:08,280
to make it bigger or smaller,

3547
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:12,240
big chunky pixels or fizzly, small drop sample pixels.

3548
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:13,770
That's the fundamental aspect

3549
02:22:13,770 --> 02:22:16,560
of what our characters were doing in these 3D games.

3550
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:17,393
You would have,

3551
02:22:17,393 --> 02:22:19,410
it's just like you might've drawn a tiny little character,

3552
02:22:19,410 --> 02:22:20,820
but now we can make 'em really big

3553
02:22:20,820 --> 02:22:23,280
and make 'em really small and move it around.

3554
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:26,520
That was the limited kind of 3D that we had for characters

3555
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:27,353
to make 'em turn,

3556
02:22:27,353 --> 02:22:29,610
there were literally eight different views of them.

3557
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:31,830
You didn't actually have a 3D model that would rotate,

3558
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:33,810
you just had these cardboard cutouts,

3559
02:22:33,810 --> 02:22:36,810
but that was good enough for that startle fight reaction

3560
02:22:36,810 --> 02:22:40,110
and it was kind of what we had to do deal with there.

3561
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:42,330
So, a straightforward approach to do that,

3562
02:22:42,330 --> 02:22:44,640
you could just write out your doubly nested loop

3563
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:47,130
of you've got your stretch factor

3564
02:22:47,130 --> 02:22:48,120
and it's like you've got a point,

3565
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:49,410
you stretch by a little bit.

3566
02:22:49,410 --> 02:22:50,730
It might be on the same pixel,

3567
02:22:50,730 --> 02:22:51,720
it might be on the next pixel,

3568
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:53,230
it might have skipped a pixel.

3569
02:22:53,230 --> 02:22:54,750
You can write that out,

3570
02:22:54,750 --> 02:22:56,130
but it's not gonna be fast enough

3571
02:22:56,130 --> 02:22:57,930
where especially you get a character

3572
02:22:57,930 --> 02:22:59,670
for that right in your face,

3573
02:22:59,670 --> 02:23:02,220
monster covering almost the entire screen.

3574
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:05,130
Doing that with a general purpose scaling routine,

3575
02:23:05,130 --> 02:23:06,555
would've just been much too slow.

3576
02:23:06,555 --> 02:23:08,370
It would've worked when they're small characters,

3577
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:10,710
but then it would get slower and slower as they got closer

3578
02:23:10,710 --> 02:23:12,210
to you until right at the time

3579
02:23:12,210 --> 02:23:15,360
when you most care about having a fast reaction time,

3580
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:17,370
the game would be chunking down.

3581
02:23:17,370 --> 02:23:22,370
So, the fastest possible way to draw pixels at that time

3582
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:26,250
was to, instead of saying,

3583
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:29,460
I've got a general purpose version

3584
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:32,370
that can handle any scale I made,

3585
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:35,880
I used a program to make essentially a hundred

3586
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:39,210
or more separate little programs that was optimized for,

3587
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:42,240
I will take an image and I will draw it 12 pixels tall,

3588
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:44,700
I'll take an image, I'll draw it 14 pixels tall,

3589
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:47,730
up by every two pixels, even for that.

3590
02:23:47,730 --> 02:23:50,340
So, you would have the most optimized code,

3591
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:53,760
so that in the normal case where most of the world

3592
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:57,030
is fairly large, like the pixels are big,

3593
02:23:57,030 --> 02:23:58,680
we did not have a lot of memory.

3594
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:00,690
So, in most cases that meant

3595
02:24:00,690 --> 02:24:02,730
that you would load a pixel color

3596
02:24:02,730 --> 02:24:05,280
and then you would store it multiple times.

3597
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:09,090
So, that was faster than even copying an image

3598
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:10,770
in a normal conventional case

3599
02:24:10,770 --> 02:24:13,260
because most of the time the image is expanded.

3600
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:14,700
So, instead of doing one read,

3601
02:24:14,700 --> 02:24:16,650
one write for a simple copy,

3602
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:19,170
you might be doing one read and three or four writes

3603
02:24:19,170 --> 02:24:20,490
as it got really big.

3604
02:24:20,490 --> 02:24:22,380
And that had the beneficial aspect

3605
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:23,942
of just when you needed the performance most

3606
02:24:23,942 --> 02:24:26,010
when things are covering the screen,

3607
02:24:26,010 --> 02:24:28,500
it was giving you the most acceleration for that.

3608
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:29,333
- By the way,

3609
02:24:29,333 --> 02:24:33,780
were you able to understand this through thinking about it

3610
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:35,790
or were you testing like the right speed?

3611
02:24:35,790 --> 02:24:37,890
- So this again comes back to,

3612
02:24:37,890 --> 02:24:41,160
I can find the antecedents for things like this.

3613
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:44,524
So, in back in the Apple II days,

3614
02:24:44,524 --> 02:24:49,524
the graphics were essentially single bits at a time.

3615
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:51,810
And if you wanted to make your little spaceship,

3616
02:24:51,810 --> 02:24:54,900
if you wanted to make it smoothly go across the world,

3617
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:56,040
if you just took the image

3618
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:57,990
and you drew it out at the next location,

3619
02:24:57,990 --> 02:24:59,910
you would move by seven pixels at a time.

3620
02:24:59,910 --> 02:25:01,350
So it would go chunk, chunk, chunk.

3621
02:25:01,350 --> 02:25:03,270
If you wanted to make it move smoothly,

3622
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:05,910
you actually had to make seven versions of the ship

3623
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:07,350
that were pre-shift.

3624
02:25:07,350 --> 02:25:09,930
You could write a program that would shift it dynamically,

3625
02:25:09,930 --> 02:25:11,460
but on a one megahertz processor

3626
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:13,170
that's not going anywhere fast.

3627
02:25:13,170 --> 02:25:16,650
So, if you wanted to do a smooth moving fast action game,

3628
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:20,460
you made separate versions of each of these sprites.

3629
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:22,350
Now, there were a few more tricks you could pull

3630
02:25:22,350 --> 02:25:24,480
that if it still fast enough,

3631
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:27,510
you could make a compiled shape where,

3632
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:30,927
instead of this program that normally copies an image

3633
02:25:30,927 --> 02:25:33,780
and it says like, get this bite from here stored here,

3634
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:35,400
get this bite stored this bite.

3635
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:37,590
If you've got the memory space,

3636
02:25:37,590 --> 02:25:38,430
you could say,

3637
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:40,590
I'm going to write the program that does nothing

3638
02:25:40,590 --> 02:25:41,970
but draw this shape.

3639
02:25:41,970 --> 02:25:42,803
It's going to be like,

3640
02:25:42,803 --> 02:25:46,650
I'm going to load the immediate value 25,

3641
02:25:46,650 --> 02:25:47,970
which is some bit pattern.

3642
02:25:47,970 --> 02:25:51,050
And then I'm going to store that at this location,

3643
02:25:51,050 --> 02:25:53,280
rather than loading something from memory

3644
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:56,880
that involved indexing registers and this other slow stuff.

3645
02:25:56,880 --> 02:25:57,750
You could go ahead and say,

3646
02:25:57,750 --> 02:26:00,000
no, I'm gonna hard code the exact values

3647
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,460
of all of the image right into the program.

3648
02:26:02,460 --> 02:26:04,110
And this was always a horrible trade off there,

3649
02:26:04,110 --> 02:26:05,370
but you didn't have much memory

3650
02:26:05,370 --> 02:26:06,990
and you didn't have much speed.

3651
02:26:06,990 --> 02:26:09,600
But if you had something that you wanted to go really fast,

3652
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:11,790
you could turn it into a program.

3653
02:26:11,790 --> 02:26:14,580
And that was knowing about that technique

3654
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:16,770
is what made me think about some of these,

3655
02:26:16,770 --> 02:26:18,600
unwinding it for the PC

3656
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:20,610
where people that didn't come from that background

3657
02:26:20,610 --> 02:26:23,340
were less likely to think about that.

3658
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:25,200
- I mean there's some deep parallels,

3659
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:27,480
probably to human cognition as well.

3660
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:31,440
There's something about optimizing

3661
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:36,440
and compressing the processing of a new information

3662
02:26:36,810 --> 02:26:39,750
that requires you to predict the possible ways

3663
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:44,460
in which the game or the world might unroll.

3664
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:47,460
And you have something like compiled scaler is always there.

3665
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:51,420
So, you have like you have a prediction

3666
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:52,740
of how the world will unroll

3667
02:26:52,740 --> 02:26:57,060
and you have some kind of optimized data structure

3668
02:26:57,060 --> 02:26:58,200
for that prediction.

3669
02:26:58,200 --> 02:26:59,430
And then you can modify

3670
02:26:59,430 --> 02:27:01,080
if the world turns out to be different,

3671
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:02,127
you can modify a slight way.

3672
02:27:02,127 --> 02:27:04,200
- And as far as building out techniques,

3673
02:27:04,200 --> 02:27:07,446
so much of the brain is about the associative context.

3674
02:27:07,446 --> 02:27:09,120
When you learn something,

3675
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:10,920
it's in the context of something else

3676
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:13,626
and you can have faint, tiny little hints of things.

3677
02:27:13,626 --> 02:27:16,890
And I do think there are some deep things around,

3678
02:27:16,890 --> 02:27:19,020
like sparse distributed memories and boosting that.

3679
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:21,510
It's like if you can just be slightly above the noise floor

3680
02:27:21,510 --> 02:27:23,340
of having some hint of something,

3681
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:26,460
you can have things refined into pulling the memory back up.

3682
02:27:26,460 --> 02:27:29,550
So, being a programmer and having a toolbox

3683
02:27:29,550 --> 02:27:31,200
of like all of these things that,

3684
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,630
things that I did in all of these previous lives

3685
02:27:33,630 --> 02:27:36,090
of programming tasks that still matters to me,

3686
02:27:36,090 --> 02:27:38,550
about how I'm able to pull up some of these things.

3687
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:41,190
Like in that case it was something I did on the Apple II

3688
02:27:41,190 --> 02:27:43,260
then being relevant for the PC.

3689
02:27:43,260 --> 02:27:45,097
And I have still cases

3690
02:27:45,097 --> 02:27:47,917
when I would work on mobile development then be like,

3691
02:27:47,917 --> 02:27:51,667
"Okay, I did something like this back in the the Doom days,

3692
02:27:51,667 --> 02:27:53,580
"but now it's a different environment,"

3693
02:27:53,580 --> 02:27:55,020
but I has still had that tie.

3694
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:56,880
I can bring it in and I can transform it

3695
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:58,714
into what the world needs right now.

3696
02:27:58,714 --> 02:28:01,950
And I do think that's actually one of the very core things

3697
02:28:01,950 --> 02:28:06,090
with human cognition and brain-like functioning

3698
02:28:06,090 --> 02:28:07,956
is finding these ways about,

3699
02:28:07,956 --> 02:28:10,849
your brain is kind of everything everywhere, all at once.

3700
02:28:10,849 --> 02:28:13,080
It is just a set of all of this stuff

3701
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:16,410
that is just fetched back by these queries that go into it

3702
02:28:16,410 --> 02:28:18,900
and they can just be slightly above the noise floor

3703
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:21,270
with random noise in your neurons and synapses

3704
02:28:21,270 --> 02:28:23,970
that are affecting exactly what gets pulled up.

3705
02:28:23,970 --> 02:28:26,520
- So, you're saying some of these very specific solutions

3706
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:28,620
for different games,

3707
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:31,980
you find that there's a kernel of an a deep idea

3708
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:34,770
that's generalizable to other to other things.

3709
02:28:34,770 --> 02:28:36,480
- Yeah, you can't predict what it's going to be,

3710
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,710
but that idea of like,

3711
02:28:37,710 --> 02:28:40,710
I called out that compiled shaders in the forward

3712
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:43,320
that I wrote for that the Game engine black book

3713
02:28:43,320 --> 02:28:48,030
as it's kind of an end point of unrolling code.

3714
02:28:48,030 --> 02:28:49,530
But that's one of those things that,

3715
02:28:49,530 --> 02:28:51,660
thinking about that and having that in your mind,

3716
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:53,130
and I'm sure there are some programmers

3717
02:28:53,130 --> 02:28:54,690
that you know hear about that,

3718
02:28:54,690 --> 02:28:55,560
think about it a little bit,

3719
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:57,060
it's kind of the mind blown moment.

3720
02:28:57,060 --> 02:29:00,750
It's like, "Oh you can just turn all of that data into code"

3721
02:29:00,750 --> 02:29:03,360
and nowadays you have instruction cache issues

3722
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:05,212
and that's not necessarily the best idea.

3723
02:29:05,212 --> 02:29:07,260
But there are different,

3724
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:09,030
it's an idea that has power

3725
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:11,490
and has probably relevance in some other areas.

3726
02:29:11,490 --> 02:29:13,020
Maybe it's in a hardware point of view

3727
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:15,480
that there's a way you approach building hardware

3728
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:16,800
that has that same,

3729
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:18,237
you don't even have to think about iterating,

3730
02:29:18,237 --> 02:29:22,170
you just bake everything all the way into it in one place.

3731
02:29:22,170 --> 02:29:25,380
- What is the story of how you came to Program Doom?

3732
02:29:25,380 --> 02:29:27,780
What are some memorable technical challenges

3733
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:29,790
or innovations within that game?

3734
02:29:29,790 --> 02:29:33,660
- So, the path that we went after Wolfenstein got out

3735
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:35,550
and we were on this crazy arc

3736
02:29:35,550 --> 02:29:38,850
where Keen one through three more success than we thought,

3737
02:29:38,850 --> 02:29:41,100
keen four through six, even more success,

3738
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:42,870
Wolfenstein even more success.

3739
02:29:42,870 --> 02:29:46,410
So, we were on this crazy trajectory for things.

3740
02:29:46,410 --> 02:29:48,270
So actually our first box commercial project

3741
02:29:48,270 --> 02:29:50,640
was a Commander Keen game,

3742
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:52,710
but then Wolfenstein was going to have a game,

3743
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:54,000
called Spear of Destiny,

3744
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,270
which was a commercial version, 60 new levels.

3745
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:59,460
So, the rest of the team took the game engine,

3746
02:29:59,460 --> 02:30:02,760
pretty much as it was and started working on that.

3747
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:03,930
We got new monsters,

3748
02:30:03,930 --> 02:30:07,620
but it's basically reskins of the things there.

3749
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:09,450
And there's a really interesting aspect about that

3750
02:30:09,450 --> 02:30:12,270
that I didn't appreciate until much, much later,

3751
02:30:12,270 --> 02:30:15,615
about how Wolfenstein clearly did tap out

3752
02:30:15,615 --> 02:30:19,650
its limit about what you wanna play all the levels

3753
02:30:19,650 --> 02:30:21,630
and a couple of our license things.

3754
02:30:21,630 --> 02:30:24,030
There was a hard creative wall

3755
02:30:24,030 --> 02:30:25,830
that you did not really benefit much

3756
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:27,359
by continuing to beat on it.

3757
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:29,820
But a game like Doom

3758
02:30:29,820 --> 02:30:33,030
and other more modern games like Minecraft or something,

3759
02:30:33,030 --> 02:30:35,070
there's kind of a touring completeness level

3760
02:30:35,070 --> 02:30:37,230
of design freedom that you get in games

3761
02:30:37,230 --> 02:30:40,068
that Wolfenstein clearly sat on one side of,

3762
02:30:40,068 --> 02:30:42,060
all the creative people in the world,

3763
02:30:42,060 --> 02:30:44,010
could not go and do a masterpiece,

3764
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:46,470
just with the technology that Wolfenstein had.

3765
02:30:46,470 --> 02:30:48,210
Wolfenstein could do Wolfenstein,

3766
02:30:48,210 --> 02:30:50,790
but you really couldn't do something crazy and different.

3767
02:30:50,790 --> 02:30:53,400
But it didn't take that much more capability

3768
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:56,310
to get to Wolfenstein with the freeform lines

3769
02:30:56,310 --> 02:30:59,460
and a little bit more artistic freedom to get to the point

3770
02:30:59,460 --> 02:31:02,490
where people still announced new Doom levels today,

3771
02:31:02,490 --> 02:31:03,750
all these years after

3772
02:31:03,750 --> 02:31:06,341
without having completely tapped out the creativity.

3773
02:31:06,341 --> 02:31:08,684
- How did you put it touring complete-

3774
02:31:08,684 --> 02:31:10,230
- Like tour complete design space.

3775
02:31:10,230 --> 02:31:11,063
- Design space.

3776
02:31:11,063 --> 02:31:12,260
- Where it's like

3777
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:13,896
we have the kind of computational universality

3778
02:31:13,896 --> 02:31:17,520
on a lot of things and how different substrates work.

3779
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:19,350
But yeah, there's things where,

3780
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:20,940
a box can be too small

3781
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:22,370
but above a certain point

3782
02:31:22,370 --> 02:31:24,232
you kind of are at the point,

3783
02:31:24,232 --> 02:31:28,380
you really have almost unbounded creative ability there.

3784
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:31,440
- And Doom was the first time you crossed that line.

3785
02:31:31,440 --> 02:31:35,100
- Yeah, where there were thousands of Doom levels created

3786
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:36,750
and some of 'em still have something new

3787
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:38,580
and interesting to say to the world about it.

3788
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:43,230
- Is that line, can you introspect what that line was?

3789
02:31:43,230 --> 02:31:44,820
Is it in the design space?

3790
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:48,390
Is it something about the programming capabilities

3791
02:31:48,390 --> 02:31:50,940
that you were able to add to the game?

3792
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:54,390
- So, the graphics fidelity was a necessary part,

3793
02:31:54,390 --> 02:31:57,540
because the block limitations in Wolfenstein,

3794
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:00,810
what we had right there was not enough.

3795
02:32:00,810 --> 02:32:03,267
The full scale blocks, although Minecraft,

3796
02:32:03,267 --> 02:32:07,707
I really did show that perhaps blocks stacked in 3D

3797
02:32:07,707 --> 02:32:09,710
and at one quarter the scale of that

3798
02:32:09,710 --> 02:32:11,340
or one eighth in volume

3799
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:13,260
is then sufficient to have all of that.

3800
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:16,770
But the wall sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein

3801
02:32:16,770 --> 02:32:18,720
was too much of a creative limitation.

3802
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:21,630
We licensed the technology to a few other teams.

3803
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:24,900
None of them made too much of a dent with that.

3804
02:32:24,900 --> 02:32:27,240
It just wasn't enough creative ability,

3805
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:28,530
but a little bit more,

3806
02:32:28,530 --> 02:32:31,020
whether it was the variable floors and ceilings

3807
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:33,180
and arbitrary angles in Doom

3808
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:36,160
or the smaller foxhole blocks in Minecraft

3809
02:32:37,230 --> 02:32:40,350
is then enough to open it up to just worlds and worlds

3810
02:32:40,350 --> 02:32:41,880
of new capabilities.

3811
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:44,193
- What is binary space partitioning?

3812
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:45,993
Which is one of the technologies, is it?

3813
02:32:47,891 --> 02:32:50,920
- Yeah, so jump around a little bit on the story path there.

3814
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:51,753
- Yes.

3815
02:32:51,753 --> 02:32:53,160
- So, while the team was working on Spirit Destiny

3816
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:54,194
for Wolfenstein.

3817
02:32:54,194 --> 02:32:58,290
We had met another development team, Raven Software,

3818
02:32:58,290 --> 02:32:59,970
while we were in Wisconsin

3819
02:32:59,970 --> 02:33:01,830
and they were doing,

3820
02:33:01,830 --> 02:33:04,437
they had RPG background and I still kind of loved that.

3821
02:33:04,437 --> 02:33:07,710
And I offered to do a game engine for them

3822
02:33:07,710 --> 02:33:11,970
to let them do a 3D rendered RPG instead of the,

3823
02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:14,070
like most RBG games were kind of hand drawn.

3824
02:33:14,070 --> 02:33:15,540
They made it look kind of 3D

3825
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:17,550
but it was done just all with artist work,

3826
02:33:17,550 --> 02:33:19,270
rather than a real engine.

3827
02:33:19,270 --> 02:33:23,340
And after Wolfenstein, this was still a tile based world,

3828
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:24,780
but I added floors and ceilings

3829
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:26,310
and some lighting and the ability

3830
02:33:26,310 --> 02:33:28,650
to have some sloped floors in different areas.

3831
02:33:28,650 --> 02:33:30,030
And that was my intermediate step

3832
02:33:30,030 --> 02:33:32,370
for a game called Shadow Caster.

3833
02:33:32,370 --> 02:33:34,440
And it had slowed down enough,

3834
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:37,680
it was not fast enough to do our type of action things.

3835
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:39,990
So, they had the screen crop down a little bit,

3836
02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:42,270
so you couldn't go the full screen width,

3837
02:33:42,270 --> 02:33:44,430
like we would try to do in Wolfenstein,

3838
02:33:44,430 --> 02:33:46,320
but I learned a lot.

3839
02:33:46,320 --> 02:33:47,430
I got the floors and ceilings

3840
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:48,870
and lightings and it looked great.

3841
02:33:48,870 --> 02:33:50,370
They were great artists up there.

3842
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:52,020
And it was an inspiration

3843
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:54,420
for us to look at some of that stuff.

3844
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:58,470
But I had learned enough from that, that I had the plan for,

3845
02:33:58,470 --> 02:34:01,560
I knew faster ways to do the lighting and shadowing

3846
02:34:01,560 --> 02:34:03,630
and I wanted to do this freeform geometry.

3847
02:34:03,630 --> 02:34:06,211
I wanted to break out of this tile-based,

3848
02:34:06,211 --> 02:34:09,120
90 degree world limitations.

3849
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:12,270
So, that was when we got our next stations

3850
02:34:12,270 --> 02:34:14,940
and we were working with these higher powered systems

3851
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:17,580
and we built an editor

3852
02:34:17,580 --> 02:34:20,220
that let us draw kind of arbitrary line segments.

3853
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:22,200
And I was working hard to try

3854
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:25,276
to make something that could render this fast enough.

3855
02:34:25,276 --> 02:34:27,826
I was pushing myself pretty hard.

3856
02:34:27,826 --> 02:34:30,690
And we were at a point

3857
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:33,720
where we could see some things that looked amazingly cool,

3858
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:37,089
but it wasn't really fast enough for the way I was doing it,

3859
02:34:37,089 --> 02:34:39,450
for this flexibility, it was no longer,

3860
02:34:39,450 --> 02:34:40,780
I couldn't just ray cast into it.

3861
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:43,260
And I had these very complex sets of lines

3862
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:45,360
and simple little worlds were okay,

3863
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:47,520
but the cool things that we wanted to do,

3864
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:49,680
just weren't quite fast enough.

3865
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:52,470
And I wound up taking a break at that point,

3866
02:34:52,470 --> 02:34:54,510
and I did the port,

3867
02:34:54,510 --> 02:34:58,740
I did two ports of our games Wolfenstein

3868
02:34:58,740 --> 02:35:01,169
to the Super Nintendo.

3869
02:35:01,169 --> 02:35:04,230
It was a crazy difficult thing to do

3870
02:35:04,230 --> 02:35:05,940
which was an even slower processor.

3871
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:09,990
It was like a couple megahertz processor.

3872
02:35:09,990 --> 02:35:11,820
And it had been this whole thing

3873
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:16,820
where we had farmed out the work and it wasn't going well.

3874
02:35:17,160 --> 02:35:18,870
And I took it back over

3875
02:35:18,870 --> 02:35:21,870
and trying to make it go fast on there,

3876
02:35:21,870 --> 02:35:25,170
where it really did not have much processing power.

3877
02:35:25,170 --> 02:35:26,880
The pixels were stretched up hugely

3878
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:29,040
and it was pretty ugly when you looked at it,

3879
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,500
but in the end it did come out fast enough to play

3880
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:33,480
and still be kind of fun from that.

3881
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:36,630
But that was where I started using BSP trees

3882
02:35:36,630 --> 02:35:38,340
or binary space partitioning trees.

3883
02:35:38,340 --> 02:35:41,550
It was one of those things I had to make it faster there.

3884
02:35:41,550 --> 02:35:42,840
It was a stepping stone

3885
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:45,110
where it was reasonably easy to understand

3886
02:35:45,110 --> 02:35:46,950
in the grid world of Wolfenstein,

3887
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:49,102
where it was all still 90 degree angles.

3888
02:35:49,102 --> 02:35:53,375
BSP trees were, I eased myself into it with that

3889
02:35:53,375 --> 02:35:55,827
and it was a big success.

3890
02:35:55,827 --> 02:35:58,740
Then when I came back to working on Doom,

3891
02:35:58,740 --> 02:36:00,660
I had this new tool in my toolbox.

3892
02:36:00,660 --> 02:36:02,010
It was gonna be a lot harder

3893
02:36:02,010 --> 02:36:03,900
with the arbitrary angles of Doom.

3894
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:06,120
This was where I really started grappling

3895
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:08,820
with Epsilon problems and just,

3896
02:36:08,820 --> 02:36:09,653
up until that point,

3897
02:36:09,653 --> 02:36:11,340
I hadn't really had to deal with the fact

3898
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:13,533
that I am so many numeric things.

3899
02:36:13,533 --> 02:36:15,360
This almost felt like a betrayal to me

3900
02:36:15,360 --> 02:36:16,410
where people had told me

3901
02:36:16,410 --> 02:36:18,900
that I had mathematicians up on a bit of a pedestal

3902
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:22,680
where I was, people think I'm a math wizard and I'm not.

3903
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:25,980
I really, everything that I did was really done

3904
02:36:25,980 --> 02:36:29,520
with a solid high school math understanding,

3905
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:31,050
algebra two, trigonometry.

3906
02:36:31,050 --> 02:36:34,860
And that was what got me all the way through Doom and Quake

3907
02:36:34,860 --> 02:36:37,887
and all of that, of just understanding basics of matrices

3908
02:36:37,887 --> 02:36:41,040
and knowing it well enough to do something with it.

3909
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:42,900
- What's the Epsilon problems you ran into?

3910
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:45,167
- So, when you wind up taking a,

3911
02:36:45,167 --> 02:36:47,250
like a sloped line and you say,

3912
02:36:47,250 --> 02:36:49,893
I'm going to intersect it with another sloped line,

3913
02:36:50,940 --> 02:36:52,200
then you wind up with something

3914
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:54,960
that's not going to be on these nice grid boundaries.

3915
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:57,090
With the Wolfenstein tile maps,

3916
02:36:57,090 --> 02:36:58,950
all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines,

3917
02:36:58,950 --> 02:37:00,210
looking at it from above.

3918
02:37:00,210 --> 02:37:01,380
And if you cut one of them,

3919
02:37:01,380 --> 02:37:03,150
it's just obvious the other one gets cut

3920
02:37:03,150 --> 02:37:04,890
exactly at that point.

3921
02:37:04,890 --> 02:37:06,600
But when you have angled lines,

3922
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:08,850
you're doing a kind of a slope intercept problem

3923
02:37:08,850 --> 02:37:11,190
and you wind up with rational numbers there

3924
02:37:11,190 --> 02:37:14,820
where things that are not going to evenly land on an integer

3925
02:37:14,820 --> 02:37:17,250
or on any fixed point value that you've got.

3926
02:37:17,250 --> 02:37:19,530
So, everything winds up having to snap

3927
02:37:19,530 --> 02:37:20,970
to some fixed point value.

3928
02:37:20,970 --> 02:37:23,400
So, the lines slightly change their angle.

3929
02:37:23,400 --> 02:37:25,320
You wind up, if you cut something here,

3930
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:26,850
this one's gonna bend a little this way

3931
02:37:26,850 --> 02:37:28,710
and it's not gonna be completely straight.

3932
02:37:28,710 --> 02:37:30,720
And then you come down to all these questions of,

3933
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:35,160
well this one is a point on an angled line.

3934
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:38,010
You can't answer that in finite precision,

3935
02:37:38,010 --> 02:37:41,010
unless you're doing something with actual rational numbers.

3936
02:37:41,010 --> 02:37:43,230
And later on I did waste far too much time,

3937
02:37:43,230 --> 02:37:44,190
chasing things like that.

3938
02:37:44,190 --> 02:37:46,860
How do you do precise arithmetic with rational numbers?

3939
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:48,741
And it always blows up eventually,

3940
02:37:48,741 --> 02:37:50,550
exponentially as you do enough.

3941
02:37:50,550 --> 02:37:53,250
- So, these kind of things are impossible with computers?

3942
02:37:53,250 --> 02:37:55,170
- So they're possible.

3943
02:37:55,170 --> 02:37:57,450
Again, there are paths to doing it,

3944
02:37:57,450 --> 02:38:00,240
but you can't fit them conveniently in any of the numbers.

3945
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:01,814
You need to start using big nums

3946
02:38:01,814 --> 02:38:04,620
and different factor trackings of different things.

3947
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:07,737
- Right, so if you have any elements of OCD

3948
02:38:07,737 --> 02:38:09,840
and you wanna do something perfectly,

3949
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:12,270
you're screwed if you're working with floating point.

3950
02:38:12,270 --> 02:38:13,410
- Yeah.

3951
02:38:13,410 --> 02:38:15,160
- So, you had to deal with this for the first time.

3952
02:38:15,160 --> 02:38:18,420
- And there were lots of challenges there about like,

3953
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:20,100
okay, they build this cool thing

3954
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:23,520
and the way the BSP trees work is it basically takes

3955
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:25,350
the walls and it carves other walls

3956
02:38:25,350 --> 02:38:28,770
by those walls in this clever way that you can then

3957
02:38:28,770 --> 02:38:31,890
take all of these fragments and then you can for sure

3958
02:38:31,890 --> 02:38:33,990
from any given point get an ordering

3959
02:38:33,990 --> 02:38:35,160
of everything in the world.

3960
02:38:35,160 --> 02:38:36,780
And you can say, this goes in front of this,

3961
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:37,980
goes in front of this,

3962
02:38:37,980 --> 02:38:40,170
all the way back to the last thing.

3963
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:42,420
And that's super valuable for graphics

3964
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:45,840
where kind of a classic graphics algorithm would be,

3965
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:46,800
painter's algorithm.

3966
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:48,990
You paint the furthest thing first and then the next thing

3967
02:38:48,990 --> 02:38:49,860
and then the next thing,

3968
02:38:49,860 --> 02:38:52,740
and then it comes up and it's all perfect for you.

3969
02:38:52,740 --> 02:38:54,240
That's slow because you don't wanna have

3970
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:56,160
to have drawn everything like that.

3971
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:57,600
But you can also flip it around

3972
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:59,550
and draw the closest thing to you

3973
02:38:59,550 --> 02:39:01,410
and then if you're clever about it,

3974
02:39:01,410 --> 02:39:03,540
you can figure out what you need to draw

3975
02:39:03,540 --> 02:39:05,430
that's visible beyond that.

3976
02:39:05,430 --> 02:39:07,560
- And that's what BSP trees allow you to do.

3977
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:10,620
- Yeah, so it's combined with a bunch of other things,

3978
02:39:10,620 --> 02:39:12,180
but it gives you that ordering.

3979
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:13,497
It's a clever way of doing things.

3980
02:39:13,497 --> 02:39:16,620
And I remember I had learned this from,

3981
02:39:16,620 --> 02:39:18,750
one of my graphics bible at the time,

3982
02:39:18,750 --> 02:39:20,490
a book called "Foley and van Dam."

3983
02:39:20,490 --> 02:39:22,200
And again, it was a different world back there.

3984
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:24,660
There was a small integer number of books

3985
02:39:24,660 --> 02:39:26,043
and this book that,

3986
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:27,833
this book that was,

3987
02:39:27,833 --> 02:39:29,700
it was big fat college textbook

3988
02:39:29,700 --> 02:39:32,520
that I had read through many times.

3989
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:34,230
I didn't understand everything in it.

3990
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:35,850
Some of it wasn't useful to me,

3991
02:39:35,850 --> 02:39:39,600
but they had the little thing about finite orderings

3992
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:41,520
of you draw little t-shaped thing

3993
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:44,790
and you can say you can make a fixed ahead of time order

3994
02:39:44,790 --> 02:39:48,270
from this and you can generalize this with the BSP trees.

3995
02:39:48,270 --> 02:39:50,882
And I got a little bit more information about that

3996
02:39:50,882 --> 02:39:51,715
and it was kind of fun.

3997
02:39:51,715 --> 02:39:53,130
Later while I was working on Quake,

3998
02:39:53,130 --> 02:39:54,780
I got to meet Bruce Naer,

3999
02:39:54,780 --> 02:39:56,550
who was one of the original researchers

4000
02:39:56,550 --> 02:40:00,870
that developed those technologies for academic literature.

4001
02:40:00,870 --> 02:40:01,740
And that was kind of fun.

4002
02:40:01,740 --> 02:40:03,810
But I was very much just finding a tool

4003
02:40:03,810 --> 02:40:05,547
that can help me solve what I was doing.

4004
02:40:05,547 --> 02:40:07,563
And I was using it in this very crude way

4005
02:40:07,563 --> 02:40:10,500
in a two dimensional fashion, rather than the general 3D.

4006
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:12,840
The Epsilon problems got much worse in Quake

4007
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:15,690
and dimensional when things angle in every way.

4008
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:20,010
But eventually I did sort out how to do it reliably on Doom.

4009
02:40:20,010 --> 02:40:22,230
There were still a few edge cases in Doom

4010
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:24,390
that were not absolutely perfect,

4011
02:40:24,390 --> 02:40:27,750
where they even got terminologies in the communities.

4012
02:40:27,750 --> 02:40:29,460
Like when you got to something where it was messed up,

4013
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:32,370
it was a hall of mirrors effect because you'd sweep by

4014
02:40:32,370 --> 02:40:33,720
and it wouldn't draw something there

4015
02:40:33,720 --> 02:40:36,210
and you would just wind up with the leftover remnants

4016
02:40:36,210 --> 02:40:39,240
as you flipped between the two pages.

4017
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:41,460
But BSP trees were important for it,

4018
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:45,660
but it's again worth noting that after we did Doom,

4019
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:47,280
our major competition came

4020
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:49,920
from Ken Silverman's build Engine,

4021
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:51,780
which was used for Duke Newcomb 3D

4022
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:54,180
and some of the other games for 3D realms.

4023
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:56,220
And he used a completely different technology,

4024
02:40:56,220 --> 02:40:59,220
nothing to do with BSP trees.

4025
02:40:59,220 --> 02:41:03,010
So, there's not just a one true way of doing things.

4026
02:41:03,010 --> 02:41:05,610
There were critical things about

4027
02:41:05,610 --> 02:41:07,170
to make any of those games fast,

4028
02:41:07,170 --> 02:41:09,660
you had to separate your drawing into,

4029
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:10,890
you drew vertical lines

4030
02:41:10,890 --> 02:41:12,450
and you drew horizontal lines,

4031
02:41:12,450 --> 02:41:15,780
just kind of changing exactly what you would draw with them.

4032
02:41:15,780 --> 02:41:19,380
That was critical for the technologies at that time.

4033
02:41:19,380 --> 02:41:21,720
And like all the games that were kind of like that,

4034
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:23,400
wound up doing something similar,

4035
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:25,440
but there were still a bunch of other decisions

4036
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:26,790
that could be made.

4037
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:30,390
And we made good enough decisions on everything on Doom.

4038
02:41:30,390 --> 02:41:33,690
We brought in multiplayer significantly

4039
02:41:33,690 --> 02:41:36,570
and it was our first game that was designed to be modified

4040
02:41:36,570 --> 02:41:37,680
by the user community

4041
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:41,100
where we had this whole setup of our WAD files and PWADs

4042
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:43,680
and things that people could build with tools

4043
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,670
that we released to them.

4044
02:41:44,670 --> 02:41:46,380
And they eventually rewrote to be better than

4045
02:41:46,380 --> 02:41:47,640
what we released.

4046
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:48,840
But they could build things

4047
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:50,400
and you could add it to your game

4048
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:52,260
without destructively modifying it,

4049
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:54,090
which is what you had to do in all the early games.

4050
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:56,700
You literally hacked the data files

4051
02:41:56,700 --> 02:41:58,080
or the executable before,

4052
02:41:58,080 --> 02:42:00,600
while Doom was set up in this flexible way

4053
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:03,240
so that you could just say, run the normal game

4054
02:42:03,240 --> 02:42:04,800
with this added on on top

4055
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:06,900
and it would overlay just the things

4056
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:08,518
that you wanted to there.

4057
02:42:08,518 --> 02:42:10,200
- Would you say that Doom

4058
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:14,220
was kind of the first true 3D game that you created?

4059
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:15,180
- So, no, it's still,

4060
02:42:15,180 --> 02:42:17,790
Doom would usually be called a two and a half D game

4061
02:42:17,790 --> 02:42:20,386
where it had three dimensional points on it.

4062
02:42:20,386 --> 02:42:22,410
And this is another one of these kind of pedantic things

4063
02:42:22,410 --> 02:42:23,940
that people love to argue about,

4064
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:26,490
about what was the first 3D game I still like

4065
02:42:26,490 --> 02:42:29,700
and like every month probably I hear from somebody about,

4066
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:32,100
well, was Doom really a 3D game or something?

4067
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:35,610
And I give the the point

4068
02:42:35,610 --> 02:42:38,520
where characters had three coordinates.

4069
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:40,200
So, you had like an X, Y, and Z,

4070
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:42,334
the Kakademon could be coming in very high

4071
02:42:42,334 --> 02:42:44,439
and come down towards you.

4072
02:42:44,439 --> 02:42:47,340
The walls had three coordinates on them.

4073
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:50,280
So, on some sense it's a 3D game engine,

4074
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:53,400
but it was not a fully general 3D game engine.

4075
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:56,610
You could not build a pyramid in Doom

4076
02:42:56,610 --> 02:42:59,400
because you couldn't make a sloped wall,

4077
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:00,420
which was slightly different

4078
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:02,250
where in that previous shadow caster game,

4079
02:43:02,250 --> 02:43:05,190
I couldn't have Vertexes and have a sloped floor there.

4080
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:08,280
But the changes that I made for Doom to get higher speed

4081
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:11,610
and a different set of flexibility traded away that ability.

4082
02:43:11,610 --> 02:43:13,408
But you literally couldn't make that,

4083
02:43:13,408 --> 02:43:17,880
you could make different heights of passages,

4084
02:43:17,880 --> 02:43:20,280
but you could not make a bridge over another area.

4085
02:43:20,280 --> 02:43:21,870
You could not go over and above it.

4086
02:43:21,870 --> 02:43:24,870
So, that's more, it still had some 2D limitations to it.

4087
02:43:24,870 --> 02:43:26,010
- That's more about the building,

4088
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:27,510
versus the actual experience,

4089
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:28,729
'cause the experience is.

4090
02:43:28,729 --> 02:43:30,540
- It felt like things would come at you,

4091
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:32,130
but again, you couldn't look up either.

4092
02:43:32,130 --> 02:43:33,150
- [Lex] Right.

4093
02:43:33,150 --> 02:43:34,710
- You could only pitch,

4094
02:43:34,710 --> 02:43:36,450
it was four degrees of freedom,

4095
02:43:36,450 --> 02:43:38,400
rather than six degrees of freedom.

4096
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:40,590
You did not have the ability to tilt your head this way

4097
02:43:40,590 --> 02:43:41,948
or pitch up and down.

4098
02:43:41,948 --> 02:43:44,490
- So, that takes us to Quake.

4099
02:43:44,490 --> 02:43:47,490
What was the leap there?

4100
02:43:47,490 --> 02:43:50,040
What was some fascinating technical challenges

4101
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:52,170
and there were a lot or not challenges,

4102
02:43:52,170 --> 02:43:54,120
but innovations that you've come up with.

4103
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:56,460
- So, Quake was kind of the first thing

4104
02:43:56,460 --> 02:43:59,520
where I did have to kind of come face to face

4105
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:01,260
with my limitations.

4106
02:44:01,260 --> 02:44:02,280
Where it was the first thing

4107
02:44:02,280 --> 02:44:05,670
where I really did kind of give it my all

4108
02:44:05,670 --> 02:44:08,400
and still come up a little bit short

4109
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:11,640
in terms of what and when I wanted to get it done.

4110
02:44:11,640 --> 02:44:15,030
And the company ran had some serious stresses,

4111
02:44:15,030 --> 02:44:16,740
through the whole project.

4112
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:19,650
And we bid off a lot.

4113
02:44:19,650 --> 02:44:21,810
So, the things that we set out to do was,

4114
02:44:21,810 --> 02:44:24,660
it was going to be really a truth 3D engine

4115
02:44:24,660 --> 02:44:26,940
where it could do six degree of freedom.

4116
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:29,670
You could have all the viewpoints,

4117
02:44:29,670 --> 02:44:31,470
you could model anything.

4118
02:44:31,470 --> 02:44:35,250
It had a really remarkable new lighting model

4119
02:44:35,250 --> 02:44:37,080
with the surface caching and things.

4120
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:37,913
That was one of those

4121
02:44:37,913 --> 02:44:39,870
where it was starting to do some things

4122
02:44:39,870 --> 02:44:43,142
that they weren't doing even on the very high end systems.

4123
02:44:43,142 --> 02:44:46,920
And it was going to be completely programmable

4124
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:48,180
in the modding standpoint,

4125
02:44:48,180 --> 02:44:49,800
where the thing that you couldn't do in Doom,

4126
02:44:49,800 --> 02:44:52,350
you could replace almost all of the media,

4127
02:44:52,350 --> 02:44:54,265
but you couldn't really change the game.

4128
02:44:54,265 --> 02:44:56,463
There were still some people that

4129
02:44:56,463 --> 02:44:58,740
were doing the hack setting of the executable,

4130
02:44:58,740 --> 02:44:59,730
they hacked things

4131
02:44:59,730 --> 02:45:01,890
where you could change a few things about rules

4132
02:45:01,890 --> 02:45:04,620
and people made some early capture the flag type things

4133
02:45:04,620 --> 02:45:06,030
by hacking the executable,

4134
02:45:06,030 --> 02:45:08,520
but it wasn't really set out to do that.

4135
02:45:08,520 --> 02:45:11,340
Quake was going to have its own programming language

4136
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:12,897
that the game was gonna be implemented in it,

4137
02:45:12,897 --> 02:45:14,850
and that would be able to be overwritten,

4138
02:45:14,850 --> 02:45:16,560
just like any of the media.

4139
02:45:16,560 --> 02:45:18,390
Code was going to be data for that.

4140
02:45:18,390 --> 02:45:21,000
And you would be able to have expansion pacs

4141
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:24,180
that changed fundamental things and mods and so on.

4142
02:45:24,180 --> 02:45:28,140
And the multiplayer was gonna be playable over the internet.

4143
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:30,870
It was going to support a client server,

4144
02:45:30,870 --> 02:45:32,400
rather than peer to peer.

4145
02:45:32,400 --> 02:45:34,890
So, we had the possibility of supporting larger numbers

4146
02:45:34,890 --> 02:45:37,440
of players in disparate locations

4147
02:45:37,440 --> 02:45:41,310
with this full flexibility of the programming overrides

4148
02:45:41,310 --> 02:45:44,910
with full six degree of freedom modeling and viewing

4149
02:45:44,910 --> 02:45:47,335
and with this fancy new light mapped,

4150
02:45:47,335 --> 02:45:49,710
kind of surface caching side.

4151
02:45:49,710 --> 02:45:50,640
It was a lot.

4152
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:53,730
And this was one of those things that if I could go back

4153
02:45:53,730 --> 02:45:56,726
and tell younger me to do something differently,

4154
02:45:56,726 --> 02:45:59,670
it would've been to split those innovations up

4155
02:45:59,670 --> 02:46:02,010
into two phases in two separate games.

4156
02:46:02,010 --> 02:46:03,630
- What would be phase one and phase two?

4157
02:46:03,630 --> 02:46:05,070
- So, it probably would've been,

4158
02:46:05,070 --> 02:46:07,080
taking the Doom rendering engine

4159
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:10,770
and bringing in the TCP IP client server.

4160
02:46:10,770 --> 02:46:12,090
- [Lex] Focusing on the multiplayer.

4161
02:46:12,090 --> 02:46:14,160
- And the Quake C,

4162
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:16,720
or would've been Doom C programming language there.

4163
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:19,350
So, I would've split that into programming language

4164
02:46:19,350 --> 02:46:21,840
and networking with the same Doom engine,

4165
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:24,000
rather than forcing everybody to go towards

4166
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,890
the Quake Engine,

4167
02:46:25,890 --> 02:46:27,630
which really meant getting a pentium,

4168
02:46:27,630 --> 02:46:29,070
while it ran on a 486.

4169
02:46:29,070 --> 02:46:30,990
It was not a great experience there.

4170
02:46:30,990 --> 02:46:33,030
We could have made more people happier

4171
02:46:33,030 --> 02:46:36,854
and gotten two games done in 50% more time.

4172
02:46:36,854 --> 02:46:39,420
- So, speaking of people happier,

4173
02:46:39,420 --> 02:46:42,840
our mutual friend Joe Rogan,

4174
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:47,250
it seems like the most important moment of his life

4175
02:46:47,250 --> 02:46:49,500
is centered around Quake.

4176
02:46:49,500 --> 02:46:53,550
So, it was a definitive part of his life.

4177
02:46:53,550 --> 02:46:56,820
So, would he agree with your thinking

4178
02:46:56,820 --> 02:46:58,233
that they should split?

4179
02:46:59,130 --> 02:47:01,440
So, he as a person who loves Quake

4180
02:47:01,440 --> 02:47:03,330
and played Quake a lot,

4181
02:47:03,330 --> 02:47:06,750
would he agree that you should have done the Doom engine

4182
02:47:06,750 --> 02:47:09,354
and focus on the multiplayer for phase one

4183
02:47:09,354 --> 02:47:12,334
or in your looking back

4184
02:47:12,334 --> 02:47:16,170
is the 3D world that Quake created

4185
02:47:16,170 --> 02:47:19,680
was also fundamental to the enriching experience?

4186
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:22,590
- So, I would say that what would've happened is,

4187
02:47:22,590 --> 02:47:27,483
you would've had a Doom-looking but Quake feeling game,

4188
02:47:28,680 --> 02:47:29,970
eight months earlier

4189
02:47:29,970 --> 02:47:33,120
and then maybe six months after Quake actually shipped,

4190
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:34,740
then there would've been the full running

4191
02:47:34,740 --> 02:47:35,732
on a Pentium,

4192
02:47:35,732 --> 02:47:38,730
six degree of freedom graphics engine type things there.

4193
02:47:38,730 --> 02:47:42,060
So, it wouldn't have been there,

4194
02:47:42,060 --> 02:47:45,000
it would've been something amazingly cool earlier

4195
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,730
and then something even cooler somewhat later

4196
02:47:47,730 --> 02:47:50,310
where I would much rather in have gone

4197
02:47:50,310 --> 02:47:53,216
and done two one year development efforts,

4198
02:47:53,216 --> 02:47:54,810
cycle them through,

4199
02:47:54,810 --> 02:47:57,480
be a little more pragmatic about that,

4200
02:47:57,480 --> 02:47:59,460
rather than killing us ourselves

4201
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:01,080
on the whole quake development.

4202
02:48:01,080 --> 02:48:04,110
But I would say it's obviously things worked out well

4203
02:48:04,110 --> 02:48:06,450
in the end, but looking back and saying,

4204
02:48:06,450 --> 02:48:08,970
how would I optimize and do things differently?

4205
02:48:08,970 --> 02:48:10,800
That did seem to be a clear case

4206
02:48:10,800 --> 02:48:15,750
where going ahead and we had enormous momentum on Doom,

4207
02:48:15,750 --> 02:48:19,140
we did Doom Two as the kind of commercial boxed version,

4208
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:22,140
after our shareware success with the original,

4209
02:48:22,140 --> 02:48:25,740
but we could have just made another Doom game.

4210
02:48:25,740 --> 02:48:28,620
Adding those new features in it would've been huge.

4211
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:31,440
We would've learned all the same lessons, but faster

4212
02:48:31,440 --> 02:48:34,110
and it would've given six degree of freedom

4213
02:48:34,110 --> 02:48:37,020
and Pentium class systems a little bit more time

4214
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:37,950
to get mainstream,

4215
02:48:37,950 --> 02:48:40,110
because we did cut out a lot of people

4216
02:48:40,110 --> 02:48:42,900
with the hardware requirements for Quake.

4217
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:44,820
- Was there any dark moments for you personally,

4218
02:48:44,820 --> 02:48:48,320
psychologically in having such harsh deadlines

4219
02:48:51,060 --> 02:48:54,693
and having to also meet difficult technical challenges?

4220
02:48:55,680 --> 02:49:00,680
- So, I've never really had really dark black places.

4221
02:49:00,713 --> 02:49:02,700
I mean, I can't necessarily put myself

4222
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:03,990
in anyone else's shoes,

4223
02:49:03,990 --> 02:49:08,990
but I understand a lot of people have significant challenges

4224
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:12,480
with kind of their mental health and wellbeing.

4225
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:15,030
And I've been super stressed.

4226
02:49:15,030 --> 02:49:18,780
I've been unhappy as a teenager in various ways,

4227
02:49:18,780 --> 02:49:23,730
but I've never really gone to a very dark place.

4228
02:49:23,730 --> 02:49:27,690
I just seem to be largely immune

4229
02:49:27,690 --> 02:49:29,850
to what really wrecks people.

4230
02:49:29,850 --> 02:49:31,080
I mean, I've had plenty of time

4231
02:49:31,080 --> 02:49:33,870
when I'm very unhappy and miserable about something,

4232
02:49:33,870 --> 02:49:35,670
but it's never hit me.

4233
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:38,790
Like, I believe it winds up hitting some other people.

4234
02:49:38,790 --> 02:49:41,670
I've born up well under whatever stresses,

4235
02:49:41,670 --> 02:49:44,370
have kind of fallen on me.

4236
02:49:44,370 --> 02:49:48,089
And I've always coped best on that when all I need to do

4237
02:49:48,089 --> 02:49:51,240
is usually just kind of bear down on my work.

4238
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:55,080
I pull myself out of whatever hole I might be slipping into

4239
02:49:55,080 --> 02:49:57,330
by actually making progress.

4240
02:49:57,330 --> 02:49:59,460
I mean, maybe if I was in a position

4241
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:01,740
where I was never able to make that progress,

4242
02:50:01,740 --> 02:50:03,300
I could have slid down further.

4243
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:05,346
But I've always been in a place where,

4244
02:50:05,346 --> 02:50:07,530
okay, a little bit more work.

4245
02:50:07,530 --> 02:50:09,090
Maybe I'm in a tough spot here,

4246
02:50:09,090 --> 02:50:12,240
but I always know if I just keep pushing,

4247
02:50:12,240 --> 02:50:14,640
eventually I break through and I make progress.

4248
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:16,710
I feel good about what I'm doing.

4249
02:50:16,710 --> 02:50:20,670
I am and that's been enough for me so far in my life.

4250
02:50:20,670 --> 02:50:22,473
- Have you seen it in the distance,

4251
02:50:23,700 --> 02:50:28,700
like ideas of depression or contemplating suicide?

4252
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:30,480
Have you seen those things far?

4253
02:50:30,480 --> 02:50:33,166
- So, what was interesting when I was a teenager,

4254
02:50:33,166 --> 02:50:37,290
I was probably on some level a troubled youth.

4255
02:50:37,290 --> 02:50:40,260
I was unhappy most of my teenage years.

4256
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:42,600
I really, I wanted to be on my own,

4257
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:44,014
doing programming all the time.

4258
02:50:44,014 --> 02:50:47,610
As soon as I was 18, 19, even though I was poor,

4259
02:50:47,610 --> 02:50:50,700
I was doing exactly what I wanted and I was very happy.

4260
02:50:50,700 --> 02:50:53,010
But high school was not a great time for me.

4261
02:50:53,010 --> 02:50:56,910
And I had a conversation with like the school counselor

4262
02:50:56,910 --> 02:50:58,560
and they're kind of running their script.

4263
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:00,600
It's like, okay, is kind of a weird kid here,

4264
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:02,400
let's carefully probe around.

4265
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:05,700
It's like do you ever think about ending it all?

4266
02:51:05,700 --> 02:51:07,530
I'm like, no, of course not.

4267
02:51:07,530 --> 02:51:08,550
Never, not at all.

4268
02:51:08,550 --> 02:51:11,250
I this is temporary, things are going to be better.

4269
02:51:11,250 --> 02:51:12,083
- [Lex] Wow.

4270
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:15,630
- And that's always been kind of the case for me.

4271
02:51:15,630 --> 02:51:18,027
And obviously that's not that way for everyone

4272
02:51:18,027 --> 02:51:20,308
and other people do react differently.

4273
02:51:20,308 --> 02:51:24,990
- What was your escape from the troubled youth?

4274
02:51:24,990 --> 02:51:29,990
Like music, video games, books?

4275
02:51:33,690 --> 02:51:35,460
How did you escape from a world

4276
02:51:35,460 --> 02:51:38,306
that's full of cruelty and suffering and that's absurd.

4277
02:51:38,306 --> 02:51:41,850
- Yeah, I mean, I was not a victim of cruelty and suffering.

4278
02:51:41,850 --> 02:51:43,140
It's like I was an unhappy,

4279
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:45,480
somewhat petulant youth in my point

4280
02:51:45,480 --> 02:51:48,270
where I'm not putting myself up

4281
02:51:48,270 --> 02:51:49,710
with anybody else's suffering,

4282
02:51:49,710 --> 02:51:52,260
but I was unhappy objectively.

4283
02:51:52,260 --> 02:51:54,840
And I am, the things that I did

4284
02:51:54,840 --> 02:51:57,960
that very much characterized my childhood were,

4285
02:51:57,960 --> 02:52:00,480
I had books, comic books,

4286
02:52:00,480 --> 02:52:03,750
Dungeons and Dragons, arcade games, video games.

4287
02:52:03,750 --> 02:52:06,390
Like some of my fondest childhood memories

4288
02:52:06,390 --> 02:52:07,470
are the convenience stores,

4289
02:52:07,470 --> 02:52:08,910
the 7-Elevens and QuikTrips,

4290
02:52:08,910 --> 02:52:11,400
because they had a spinner rack of comic books

4291
02:52:11,400 --> 02:52:13,230
and they had a little side room with two

4292
02:52:13,230 --> 02:52:15,780
or three video games, arcade games in it.

4293
02:52:15,780 --> 02:52:18,570
And that was very much my happy place,

4294
02:52:18,570 --> 02:52:19,680
if I could,

4295
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:22,590
I get my comic books and if I could go to a library

4296
02:52:22,590 --> 02:52:24,210
and go through those,

4297
02:52:24,210 --> 02:52:26,580
the little 000 section where computer books

4298
02:52:26,580 --> 02:52:27,413
were supposed to be.

4299
02:52:27,413 --> 02:52:28,980
And there were a few sad little books there,

4300
02:52:28,980 --> 02:52:31,860
but still just being able to sit down and go through that.

4301
02:52:31,860 --> 02:52:35,730
And I read a ridiculous number of books,

4302
02:52:35,730 --> 02:52:38,610
both fiction and nonfiction as a teenager.

4303
02:52:38,610 --> 02:52:42,810
And my rebel my rebelling in high school

4304
02:52:42,810 --> 02:52:44,520
was just sitting there with my nose in a book,

4305
02:52:44,520 --> 02:52:45,930
ignoring the class.

4306
02:52:45,930 --> 02:52:46,860
And through lots of it.

4307
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:49,470
And teachers had a range of reactions to that.

4308
02:52:49,470 --> 02:52:52,353
Some more accepting of it than others.

4309
02:52:53,580 --> 02:52:54,630
- I'm with you on that.

4310
02:52:54,630 --> 02:52:56,550
So, let us return to Quake for bit

4311
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:58,170
with the technical challenges.

4312
02:52:58,170 --> 02:53:01,500
What everything together

4313
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:05,370
from the networking to the graphics.

4314
02:53:05,370 --> 02:53:07,200
What are some things you remember

4315
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:10,290
that were innovations you had to come up

4316
02:53:10,290 --> 02:53:12,390
with in order to make it all happen?

4317
02:53:12,390 --> 02:53:14,910
- Yeah, so there were a bunch of things on Quake

4318
02:53:14,910 --> 02:53:16,410
where on the one hand,

4319
02:53:16,410 --> 02:53:19,290
the idea that I built my own programming language

4320
02:53:19,290 --> 02:53:20,970
to implement the game in,

4321
02:53:20,970 --> 02:53:22,950
looking back and I try to tell people,

4322
02:53:22,950 --> 02:53:25,920
it's like every high level programmer sometime

4323
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:26,880
in their career goes through

4324
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:28,080
and they invent their own language.

4325
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:30,420
It just seems to be a thing that's pretty broadly done.

4326
02:53:30,420 --> 02:53:31,253
People will be like,

4327
02:53:31,253 --> 02:53:33,270
I'm gonna go write a computer programming language.

4328
02:53:33,270 --> 02:53:37,170
And I don't regret having done it.

4329
02:53:37,170 --> 02:53:40,170
But after that, I switched from Quake C,

4330
02:53:40,170 --> 02:53:41,880
my quirky little,

4331
02:53:41,880 --> 02:53:45,360
pseudo object entity-oriented language there.

4332
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:48,000
Quake Two went back to using DLLs with C

4333
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,640
and then Quake Three I implemented my own C interpreter

4334
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:53,220
or compiler, which was a much smarter thing to do

4335
02:53:53,220 --> 02:53:55,830
that I should have done originally for Quake.

4336
02:53:55,830 --> 02:53:57,930
But building my own language was an experience,

4337
02:53:57,930 --> 02:53:59,397
I learned a lot from that.

4338
02:53:59,397 --> 02:54:02,310
And then there was a generation of game programmers

4339
02:54:02,310 --> 02:54:04,350
that learned programming with Quake C,

4340
02:54:04,350 --> 02:54:05,730
which I feel kind of bad about,

4341
02:54:05,730 --> 02:54:08,700
because I mean we give JavaScript a lot of crap,

4342
02:54:08,700 --> 02:54:13,080
but Quake C was nothing to write home about there,

4343
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:15,750
but it allowed people to do magical things.

4344
02:54:15,750 --> 02:54:16,830
You get into programming,

4345
02:54:16,830 --> 02:54:21,360
not because you love the the BNF syntax of a language,

4346
02:54:21,360 --> 02:54:23,370
it's because the language lets you do something

4347
02:54:23,370 --> 02:54:24,510
that you cared about.

4348
02:54:24,510 --> 02:54:27,030
- And here is very much you could do something

4349
02:54:27,030 --> 02:54:29,768
in a whole beautiful three-dimensional world.

4350
02:54:29,768 --> 02:54:31,290
- Yeah and the idea and the fact that the code

4351
02:54:31,290 --> 02:54:33,210
for the game was out there, you could say,

4352
02:54:33,210 --> 02:54:34,560
I like the shotgun,

4353
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:36,090
but I want it to be more badass.

4354
02:54:36,090 --> 02:54:37,230
You go in there and say,

4355
02:54:37,230 --> 02:54:39,240
okay, now it does 200 points damage.

4356
02:54:39,240 --> 02:54:41,550
And if you go around with a big grin on your face,

4357
02:54:41,550 --> 02:54:43,553
blowing up monsters all over the game.

4358
02:54:43,553 --> 02:54:48,553
So yeah, it is not what I would do today going back

4359
02:54:48,780 --> 02:54:51,300
with that language, but that was a big part of it,

4360
02:54:51,300 --> 02:54:53,253
learning about the networking stuff,

4361
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:55,440
because it's interesting

4362
02:54:55,440 --> 02:54:57,600
where I learn these things by reading books.

4363
02:54:57,600 --> 02:54:59,310
So, I would get a book on networking,

4364
02:54:59,310 --> 02:55:01,800
find something I read all about it and learn,

4365
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:03,720
okay, packets they can be,

4366
02:55:03,720 --> 02:55:06,420
out of order lost or duplicated.

4367
02:55:06,420 --> 02:55:08,430
These are all the things that can theoretically happen

4368
02:55:08,430 --> 02:55:09,330
to packets.

4369
02:55:09,330 --> 02:55:11,460
So, I wind up spending all this time thinking about

4370
02:55:11,460 --> 02:55:13,080
how do we deal about all of that?

4371
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:15,120
And it turns out, of course in the real world,

4372
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:16,080
those are things that yes,

4373
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:18,120
theoretically can happen with multiple routes,

4374
02:55:18,120 --> 02:55:19,710
but they really aren't things

4375
02:55:19,710 --> 02:55:24,341
that you're 99.999% of your packets have to deal with.

4376
02:55:24,341 --> 02:55:27,987
So, there was learning experiences about lots of that

4377
02:55:27,987 --> 02:55:32,550
and like why when TCP is appropriate versus UDP

4378
02:55:32,550 --> 02:55:34,200
and how if you do things in UDP,

4379
02:55:34,200 --> 02:55:37,950
you wind up reinventing TCP badly in almost all cases.

4380
02:55:37,950 --> 02:55:41,580
So, there's good arguments for using both

4381
02:55:41,580 --> 02:55:45,030
for different parts of the game process transitioning

4382
02:55:45,030 --> 02:55:46,740
from level to level and all.

4383
02:55:46,740 --> 02:55:49,410
But the graphics were the showcase

4384
02:55:49,410 --> 02:55:51,960
of what Quake was all about.

4385
02:55:51,960 --> 02:55:55,560
It was this graphics technology that nobody had seen there.

4386
02:55:55,560 --> 02:55:57,450
And it was a while before,

4387
02:55:57,450 --> 02:55:59,610
there were competitive things out there

4388
02:55:59,610 --> 02:56:03,660
and it went a long time internally really not working

4389
02:56:03,660 --> 02:56:05,640
where we were even building levels

4390
02:56:05,640 --> 02:56:09,630
where the game just was not at all shippable

4391
02:56:09,630 --> 02:56:11,280
with large fractions of the world,

4392
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:12,180
like disappearing,

4393
02:56:12,180 --> 02:56:16,890
not being there or being really slow in various parts of it.

4394
02:56:16,890 --> 02:56:18,360
And it was this act of faith.

4395
02:56:18,360 --> 02:56:20,700
It's like, I think I'm gonna be able to fix this.

4396
02:56:20,700 --> 02:56:23,035
I think I'm gonna be able to make this work.

4397
02:56:23,035 --> 02:56:25,725
And lots of stuff changed

4398
02:56:25,725 --> 02:56:27,360
where the level designers would build something

4399
02:56:27,360 --> 02:56:29,010
and then have to throw it away

4400
02:56:29,010 --> 02:56:31,380
as something fundamental the kind of graphics

4401
02:56:31,380 --> 02:56:33,840
or level technology change.

4402
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:37,230
And so there were two big things

4403
02:56:37,230 --> 02:56:40,503
that contributed to making it possible at that timeframe.

4404
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:42,360
Two new things.

4405
02:56:42,360 --> 02:56:44,760
There was certainly hardcore optimized,

4406
02:56:44,760 --> 02:56:45,777
low level assembly language.

4407
02:56:45,777 --> 02:56:48,660
And this was where I had hired Michael Abrash,

4408
02:56:48,660 --> 02:56:50,310
away from Microsoft,

4409
02:56:50,310 --> 02:56:52,380
and he had been one of my early inspirations

4410
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:54,780
where that back in the soft softest days,

4411
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:57,048
the library of magazines that they had,

4412
02:56:57,048 --> 02:56:58,890
some of my most treasured ones

4413
02:56:58,890 --> 02:57:02,430
were Michael Abrash's articles in "Dr. Dobbs journal."

4414
02:57:02,430 --> 02:57:04,440
And it was amazing,

4415
02:57:04,440 --> 02:57:06,420
after all of our success in Doom,

4416
02:57:06,420 --> 02:57:08,047
we were able to kind of hit him up and say,

4417
02:57:08,047 --> 02:57:10,560
"Hey, we'd like you to come work at id Software."

4418
02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:13,200
And he was in the senior technical role at Microsoft

4419
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:15,930
and he was on track for,

4420
02:57:15,930 --> 02:57:18,330
and this was right when Microsoft was starting to take off

4421
02:57:18,330 --> 02:57:21,990
and I did eventually convince him that

4422
02:57:21,990 --> 02:57:24,600
what we were doing was gonna be really amazing with Quake.

4423
02:57:24,600 --> 02:57:25,830
It was going to,

4424
02:57:25,830 --> 02:57:28,320
it was gonna be something nobody had seen before.

4425
02:57:28,320 --> 02:57:31,470
It had these aspects of what we were talking about.

4426
02:57:31,470 --> 02:57:33,208
And we had Metaverse talk back then.

4427
02:57:33,208 --> 02:57:34,740
We had read "Snow Crash"

4428
02:57:34,740 --> 02:57:36,720
and we knew about this

4429
02:57:36,720 --> 02:57:40,200
and Michael was big into the science fiction

4430
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:42,930
and we would talk about all that and kind of spin this tail.

4431
02:57:42,930 --> 02:57:45,210
And it was some of the same conversations

4432
02:57:45,210 --> 02:57:46,950
that we have today about the Metaverse,

4433
02:57:46,950 --> 02:57:49,560
about how you could have different areas linked together

4434
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:52,380
by portals and you could have user generated content

4435
02:57:52,380 --> 02:57:54,450
and changing out all of these things.

4436
02:57:54,450 --> 02:57:56,970
- So, you really were created in the Metaverse with Quake?

4437
02:57:56,970 --> 02:57:58,583
- And we talked about things like,

4438
02:57:58,583 --> 02:58:02,850
used to be advertised as a virtual reality experience.

4439
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:05,910
That was the first wave of virtual reality was

4440
02:58:05,910 --> 02:58:07,680
in the late '80s and early '90s.

4441
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:10,620
You had like the "Lawnmower Man" movie

4442
02:58:10,620 --> 02:58:12,180
and you had Time and Newsweek,

4443
02:58:12,180 --> 02:58:14,640
talking about the early VPL headsets.

4444
02:58:14,640 --> 02:58:16,830
And of course that cratered so hard

4445
02:58:16,830 --> 02:58:18,690
that people didn't wanna look at virtual reality

4446
02:58:18,690 --> 02:58:21,960
for decades afterwards where it was just,

4447
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:23,280
it was smoke and mirrors.

4448
02:58:23,280 --> 02:58:24,300
It was not real

4449
02:58:24,300 --> 02:58:27,120
in the sense that you could actually do something real

4450
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:28,620
and valuable with it.

4451
02:58:28,620 --> 02:58:32,250
But still we had that kind of common set of talking points

4452
02:58:32,250 --> 02:58:36,390
and we were talking about what these games could become

4453
02:58:36,390 --> 02:58:37,950
and how you'd like to see people,

4454
02:58:37,950 --> 02:58:39,600
building all of these creative things,

4455
02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:41,160
because we were seeing an explosion

4456
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:42,660
of work with Doom at that time

4457
02:58:42,660 --> 02:58:45,750
where people were doing amazingly cool things.

4458
02:58:45,750 --> 02:58:47,133
Like we saw cooler levels

4459
02:58:47,133 --> 02:58:49,770
than we had built coming out of the user community.

4460
02:58:49,770 --> 02:58:52,400
And then people finding ways to change

4461
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:54,090
the characters in different ways.

4462
02:58:54,090 --> 02:58:54,923
And it was great.

4463
02:58:54,923 --> 02:58:56,760
And we knew what we were doing in Quake

4464
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:58,890
was removing those last things.

4465
02:58:58,890 --> 02:59:02,010
There was some quirky things with a couple of the data types

4466
02:59:02,010 --> 02:59:03,960
that didn't work right for overriding.

4467
02:59:03,960 --> 02:59:07,410
And then the core thing about the programming model,

4468
02:59:07,410 --> 02:59:09,861
and I was definitely going to hit all of those in Quake,

4469
02:59:09,861 --> 02:59:13,473
but the graphics side of it was,

4470
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:15,570
it was still,

4471
02:59:15,570 --> 02:59:17,100
I knew what I wanted to do

4472
02:59:17,100 --> 02:59:20,940
and it was one of these hubris things where it's like,

4473
02:59:20,940 --> 02:59:24,150
well, so far I've been able to kind of kick everything

4474
02:59:24,150 --> 02:59:26,610
that I set out to go do.

4475
02:59:26,610 --> 02:59:29,460
But Quake was definitely a little bit more

4476
02:59:29,460 --> 02:59:31,953
than could be comfortably chewed at that point.

4477
02:59:33,270 --> 02:59:36,870
But Michael was one of the strongest programmers

4478
02:59:36,870 --> 02:59:39,150
and graphics programmers that I knew,

4479
02:59:39,150 --> 02:59:40,891
and he was one of the people that I trusted

4480
02:59:40,891 --> 02:59:44,310
to write assembly code better than I could.

4481
02:59:44,310 --> 02:59:46,770
And there's a few people that I can point to,

4482
02:59:46,770 --> 02:59:49,980
about things like this where I'm a world class optimizer.

4483
02:59:49,980 --> 02:59:51,780
I mean, I make things go fast,

4484
02:59:51,780 --> 02:59:54,720
but I recognize there's a number of people

4485
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:56,880
that can write tighter assembly code,

4486
02:59:56,880 --> 03:00:01,345
tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA code than I can write.

4487
03:00:01,345 --> 03:00:05,370
My best strengths are a little bit more at the system level.

4488
03:00:05,370 --> 03:00:07,080
I mean, I'm good at all of that,

4489
03:00:07,080 --> 03:00:09,240
but the most leverage comes

4490
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:11,640
from making the decisions that are a little bit higher up

4491
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:15,240
where you figure out how to change your large scale problems

4492
03:00:15,240 --> 03:00:17,040
so that these lower level problems

4493
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:19,506
are easier to do or it makes it possible to do them

4494
03:00:19,506 --> 03:00:23,400
in a uniquely fast way.

4495
03:00:23,400 --> 03:00:27,480
So, most of my big wins in a lot of ways from,

4496
03:00:27,480 --> 03:00:30,360
all the way from the early games through VR

4497
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:32,070
and the aerospace work that I'm doing

4498
03:00:32,070 --> 03:00:34,380
and or did and hopefully the AI work

4499
03:00:34,380 --> 03:00:35,430
that I'm working on now,

4500
03:00:35,430 --> 03:00:37,650
is finding an angle on something

4501
03:00:37,650 --> 03:00:40,380
that means you trade off something

4502
03:00:40,380 --> 03:00:41,580
that you maybe think you need,

4503
03:00:41,580 --> 03:00:43,110
but it turns out you don't need.

4504
03:00:43,110 --> 03:00:45,870
And by making a sacrifice in one place,

4505
03:00:45,870 --> 03:00:48,840
you can get big advantages in another place.

4506
03:00:48,840 --> 03:00:50,931
- Is it clear at which level of the system

4507
03:00:50,931 --> 03:00:54,330
those big advantages can be gained?

4508
03:00:54,330 --> 03:00:55,620
- It's not always clear.

4509
03:00:55,620 --> 03:00:57,720
And that's why the thing that,

4510
03:00:57,720 --> 03:01:00,180
that I try to make one of my core values

4511
03:01:00,180 --> 03:01:03,300
and I proselytize to a lot of people is,

4512
03:01:03,300 --> 03:01:05,520
trying to know the entire stack,

4513
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:08,160
trying to see through everything that happens.

4514
03:01:08,160 --> 03:01:10,020
And it's almost impossible on,

4515
03:01:10,020 --> 03:01:11,880
like the web browser level of things

4516
03:01:11,880 --> 03:01:13,500
where there's so many levels to it,

4517
03:01:13,500 --> 03:01:15,840
but you should at least understand what they all are,

4518
03:01:15,840 --> 03:01:17,040
even if you can't understand,

4519
03:01:17,040 --> 03:01:20,040
all the performance characteristics at each level.

4520
03:01:20,040 --> 03:01:23,010
But it goes all the way down to literally the hardware.

4521
03:01:23,010 --> 03:01:26,580
So, what is this chip capable of

4522
03:01:26,580 --> 03:01:29,430
and what is this software that you're writing capable of?

4523
03:01:29,430 --> 03:01:31,503
And then when this architecture you put on top of that,

4524
03:01:31,503 --> 03:01:33,330
then the ecosystem around it,

4525
03:01:33,330 --> 03:01:35,970
all the people that are working on it.

4526
03:01:35,970 --> 03:01:38,520
So, there are all these decisions

4527
03:01:38,520 --> 03:01:41,220
and they're never made in a globally optimal way,

4528
03:01:41,220 --> 03:01:43,470
but sometimes you can drive a thread

4529
03:01:43,470 --> 03:01:45,120
of global optimality through it.

4530
03:01:45,120 --> 03:01:46,350
You can't look at everything.

4531
03:01:46,350 --> 03:01:47,790
It's too complicated.

4532
03:01:47,790 --> 03:01:49,740
But sometimes you can step back up

4533
03:01:49,740 --> 03:01:51,600
and make a different decision.

4534
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:53,490
And we kind of went through this on the graphics side

4535
03:01:53,490 --> 03:01:55,830
on Quake where in some ways

4536
03:01:55,830 --> 03:01:56,663
it was kind of bad

4537
03:01:56,663 --> 03:01:59,160
where Michael would spend his time writing,

4538
03:01:59,160 --> 03:02:01,680
like I'd rough out the basic routines,

4539
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:03,546
like, okay, here's our span rusterizer

4540
03:02:03,546 --> 03:02:06,780
and he would spend a month writing this,

4541
03:02:06,780 --> 03:02:10,560
beautiful cycle optimized piece of assembly language

4542
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:13,350
that does what I asked it to do.

4543
03:02:13,350 --> 03:02:16,140
And he did it faster than like my original code would do

4544
03:02:16,140 --> 03:02:17,910
or probably what I would be able to do even

4545
03:02:17,910 --> 03:02:20,020
if I had spent that month on it.

4546
03:02:20,020 --> 03:02:23,310
But then we'd have some cases when I'd be like, okay,

4547
03:02:23,310 --> 03:02:25,500
well I figured out at this higher level,

4548
03:02:25,500 --> 03:02:28,140
instead of drawing these in a painter's order here,

4549
03:02:28,140 --> 03:02:32,610
I do a span buffer and it cuts out 30% or 40%

4550
03:02:32,610 --> 03:02:34,080
of all of these pixels,

4551
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:35,490
but it means you need to rewrite,

4552
03:02:35,490 --> 03:02:37,240
kind of this interface of all of that.

4553
03:02:37,240 --> 03:02:39,390
And I could tell that wore on him a little bit,

4554
03:02:39,390 --> 03:02:41,970
but in the end it was the right thing to do

4555
03:02:41,970 --> 03:02:45,180
where we wound up changing that rasterization approach

4556
03:02:45,180 --> 03:02:48,289
and we wound up with a super optimized assembly language,

4557
03:02:48,289 --> 03:02:51,720
core loop and then a good system around,

4558
03:02:51,720 --> 03:02:54,450
which minimized how much that had to be called.

4559
03:02:54,450 --> 03:02:55,980
- And so in order to be able to do this,

4560
03:02:55,980 --> 03:02:58,200
kind of system level thinking,

4561
03:02:58,200 --> 03:03:02,490
whether we're talking about game development,

4562
03:03:02,490 --> 03:03:07,490
aerospace, nuclear energy, AI, VR,

4563
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:10,710
you have to be able to understand the hardware,

4564
03:03:10,710 --> 03:03:14,730
the low level software, the high level software,

4565
03:03:14,730 --> 03:03:15,870
the design decisions,

4566
03:03:15,870 --> 03:03:18,093
the whole thing, the full stack of it.

4567
03:03:18,093 --> 03:03:20,490
- Yeah and that's where a lot of these things,

4568
03:03:20,490 --> 03:03:22,230
become possible when you're really,

4569
03:03:22,230 --> 03:03:23,970
when you're bringing the future forward.

4570
03:03:23,970 --> 03:03:25,170
I mean there's a pace that everything,

4571
03:03:25,170 --> 03:03:27,960
just kind of glides towards where we have a lot of progress

4572
03:03:27,960 --> 03:03:29,013
that's happening at such a,

4573
03:03:29,013 --> 03:03:30,420
so many different ways.

4574
03:03:30,420 --> 03:03:32,310
You kind of slide towards progress,

4575
03:03:32,310 --> 03:03:34,890
just left to your own programs just get faster

4576
03:03:34,890 --> 03:03:36,120
for a while it wasn't clear

4577
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:37,740
if they were gonna get fatter,

4578
03:03:37,740 --> 03:03:39,660
more than they get quicker than they get faster

4579
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:40,740
and it cancels out.

4580
03:03:40,740 --> 03:03:42,570
But it is clear now in retrospect now,

4581
03:03:42,570 --> 03:03:44,010
programs just get faster

4582
03:03:44,010 --> 03:03:46,650
and have gotten faster for a long time.

4583
03:03:46,650 --> 03:03:48,030
But if you wanna do something,

4584
03:03:48,030 --> 03:03:52,050
like back at that original talking about scrolling games,

4585
03:03:52,050 --> 03:03:54,690
say what this needs to be five times faster,

4586
03:03:54,690 --> 03:03:57,690
well we can wait six years and just,

4587
03:03:57,690 --> 03:04:00,810
it'll naturally get that much faster at that time.

4588
03:04:00,810 --> 03:04:03,690
Or you come up with some really clever way of doing it.

4589
03:04:03,690 --> 03:04:06,120
So, there are those opportunities like that

4590
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:08,100
in a whole bunch of different areas.

4591
03:04:08,100 --> 03:04:11,760
Now, most programmers don't need to be thinking about that.

4592
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:13,260
There's not that many,

4593
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:15,090
there's a lot of opportunities for this,

4594
03:04:15,090 --> 03:04:17,220
but it's not everyone's workaday type stuff.

4595
03:04:17,220 --> 03:04:20,340
So, everyone doesn't have to know how all these things work.

4596
03:04:20,340 --> 03:04:22,890
They don't have to know how their compiler works,

4597
03:04:22,890 --> 03:04:26,160
how the processor chip manages cash eviction

4598
03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:28,170
and all these low level things.

4599
03:04:28,170 --> 03:04:31,359
But sometimes there are powerful opportunities

4600
03:04:31,359 --> 03:04:33,150
that you can look at and say,

4601
03:04:33,150 --> 03:04:37,230
we can bring the future five years faster.

4602
03:04:37,230 --> 03:04:38,430
We can do something that,

4603
03:04:38,430 --> 03:04:40,290
wouldn't it be great if we could do this?

4604
03:04:40,290 --> 03:04:42,030
Well, we can do it today

4605
03:04:42,030 --> 03:04:44,190
if we make a certain set of decisions.

4606
03:04:44,190 --> 03:04:47,160
And it is in some ways smoke and mirrors

4607
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:48,450
where you say it's like,

4608
03:04:48,450 --> 03:04:50,460
Doom was a lot of smoke and mirrors

4609
03:04:50,460 --> 03:04:52,260
where people thought it was more capable

4610
03:04:52,260 --> 03:04:53,550
than it actually was,

4611
03:04:53,550 --> 03:04:56,610
but we picked the right smoke and mirrors to deploy

4612
03:04:56,610 --> 03:04:58,980
in the game where by doing this,

4613
03:04:58,980 --> 03:05:00,930
people will think that it's more general,

4614
03:05:00,930 --> 03:05:03,450
if we are gonna amaze them with what they've got here

4615
03:05:03,450 --> 03:05:07,620
and they won't notice that it doesn't do these other things.

4616
03:05:07,620 --> 03:05:09,930
So, smart decision making at that point,

4617
03:05:09,930 --> 03:05:14,930
that's where that kind of global holistic top-down view

4618
03:05:15,690 --> 03:05:16,523
can work.

4619
03:05:16,523 --> 03:05:20,220
And I'm really a strong believer

4620
03:05:20,220 --> 03:05:23,970
that technology should be sitting at that table,

4621
03:05:23,970 --> 03:05:25,080
having those discussions,

4622
03:05:25,080 --> 03:05:26,670
because you do have cases where you say,

4623
03:05:26,670 --> 03:05:28,620
well you wanna be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever,

4624
03:05:28,620 --> 03:05:32,100
where it's a pure design solution.

4625
03:05:32,100 --> 03:05:35,220
And in some cases now

4626
03:05:35,220 --> 03:05:37,770
where you truly have almost infinite resources.

4627
03:05:37,770 --> 03:05:41,520
Like if you're trying to do a scrolling game on the PC now,

4628
03:05:41,520 --> 03:05:43,620
you don't even have to talk to a technology person.

4629
03:05:43,620 --> 03:05:45,092
You can just have,

4630
03:05:45,092 --> 03:05:48,207
any intern can make that go run as fast as it needs to there

4631
03:05:48,207 --> 03:05:50,670
and it can be completely design-based.

4632
03:05:50,670 --> 03:05:53,190
But if you're trying to do something that's hard,

4633
03:05:53,190 --> 03:05:56,520
either that can't be done for resources like VR

4634
03:05:56,520 --> 03:05:58,080
on a mobile chip set

4635
03:05:58,080 --> 03:05:59,820
or that we don't even know how to do yet,

4636
03:05:59,820 --> 03:06:02,010
like artificial general intelligence,

4637
03:06:02,010 --> 03:06:04,560
it's probably going to be a matter of coming at it

4638
03:06:04,560 --> 03:06:05,393
from an angle.

4639
03:06:05,393 --> 03:06:07,830
Like, I mean for AGI we have some of like,

4640
03:06:07,830 --> 03:06:10,890
some of the harder principles about how you can SI

4641
03:06:10,890 --> 03:06:12,543
or there are theoretical ways

4642
03:06:12,543 --> 03:06:15,240
that you can say this is the optimal learning algorithm

4643
03:06:15,240 --> 03:06:18,630
that can solve everything, but it's completely impractical.

4644
03:06:18,630 --> 03:06:20,190
You just can't do that.

4645
03:06:20,190 --> 03:06:23,310
So, clearly you have to make some concessions

4646
03:06:23,310 --> 03:06:25,200
for general intelligence

4647
03:06:25,200 --> 03:06:27,300
and nobody knows what the right ones are yet.

4648
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:29,310
So, people are taking different angles of attack.

4649
03:06:29,310 --> 03:06:32,190
I hope I've got something clever to come up with

4650
03:06:32,190 --> 03:06:34,050
in that space.

4651
03:06:34,050 --> 03:06:35,490
- It's been surprising to me

4652
03:06:35,490 --> 03:06:38,760
and I think it perhaps it is a principle of progress

4653
03:06:38,760 --> 03:06:40,590
that smoke and mirrors somehow

4654
03:06:40,590 --> 03:06:42,810
is the way you build the future.

4655
03:06:42,810 --> 03:06:45,953
You kind of fake it till you make it

4656
03:06:45,953 --> 03:06:47,120
and you almost always make it.

4657
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:49,997
And I think that's going to be the way we achieve AGI,

4658
03:06:49,997 --> 03:06:53,610
that's going to be the way we build consciousness

4659
03:06:53,610 --> 03:06:54,930
into our machines

4660
03:06:54,930 --> 03:06:59,426
is there's philosophers debate about the touring test

4661
03:06:59,426 --> 03:07:02,850
is essentially about faking it till you make it.

4662
03:07:02,850 --> 03:07:04,530
You start by faking it.

4663
03:07:04,530 --> 03:07:08,970
And I think that always leads to making it.

4664
03:07:08,970 --> 03:07:10,680
Because if we look at history-

4665
03:07:10,680 --> 03:07:13,140
- Arguments when as soon as people start talking about

4666
03:07:13,140 --> 03:07:15,926
and consciousness and Chinese rooms and things,

4667
03:07:15,926 --> 03:07:17,580
it's like I just check out,

4668
03:07:17,580 --> 03:07:20,190
I just don't think there's any value in those conversations.

4669
03:07:20,190 --> 03:07:22,500
It's just like, go ahead, tell me it's not gonna work.

4670
03:07:22,500 --> 03:07:25,380
I'm gonna do my best to try to make it work anyways.

4671
03:07:25,380 --> 03:07:26,910
- I don't know if you work with legged robots,

4672
03:07:26,910 --> 03:07:28,160
there's a bunch of these,

4673
03:07:29,400 --> 03:07:33,900
they sure as heck make me feel like they're cautious

4674
03:07:33,900 --> 03:07:37,170
in a certain way that's not here today,

4675
03:07:37,170 --> 03:07:41,250
but is you could see the kernel.

4676
03:07:41,250 --> 03:07:46,020
It's like the flame, the beginnings of a flame.

4677
03:07:46,020 --> 03:07:47,520
- We don't have line of sight,

4678
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:50,070
but there's glimmerings of light in the distance

4679
03:07:50,070 --> 03:07:51,060
for all of these things.

4680
03:07:51,060 --> 03:07:53,553
- Yeah, I'm hearing murmuring in a distant room.

4681
03:07:54,900 --> 03:07:56,870
Well, let me ask you a human question here.

4682
03:07:56,870 --> 03:07:59,910
In the game design space,

4683
03:07:59,910 --> 03:08:01,920
you've done a lot of incredible work throughout,

4684
03:08:01,920 --> 03:08:04,410
but in terms of game design,

4685
03:08:04,410 --> 03:08:05,820
you have changed the world

4686
03:08:05,820 --> 03:08:08,460
and there's a few people around you that did the same.

4687
03:08:08,460 --> 03:08:11,610
So, famously there's some animosity,

4688
03:08:11,610 --> 03:08:13,050
there's much love,

4689
03:08:13,050 --> 03:08:16,350
but there's some animosity between you and John Romero,

4690
03:08:16,350 --> 03:08:19,950
what is at the core of that animosity and human tension.

4691
03:08:19,950 --> 03:08:22,248
- So there really hasn't been,

4692
03:08:22,248 --> 03:08:25,500
for a long time and even at the beginning it's like,

4693
03:08:25,500 --> 03:08:29,490
yes I did push Romero out of the company

4694
03:08:29,490 --> 03:08:32,160
and this is one of the things that I look back,

4695
03:08:32,160 --> 03:08:35,970
if I could go back telling my younger self,

4696
03:08:35,970 --> 03:08:37,860
some advice about things,

4697
03:08:37,860 --> 03:08:41,940
the original founding kind of corporate structure

4698
03:08:41,940 --> 03:08:45,720
of id Software really led to a bunch of problems.

4699
03:08:45,720 --> 03:08:48,540
We started off with us as equal partners

4700
03:08:48,540 --> 03:08:50,430
and we had a buy sell agreement,

4701
03:08:50,430 --> 03:08:52,500
because we didn't want outsiders to be telling us

4702
03:08:52,500 --> 03:08:54,420
what to do inside the company.

4703
03:08:54,420 --> 03:08:57,270
And that did lead to a bunch of the problems

4704
03:08:57,270 --> 03:08:59,580
where I was sitting here going,

4705
03:08:59,580 --> 03:09:02,910
it's like, alright, I'm working harder than anyone.

4706
03:09:02,910 --> 03:09:04,770
I'm doing these technologies,

4707
03:09:04,770 --> 03:09:08,100
nobody's done before, but we're all equal partners

4708
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:11,490
and then I see somebody that's not working as hard.

4709
03:09:11,490 --> 03:09:16,140
And I mean, I can't say I was the most mature about that.

4710
03:09:16,140 --> 03:09:18,000
I was 20 something years old

4711
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:21,960
and it did bother me when I'm like,

4712
03:09:21,960 --> 03:09:24,000
everybody, okay, we need all pull together

4713
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,973
and we've done it before.

4714
03:09:25,973 --> 03:09:27,690
Everybody we know we can do this if we get together

4715
03:09:27,690 --> 03:09:29,400
and we grind it all out.

4716
03:09:29,400 --> 03:09:33,237
But not everybody wanted to do that for all time

4717
03:09:33,237 --> 03:09:35,700
and I was the youngest, one of the crowd there.

4718
03:09:35,700 --> 03:09:40,470
I had different sets of kind of backgrounds and motivations

4719
03:09:40,470 --> 03:09:44,910
and left at that point where it was all right,

4720
03:09:44,910 --> 03:09:47,160
either everybody has to be contributing,

4721
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:50,373
like up to this level or they need to get pushed out,

4722
03:09:52,350 --> 03:09:54,243
that was not a situation.

4723
03:09:55,323 --> 03:09:56,334
And I look back on it

4724
03:09:56,334 --> 03:09:58,410
and now we pushed people outta the company

4725
03:09:58,410 --> 03:10:00,270
that could have contributed

4726
03:10:00,270 --> 03:10:02,790
if there was a different framework for them

4727
03:10:02,790 --> 03:10:04,650
and the modern kind of Silicon Valley,

4728
03:10:04,650 --> 03:10:06,990
like let your stock vest over a time period

4729
03:10:06,990 --> 03:10:08,760
and maybe it's non-voting stock

4730
03:10:08,760 --> 03:10:09,780
and all those different things.

4731
03:10:09,780 --> 03:10:11,400
We knew nothing about any of that.

4732
03:10:11,400 --> 03:10:14,310
I mean, we didn't know what we were doing in terms

4733
03:10:14,310 --> 03:10:16,410
of corporate structure or anything.

4734
03:10:16,410 --> 03:10:18,420
- So, if you think the framework was different,

4735
03:10:18,420 --> 03:10:20,490
some of the human tension could have been a little bit of-

4736
03:10:20,490 --> 03:10:21,827
- It almost certainly would have.

4737
03:10:21,827 --> 03:10:23,992
I mean I look back at that

4738
03:10:23,992 --> 03:10:28,170
and it's like even trying to summon up in my mind it's like,

4739
03:10:28,170 --> 03:10:31,637
I know I was really, really angry about,

4740
03:10:31,637 --> 03:10:35,550
like Romero not working as hard as I wanted him to work

4741
03:10:35,550 --> 03:10:39,030
or not carrying his load on the design for Quake

4742
03:10:39,030 --> 03:10:40,890
and coming up with things there.

4743
03:10:40,890 --> 03:10:43,050
But he was definitely doing things.

4744
03:10:43,050 --> 03:10:44,880
He made some of the best levels there.

4745
03:10:44,880 --> 03:10:47,730
He was working with some of our external teams,

4746
03:10:47,730 --> 03:10:50,178
like Raven on the licensing side of things.

4747
03:10:50,178 --> 03:10:53,806
But there were differences of opinion about it.

4748
03:10:53,806 --> 03:10:57,240
But he landed right on his feet.

4749
03:10:57,240 --> 03:10:59,670
He went and he got $20 million from IDOs

4750
03:10:59,670 --> 03:11:02,970
to go do Ion Storm and he got to do things his way

4751
03:11:02,970 --> 03:11:05,700
and spun up three teams simultaneously,

4752
03:11:05,700 --> 03:11:08,160
because that was always one of the challenging things

4753
03:11:08,160 --> 03:11:08,993
in at id,

4754
03:11:08,993 --> 03:11:11,103
where we were doing these single string,

4755
03:11:12,314 --> 03:11:13,170
one project after another.

4756
03:11:13,170 --> 03:11:17,216
And I think some of them, wanted to grow the company more.

4757
03:11:17,216 --> 03:11:19,177
And I didn't because I knew people that were saying that,

4758
03:11:19,177 --> 03:11:22,200
"Oh, companies turned to shit when you got 50 employees."

4759
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:24,944
It's just a different world there.

4760
03:11:24,944 --> 03:11:28,470
And I loved our little dozen people working on the projects,

4761
03:11:28,470 --> 03:11:30,607
but you can look at it and say,

4762
03:11:30,607 --> 03:11:32,307
"Well, business realities matter."

4763
03:11:33,414 --> 03:11:34,644
It's like, you're super successful here

4764
03:11:34,644 --> 03:11:36,360
and we could take a swing and a miss on something,

4765
03:11:36,360 --> 03:11:38,829
but you do it a couple times and you're outta luck.

4766
03:11:38,829 --> 03:11:41,234
There's a reason companies try to have,

4767
03:11:41,234 --> 03:11:44,687
multiple teams running at one time.

4768
03:11:44,687 --> 03:11:47,070
And so that was again,

4769
03:11:47,070 --> 03:11:49,590
something I didn't really appreciate back then.

4770
03:11:49,590 --> 03:11:51,030
- So, if you look past all that,

4771
03:11:51,030 --> 03:11:53,760
you did create some amazing things together.

4772
03:11:53,760 --> 03:11:55,770
What did you love about John Romero?

4773
03:11:55,770 --> 03:11:57,150
What did you respect and appreciate about him?

4774
03:11:57,150 --> 03:11:59,100
What did you admire about him?

4775
03:11:59,100 --> 03:12:00,960
What did you learn from him?

4776
03:12:00,960 --> 03:12:01,793
- When I met him,

4777
03:12:01,793 --> 03:12:04,020
he was the coolest programmer I had ever met.

4778
03:12:04,020 --> 03:12:05,580
He had done all of this stuff.

4779
03:12:05,580 --> 03:12:07,590
He had made all of these games.

4780
03:12:07,590 --> 03:12:08,520
He had worked at,

4781
03:12:08,520 --> 03:12:11,190
one of the companies that I thought was the coolest

4782
03:12:11,190 --> 03:12:14,580
at Origin Systems and he knew all this stuff.

4783
03:12:14,580 --> 03:12:17,060
He made things happen fast and he could,

4784
03:12:17,060 --> 03:12:18,930
he was also kind of a polymath about this

4785
03:12:18,930 --> 03:12:19,763
where he could do,

4786
03:12:19,763 --> 03:12:21,570
he made his own, he drew his own art,

4787
03:12:21,570 --> 03:12:23,820
he made his own levels as well as,

4788
03:12:23,820 --> 03:12:26,760
he worked on sound design systems on top

4789
03:12:26,760 --> 03:12:29,280
of actually being a really good programmer.

4790
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:32,466
And we had we went through a little,

4791
03:12:32,466 --> 03:12:34,680
it was kind of fun where one of the early things that we did

4792
03:12:34,680 --> 03:12:37,080
where there was kind of the young buck bit going in

4793
03:12:37,080 --> 03:12:40,599
where I was the new guy and he was the,

4794
03:12:40,599 --> 03:12:43,659
he was the top man programmer at the Soft Disc Area.

4795
03:12:43,659 --> 03:12:47,100
And eventually we had sort of a challenge over the weekend

4796
03:12:47,100 --> 03:12:49,720
that we were gonna like race to implement this game

4797
03:12:50,587 --> 03:12:52,770
to port one of our PC games down to the Apple II.

4798
03:12:52,770 --> 03:12:56,164
And that was where we finally kind of became clear,

4799
03:12:56,164 --> 03:12:57,720
it's like, okay, CarMax stands a little bit apart

4800
03:12:57,720 --> 03:12:59,740
on the programming side of things,

4801
03:12:59,740 --> 03:13:03,060
but Romero then very gracefully moved into,

4802
03:13:03,060 --> 03:13:04,500
well he'll work on the tools,

4803
03:13:04,500 --> 03:13:06,060
he'll work on the systems,

4804
03:13:06,060 --> 03:13:07,650
do some of the game design stuff

4805
03:13:07,650 --> 03:13:10,050
as well as contributing on starting

4806
03:13:10,050 --> 03:13:12,544
to lead the design aspects of a lot of things.

4807
03:13:12,544 --> 03:13:16,707
So, he was enormously valuable in the early stuff

4808
03:13:16,707 --> 03:13:18,180
and so much of Doom

4809
03:13:18,180 --> 03:13:21,900
and even Quake have his stamp on it in a lot of ways.

4810
03:13:21,900 --> 03:13:25,650
But he wasn't at the same level of focus

4811
03:13:25,650 --> 03:13:29,160
that I brought to the work that we were doing there.

4812
03:13:29,160 --> 03:13:30,423
And he really did,

4813
03:13:31,710 --> 03:13:33,510
we hit such a degree of success

4814
03:13:33,510 --> 03:13:35,730
that it was all in the press about

4815
03:13:35,730 --> 03:13:38,010
that the Rockstar game programmers.

4816
03:13:38,010 --> 03:13:40,080
- I mean it's the Beatles problem.

4817
03:13:40,080 --> 03:13:43,320
- Yeah, I mean, he ate it up and he did personify,

4818
03:13:43,320 --> 03:13:45,070
there was the whole game developers

4819
03:13:45,986 --> 03:13:48,568
with Ferraris that we had there.

4820
03:13:48,568 --> 03:13:52,988
And I thought that led to some challenges there.

4821
03:13:52,988 --> 03:13:57,570
But so much of the stuff that was great

4822
03:13:57,570 --> 03:13:59,277
in the games did come from him.

4823
03:13:59,277 --> 03:14:01,534
And I would certainly not take that away from him.

4824
03:14:01,534 --> 03:14:05,135
And even after we parted ways and he took his swing

4825
03:14:05,135 --> 03:14:08,370
with IDOs in some ways he was like,

4826
03:14:08,370 --> 03:14:10,860
he was ahead of the curve with mobile gaming as well,

4827
03:14:10,860 --> 03:14:13,500
where one of his companies after IDOs

4828
03:14:13,500 --> 03:14:16,319
was working on feature phone game development

4829
03:14:16,319 --> 03:14:19,680
and I wound up doing some of that just,

4830
03:14:19,680 --> 03:14:23,100
before the iPhone crossing over into the iPhone phase there.

4831
03:14:23,100 --> 03:14:25,620
And that was something that clearly did turn out

4832
03:14:25,620 --> 03:14:26,520
to be a huge thing,

4833
03:14:26,520 --> 03:14:28,620
although he was too early

4834
03:14:28,620 --> 03:14:30,867
for what he was working on at that time.

4835
03:14:30,867 --> 03:14:34,080
We've had pretty cordial relationships

4836
03:14:34,080 --> 03:14:36,735
where I was happy to talk with him anytime I'd run into him

4837
03:14:36,735 --> 03:14:38,190
at a conference.

4838
03:14:38,190 --> 03:14:40,950
I haven't actually had some other people just say it's like,

4839
03:14:40,950 --> 03:14:42,960
oh, you shouldn't go over there

4840
03:14:42,960 --> 03:14:44,430
and give him the time of day

4841
03:14:44,430 --> 03:14:47,214
or felt that Masters of Doom was,

4842
03:14:47,214 --> 03:14:50,940
like portray played things up in a way

4843
03:14:50,940 --> 03:14:52,530
that I shouldn't be too happy with.

4844
03:14:52,530 --> 03:14:55,170
But I'm okay with all of that and I know.

4845
03:14:55,170 --> 03:14:56,790
- So you still got love in your heart?

4846
03:14:56,790 --> 03:15:00,000
- Yeah, I mean, I just talked with him like last year,

4847
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:01,830
I guess it was even this year about mentioning

4848
03:15:01,830 --> 03:15:03,840
that I'm going off doing this AI stuff.

4849
03:15:03,840 --> 03:15:06,193
I'm going big into artificial intelligence

4850
03:15:06,193 --> 03:15:08,121
and he had bunch of ideas

4851
03:15:08,121 --> 03:15:10,334
for how AI is gonna play into gaming

4852
03:15:10,334 --> 03:15:12,888
and asked if I was interested in collaborating

4853
03:15:12,888 --> 03:15:15,908
and it's not in line with what I'm doing,

4854
03:15:15,908 --> 03:15:19,650
but I wish almost everyone the best.

4855
03:15:19,650 --> 03:15:22,610
I mean, I know I may not have parted on the best of terms

4856
03:15:22,610 --> 03:15:24,480
with some people,

4857
03:15:24,480 --> 03:15:29,100
but I was thrilled to see Tom Hall writing VR games now.

4858
03:15:29,100 --> 03:15:31,320
He wrote working on a game called "Demio,"

4859
03:15:31,320 --> 03:15:33,780
which is really an awesome VR game.

4860
03:15:33,780 --> 03:15:35,010
It's like "Dungeons and Dragons"

4861
03:15:35,010 --> 03:15:36,810
we all used to play "Dungeons and Dragons" together.

4862
03:15:36,810 --> 03:15:39,150
That was one of the things that was what we did on Sundays

4863
03:15:39,150 --> 03:15:40,320
in the early days,

4864
03:15:40,320 --> 03:15:42,180
I would Dungeon Master and they'd all play

4865
03:15:42,180 --> 03:15:45,720
and so it really made me smile seeing Tom involved

4866
03:15:45,720 --> 03:15:48,603
with an RPG game in virtual reality.

4867
03:15:49,680 --> 03:15:54,600
- You were the CTO of Oculus VR since 2013

4868
03:15:54,600 --> 03:15:59,600
and maybe lessen your involvement a bit in 2019.

4869
03:16:00,390 --> 03:16:04,890
Oculus was acquired by Facebook now Meta in 2014.

4870
03:16:04,890 --> 03:16:07,800
You've spoken brilliantly about both the low level details,

4871
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:09,060
the experimental design

4872
03:16:09,060 --> 03:16:12,030
and the big picture vision of virtual reality.

4873
03:16:12,030 --> 03:16:14,250
Let me ask you about the Metaverse,

4874
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:15,690
the big question here,

4875
03:16:15,690 --> 03:16:17,489
both philosophically and technically,

4876
03:16:17,489 --> 03:16:20,190
how hard is it to build the Metaverse?

4877
03:16:20,190 --> 03:16:22,710
What is the metaverse in your view,

4878
03:16:22,710 --> 03:16:23,940
you started with discussing

4879
03:16:23,940 --> 03:16:26,390
and thinking about quake as a kind of a metaverse

4880
03:16:27,240 --> 03:16:28,950
as you think about it today.

4881
03:16:28,950 --> 03:16:31,890
What is the metaverse the thing

4882
03:16:31,890 --> 03:16:34,410
that could create this compelling user value,

4883
03:16:34,410 --> 03:16:36,840
this experience that will change the world

4884
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:39,000
and how hard is it to build it?

4885
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:41,167
- So, the term comes from Neil Stevenson's book,

4886
03:16:41,167 --> 03:16:43,680
"Snow Crash," which many of us had read,

4887
03:16:43,680 --> 03:16:44,700
back in the '90s.

4888
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,852
It was one of those kind of formative books.

4889
03:16:46,852 --> 03:16:51,727
And there was this sense that the possibilities

4890
03:16:53,100 --> 03:16:54,420
and kind of the freedom

4891
03:16:54,420 --> 03:16:57,732
and unlimited capabilities to build a virtual world,

4892
03:16:57,732 --> 03:16:59,520
that does whatever you want,

4893
03:16:59,520 --> 03:17:00,990
whatever you ask of it

4894
03:17:00,990 --> 03:17:04,200
has been a powerful draw for generations of developers,

4895
03:17:04,200 --> 03:17:05,610
game developers specifically

4896
03:17:05,610 --> 03:17:06,780
and people that are thinking,

4897
03:17:06,780 --> 03:17:09,750
about more general purpose applications.

4898
03:17:09,750 --> 03:17:12,079
So, we were talking about that back

4899
03:17:12,079 --> 03:17:15,180
in the Doom and Quake days about how do you wind up

4900
03:17:15,180 --> 03:17:17,100
with an interconnected set of worlds

4901
03:17:17,100 --> 03:17:19,170
that you kind of visit from one to another

4902
03:17:19,170 --> 03:17:21,480
and as webpage were becoming a thing,

4903
03:17:21,480 --> 03:17:23,220
you start thinking about

4904
03:17:23,220 --> 03:17:27,600
what is the interactive kind of 3D-based equivalent of this?

4905
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:29,760
And there were a lot of really bad takes.

4906
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:34,230
You had like VRML then, virtual reality markup languages.

4907
03:17:34,230 --> 03:17:38,220
And there's aspects like that came from people saying,

4908
03:17:38,220 --> 03:17:41,467
well what kind of capabilities should we develop

4909
03:17:41,467 --> 03:17:43,650
to enable this?

4910
03:17:43,650 --> 03:17:45,600
And that kind of capability-first work

4911
03:17:45,600 --> 03:17:48,750
has usually not panned out very well.

4912
03:17:48,750 --> 03:17:49,620
On the other hand,

4913
03:17:49,620 --> 03:17:52,140
we have successful games that started

4914
03:17:52,140 --> 03:17:53,640
with things like Doom and Quake

4915
03:17:53,640 --> 03:17:55,680
and communities that formed around those

4916
03:17:55,680 --> 03:17:58,710
and whether it was server lists in the early days

4917
03:17:58,710 --> 03:18:01,650
or literal portal link between different games

4918
03:18:01,650 --> 03:18:03,630
and then modern things

4919
03:18:03,630 --> 03:18:04,830
that are on completely different order

4920
03:18:04,830 --> 03:18:07,200
of magnitude like Minecraft and Fortnite

4921
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:09,903
that have a hundred million plus users.

4922
03:18:11,504 --> 03:18:14,130
I still think that that's the right way to go

4923
03:18:14,130 --> 03:18:16,710
to build the Metaverse is you build something

4924
03:18:16,710 --> 03:18:18,240
that's amazing that people love

4925
03:18:18,240 --> 03:18:20,940
and people wind up spending all their time in,

4926
03:18:20,940 --> 03:18:21,960
because it's awesome

4927
03:18:21,960 --> 03:18:24,060
and you expand the capabilities of that.

4928
03:18:24,060 --> 03:18:26,050
- So, even if it's a very basic experience?

4929
03:18:26,050 --> 03:18:27,216
- As long as it's,

4930
03:18:27,216 --> 03:18:30,923
Minecraft is an amazing case study in so many things.

4931
03:18:30,923 --> 03:18:34,100
What's been able to be done with that

4932
03:18:34,100 --> 03:18:36,395
is really enlightening.

4933
03:18:36,395 --> 03:18:38,910
And there are other cases where,

4934
03:18:38,910 --> 03:18:40,470
like right now Roblox

4935
03:18:40,470 --> 03:18:43,260
is basically a game construction kit aimed at kids

4936
03:18:43,260 --> 03:18:45,030
and that was a capability first play

4937
03:18:45,030 --> 03:18:46,410
and it's achieving scale

4938
03:18:46,410 --> 03:18:48,990
that's on the same order of those things.

4939
03:18:48,990 --> 03:18:50,489
So, it's not impossible,

4940
03:18:50,489 --> 03:18:53,370
but my preferred bet would be,

4941
03:18:53,370 --> 03:18:55,170
you make something amazing that people love

4942
03:18:55,170 --> 03:18:56,850
and you make it better and better.

4943
03:18:56,850 --> 03:18:59,610
And that's where I could say we could have gone back

4944
03:18:59,610 --> 03:19:01,560
and followed a path kind of like that

4945
03:19:01,560 --> 03:19:04,740
in the early days if you just kind of take the same game.

4946
03:19:04,740 --> 03:19:07,080
Whether it's when Activision demonstrated

4947
03:19:07,080 --> 03:19:09,180
that you could make Call of Duty every year

4948
03:19:09,180 --> 03:19:12,150
and not only is it not bad, people kind of love it

4949
03:19:12,150 --> 03:19:13,626
and it's very profitable.

4950
03:19:13,626 --> 03:19:16,848
The idea that you could have taken something like that,

4951
03:19:16,848 --> 03:19:20,250
take a great game, release a new version every year

4952
03:19:20,250 --> 03:19:22,080
that lets the capabilities grow

4953
03:19:22,080 --> 03:19:24,150
and expand to start saying it's like,

4954
03:19:24,150 --> 03:19:26,820
okay, it's a game about running around and shooting things,

4955
03:19:26,820 --> 03:19:30,300
but now you can have, bring your media into it.

4956
03:19:30,300 --> 03:19:35,040
You can add persistence of social sense, signs of life

4957
03:19:35,040 --> 03:19:36,753
or whatever you want to add to it.

4958
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:41,420
I still think that's quite a good position to take.

4959
03:19:41,420 --> 03:19:43,256
And I think that while Meta

4960
03:19:43,256 --> 03:19:46,470
is doing a bottoms up capability approach

4961
03:19:46,470 --> 03:19:47,910
with Horizon Worlds,

4962
03:19:47,910 --> 03:19:50,067
where it's a fairly general purpose,

4963
03:19:50,067 --> 03:19:52,440
creators can build whatever they want

4964
03:19:52,440 --> 03:19:53,703
in their sort of thing,

4965
03:19:55,351 --> 03:19:57,630
it's hard to compare and compete

4966
03:19:57,630 --> 03:19:58,740
with something like Fortnite,

4967
03:19:58,740 --> 03:20:01,338
which also has enormous amounts of creativity,

4968
03:20:01,338 --> 03:20:03,660
even though it was not designed originally

4969
03:20:03,660 --> 03:20:05,790
as a general purpose sort of thing.

4970
03:20:05,790 --> 03:20:08,083
So, we have examples on both sides.

4971
03:20:08,083 --> 03:20:09,470
Me personally,

4972
03:20:09,470 --> 03:20:13,350
I would've bet on trying to do entertainment,

4973
03:20:13,350 --> 03:20:16,702
valuable destination first and expanding from there.

4974
03:20:16,702 --> 03:20:21,702
- So, can you imagine the thing that will be kind of,

4975
03:20:22,101 --> 03:20:24,902
if we look back a couple of centuries from now

4976
03:20:24,902 --> 03:20:28,699
and you think about the experiences

4977
03:20:28,699 --> 03:20:30,990
that marked the singularity,

4978
03:20:30,990 --> 03:20:35,910
the transition in where most of our world moved

4979
03:20:35,910 --> 03:20:37,680
into virtual reality.

4980
03:20:37,680 --> 03:20:40,721
What do you think those experiences will look like?

4981
03:20:40,721 --> 03:20:42,480
- So, I do think it's gonna be kind of like

4982
03:20:42,480 --> 03:20:44,880
the way the web slowly took over

4983
03:20:44,880 --> 03:20:47,325
where you're the frog in the pot of water

4984
03:20:47,325 --> 03:20:48,900
that's slowly heating up

4985
03:20:48,900 --> 03:20:51,221
where having lived through all of that,

4986
03:20:51,221 --> 03:20:53,548
I remember when it was shocking to start

4987
03:20:53,548 --> 03:20:56,404
seeing the first website address on a billboard

4988
03:20:56,404 --> 03:20:57,367
when you're like,

4989
03:20:57,367 --> 03:21:00,690
"Hey, my computer world is infecting the real world."

4990
03:21:00,690 --> 03:21:03,150
This is spreading out in some way.

4991
03:21:03,150 --> 03:21:05,317
But there's still when you look back and say,

4992
03:21:05,317 --> 03:21:07,400
"Well, what made the web take off?"

4993
03:21:07,400 --> 03:21:12,090
And it wasn't a big bang sort of moment there,

4994
03:21:12,090 --> 03:21:13,629
it was a bunch of little things

4995
03:21:13,629 --> 03:21:15,720
that turned out not to even be the things

4996
03:21:15,720 --> 03:21:18,441
that are relevant now that brought them into it.

4997
03:21:18,441 --> 03:21:20,460
- Well I wonder if from,

4998
03:21:20,460 --> 03:21:23,190
I mean like you said, you're not a historian,

4999
03:21:23,190 --> 03:21:26,640
so maybe there's a historian out there

5000
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:30,750
that could really identify that moment data-driven way.

5001
03:21:30,750 --> 03:21:33,359
It could be like MySpace or something like that.

5002
03:21:33,359 --> 03:21:35,803
Maybe the first major social network

5003
03:21:35,803 --> 03:21:40,803
that really reached into non-Geek World

5004
03:21:40,880 --> 03:21:42,240
or something like that.

5005
03:21:42,240 --> 03:21:45,180
- I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians though,

5006
03:21:45,180 --> 03:21:48,090
looking for some of those kind of primary dominant,

5007
03:21:48,090 --> 03:21:50,690
causes where so many of these things are like,

5008
03:21:50,690 --> 03:21:52,680
we see an exponential curve,

5009
03:21:52,680 --> 03:21:55,633
but it's not because like one thing is going exponential,

5010
03:21:55,633 --> 03:21:58,683
it's because we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves,

5011
03:21:58,683 --> 03:22:00,840
overlapped on top of each other

5012
03:22:00,840 --> 03:22:02,550
and they just happen to keep adding up

5013
03:22:02,550 --> 03:22:05,183
so that you've got something kind of going exponential

5014
03:22:05,183 --> 03:22:06,510
at any given point.

5015
03:22:06,510 --> 03:22:09,057
But no single one of them was the critical thing.

5016
03:22:09,057 --> 03:22:11,730
There were dozens and dozens of things.

5017
03:22:11,730 --> 03:22:13,980
I mean, seeing the transitions of stuff like

5018
03:22:13,980 --> 03:22:16,620
as obviously MySpace giving way to other things,

5019
03:22:16,620 --> 03:22:19,382
but even like blogging, giving way to social media

5020
03:22:19,382 --> 03:22:22,543
and getting resurrected in other guises

5021
03:22:22,543 --> 03:22:24,687
and things that happened there.

5022
03:22:24,687 --> 03:22:26,100
- And the memes with dancing baby GIF

5023
03:22:26,100 --> 03:22:29,190
or whatever all your base not belonged to us.

5024
03:22:29,190 --> 03:22:32,001
Whatever those early memes that led to the modern memes

5025
03:22:32,001 --> 03:22:35,790
and the humor on the different evolution

5026
03:22:35,790 --> 03:22:37,053
of humor on the internet

5027
03:22:37,053 --> 03:22:39,655
that I'm sure the historians will also write books about

5028
03:22:39,655 --> 03:22:42,660
from the different website that support,

5029
03:22:42,660 --> 03:22:44,550
that create the infrastructure for that humor,

5030
03:22:44,550 --> 03:22:46,212
like Reddit and all that kind of stuff.

5031
03:22:46,212 --> 03:22:48,000
- So, people will go back

5032
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:50,400
and they will name firsts in critical moments.

5033
03:22:50,400 --> 03:22:53,190
But it's probably going to be a poor approximation

5034
03:22:53,190 --> 03:22:54,209
of what actually happens.

5035
03:22:54,209 --> 03:22:56,280
And we've already seen,

5036
03:22:56,280 --> 03:22:59,340
like in the VR space where it didn't play out

5037
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:01,080
the way we thought it would

5038
03:23:01,080 --> 03:23:04,200
in terms of what was gonna be like when the modern era

5039
03:23:04,200 --> 03:23:07,320
of VR basically started with my E3 demo of Doom Three

5040
03:23:07,320 --> 03:23:08,490
on the Rift prototype.

5041
03:23:08,490 --> 03:23:11,010
So, we're like first person shooters in VR,

5042
03:23:11,010 --> 03:23:12,335
match made in heaven, right?

5043
03:23:12,335 --> 03:23:14,934
And that didn't work out that way at all.

5044
03:23:14,934 --> 03:23:18,026
They have the most comfort problems with it.

5045
03:23:18,026 --> 03:23:22,170
And then the most popular virtual reality app is Beat Saber,

5046
03:23:22,170 --> 03:23:24,435
which nobody predicted back then.

5047
03:23:24,435 --> 03:23:28,800
- What's that make you like from First Principles?

5048
03:23:28,800 --> 03:23:31,350
If you were to like reverse engineer that,

5049
03:23:31,350 --> 03:23:34,312
why are these like silly fun games the most?

5050
03:23:34,312 --> 03:23:37,049
- It actually makes very clear sense

5051
03:23:37,049 --> 03:23:40,500
when you analyze it from hindsight

5052
03:23:40,500 --> 03:23:41,940
and look at the engineering reasons

5053
03:23:41,940 --> 03:23:44,820
where it's not just that it was a magical, quirky idea.

5054
03:23:44,820 --> 03:23:47,850
It was something that played almost perfectly

5055
03:23:47,850 --> 03:23:50,189
to what turned out to be the real strengths of VR.

5056
03:23:50,189 --> 03:23:51,720
Where the one thing

5057
03:23:51,720 --> 03:23:54,030
that I really underestimated importance in VR

5058
03:23:54,030 --> 03:23:55,681
was the importance of the controllers.

5059
03:23:55,681 --> 03:23:57,750
I was still thinking we could do a lot more

5060
03:23:57,750 --> 03:23:58,890
with the Game Pad

5061
03:23:58,890 --> 03:24:01,980
and just the amazingness of taking any existing game.

5062
03:24:01,980 --> 03:24:03,087
Being able to move your head around

5063
03:24:03,087 --> 03:24:06,210
and look around that, that was really amazing.

5064
03:24:06,210 --> 03:24:09,030
But the controllers were super important.

5065
03:24:09,030 --> 03:24:09,863
But the problem is,

5066
03:24:09,863 --> 03:24:13,470
so many things that you do with the controllers just suck.

5067
03:24:13,470 --> 03:24:14,760
It feels like it breaks the illusion,

5068
03:24:14,760 --> 03:24:16,080
like trying to pick up glasses

5069
03:24:16,080 --> 03:24:17,227
with the controllers where you're like,

5070
03:24:17,227 --> 03:24:19,597
"Oh, use the grip button when you're kind of close

5071
03:24:19,597 --> 03:24:20,887
"and it'll snap into your hand."

5072
03:24:20,887 --> 03:24:25,410
All of those things are unnatural actions that you do them,

5073
03:24:25,410 --> 03:24:27,197
and it's still part of the VR experience.

5074
03:24:27,197 --> 03:24:32,197
But Beat Saber winds up playing only to the strengths.

5075
03:24:32,490 --> 03:24:34,650
It completely hides all the weaknesses of it,

5076
03:24:34,650 --> 03:24:37,110
because you are holding something in your hand,

5077
03:24:37,110 --> 03:24:38,899
you keep a solid grip on it the whole time.

5078
03:24:38,899 --> 03:24:41,773
It slices through things without ever bumping into things.

5079
03:24:41,773 --> 03:24:43,500
You never get into the point

5080
03:24:43,500 --> 03:24:46,320
where I'm knocking on this table, but in VR,

5081
03:24:46,320 --> 03:24:48,090
my hand just goes right through it.

5082
03:24:48,090 --> 03:24:51,090
So, you've got something that slices through.

5083
03:24:51,090 --> 03:24:53,017
So, it's never your brain telling you,

5084
03:24:53,017 --> 03:24:54,540
"Oh, I should have hit something."

5085
03:24:54,540 --> 03:24:55,830
You've got a lightsaber here.

5086
03:24:55,830 --> 03:24:58,110
It's just, you expect it to slice through everything.

5087
03:24:58,110 --> 03:25:02,046
Audio and music turned out to be a really powerful aspect

5088
03:25:02,046 --> 03:25:03,600
of virtual reality

5089
03:25:03,600 --> 03:25:05,190
where you're blocking the world off

5090
03:25:05,190 --> 03:25:07,243
and constructing the world around you

5091
03:25:07,243 --> 03:25:10,809
and being something that can run efficiently on,

5092
03:25:10,809 --> 03:25:13,081
even this relatively low powered hardware

5093
03:25:13,081 --> 03:25:17,670
and can have a valuable loop in a small amount of time.

5094
03:25:17,670 --> 03:25:18,909
Where a lot of modern games,

5095
03:25:18,909 --> 03:25:21,480
you're supposed to sit down and play it for an hour,

5096
03:25:21,480 --> 03:25:22,313
just to get anywhere.

5097
03:25:22,313 --> 03:25:23,670
Sometimes a new game takes an hour

5098
03:25:23,670 --> 03:25:25,350
to get through the tutorial level

5099
03:25:25,350 --> 03:25:27,870
and that's not good for VR for a couple reasons.

5100
03:25:27,870 --> 03:25:29,315
You do still have the comfort issues

5101
03:25:29,315 --> 03:25:30,976
if you're moving around at all,

5102
03:25:30,976 --> 03:25:34,296
but you've also got just discomfort from the headset,

5103
03:25:34,296 --> 03:25:37,084
battery lifespan on the mobile versions.

5104
03:25:37,084 --> 03:25:39,150
So, having things that do break down

5105
03:25:39,150 --> 03:25:41,835
into three and four minute windows of play,

5106
03:25:41,835 --> 03:25:43,770
that turns out to be very valuable

5107
03:25:43,770 --> 03:25:45,312
from a gameplay standpoint.

5108
03:25:45,312 --> 03:25:47,874
So, it winds up being kind of a perfect storm

5109
03:25:47,874 --> 03:25:49,554
of all of these things that are really good.

5110
03:25:49,554 --> 03:25:52,080
It doesn't have any of the comfort problems.

5111
03:25:52,080 --> 03:25:54,246
You're not navigating around, you're standing still.

5112
03:25:54,246 --> 03:25:56,309
All the stuff flies at you.

5113
03:25:56,309 --> 03:25:58,196
It has placed audio strengths.

5114
03:25:58,196 --> 03:26:00,899
It adds the whole,

5115
03:26:00,899 --> 03:26:01,732
the whole fitness in VR.

5116
03:26:01,732 --> 03:26:04,500
Nobody was thinking about that back at the beginning.

5117
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:05,760
And it turns out that

5118
03:26:05,760 --> 03:26:09,090
that is an excellent daily fitness thing to be doing.

5119
03:26:09,090 --> 03:26:11,910
If you go play an hour of "Beat Saber"

5120
03:26:11,910 --> 03:26:16,060
or "Supernatural" or something that is legit solid exercise

5121
03:26:17,517 --> 03:26:18,350
and it's more fun than doing it,

5122
03:26:18,350 --> 03:26:19,920
just about any other way there.

5123
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:22,723
- So, that's kind of the arcade stage of things.

5124
03:26:22,723 --> 03:26:26,226
If I were to say with my experience with VR,

5125
03:26:26,226 --> 03:26:30,660
the thing that I think is powerful is the,

5126
03:26:30,660 --> 03:26:32,028
maybe it's not here yet,

5127
03:26:32,028 --> 03:26:35,957
but the degree to which it is immersive

5128
03:26:35,957 --> 03:26:39,189
in the way that Quake is immersive,

5129
03:26:39,189 --> 03:26:41,010
it takes you to another world for me,

5130
03:26:41,010 --> 03:26:43,139
because I'm a fan of role playing games,

5131
03:26:43,139 --> 03:26:48,139
the elder scroll series like Sky Room

5132
03:26:48,930 --> 03:26:52,590
or even Daggerfall, it just takes you to another world.

5133
03:26:52,590 --> 03:26:56,010
And when you're not in that world, you miss not being there.

5134
03:26:56,010 --> 03:26:58,860
And then you just, you kind of wanna stay there forever.

5135
03:26:58,860 --> 03:27:03,860
'Cause life is shitty and you just wanna go to this place.

5136
03:27:04,489 --> 03:27:07,500
- Is that there was a time

5137
03:27:07,500 --> 03:27:10,200
when we were kind of asked to come up with like,

5138
03:27:10,200 --> 03:27:11,686
what's your view about VR?

5139
03:27:11,686 --> 03:27:14,512
And my pitch was that

5140
03:27:14,512 --> 03:27:17,250
it should be better inside the headset than outside.

5141
03:27:17,250 --> 03:27:19,020
It's the world as you want it.

5142
03:27:19,020 --> 03:27:19,853
- Yeah.

5143
03:27:19,853 --> 03:27:21,690
- And everybody thought that was dystopian

5144
03:27:21,690 --> 03:27:23,017
and like that's like,

5145
03:27:23,017 --> 03:27:25,590
"Oh, you're just gonna forget about the world outside."

5146
03:27:25,590 --> 03:27:28,292
And I don't get that mindset

5147
03:27:28,292 --> 03:27:31,121
where the idea that if you can make the world better

5148
03:27:31,121 --> 03:27:33,243
inside the headset than outside,

5149
03:27:33,243 --> 03:27:36,240
you've just improved the person's life

5150
03:27:36,240 --> 03:27:38,520
that's has a headset that can wear it.

5151
03:27:38,520 --> 03:27:39,663
And there are plenty of things

5152
03:27:39,663 --> 03:27:42,390
that we just can't do for everyone in the real world.

5153
03:27:42,390 --> 03:27:44,940
Everybody can't have Richard Branson's private island,

5154
03:27:44,940 --> 03:27:47,220
but everyone can have a private VR island

5155
03:27:47,220 --> 03:27:49,170
and it can have the things that they want on it.

5156
03:27:49,170 --> 03:27:50,460
And there's a lot of these kind

5157
03:27:50,460 --> 03:27:52,860
of rivalry goods in the real world

5158
03:27:52,860 --> 03:27:54,986
that VR can just be better at.

5159
03:27:54,986 --> 03:27:57,810
We can do a lot of things like that

5160
03:27:57,810 --> 03:27:59,179
that can be very, very rich.

5161
03:27:59,179 --> 03:28:02,400
So yeah, I want the, I think it's gonna be a positive thing,

5162
03:28:02,400 --> 03:28:04,911
this world where people want to go back into their headset

5163
03:28:04,911 --> 03:28:07,024
where it can be better than somebody

5164
03:28:07,024 --> 03:28:08,672
that's living in a tiny apartment

5165
03:28:08,672 --> 03:28:12,000
can have a palatial estate in virtual reality.

5166
03:28:12,000 --> 03:28:12,960
They can have all their friends

5167
03:28:12,960 --> 03:28:15,600
from all over the world come over and visit them

5168
03:28:15,600 --> 03:28:17,074
without everybody getting on a plane

5169
03:28:17,074 --> 03:28:19,710
and meeting in someplace and dealing

5170
03:28:19,710 --> 03:28:21,232
with all the other logistics hassles.

5171
03:28:21,232 --> 03:28:22,691
There is real value

5172
03:28:22,691 --> 03:28:26,610
in the presence that you can get for remote meetings.

5173
03:28:26,610 --> 03:28:29,769
It's all the little things that we need to sort out,

5174
03:28:29,769 --> 03:28:32,880
but those are things that we have line of sight on.

5175
03:28:32,880 --> 03:28:36,000
People that have been in like a good VR meeting,

5176
03:28:36,000 --> 03:28:38,137
using workrooms where you can say,

5177
03:28:38,137 --> 03:28:40,440
"Oh, that was better than a Zoom meeting."

5178
03:28:40,440 --> 03:28:42,960
But of course it's more of a hassle to get into it.

5179
03:28:42,960 --> 03:28:44,430
Not everyone has the headset.

5180
03:28:44,430 --> 03:28:46,290
Interoperability is worse.

5181
03:28:46,290 --> 03:28:48,660
You can't have you cap out at a certain number.

5182
03:28:48,660 --> 03:28:50,670
There's all these things that need to be fixed,

5183
03:28:50,670 --> 03:28:51,867
but that's one of those things you can look at

5184
03:28:51,867 --> 03:28:54,240
and say we know there's value there.

5185
03:28:54,240 --> 03:28:56,340
We just need to really grind hard,

5186
03:28:56,340 --> 03:28:59,460
file off all the rough edges and make that possible.

5187
03:28:59,460 --> 03:29:01,442
- So, you do think we have line of sight,

5188
03:29:01,442 --> 03:29:06,063
because there's a reason like,

5189
03:29:07,020 --> 03:29:09,513
I do this podcast in person for example.

5190
03:29:10,560 --> 03:29:14,100
It's doing it remotely, it it's not the same.

5191
03:29:14,100 --> 03:29:16,950
And if somebody were to ask me why it's not the same,

5192
03:29:16,950 --> 03:29:19,734
I wouldn't be able to write down exactly why.

5193
03:29:19,734 --> 03:29:23,400
But you're saying that it's possible,

5194
03:29:23,400 --> 03:29:27,030
whatever the magic is for in-person interaction,

5195
03:29:27,030 --> 03:29:30,093
that immersiveness of the experience,

5196
03:29:30,093 --> 03:29:32,190
we are almost there.

5197
03:29:32,190 --> 03:29:33,423
- Yes, so the idea like,

5198
03:29:33,423 --> 03:29:37,740
I am doing a VR interview with someone,

5199
03:29:37,740 --> 03:29:39,630
I'm not saying it's here right now,

5200
03:29:39,630 --> 03:29:42,690
but you can see glimmers of what it should be.

5201
03:29:42,690 --> 03:29:46,080
And we largely know what would need to be fixed

5202
03:29:46,080 --> 03:29:48,090
and improved to like you say,

5203
03:29:48,090 --> 03:29:50,640
there's a difference between at remote interview,

5204
03:29:50,640 --> 03:29:53,970
doing a podcast over Zoom or something and face-to-face.

5205
03:29:53,970 --> 03:29:56,520
There's that sense of presence, that immediacy,

5206
03:29:56,520 --> 03:29:59,100
the super low latency, responsiveness,

5207
03:29:59,100 --> 03:30:01,470
being able to see all the subtle things there,

5208
03:30:01,470 --> 03:30:03,720
just occupying the same field of view.

5209
03:30:03,720 --> 03:30:07,800
And all of those are things that we absolutely can do in VR.

5210
03:30:07,800 --> 03:30:10,530
And that simple case of a small meeting

5211
03:30:10,530 --> 03:30:11,670
with a couple people,

5212
03:30:11,670 --> 03:30:13,860
that's the much easier case than everybody thinks.

5213
03:30:13,860 --> 03:30:15,360
The ready player one multiverse

5214
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:17,000
with a thousand people going across

5215
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:20,100
a huge bridge to amazing places.

5216
03:30:20,100 --> 03:30:22,500
That's harder in a lot of other technical ways.

5217
03:30:22,500 --> 03:30:24,150
Not to say we can't also do that,

5218
03:30:24,150 --> 03:30:26,610
but that's further away and has more challenges.

5219
03:30:26,610 --> 03:30:29,417
But this small thing about being able to have a meeting

5220
03:30:29,417 --> 03:30:32,130
with one or a few people

5221
03:30:32,130 --> 03:30:35,313
and have it feel real, feel like you're there,

5222
03:30:35,313 --> 03:30:37,110
like you have the same interactions

5223
03:30:37,110 --> 03:30:37,950
and talking with them,

5224
03:30:37,950 --> 03:30:39,390
you get subtle cues

5225
03:30:39,390 --> 03:30:41,370
as we start getting eye and face tracking

5226
03:30:41,370 --> 03:30:43,950
and some of the other things on high-end headsets,

5227
03:30:43,950 --> 03:30:46,380
a lot of that is going to come over

5228
03:30:46,380 --> 03:30:49,170
and it doesn't have to be as good.

5229
03:30:49,170 --> 03:30:51,120
This is an important thing that people miss,

5230
03:30:51,120 --> 03:30:54,120
where there was a lot of people that,

5231
03:30:54,120 --> 03:30:56,850
especially rich people that would look at VR

5232
03:30:56,850 --> 03:30:59,820
and say it's like, oh, this just isn't that good.

5233
03:30:59,820 --> 03:31:00,653
And I'd say it's like,

5234
03:31:00,653 --> 03:31:03,810
well you've already been courtside backstage

5235
03:31:03,810 --> 03:31:07,050
and on pit row and you've done all of these experiences,

5236
03:31:07,050 --> 03:31:08,760
because you get to do them in real life.

5237
03:31:08,760 --> 03:31:10,770
But most people don't get to

5238
03:31:10,770 --> 03:31:13,410
and even if the experience is only half as good,

5239
03:31:13,410 --> 03:31:15,060
if it's something that they never would've gotten

5240
03:31:15,060 --> 03:31:17,790
to do before, it's still a very good thing.

5241
03:31:17,790 --> 03:31:20,940
And as we can push that number up over time.

5242
03:31:20,940 --> 03:31:24,180
It has a minimum viable value level

5243
03:31:24,180 --> 03:31:27,240
when it does something that is valuable enough to people,

5244
03:31:27,240 --> 03:31:30,030
as long as it's better inside the headset on any metric

5245
03:31:30,030 --> 03:31:32,670
than it is outside and people choose to go there,

5246
03:31:32,670 --> 03:31:35,640
we're on the right path and we have a value gradient

5247
03:31:35,640 --> 03:31:37,140
that I'm just always hammering on.

5248
03:31:37,140 --> 03:31:39,090
We can just follow this value gradient.

5249
03:31:39,090 --> 03:31:41,070
Just keep making things better,

5250
03:31:41,070 --> 03:31:43,860
rather than going for that one.

5251
03:31:43,860 --> 03:31:46,350
Close your eyes swing for the fences,

5252
03:31:46,350 --> 03:31:48,750
kind of silver bullet approach.

5253
03:31:48,750 --> 03:31:50,520
- Well, I wonder if there's a value gradient

5254
03:31:50,520 --> 03:31:51,540
for in-person meetings.

5255
03:31:51,540 --> 03:31:53,490
Because if you get that right,

5256
03:31:53,490 --> 03:31:54,903
I mean that would change the world.

5257
03:31:54,903 --> 03:31:55,736
- [John] Yeah.

5258
03:31:55,736 --> 03:31:57,030
- That it doesn't need to,

5259
03:31:57,030 --> 03:31:59,015
I mean you don't need ready player one.

5260
03:31:59,015 --> 03:32:02,820
but I wonder if there's that value gradient

5261
03:32:02,820 --> 03:32:06,597
you can follow along because if there is

5262
03:32:06,597 --> 03:32:10,380
and you follow it then there'll be a certain,

5263
03:32:10,380 --> 03:32:13,470
like phase shift at a certain point

5264
03:32:13,470 --> 03:32:18,470
where people will shift from Zoom to this.

5265
03:32:18,630 --> 03:32:23,250
I wonder what are the bottlenecks?

5266
03:32:23,250 --> 03:32:24,120
Is it software?

5267
03:32:24,120 --> 03:32:25,491
Is it hardware?

5268
03:32:25,491 --> 03:32:27,810
Is it all about latency?

5269
03:32:27,810 --> 03:32:30,480
So, I have big arguments internally,

5270
03:32:30,480 --> 03:32:32,760
about strategic things like that

5271
03:32:32,760 --> 03:32:36,720
where like the next headset that's coming out

5272
03:32:36,720 --> 03:32:39,000
that we've made various announcements about

5273
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:40,500
is gonna be a higher end headset,

5274
03:32:40,500 --> 03:32:42,000
more expensive, more features.

5275
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:45,540
Lots of people wanna make those trade-offs.

5276
03:32:45,540 --> 03:32:47,343
We'll see what the market has to say about

5277
03:32:47,343 --> 03:32:49,499
the exact trade-offs we've made here.

5278
03:32:49,499 --> 03:32:51,127
But if you wanna replace Zoom,

5279
03:32:51,127 --> 03:32:53,670
you need to have something that everybody has.

5280
03:32:53,670 --> 03:32:56,460
- [Lex] So, you want something you like cheaper.

5281
03:32:56,460 --> 03:33:00,210
- I like cheaper because also lighter and cheaper,

5282
03:33:00,210 --> 03:33:04,770
wind up being a virtuous cycle there where expensive

5283
03:33:04,770 --> 03:33:07,260
and more features tends to also lead towards heavier.

5284
03:33:07,260 --> 03:33:08,280
And it just kind of goes,

5285
03:33:08,280 --> 03:33:09,660
it's like, let's add more features.

5286
03:33:09,660 --> 03:33:11,343
The features are not,

5287
03:33:11,343 --> 03:33:13,800
they have physical presence and weight

5288
03:33:13,800 --> 03:33:16,170
and draw from batteries and all of those things.

5289
03:33:16,170 --> 03:33:19,830
So, I've always favored a lower end, cheaper,

5290
03:33:19,830 --> 03:33:21,450
faster approach.

5291
03:33:21,450 --> 03:33:24,360
That's why I was always behind the mobile side of VR,

5292
03:33:24,360 --> 03:33:26,730
rather than the higher end PC headsets.

5293
03:33:26,730 --> 03:33:29,430
And I think that's proven out well.

5294
03:33:29,430 --> 03:33:31,110
But there's, you always,

5295
03:33:31,110 --> 03:33:32,910
ideally we have a whole range of things,

5296
03:33:32,910 --> 03:33:35,400
but if you've only got one or two things,

5297
03:33:35,400 --> 03:33:37,156
it's important that those two things cover

5298
03:33:37,156 --> 03:33:40,590
the scope that you think is most important.

5299
03:33:40,590 --> 03:33:42,480
When we're in a world when it's like cell phones

5300
03:33:42,480 --> 03:33:44,010
and there's 50 of 'em on the market,

5301
03:33:44,010 --> 03:33:46,980
covering every conceivable ecological niche you want,

5302
03:33:46,980 --> 03:33:47,940
that's gonna be great,

5303
03:33:47,940 --> 03:33:49,920
but we're not gonna be there for a while.

5304
03:33:49,920 --> 03:33:51,570
- Where are the bottlenecks?

5305
03:33:51,570 --> 03:33:53,400
Is it the hardware or the software?

5306
03:33:53,400 --> 03:33:56,310
- Yeah, so right now you can play,

5307
03:33:56,310 --> 03:33:58,890
you can get workrooms on Quest

5308
03:33:58,890 --> 03:34:00,360
and you can set up these things

5309
03:34:00,360 --> 03:34:01,710
and it's a pretty good experience.

5310
03:34:01,710 --> 03:34:02,730
It's surprisingly good.

5311
03:34:02,730 --> 03:34:03,563
- I haven't tried it.

5312
03:34:03,563 --> 03:34:05,160
Is it surprisingly good.

5313
03:34:05,160 --> 03:34:06,750
- Yeah, the voice latency

5314
03:34:06,750 --> 03:34:10,110
is better on that than a lot better than a Zoom meeting.

5315
03:34:10,110 --> 03:34:13,560
So, you've got a better sense of immediacy there.

5316
03:34:13,560 --> 03:34:15,480
The expressions that you get

5317
03:34:15,480 --> 03:34:19,140
from the current hardware with just kind of your controllers

5318
03:34:19,140 --> 03:34:21,540
and your head is pretty realistic feeling

5319
03:34:21,540 --> 03:34:23,310
and you've got a pretty good sense of being there

5320
03:34:23,310 --> 03:34:24,143
with someone with that.

5321
03:34:24,143 --> 03:34:27,510
- Are these like avatars of people?

5322
03:34:27,510 --> 03:34:30,025
Like do you get to see their body

5323
03:34:30,025 --> 03:34:32,460
and they're sitting around a table?

5324
03:34:32,460 --> 03:34:33,397
- [John] Yeah.

5325
03:34:33,397 --> 03:34:35,700
- And it feels is better than Zoom?

5326
03:34:35,700 --> 03:34:37,550
- Better than, yeah, better than you'd expect for that.

5327
03:34:37,550 --> 03:34:40,230
It is definitely,

5328
03:34:40,230 --> 03:34:42,660
yeah, I'd say it's quite a bit better than Zoom

5329
03:34:42,660 --> 03:34:43,890
when everything's working right.

5330
03:34:43,890 --> 03:34:46,470
But there's still all the rough edges of,

5331
03:34:46,470 --> 03:34:48,270
the reason Zoom became so successful

5332
03:34:48,270 --> 03:34:51,060
is because they just nailed the usability of everything.

5333
03:34:51,060 --> 03:34:54,990
It's high quality with a absolutely first rate experience

5334
03:34:54,990 --> 03:34:58,050
and we are not there yet with any of the VR stuff.

5335
03:34:58,050 --> 03:35:00,076
I'm trying to push hard to get,

5336
03:35:00,076 --> 03:35:02,250
I keep talking about,

5337
03:35:02,250 --> 03:35:03,810
it's like it needs to just be one click

5338
03:35:03,810 --> 03:35:05,040
to make everything happen.

5339
03:35:05,040 --> 03:35:07,650
And we're getting there in our home environment,

5340
03:35:07,650 --> 03:35:09,300
not the whole work room's application,

5341
03:35:09,300 --> 03:35:11,760
but the main home where you can now kind of go over

5342
03:35:11,760 --> 03:35:12,720
and click an invite

5343
03:35:12,720 --> 03:35:15,240
and it still winds up taking five times longer

5344
03:35:15,240 --> 03:35:16,290
than it should.

5345
03:35:16,290 --> 03:35:17,970
But we're getting close to that

5346
03:35:17,970 --> 03:35:20,730
where you click there, they click on their button

5347
03:35:20,730 --> 03:35:22,020
and then they're sitting there

5348
03:35:22,020 --> 03:35:23,880
in this good presence with you.

5349
03:35:23,880 --> 03:35:25,950
But latencies need to get a lot better.

5350
03:35:25,950 --> 03:35:28,275
User interface needs to get a lot better.

5351
03:35:28,275 --> 03:35:30,930
Ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better.

5352
03:35:30,930 --> 03:35:33,780
We need to have a hundred million of 'em out there,

5353
03:35:33,780 --> 03:35:35,430
just so that everybody knows somebody

5354
03:35:35,430 --> 03:35:37,260
that uses this all the time.

5355
03:35:37,260 --> 03:35:38,550
- Well I think it's a virtuous cycle,

5356
03:35:38,550 --> 03:35:43,550
because I do think the interface is the thing that makes

5357
03:35:45,180 --> 03:35:48,150
or breaks this kind of revolution.

5358
03:35:48,150 --> 03:35:50,880
It's so interesting how, like you said, one click,

5359
03:35:50,880 --> 03:35:54,000
but it's also like how you achieve that one click.

5360
03:35:54,000 --> 03:35:58,620
I don't know what is, can I ask a dark question?

5361
03:35:58,620 --> 03:36:00,690
Maybe let's keep it outside of Meta,

5362
03:36:00,690 --> 03:36:05,040
but this is about Meta but also Google and big companies.

5363
03:36:05,040 --> 03:36:07,920
Are they able to do this kind of thing?

5364
03:36:07,920 --> 03:36:12,660
It seems like, let me put on my cranky old man hat,

5365
03:36:12,660 --> 03:36:15,690
they seem to not do a good job

5366
03:36:15,690 --> 03:36:20,490
of creating these user-friendly interfaces

5367
03:36:20,490 --> 03:36:22,950
as they get bigger and bigger as a company.

5368
03:36:22,950 --> 03:36:24,090
Like Google has created,

5369
03:36:24,090 --> 03:36:27,537
some of the greatest interfaces ever early on

5370
03:36:27,537 --> 03:36:30,330
and it's, I mean, creating Gmail,

5371
03:36:30,330 --> 03:36:34,110
just so many brilliant interfaces

5372
03:36:34,110 --> 03:36:37,200
and she seems to getting crappier and crappier at that.

5373
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:42,180
Same with Meta, same with Microsoft.

5374
03:36:42,180 --> 03:36:44,940
It's just, it seems to get worse and worse at that.

5375
03:36:44,940 --> 03:36:46,110
I don't know what is it,

5376
03:36:46,110 --> 03:36:47,640
because you've become more conservative,

5377
03:36:47,640 --> 03:36:49,980
careful, risk averse.

5378
03:36:49,980 --> 03:36:51,150
Is that why?

5379
03:36:51,150 --> 03:36:52,285
Can you speak to that?

5380
03:36:52,285 --> 03:36:53,520
- So, it's been really eye-opening to me,

5381
03:36:53,520 --> 03:36:57,213
working inside a tech titan where I am.

5382
03:36:57,213 --> 03:36:59,490
I had my small companies

5383
03:36:59,490 --> 03:37:03,510
and then we are acquired by a mid-size game publisher

5384
03:37:03,510 --> 03:37:06,780
and then Oculus getting acquired by Meta.

5385
03:37:06,780 --> 03:37:08,910
And Meta has grown by a factor of many,

5386
03:37:08,910 --> 03:37:13,020
just in the eight years since the acquisition.

5387
03:37:13,020 --> 03:37:16,260
So, I did not have experience with this.

5388
03:37:16,260 --> 03:37:18,180
And it was interesting

5389
03:37:18,180 --> 03:37:20,580
because I remember like previously my benchmark

5390
03:37:20,580 --> 03:37:23,040
for kind of use of resources

5391
03:37:23,040 --> 03:37:25,290
was some of the government programs I interacted with

5392
03:37:25,290 --> 03:37:26,910
on the aerospace side.

5393
03:37:26,910 --> 03:37:28,860
And I remember thinking there was,

5394
03:37:28,860 --> 03:37:30,117
okay, there's an Air Force program

5395
03:37:30,117 --> 03:37:31,290
and they spent $50 million

5396
03:37:31,290 --> 03:37:34,380
and they didn't launch anything.

5397
03:37:34,380 --> 03:37:35,490
They didn't even build anything.

5398
03:37:35,490 --> 03:37:39,030
It was just kind of like they made a bunch of papers

5399
03:37:39,030 --> 03:37:42,090
and had some parts in a warehouse and nothing came of it.

5400
03:37:42,090 --> 03:37:43,300
It's like $50 million

5401
03:37:44,321 --> 03:37:47,760
and I've had to radically recalibrate

5402
03:37:47,760 --> 03:37:51,360
my sense of like how much money can be spent with-

5403
03:37:51,360 --> 03:37:52,650
- [Lex] Without a product at the end.

5404
03:37:52,650 --> 03:37:57,650
- Resources on the plus side VR has turned out,

5405
03:37:58,020 --> 03:38:02,280
we've built pretty much exactly what,

5406
03:38:02,280 --> 03:38:04,470
we just passed the 10-year mark then from my,

5407
03:38:04,470 --> 03:38:06,960
I like my first demo of the Rift

5408
03:38:06,960 --> 03:38:09,570
and if I could have said what I wanted to have,

5409
03:38:09,570 --> 03:38:11,400
it would've been a standalone,

5410
03:38:11,400 --> 03:38:14,910
inside out tracked 4K resolution headset

5411
03:38:14,910 --> 03:38:18,390
that could still plug into a PC for High-end rendering.

5412
03:38:18,390 --> 03:38:21,000
And that's exactly what we've got on Quest Two right now.

5413
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:22,680
- Yes, first of all, let's pause on that

5414
03:38:22,680 --> 03:38:24,690
with me being cranky and everything.

5415
03:38:24,690 --> 03:38:29,690
What Meta achieved with Oculus and so on is incredible.

5416
03:38:30,180 --> 03:38:31,566
I mean this is this

5417
03:38:31,566 --> 03:38:34,050
when I thought about the future of VR,

5418
03:38:34,050 --> 03:38:36,720
this is what I imagined in terms of hardware I would say.

5419
03:38:36,720 --> 03:38:39,270
And maybe in terms of the experience as well,

5420
03:38:39,270 --> 03:38:42,090
but it's still not there somehow

5421
03:38:42,090 --> 03:38:44,610
- On the one hand we did kind of achieve it and win

5422
03:38:44,610 --> 03:38:46,380
and we've sold,

5423
03:38:46,380 --> 03:38:48,180
we're a success right now.

5424
03:38:48,180 --> 03:38:51,240
But the amount of resources that have gone into it,

5425
03:38:51,240 --> 03:38:53,550
it winds up getting floated up in accounting

5426
03:38:53,550 --> 03:38:58,380
where Mark did announce that they spent $10 billion a year,

5427
03:38:58,380 --> 03:38:59,520
like on Reality Labs.

5428
03:38:59,520 --> 03:39:01,740
Now Reality Labs covers a lot.

5429
03:39:01,740 --> 03:39:04,320
It was, VR was not the large part of it,

5430
03:39:04,320 --> 03:39:08,190
also had portal and Spark and the big AR research efforts

5431
03:39:08,190 --> 03:39:11,070
and it's been expanding out to include AI

5432
03:39:11,070 --> 03:39:15,570
and other things there where there's a lot going on there.

5433
03:39:15,570 --> 03:39:18,150
But $10 billion was just a number

5434
03:39:18,150 --> 03:39:20,315
that I had trouble processing.

5435
03:39:20,315 --> 03:39:22,500
I feel sick to my stomach,

5436
03:39:22,500 --> 03:39:24,990
thinking about that much money being spent.

5437
03:39:24,990 --> 03:39:27,840
But that's how they demonstrate commitment to this

5438
03:39:27,840 --> 03:39:31,410
where it's not more so than like yeah,

5439
03:39:31,410 --> 03:39:34,080
Google goes and cancels all of these projects,

5440
03:39:34,080 --> 03:39:36,690
different things like that while Meta

5441
03:39:36,690 --> 03:39:40,440
is really sticking with the funding of VR and AR

5442
03:39:40,440 --> 03:39:41,910
is still further out with it.

5443
03:39:41,910 --> 03:39:43,961
So, there's something to be said for that.

5444
03:39:43,961 --> 03:39:46,950
It's not just gonna vanish the work's going in.

5445
03:39:46,950 --> 03:39:49,680
I just wish it could be all those resources,

5446
03:39:49,680 --> 03:39:51,510
could be applied more effectively.

5447
03:39:51,510 --> 03:39:53,730
Yeah, because I see all these cases,

5448
03:39:53,730 --> 03:39:56,910
I point out these examples of how a third party

5449
03:39:56,910 --> 03:39:58,950
that we're kind of competing with in various ways,

5450
03:39:58,950 --> 03:40:00,480
there's a number of these examples

5451
03:40:00,480 --> 03:40:03,840
and they do work with a 10th of the people

5452
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:05,400
that we do internally.

5453
03:40:05,400 --> 03:40:06,960
And a lot of it comes from,

5454
03:40:06,960 --> 03:40:08,880
yes, there's the small company

5455
03:40:08,880 --> 03:40:11,430
can just go do it while in a big company

5456
03:40:11,430 --> 03:40:12,780
you do have to worry about,

5457
03:40:12,780 --> 03:40:16,427
is there some SDK internally that you should be using,

5458
03:40:16,427 --> 03:40:18,180
'cause another team's making it.

5459
03:40:18,180 --> 03:40:21,090
You have to have your cross-functional group meetups

5460
03:40:21,090 --> 03:40:22,290
for different things.

5461
03:40:22,290 --> 03:40:25,290
You do have more concerns about privacy

5462
03:40:25,290 --> 03:40:26,910
or diversity and equity

5463
03:40:26,910 --> 03:40:28,920
and safety of different things,

5464
03:40:28,920 --> 03:40:31,890
parental issues and things that a small startup company

5465
03:40:31,890 --> 03:40:36,077
can just kind of cowboy off and do something interesting.

5466
03:40:36,077 --> 03:40:39,420
And there's a lot more that is a problem

5467
03:40:39,420 --> 03:40:41,490
that you have to pay attention to in the big companies.

5468
03:40:41,490 --> 03:40:42,900
But I'm not willing to believe

5469
03:40:42,900 --> 03:40:46,320
that we are within even a factor of two or four

5470
03:40:46,320 --> 03:40:48,219
of what the efficiency could be.

5471
03:40:48,219 --> 03:40:52,080
I am constantly kind of crying out for it's like,

5472
03:40:52,080 --> 03:40:53,460
we can do better than this.

5473
03:40:53,460 --> 03:40:55,110
- Yeah and you wonder what the mechanisms

5474
03:40:55,110 --> 03:40:57,827
to unlock that efficiency are.

5475
03:40:57,827 --> 03:41:02,827
There is some sense in a large company that,

5476
03:41:03,450 --> 03:41:05,700
like an individual engineer might not believe

5477
03:41:05,700 --> 03:41:07,140
that they can change the world.

5478
03:41:07,140 --> 03:41:11,490
Maybe you delegate a little bit of the responsibility

5479
03:41:11,490 --> 03:41:14,430
to be the one who changes the world in a big company,

5480
03:41:14,430 --> 03:41:15,330
I think.

5481
03:41:15,330 --> 03:41:19,470
But the reality is like the world will get changed

5482
03:41:19,470 --> 03:41:21,390
by a single engineer anyway.

5483
03:41:21,390 --> 03:41:24,420
So, whether inside Google or inside a startup,

5484
03:41:24,420 --> 03:41:25,253
it doesn't matter.

5485
03:41:25,253 --> 03:41:26,310
It's just like Google

5486
03:41:26,310 --> 03:41:29,730
and Meta needs to help those engineers believe.

5487
03:41:29,730 --> 03:41:32,580
They're the ones that are gonna decrease that latency,

5488
03:41:32,580 --> 03:41:37,200
it'll take one John Carmack like the 20-year-old Carmack

5489
03:41:37,200 --> 03:41:40,257
that's inside Meta right now to change everything.

5490
03:41:40,257 --> 03:41:43,080
- And I try to point that out and push people.

5491
03:41:43,080 --> 03:41:46,050
It's like, try to go ahead and when you see some,

5492
03:41:46,050 --> 03:41:48,787
because you get the silo mentality where you're like,

5493
03:41:48,787 --> 03:41:50,857
"Okay, I know something's not right over there,

5494
03:41:50,857 --> 03:41:52,878
"but I'm staying in my lane here."

5495
03:41:52,878 --> 03:41:57,420
And there's a couple people that I can think about

5496
03:41:57,420 --> 03:41:59,610
that are willing to just like hop all over the place

5497
03:41:59,610 --> 03:42:00,957
and man, I treasure them.

5498
03:42:00,957 --> 03:42:02,970
The people that are just willing to,

5499
03:42:02,970 --> 03:42:04,830
they're fearless, they will go over

5500
03:42:04,830 --> 03:42:06,420
and they will go rebuild the kernel

5501
03:42:06,420 --> 03:42:08,280
and change this distribution and go in

5502
03:42:08,280 --> 03:42:11,880
and hack the firmware over here to get something done right.

5503
03:42:11,880 --> 03:42:14,220
And that is relatively rare,

5504
03:42:14,220 --> 03:42:15,780
there's thousands of developers

5505
03:42:15,780 --> 03:42:18,300
and you've got a small handful that are willing to operate

5506
03:42:18,300 --> 03:42:22,350
at that level and it's potentially risky for them.

5507
03:42:22,350 --> 03:42:24,960
The the politics are real in a lot of that.

5508
03:42:24,960 --> 03:42:29,460
And I'm in the very much the privileged position of I am,

5509
03:42:29,460 --> 03:42:31,320
I'm more or less untouchable

5510
03:42:31,320 --> 03:42:33,480
where I've been dinged like twice for,

5511
03:42:33,480 --> 03:42:35,730
it's like you said something insensitive in that post.

5512
03:42:35,730 --> 03:42:38,940
And you should probably not say that,

5513
03:42:38,940 --> 03:42:39,960
but for the most part,

5514
03:42:39,960 --> 03:42:43,813
yes, I get away with I every week I'm posting something,

5515
03:42:43,813 --> 03:42:47,460
pretty loud and opinionated internally.

5516
03:42:47,460 --> 03:42:50,220
And I think that's useful for the company.

5517
03:42:50,220 --> 03:42:54,627
But yeah, it's rare to have a position like that

5518
03:42:54,627 --> 03:42:56,640
and I can't necessarily offer advice

5519
03:42:56,640 --> 03:42:58,713
for how someone can do that.

5520
03:42:58,713 --> 03:43:01,530
- Well, you could offer advice to a company in general

5521
03:43:01,530 --> 03:43:06,060
to give a little bit of freedom for the young, wild,

5522
03:43:06,060 --> 03:43:10,230
like the wildest ideas come from the young minds.

5523
03:43:10,230 --> 03:43:14,430
And so you need to give the young minds freedom to think big

5524
03:43:14,430 --> 03:43:16,530
and wild and crazy.

5525
03:43:16,530 --> 03:43:18,175
And for that they have to be opinionated.

5526
03:43:18,175 --> 03:43:23,175
They have to think crazy ideas and thoughts

5527
03:43:24,360 --> 03:43:26,310
and pursue them with a full passion,

5528
03:43:26,310 --> 03:43:29,220
without being slowed down by bureaucracy or managers

5529
03:43:29,220 --> 03:43:31,080
and all that kind of stuff.

5530
03:43:31,080 --> 03:43:33,060
Obviously startups really empower that.

5531
03:43:33,060 --> 03:43:34,260
But big companies could too.

5532
03:43:34,260 --> 03:43:37,140
And that's a design challenge for company,

5533
03:43:37,140 --> 03:43:40,170
for big companies to see how can you enable that?

5534
03:43:40,170 --> 03:43:41,175
How can you empower that?

5535
03:43:41,175 --> 03:43:42,008
- 'Cause the big company,

5536
03:43:42,008 --> 03:43:43,620
there are so many resources there.

5537
03:43:43,620 --> 03:43:46,590
And they do amazing things do get accomplished,

5538
03:43:46,590 --> 03:43:49,800
but there's so much more that could come out of that.

5539
03:43:49,800 --> 03:43:51,540
And I'm hope, I'm always hopeful.

5540
03:43:51,540 --> 03:43:53,220
I'm an optimist in almost everything.

5541
03:43:53,220 --> 03:43:55,020
I think things can get better.

5542
03:43:55,020 --> 03:43:56,790
I think that they can improve things

5543
03:43:56,790 --> 03:43:58,350
that you go through a path

5544
03:43:58,350 --> 03:44:01,410
and you're learning kind of what does and doesn't work.

5545
03:44:01,410 --> 03:44:03,770
And I'm not ready to be fatalistic about

5546
03:44:03,770 --> 03:44:06,810
the kind of the outcome of any of that.

5547
03:44:06,810 --> 03:44:07,643
- Me neither.

5548
03:44:07,643 --> 03:44:10,560
I know too many good people inside of those large companies

5549
03:44:10,560 --> 03:44:11,560
that are incredible.

5550
03:44:12,420 --> 03:44:15,033
You have a friendship with Elon Musk,

5551
03:44:16,050 --> 03:44:17,340
often when I talk to him,

5552
03:44:17,340 --> 03:44:19,590
he'll bring up how incredible of an engineer

5553
03:44:19,590 --> 03:44:22,217
and just a big picture thinker you are,

5554
03:44:22,217 --> 03:44:26,250
he has a huge amount of respect for you.

5555
03:44:26,250 --> 03:44:28,890
I have never been a fly on the wall,

5556
03:44:28,890 --> 03:44:30,570
between the discussion between the two of you.

5557
03:44:30,570 --> 03:44:34,920
I just wonder, is there something you guys debate,

5558
03:44:34,920 --> 03:44:36,750
argue about, discuss?

5559
03:44:36,750 --> 03:44:38,250
Is there some interesting problems

5560
03:44:38,250 --> 03:44:41,190
that the two of you think about?

5561
03:44:41,190 --> 03:44:42,450
You come from different worlds.

5562
03:44:42,450 --> 03:44:45,840
Maybe there's some intersection in aerospace,

5563
03:44:45,840 --> 03:44:50,310
maybe there's some intersection in your new efforts

5564
03:44:50,310 --> 03:44:53,550
in artificial intelligence in terms of thinking.

5565
03:44:53,550 --> 03:44:54,383
Is there something interesting

5566
03:44:54,383 --> 03:44:56,400
you could say about sort of the debates

5567
03:44:56,400 --> 03:44:57,470
that two of you have?

5568
03:44:57,470 --> 03:44:58,511
- So, I think in some ways

5569
03:44:58,511 --> 03:45:01,260
we do have a kind of similar background

5570
03:45:01,260 --> 03:45:03,540
where we're almost exactly the same age

5571
03:45:03,540 --> 03:45:06,390
and we had kind of similar programming backgrounds

5572
03:45:06,390 --> 03:45:07,770
on the personal computers

5573
03:45:07,770 --> 03:45:10,620
and even some of the books that we would read

5574
03:45:10,620 --> 03:45:13,080
and things that would kind of turn us into the people

5575
03:45:13,080 --> 03:45:14,700
that we are today.

5576
03:45:14,700 --> 03:45:19,665
And I think there is a degree of sensibility similarities

5577
03:45:19,665 --> 03:45:22,920
where we kind of call bullshit on the same things

5578
03:45:22,920 --> 03:45:25,800
and kind of see the same opportunities

5579
03:45:25,800 --> 03:45:27,180
in different technology.

5580
03:45:27,180 --> 03:45:28,980
And there's that sense of,

5581
03:45:28,980 --> 03:45:31,560
I always talk about the speed of light solutions for things.

5582
03:45:31,560 --> 03:45:34,860
And he's thinking about kind of minimum manufacturing

5583
03:45:34,860 --> 03:45:38,970
and engineering and operational standpoints for things.

5584
03:45:38,970 --> 03:45:40,650
And so, I mean,

5585
03:45:40,650 --> 03:45:44,040
I first met Elon right at the start of the aerospace era

5586
03:45:44,040 --> 03:45:46,170
where I wasn't familiar with,

5587
03:45:46,170 --> 03:45:47,730
I was still in my game dev bubble.

5588
03:45:47,730 --> 03:45:49,830
I really wasn't familiar with all the startups

5589
03:45:49,830 --> 03:45:52,050
that were going and being successful

5590
03:45:52,050 --> 03:45:53,670
and what went on with PayPal

5591
03:45:53,670 --> 03:45:54,960
and all of his different companies.

5592
03:45:54,960 --> 03:45:58,890
But I met him as I was starting to do Armadillo Aerospace

5593
03:45:58,890 --> 03:46:03,090
and he came down with kind of his right hand propulsion guy.

5594
03:46:03,090 --> 03:46:07,260
And we talked about rockets what can we do with this?

5595
03:46:07,260 --> 03:46:09,900
And it was kind of specific things about like

5596
03:46:09,900 --> 03:46:12,120
how are our flight computers set up?

5597
03:46:12,120 --> 03:46:14,062
What are different propellant options?

5598
03:46:14,062 --> 03:46:17,580
What can happen with different ways

5599
03:46:17,580 --> 03:46:19,380
of putting things together?

5600
03:46:19,380 --> 03:46:21,210
And then in some ways,

5601
03:46:21,210 --> 03:46:22,860
he was certainly the biggest player

5602
03:46:22,860 --> 03:46:24,900
in the sort of alt space community

5603
03:46:24,900 --> 03:46:27,578
that was going on in the early 2000s.

5604
03:46:27,578 --> 03:46:31,140
He was the most well-funded, although,

5605
03:46:31,140 --> 03:46:33,965
his funding in the larger scheme of things compared to a,

5606
03:46:33,965 --> 03:46:38,250
like a NASA or something like that was really tiny.

5607
03:46:38,250 --> 03:46:40,633
It was a lot more than I had at the time.

5608
03:46:40,633 --> 03:46:42,630
But it was interesting.

5609
03:46:42,630 --> 03:46:45,570
I had a point years later when I realized,

5610
03:46:45,570 --> 03:46:48,870
okay, like my financial resources at this point

5611
03:46:48,870 --> 03:46:50,460
are basically what Elon's was

5612
03:46:50,460 --> 03:46:54,360
when he went all in on SpaceX and Tesla.

5613
03:46:54,360 --> 03:46:59,360
And I think in many corners he does not get the respect

5614
03:47:00,510 --> 03:47:03,330
that he should about being a wealthy person

5615
03:47:03,330 --> 03:47:04,980
that could just retire.

5616
03:47:04,980 --> 03:47:08,733
And he went all in where he was really going to,

5617
03:47:09,664 --> 03:47:11,400
he could have gone bust.

5618
03:47:11,400 --> 03:47:15,480
And there's plenty of people you look at the sad athletes

5619
03:47:15,480 --> 03:47:18,120
or entertainers that had all the money in the world

5620
03:47:18,120 --> 03:47:18,976
and blew it.

5621
03:47:18,976 --> 03:47:22,440
And he could have been the business case example of that.

5622
03:47:22,440 --> 03:47:25,440
But the things that he was doing,

5623
03:47:25,440 --> 03:47:29,505
space exploration, electrification of transportation,

5624
03:47:29,505 --> 03:47:34,505
solar city type things, these are big world level things.

5625
03:47:34,560 --> 03:47:36,810
And I have a great deal of admiration

5626
03:47:36,810 --> 03:47:38,730
that he was willing to throw himself

5627
03:47:38,730 --> 03:47:43,080
so completely into that because in contrast with myself,

5628
03:47:43,080 --> 03:47:46,704
I was doing Armadillo Aerospace with this tightly bounded,

5629
03:47:46,704 --> 03:47:49,560
it was John's crazy money at the time

5630
03:47:49,560 --> 03:47:51,420
that had a finite limit on it.

5631
03:47:51,420 --> 03:47:54,870
It was never going to impact me or my family

5632
03:47:54,870 --> 03:47:56,550
if it completely failed.

5633
03:47:56,550 --> 03:47:59,210
And I was still hedging my bets working

5634
03:47:59,210 --> 03:48:01,080
in software at the time

5635
03:48:01,080 --> 03:48:04,950
when he had been really all in there.

5636
03:48:04,950 --> 03:48:08,010
And I have a huge amount of respect for that.

5637
03:48:08,010 --> 03:48:09,117
And people do not,

5638
03:48:09,117 --> 03:48:11,490
the other thing I get irritated with is people that say

5639
03:48:11,490 --> 03:48:13,807
it's like, "Oh, Elon's just a business guy."

5640
03:48:13,807 --> 03:48:15,247
"He just got like,

5641
03:48:15,247 --> 03:48:16,417
"he was gifted the money

5642
03:48:16,417 --> 03:48:19,470
"and he's just kind of investing in all of this."

5643
03:48:19,470 --> 03:48:22,260
When he was really deeply involved

5644
03:48:22,260 --> 03:48:25,800
in a lot of the decisions, not all of 'em were perfect,

5645
03:48:25,800 --> 03:48:30,390
but he cared very much about engine material selection,

5646
03:48:30,390 --> 03:48:31,680
propellant selection.

5647
03:48:31,680 --> 03:48:35,010
And for years he'd be kind of telling me it's like,

5648
03:48:35,010 --> 03:48:37,020
get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff.

5649
03:48:37,020 --> 03:48:40,860
It's like liquid oxygen is the only proper oxidizer

5650
03:48:40,860 --> 03:48:41,850
for this.

5651
03:48:41,850 --> 03:48:46,140
And unlike the times that I've gone through the factories

5652
03:48:46,140 --> 03:48:47,010
with him,

5653
03:48:47,010 --> 03:48:50,190
we're talking very detailed things about like

5654
03:48:50,190 --> 03:48:51,840
how this weld is made,

5655
03:48:51,840 --> 03:48:53,826
how this subassembly goes together,

5656
03:48:53,826 --> 03:48:57,570
what are like startup shutdown behaviors

5657
03:48:57,570 --> 03:48:58,560
of the different things.

5658
03:48:58,560 --> 03:49:02,930
So, he is really in there at a very detailed level.

5659
03:49:02,930 --> 03:49:06,960
And I think that he is the best modern example now

5660
03:49:06,960 --> 03:49:08,550
of someone that tries to,

5661
03:49:08,550 --> 03:49:11,910
that can effectively micromanage some decisions on things,

5662
03:49:11,910 --> 03:49:15,060
on both Tesla and SpaceX to some degree

5663
03:49:15,060 --> 03:49:16,920
where he cares enough about it.

5664
03:49:16,920 --> 03:49:19,260
I worry a lot that he stretched too thin,

5665
03:49:19,260 --> 03:49:22,980
that you get Boring Company and Neuralink and Twitter

5666
03:49:22,980 --> 03:49:25,290
and all the other possible things there

5667
03:49:25,290 --> 03:49:27,248
where I know I've got,

5668
03:49:27,248 --> 03:49:30,810
I've got limits on how much I can pay attention to

5669
03:49:30,810 --> 03:49:34,020
that I have to kind of box off different amounts of time.

5670
03:49:34,020 --> 03:49:35,010
And I look back at like,

5671
03:49:35,010 --> 03:49:36,450
at my aerospace side of things,

5672
03:49:36,450 --> 03:49:38,400
it's like I did not go all in on that.

5673
03:49:38,400 --> 03:49:40,353
I did not commit myself at a level

5674
03:49:40,353 --> 03:49:43,500
that it would've taken to be successful there.

5675
03:49:43,500 --> 03:49:46,440
And yeah and it's kind of a weird thing,

5676
03:49:46,440 --> 03:49:49,020
just like having a discussion with him.

5677
03:49:49,020 --> 03:49:50,847
He's the richest man in the world right now.

5678
03:49:50,847 --> 03:49:55,847
But he operates on a level that is still very much

5679
03:49:57,000 --> 03:50:00,570
in my wheelhouse on a technical side of things.

5680
03:50:00,570 --> 03:50:02,460
- Doing that systems level type of thinking

5681
03:50:02,460 --> 03:50:04,890
where you can go to the low level details

5682
03:50:04,890 --> 03:50:07,410
and go up high to the big picture.

5683
03:50:07,410 --> 03:50:12,410
Do you think in aerospace arena in the next five, 10 years,

5684
03:50:14,490 --> 03:50:16,350
do you think we're gonna put a human on Mars?

5685
03:50:16,350 --> 03:50:20,250
Like what do you think is the interesting point.

5686
03:50:20,250 --> 03:50:23,040
- No, in fact, I made a bet with someone,

5687
03:50:23,040 --> 03:50:25,290
with a group of people kind of this about,

5688
03:50:25,290 --> 03:50:27,840
whether boots on Mars by 2030.

5689
03:50:27,840 --> 03:50:31,320
And this was kind of a fun story

5690
03:50:31,320 --> 03:50:34,140
because I was at an Intel sponsored event

5691
03:50:34,140 --> 03:50:37,380
and we had a bunch of just world class brilliant people

5692
03:50:37,380 --> 03:50:39,120
and we were talking about computing stuff,

5693
03:50:39,120 --> 03:50:41,520
but the after dinner conversation was like,

5694
03:50:41,520 --> 03:50:42,353
what are some other things?

5695
03:50:42,353 --> 03:50:43,920
How are they gonna go in the future?

5696
03:50:43,920 --> 03:50:46,710
And one of the ones tossed up on the whiteboard was like,

5697
03:50:46,710 --> 03:50:49,020
boots on Mars by 2030.

5698
03:50:49,020 --> 03:50:51,883
And most of the people in the room thought, yes.

5699
03:50:51,883 --> 03:50:54,450
They thought that like, SpaceX is kicking ass,

5700
03:50:54,450 --> 03:50:56,151
we've got all this possible stuff,

5701
03:50:56,151 --> 03:50:59,430
seems likely that it's gonna go that way.

5702
03:50:59,430 --> 03:51:03,270
And I said, no, I think less than 50% chance

5703
03:51:03,270 --> 03:51:05,430
that it's going to make it there.

5704
03:51:05,430 --> 03:51:07,237
And people were kind of like,

5705
03:51:07,237 --> 03:51:09,420
"Oh, why the pessimism or whatever."

5706
03:51:09,420 --> 03:51:12,030
And of course I'm an optimist at almost everything,

5707
03:51:12,030 --> 03:51:14,820
but for me to be the one kind of outlier saying,

5708
03:51:14,820 --> 03:51:16,505
no, I don't think so.

5709
03:51:16,505 --> 03:51:19,410
Then I started saying some of the things I said,

5710
03:51:19,410 --> 03:51:21,030
well, let's be concrete about it.

5711
03:51:21,030 --> 03:51:24,870
Let's bet $10,000 that it's not gonna happen.

5712
03:51:24,870 --> 03:51:29,790
And this was really a startling thing to see that I,

5713
03:51:29,790 --> 03:51:31,620
again, room full of brilliant people,

5714
03:51:31,620 --> 03:51:34,320
but as soon as like money came on the line

5715
03:51:34,320 --> 03:51:36,690
and they were like, do I wanna put $10,000 in?

5716
03:51:36,690 --> 03:51:38,439
I was not the richest person in the room.

5717
03:51:38,439 --> 03:51:41,280
There are people much better off than I was.

5718
03:51:41,280 --> 03:51:42,120
There's a spectrum.

5719
03:51:42,120 --> 03:51:45,570
But as soon as they started thinking it's like,

5720
03:51:45,570 --> 03:51:50,570
oh, I could lose money by keeping my position right now.

5721
03:51:50,730 --> 03:51:53,400
And all these engineers, they engaged their brain,

5722
03:51:53,400 --> 03:51:54,360
they started thinking it's like,

5723
03:51:54,360 --> 03:51:57,840
okay, launch windows, launch delays.

5724
03:51:57,840 --> 03:52:00,330
Like how many times would it take to get this right?

5725
03:52:00,330 --> 03:52:02,670
What historical precedents do we have?

5726
03:52:02,670 --> 03:52:05,790
And then it mostly came down to it's like,

5727
03:52:05,790 --> 03:52:08,007
well what about in transit by 2030?

5728
03:52:08,007 --> 03:52:10,860
And then what about I,

5729
03:52:10,860 --> 03:52:13,890
different things or would you hand would you go for 2032?

5730
03:52:13,890 --> 03:52:15,750
But one of the people did go ahead

5731
03:52:15,750 --> 03:52:18,300
and was optimistic enough to make a bet with me.

5732
03:52:18,300 --> 03:52:21,960
So, I have a $10,000 bet that by 2030,

5733
03:52:21,960 --> 03:52:24,390
I think it's gonna happen shortly thereafter.

5734
03:52:24,390 --> 03:52:25,980
I think there will probably be infrastructure

5735
03:52:25,980 --> 03:52:27,600
on Mars by 2030,

5736
03:52:27,600 --> 03:52:31,110
but I don't think that we'll have humans on Mars in 2030.

5737
03:52:31,110 --> 03:52:32,310
I think it's possible,

5738
03:52:32,310 --> 03:52:34,650
but I think it's less than a 50% chance.

5739
03:52:34,650 --> 03:52:36,720
So, I felt safe making that bet.

5740
03:52:36,720 --> 03:52:39,960
- Well I think you had an interesting point.

5741
03:52:39,960 --> 03:52:42,542
Correct me if I'm wrong, that's a dark one,

5742
03:52:42,542 --> 03:52:47,542
that should perhaps help people appreciate Elon Musk,

5743
03:52:48,780 --> 03:52:53,400
which is in this particular effort,

5744
03:52:53,400 --> 03:52:56,850
Elon is critical to the success.

5745
03:52:56,850 --> 03:53:01,850
SpaceX seems to be critical to 20th humans on Mars

5746
03:53:04,530 --> 03:53:07,050
by 2030 or thereabouts.

5747
03:53:07,050 --> 03:53:08,793
So, if something happens to Elon,

5748
03:53:10,500 --> 03:53:13,710
then all of this collapses.

5749
03:53:13,710 --> 03:53:17,460
- And this is in contrast to the the other $10,000 bet

5750
03:53:17,460 --> 03:53:18,630
I made kind of recently

5751
03:53:18,630 --> 03:53:20,700
and that was self-driving cars

5752
03:53:20,700 --> 03:53:23,370
at like a level five running around cities.

5753
03:53:23,370 --> 03:53:25,350
And people have kind of nitpicked that,

5754
03:53:25,350 --> 03:53:27,810
that we probably don't mean exactly level five,

5755
03:53:27,810 --> 03:53:31,500
but the guy I'm having the bet with is we're gonna be,

5756
03:53:31,500 --> 03:53:32,970
we know what we mean about this.

5757
03:53:32,970 --> 03:53:33,870
- [Lex] Jeff Atwood.

5758
03:53:33,870 --> 03:53:37,020
- Yeah, Coding horror and stack flow and all.

5759
03:53:37,020 --> 03:53:37,853
- [Lex] Yeah.

5760
03:53:37,853 --> 03:53:39,420
- But yeah, I mean it's just,

5761
03:53:39,420 --> 03:53:41,520
he doesn't think that people are gonna be riding

5762
03:53:41,520 --> 03:53:45,150
around in Robotaxis in 2030 in major cities.

5763
03:53:45,150 --> 03:53:47,580
Just like you take an Uber now

5764
03:53:47,580 --> 03:53:48,815
and think I think it will.

5765
03:53:48,815 --> 03:53:49,770
- [Lex] And you think you think it will.

5766
03:53:49,770 --> 03:53:51,480
- And the difference is everybody looks at this,

5767
03:53:51,480 --> 03:53:53,580
it's like, "Oh, but Tesla's been wrong for years."

5768
03:53:53,580 --> 03:53:56,520
They've been promising it for years and it's not here yet.

5769
03:53:56,520 --> 03:53:59,490
And the reason this is different than the bet

5770
03:53:59,490 --> 03:54:03,510
with Mars is Mars really is more than

5771
03:54:03,510 --> 03:54:06,960
is comfortable a bet on Elon Musk.

5772
03:54:06,960 --> 03:54:11,550
That is his thing and he is really going to move heaven

5773
03:54:11,550 --> 03:54:13,590
and earth to try to make that happen.

5774
03:54:13,590 --> 03:54:15,120
- And perhaps not even SpaceX.

5775
03:54:15,120 --> 03:54:18,000
- [John] Yeah. - Perhaps just Elon Musk.

5776
03:54:18,000 --> 03:54:21,780
- Yeah, because if Elon went away and SpaceX went public

5777
03:54:21,780 --> 03:54:23,279
and got a board of directors,

5778
03:54:23,279 --> 03:54:26,430
there are more profitable things they could be doing

5779
03:54:26,430 --> 03:54:29,520
than focusing on human presence on Mars.

5780
03:54:29,520 --> 03:54:32,790
So, this really is a sort of personal thing there.

5781
03:54:32,790 --> 03:54:34,890
And in contrast with that,

5782
03:54:34,890 --> 03:54:38,820
self-driving cars have a dozen credible companies,

5783
03:54:38,820 --> 03:54:40,650
working really hard.

5784
03:54:40,650 --> 03:54:42,420
And while yes,

5785
03:54:42,420 --> 03:54:45,660
it's going slower than most people thought it would,

5786
03:54:45,660 --> 03:54:48,090
betting against that is a bet against almost

5787
03:54:48,090 --> 03:54:49,260
the entire world

5788
03:54:49,260 --> 03:54:51,120
in terms of all of these companies

5789
03:54:51,120 --> 03:54:52,860
that have all of these incentives.

5790
03:54:52,860 --> 03:54:56,803
It's not just one guy's passion project.

5791
03:54:56,803 --> 03:54:59,850
And I do think that it is solvable.

5792
03:54:59,850 --> 03:55:01,290
Although I recognize

5793
03:55:01,290 --> 03:55:03,900
it's not a hundred percent chance because it's possible.

5794
03:55:03,900 --> 03:55:06,510
The long tail of self-driving problems winds up being

5795
03:55:06,510 --> 03:55:08,490
an AGI complete problem.

5796
03:55:08,490 --> 03:55:10,800
I think there's plenty of value to mine out of it

5797
03:55:10,800 --> 03:55:11,910
with narrow AI

5798
03:55:11,910 --> 03:55:13,830
and I think that it's going

5799
03:55:13,830 --> 03:55:16,530
to happen probably more so than people expect,

5800
03:55:16,530 --> 03:55:19,378
but it's that whole sigmoid curve where you over,

5801
03:55:19,378 --> 03:55:21,660
you overestimate the near term progress

5802
03:55:21,660 --> 03:55:23,940
and you underestimate the long-term progress.

5803
03:55:23,940 --> 03:55:26,397
And I think self-driving is gonna be like that.

5804
03:55:26,397 --> 03:55:29,880
And I think 2030 is still a pretty good bet.

5805
03:55:29,880 --> 03:55:34,350
- Yeah, unfortunately self-driving

5806
03:55:34,350 --> 03:55:38,070
is a problem that is safety critical.

5807
03:55:38,070 --> 03:55:42,655
Meaning that if you don't do it well, people get hurt.

5808
03:55:42,655 --> 03:55:46,440
- But the other side of that is people are terrible drivers.

5809
03:55:46,440 --> 03:55:48,180
So, it is not going to be,

5810
03:55:48,180 --> 03:55:49,560
that's probably gonna be the argument

5811
03:55:49,560 --> 03:55:50,970
that gets it through is like,

5812
03:55:50,970 --> 03:55:54,120
we can save 10,000 lives a year

5813
03:55:54,120 --> 03:55:56,820
by taking imperfect self-driving cars

5814
03:55:56,820 --> 03:55:57,870
and letting them take over

5815
03:55:57,870 --> 03:55:59,910
a lot of driving responsibilities.

5816
03:55:59,910 --> 03:56:02,520
It's like, was it 30,000 people a year die

5817
03:56:02,520 --> 03:56:04,830
in auto accidents right now in America?

5818
03:56:04,830 --> 03:56:06,930
And a lot of those are preventable.

5819
03:56:06,930 --> 03:56:08,580
And the problem is you'll have people

5820
03:56:08,580 --> 03:56:11,310
that every time a Tesla crashes into something,

5821
03:56:11,310 --> 03:56:12,360
you've got a bunch of people

5822
03:56:12,360 --> 03:56:14,970
that literally have vested interests shorting Tesla

5823
03:56:14,970 --> 03:56:17,460
to come out and make it the worst thing in the world.

5824
03:56:17,460 --> 03:56:19,440
And people will be fighting against that.

5825
03:56:19,440 --> 03:56:23,250
But optimist in me again, I think that we will have systems

5826
03:56:23,250 --> 03:56:26,280
that are statistically safer than human drivers

5827
03:56:26,280 --> 03:56:28,680
and we will be saving thousands

5828
03:56:28,680 --> 03:56:30,990
and thousands of lives every year

5829
03:56:30,990 --> 03:56:34,260
when we can hand over more of those responsibilities to it.

5830
03:56:34,260 --> 03:56:36,060
- I do still think as a person

5831
03:56:36,060 --> 03:56:38,520
who studied this problem very deeply

5832
03:56:38,520 --> 03:56:41,010
from a human side as well,

5833
03:56:41,010 --> 03:56:46,010
it's still an open problem how good/bad humans are driving.

5834
03:56:46,380 --> 03:56:49,500
It's a kind of funny thing we say about each other.

5835
03:56:49,500 --> 03:56:51,732
All humans suck at driving,

5836
03:56:51,732 --> 03:56:54,810
everybody except you, of course.

5837
03:56:54,810 --> 03:56:56,409
Like we think we're good at driving.

5838
03:56:56,409 --> 03:56:59,910
But after really studying it,

5839
03:56:59,910 --> 03:57:03,300
I think you start to notice,

5840
03:57:03,300 --> 03:57:05,700
'cause I've watched hundreds of hours

5841
03:57:05,700 --> 03:57:08,700
of humans driving with the projects of this kind of thing.

5842
03:57:08,700 --> 03:57:11,760
You've noticed that even with the distraction,

5843
03:57:11,760 --> 03:57:13,410
even with everything else,

5844
03:57:13,410 --> 03:57:17,790
humans are able to do some incredible things

5845
03:57:17,790 --> 03:57:19,380
with the attention.

5846
03:57:19,380 --> 03:57:21,120
Even when you're just looking at a smartphone,

5847
03:57:21,120 --> 03:57:22,916
just to get cues from the environment

5848
03:57:22,916 --> 03:57:26,760
to make less seconds decisions,

5849
03:57:26,760 --> 03:57:29,040
to use instinctual type of decisions

5850
03:57:29,040 --> 03:57:32,385
that actually save your ass time and time and time again

5851
03:57:32,385 --> 03:57:35,430
and are able to do that

5852
03:57:35,430 --> 03:57:37,980
with so much uncertainty around you

5853
03:57:37,980 --> 03:57:40,860
in such tricky dynamic environments.

5854
03:57:40,860 --> 03:57:42,030
I don't know,

5855
03:57:42,030 --> 03:57:46,380
I don't know exactly how hard is it

5856
03:57:46,380 --> 03:57:50,991
to beat that kind of skill of common sense reasoning.

5857
03:57:50,991 --> 03:57:52,740
- So, this is one of those interesting things

5858
03:57:52,740 --> 03:57:55,530
that there have been a lot of studies about how experts

5859
03:57:55,530 --> 03:57:58,650
in their field usually underestimate the progress

5860
03:57:58,650 --> 03:57:59,700
that's going to happen,

5861
03:57:59,700 --> 03:58:02,280
because an expert thinks about all the problems

5862
03:58:02,280 --> 03:58:03,870
they deal with and they're like,

5863
03:58:03,870 --> 03:58:06,360
damn, I'm gonna have a hard time solving all of this.

5864
03:58:06,360 --> 03:58:08,880
And they filter out the fact that they are one expert

5865
03:58:08,880 --> 03:58:10,620
in a field of thousands.

5866
03:58:10,620 --> 03:58:13,440
And you think about, yeah, I can't do all of that.

5867
03:58:13,440 --> 03:58:16,770
And you sometimes forget about the scope of the ecosystem

5868
03:58:16,770 --> 03:58:18,120
that you're embedded in.

5869
03:58:18,120 --> 03:58:19,710
And if you think back eight years,

5870
03:58:19,710 --> 03:58:22,590
very specifically the state of AI and machine learning,

5871
03:58:22,590 --> 03:58:23,900
where was that?

5872
03:58:23,900 --> 03:58:26,850
We had just gotten res nets probably at that point.

5873
03:58:26,850 --> 03:58:29,820
And you look at all the amazing magical things

5874
03:58:29,820 --> 03:58:31,470
that have happened in eight years

5875
03:58:31,470 --> 03:58:34,410
and they do kind of seem to be happening a little faster

5876
03:58:34,410 --> 03:58:36,000
in recent years also.

5877
03:58:36,000 --> 03:58:39,090
And you project that eight more years into the future

5878
03:58:39,090 --> 03:58:41,220
where again I think there's a 50% chance

5879
03:58:41,220 --> 03:58:43,860
we're gonna have signs of life of AGI,

5880
03:58:43,860 --> 03:58:46,410
which we can put through driver's ed if we need to,

5881
03:58:46,410 --> 03:58:48,720
to actually build self-driving cars.

5882
03:58:48,720 --> 03:58:50,820
And I think that the narrow systems are going

5883
03:58:50,820 --> 03:58:54,502
to have real value demonstrated well before then.

5884
03:58:54,502 --> 03:58:57,930
- So, signs of life in AGI,

5885
03:58:57,930 --> 03:59:02,550
you've mentioned that, okay, first of all,

5886
03:59:02,550 --> 03:59:04,980
you're one of the most brilliant people on this earth.

5887
03:59:04,980 --> 03:59:08,070
You could be solving a number of different problems,

5888
03:59:08,070 --> 03:59:09,390
as you've mentioned,

5889
03:59:09,390 --> 03:59:12,300
you mind was attracted to nuclear energy.

5890
03:59:12,300 --> 03:59:14,670
Obviously virtual reality with the metaverse

5891
03:59:14,670 --> 03:59:16,407
is something you could have a tremendous impact on.

5892
03:59:16,407 --> 03:59:19,200
- So, I do wanna say a quick thing about nuclear energy

5893
03:59:19,200 --> 03:59:21,660
where this is something that,

5894
03:59:21,660 --> 03:59:26,660
this so precisely feels like aerospace before SpaceX,

5895
03:59:27,240 --> 03:59:31,170
where from everything that I know about all of these,

5896
03:59:31,170 --> 03:59:33,480
the physics of this stuff hasn't changed.

5897
03:59:33,480 --> 03:59:36,630
And the reasons why things are expensive now

5898
03:59:36,630 --> 03:59:38,317
are not fundamental.

5899
03:59:38,317 --> 03:59:40,650
I somebody should be going

5900
03:59:40,650 --> 03:59:45,370
into a really hard Elon Musk style visions,

5901
03:59:46,470 --> 03:59:48,840
economical vision, not fusion,

5902
03:59:48,840 --> 03:59:53,010
where the fusion is the kind of the darling of people

5903
03:59:53,010 --> 03:59:54,570
that want to go and do nuclear,

5904
03:59:54,570 --> 03:59:57,210
because it doesn't have the taint that fission has

5905
03:59:57,210 --> 03:59:58,860
in a lot of people's minds.

5906
03:59:58,860 --> 04:00:02,160
But it's an almost absurdly complex thing

5907
04:00:02,160 --> 04:00:04,200
where nuclear fusion is,

5908
04:00:04,200 --> 04:00:05,880
you look at the tocomax

5909
04:00:05,880 --> 04:00:07,620
or any of the things that people are building

5910
04:00:07,620 --> 04:00:09,930
and it's doing all of this infrastructure,

5911
04:00:09,930 --> 04:00:12,533
just at the end of the day to make something hot,

5912
04:00:12,533 --> 04:00:14,760
so that you can then turn into energy,

5913
04:00:14,760 --> 04:00:17,010
through a conventional power plant

5914
04:00:17,010 --> 04:00:18,210
and all of that work,

5915
04:00:18,210 --> 04:00:20,640
which we think we've got line of sight on.

5916
04:00:20,640 --> 04:00:22,080
But even if it comes out,

5917
04:00:22,080 --> 04:00:25,020
then you have to do all of that immensely complex,

5918
04:00:25,020 --> 04:00:27,360
expensive stuff just to make something hot.

5919
04:00:27,360 --> 04:00:29,400
Where nuclear fission is basically,

5920
04:00:29,400 --> 04:00:30,990
you put these two rocks together

5921
04:00:30,990 --> 04:00:33,150
and they get hot all by themselves.

5922
04:00:33,150 --> 04:00:35,220
That is just that much simpler.

5923
04:00:35,220 --> 04:00:39,420
It's just orders of magnitude simpler and the actual rocks,

5924
04:00:39,420 --> 04:00:41,910
the refined uranium is not very expensive.

5925
04:00:41,910 --> 04:00:45,240
It's a couple percent of the cost of electricity.

5926
04:00:45,240 --> 04:00:47,640
That's why I made that point where you could have something

5927
04:00:47,640 --> 04:00:52,200
which was five times less efficient than current systems.

5928
04:00:52,200 --> 04:00:54,180
And if the rest of the plant was a whole bunch cheaper,

5929
04:00:54,180 --> 04:00:57,120
you could still be super, super valuable.

5930
04:00:57,120 --> 04:01:02,070
- So, how much of the pie do you think could be solved

5931
04:01:02,070 --> 04:01:04,440
by nuclear energy by fission?

5932
04:01:04,440 --> 04:01:07,380
So, how much could it become the primary source

5933
04:01:07,380 --> 04:01:08,850
of energy on earth?

5934
04:01:08,850 --> 04:01:10,050
- It could be most of it,

5935
04:01:10,050 --> 04:01:12,150
like the reserves of uranium as it stands now,

5936
04:01:12,150 --> 04:01:13,710
could not power the whole earth.

5937
04:01:13,710 --> 04:01:16,950
But you get into breeder reactors and thorium

5938
04:01:16,950 --> 04:01:19,890
and things like that that you do for conventional fission.

5939
04:01:19,890 --> 04:01:22,320
There is enough for everything.

5940
04:01:22,320 --> 04:01:25,412
Now, I mean, solar photovoltaic has been amazing.

5941
04:01:25,412 --> 04:01:29,940
One of my current projects is working on an off-grid system

5942
04:01:29,940 --> 04:01:31,440
and it's been fun just kind of, again,

5943
04:01:31,440 --> 04:01:33,870
putting my hands on all the stripping the wires

5944
04:01:33,870 --> 04:01:36,150
and wiring things together and doing all of that

5945
04:01:36,150 --> 04:01:38,130
and just having followed that a little bit

5946
04:01:38,130 --> 04:01:40,890
from the outside over the last couple decades,

5947
04:01:40,890 --> 04:01:44,310
there's been semiconductor like magical progress

5948
04:01:44,310 --> 04:01:45,990
in what's going on there.

5949
04:01:45,990 --> 04:01:48,030
So, I'm all for all of that,

5950
04:01:48,030 --> 04:01:49,590
but it doesn't solve everything

5951
04:01:49,590 --> 04:01:53,370
and nuclear really still does seem like the smart money bet

5952
04:01:53,370 --> 04:01:55,560
for what you should be getting for baseband

5953
04:01:55,560 --> 04:01:56,970
on a lot of things.

5954
04:01:56,970 --> 04:01:58,410
And solar may be cheaper

5955
04:01:58,410 --> 04:02:02,400
for peaking over air conditioning loads during the summer

5956
04:02:02,400 --> 04:02:05,310
and things that you can push around in different ways.

5957
04:02:05,310 --> 04:02:07,210
But it's one of those things that's,

5958
04:02:07,210 --> 04:02:09,030
it's just strange

5959
04:02:09,030 --> 04:02:10,980
how we've had the technology sitting there,

5960
04:02:10,980 --> 04:02:14,520
but these non-technical reasons on the social optics of it

5961
04:02:14,520 --> 04:02:19,290
has been this major forcing function for something that,

5962
04:02:19,290 --> 04:02:21,450
really should be at the cornerstone

5963
04:02:21,450 --> 04:02:24,150
of all of the world's concerns with energy.

5964
04:02:24,150 --> 04:02:27,540
It's interesting how the non-technical factors,

5965
04:02:27,540 --> 04:02:28,950
have really dominated something

5966
04:02:28,950 --> 04:02:31,980
that is so fundamental to kind of the existence

5967
04:02:31,980 --> 04:02:34,830
of the human race as we know it today.

5968
04:02:34,830 --> 04:02:36,510
- And much of the troubles of the world,

5969
04:02:36,510 --> 04:02:39,690
including wars in different parts of the world,

5970
04:02:39,690 --> 04:02:42,120
like Ukraine is energy based

5971
04:02:42,120 --> 04:02:45,573
and yeah, it's just sitting right there to be solved.

5972
04:02:47,520 --> 04:02:50,820
That said, I mean to me personally,

5973
04:02:50,820 --> 04:02:53,910
I think it's clear that if AGI were to be achieved,

5974
04:02:53,910 --> 04:02:56,100
that would change the course of human history.

5975
04:02:56,100 --> 04:02:57,626
- So, AGI wise,

5976
04:02:57,626 --> 04:03:00,450
I was making this decision about

5977
04:03:00,450 --> 04:03:03,780
what do I want to focus on after VR

5978
04:03:03,780 --> 04:03:06,390
and I'm still working on VR regularly.

5979
04:03:06,390 --> 04:03:09,180
I spend a day a week kind of consulting with Meta

5980
04:03:09,180 --> 04:03:13,620
and Boz styles me, the consulting CTO

5981
04:03:13,620 --> 04:03:15,840
is kind of like the Sherlock Holmes that comes in

5982
04:03:15,840 --> 04:03:18,840
and consults on some of the specific tough issues.

5983
04:03:18,840 --> 04:03:21,840
And I'm still pretty passionate about all of that,

5984
04:03:21,840 --> 04:03:25,110
but I have been figuring out how to compartmentalize

5985
04:03:25,110 --> 04:03:27,360
and force that into a smaller box

5986
04:03:27,360 --> 04:03:29,160
to work on some other things.

5987
04:03:29,160 --> 04:03:30,900
And I did come down to this decision,

5988
04:03:30,900 --> 04:03:34,530
between working on economical nuclear fission

5989
04:03:34,530 --> 04:03:37,050
or artificial general intelligence

5990
04:03:37,050 --> 04:03:39,210
and the fission side of things.

5991
04:03:39,210 --> 04:03:42,240
I've got a bunch of interesting things going that way.

5992
04:03:42,240 --> 04:03:44,070
But it would take,

5993
04:03:44,070 --> 04:03:46,440
that would be a fairly big project thing to do.

5994
04:03:46,440 --> 04:03:49,020
I don't think it's needs to be as big as people expect.

5995
04:03:49,020 --> 04:03:51,828
I do think something original SpaceX sized,

5996
04:03:51,828 --> 04:03:55,110
you build it, power your building off of it,

5997
04:03:55,110 --> 04:03:57,450
and then the government I think will come around

5998
04:03:57,450 --> 04:04:01,140
to what you need to, everybody loves an existence proof.

5999
04:04:01,140 --> 04:04:03,840
I think it's possible somebody should be doing this,

6000
04:04:03,840 --> 04:04:05,790
but it's gonna involve some politics.

6001
04:04:05,790 --> 04:04:08,040
It's going to involve decent sized teams

6002
04:04:08,040 --> 04:04:09,930
and a bunch of this cross-functional stuff

6003
04:04:09,930 --> 04:04:11,220
that I don't love.

6004
04:04:11,220 --> 04:04:15,665
While the artificial general intelligence side of things,

6005
04:04:15,665 --> 04:04:20,665
it seems to me like this is the highest leverage moment

6006
04:04:22,230 --> 04:04:24,660
for potentially a single individual,

6007
04:04:24,660 --> 04:04:26,490
potentially in the history of the world

6008
04:04:26,490 --> 04:04:30,090
where the things that we know about the brain,

6009
04:04:30,090 --> 04:04:32,907
about what we can do with artificial intelligence.

6010
04:04:32,907 --> 04:04:36,240
Nobody can say absolutely on any of these things,

6011
04:04:36,240 --> 04:04:41,010
but I am not a madman for saying that it is likely

6012
04:04:41,010 --> 04:04:44,220
that the code for artificial general intelligence

6013
04:04:44,220 --> 04:04:47,970
is going to be tens of thousands of lines of code,

6014
04:04:47,970 --> 04:04:50,010
not millions of lines of code.

6015
04:04:50,010 --> 04:04:53,460
This is code that conceivably one individual could write,

6016
04:04:53,460 --> 04:04:57,360
unlike writing a new web browser or operating system.

6017
04:04:57,360 --> 04:05:02,100
And based on the progress that AI machine learning has made

6018
04:05:02,100 --> 04:05:03,870
in the recent decade,

6019
04:05:03,870 --> 04:05:05,700
it's likely that the important things

6020
04:05:05,700 --> 04:05:08,700
that we don't know are relatively simple.

6021
04:05:08,700 --> 04:05:10,740
There's probably a handful of things

6022
04:05:10,740 --> 04:05:13,410
and my bet is that I think

6023
04:05:13,410 --> 04:05:17,760
there's less than six key insights that need to be made.

6024
04:05:17,760 --> 04:05:19,380
Each one of them can probably be written

6025
04:05:19,380 --> 04:05:20,940
on the back of an envelope.

6026
04:05:20,940 --> 04:05:22,500
We don't know what they are,

6027
04:05:22,500 --> 04:05:26,250
but when they're put together in concert with GPUs at scale

6028
04:05:26,250 --> 04:05:28,860
and the data that we all have access to,

6029
04:05:28,860 --> 04:05:32,880
that we can make something that behaves like a human being

6030
04:05:32,880 --> 04:05:34,860
or like a living creature

6031
04:05:34,860 --> 04:05:38,010
and that can then be educated in whatever ways

6032
04:05:38,010 --> 04:05:39,300
that we need to get to the point

6033
04:05:39,300 --> 04:05:42,360
where we can have universal remote workers

6034
04:05:42,360 --> 04:05:45,930
where anything that somebody does mediated by a computer

6035
04:05:45,930 --> 04:05:48,389
and doesn't require physical interaction

6036
04:05:48,389 --> 04:05:50,640
that an AGI will be able to do.

6037
04:05:50,640 --> 04:05:55,140
We can already simulate the equivalent of the Zoom meetings

6038
04:05:55,140 --> 04:05:59,010
with avatars and synthetic deepfakes and whatnot.

6039
04:05:59,010 --> 04:06:00,518
We can definitely do that.

6040
04:06:00,518 --> 04:06:04,110
We have superhuman capabilities on any narrow thing

6041
04:06:04,110 --> 04:06:08,100
that we can formalize and make a loss function for.

6042
04:06:08,100 --> 04:06:10,440
But there's things we don't know how to do now,

6043
04:06:10,440 --> 04:06:13,410
but I don't think they are unapproachable hard.

6044
04:06:13,410 --> 04:06:17,130
Now, that's incredibly hubristic to say that it's like,

6045
04:06:17,130 --> 04:06:19,650
but I think that what I said a couple years ago

6046
04:06:19,650 --> 04:06:22,080
is a 50% chance that somewhere

6047
04:06:22,080 --> 04:06:25,407
there will be signs of life of AGI in 2030

6048
04:06:25,407 --> 04:06:28,080
and I've probably increased that slightly.

6049
04:06:28,080 --> 04:06:30,630
I may be at 55, 60% now,

6050
04:06:30,630 --> 04:06:32,220
because I do think there's a little sense

6051
04:06:32,220 --> 04:06:34,620
of acceleration there.

6052
04:06:34,620 --> 04:06:35,453
- So, I wonder what the

6053
04:06:35,453 --> 04:06:38,310
and by the way you also written that,

6054
04:06:38,310 --> 04:06:42,120
I bet with hindsight we'll find that clear antecedents

6055
04:06:42,120 --> 04:06:45,030
of all the critical remaining steps for AGI

6056
04:06:45,030 --> 04:06:46,830
are already buried somewhere

6057
04:06:46,830 --> 04:06:48,450
in the vast literature of today.

6058
04:06:48,450 --> 04:06:51,090
So, the ideas are already there.

6059
04:06:51,090 --> 04:06:52,410
- I think that's likely the case.

6060
04:06:52,410 --> 04:06:54,570
One of the things that appeals to so many people,

6061
04:06:54,570 --> 04:06:56,910
including me about the promise of AGI

6062
04:06:56,910 --> 04:07:00,630
is we know that we're only drinking from a straw

6063
04:07:00,630 --> 04:07:03,510
from the fire hose of all the information out there.

6064
04:07:03,510 --> 04:07:07,410
I mean, you look at just in a very narrowly bounded field,

6065
04:07:07,410 --> 04:07:08,430
like machine learning,

6066
04:07:08,430 --> 04:07:10,140
like you can't read all the papers

6067
04:07:10,140 --> 04:07:11,700
that come out all the time.

6068
04:07:11,700 --> 04:07:14,280
You can't go back and read all the clever things

6069
04:07:14,280 --> 04:07:16,170
that people did in the '90s or earlier

6070
04:07:16,170 --> 04:07:17,520
that people have forgotten about,

6071
04:07:17,520 --> 04:07:19,080
because they didn't pan out at the time

6072
04:07:19,080 --> 04:07:21,643
when they were trying to do them with 12 neurons.

6073
04:07:21,643 --> 04:07:24,840
So that this idea that,

6074
04:07:24,840 --> 04:07:27,180
yeah, I think there are gems buried

6075
04:07:27,180 --> 04:07:28,650
in some of the older literature

6076
04:07:28,650 --> 04:07:31,080
that was not the path taken by everything.

6077
04:07:31,080 --> 04:07:33,600
And you can see a kind of herd mentality

6078
04:07:33,600 --> 04:07:35,130
on the things that happen right now.

6079
04:07:35,130 --> 04:07:36,690
It's almost funny to see,

6080
04:07:36,690 --> 04:07:38,010
it's like, oh, Google does something

6081
04:07:38,010 --> 04:07:40,530
and OpenAI does something and Meta does something

6082
04:07:40,530 --> 04:07:43,530
and they're the same people that all talk to each other

6083
04:07:43,530 --> 04:07:45,000
and they're all one-upping each other

6084
04:07:45,000 --> 04:07:47,880
and they're all capable of implementing each other's work,

6085
04:07:47,880 --> 04:07:50,070
given a month or two after somebody

6086
04:07:50,070 --> 04:07:51,930
has an announcement of that.

6087
04:07:51,930 --> 04:07:55,590
But there's a whole world of possible approaches

6088
04:07:55,590 --> 04:07:56,858
to machine learning

6089
04:07:56,858 --> 04:08:00,750
and I think that we probably will in hindsight go back

6090
04:08:00,750 --> 04:08:03,600
and see it's like, yeah, that was kind of clearly predicted

6091
04:08:03,600 --> 04:08:05,640
by this early paper here

6092
04:08:05,640 --> 04:08:08,520
and this turns out that if you do this and this

6093
04:08:08,520 --> 04:08:11,310
and take this result from animal training

6094
04:08:11,310 --> 04:08:13,380
and this thing from neuroscience over here

6095
04:08:13,380 --> 04:08:14,610
and put it together

6096
04:08:14,610 --> 04:08:17,490
and set up this curriculum for them to learn in,

6097
04:08:17,490 --> 04:08:19,800
that that's kind of what it took.

6098
04:08:19,800 --> 04:08:22,590
You don't have too many people now that are still saying

6099
04:08:22,590 --> 04:08:23,610
it's not possible

6100
04:08:23,610 --> 04:08:25,440
or it's gonna take hundreds of years

6101
04:08:25,440 --> 04:08:27,090
and 10 years ago you would get,

6102
04:08:27,090 --> 04:08:29,160
you would get a collection of experts

6103
04:08:29,160 --> 04:08:31,320
and you would have a decent chunk on the margin

6104
04:08:31,320 --> 04:08:33,510
that either say not possible

6105
04:08:33,510 --> 04:08:36,660
or couple hundred years, might be centuries.

6106
04:08:36,660 --> 04:08:40,650
And the median estimate would be like 50, 70 years.

6107
04:08:40,650 --> 04:08:41,850
And it's been coming down

6108
04:08:41,850 --> 04:08:44,160
and I know with me saying eight years for something

6109
04:08:44,160 --> 04:08:46,200
that still puts me on the optimistic side,

6110
04:08:46,200 --> 04:08:49,230
but it's not crazy out in the fringes.

6111
04:08:49,230 --> 04:08:51,990
And just being able to look at that a Meta level,

6112
04:08:51,990 --> 04:08:55,860
about the trend of the trend of the predictions,

6113
04:08:55,860 --> 04:08:57,150
going down there,

6114
04:08:57,150 --> 04:09:01,890
the idea that something could be happening relatively soon.

6115
04:09:01,890 --> 04:09:04,890
Now, I do not believe in fast takeoffs.

6116
04:09:04,890 --> 04:09:06,690
That's one of the safety issues that people say.

6117
04:09:06,690 --> 04:09:08,040
It's like, oh, it's gonna go foom

6118
04:09:08,040 --> 04:09:10,320
and the AI's gonna take over the world.

6119
04:09:10,320 --> 04:09:11,430
There's a lot of reasons

6120
04:09:11,430 --> 04:09:14,370
I don't think that's a credible position.

6121
04:09:14,370 --> 04:09:16,830
And I think that we will go from a point

6122
04:09:16,830 --> 04:09:20,790
where we start seeing things that credibly look like,

6123
04:09:20,790 --> 04:09:22,380
look like animals behaviors

6124
04:09:22,380 --> 04:09:25,407
and have a human voice box wired into them.

6125
04:09:25,407 --> 04:09:27,690
It's like, I tried to get Elon to say,

6126
04:09:27,690 --> 04:09:29,250
it's like, you're your pig at neuralink.

6127
04:09:29,250 --> 04:09:30,480
Give it a human voice box

6128
04:09:30,480 --> 04:09:33,240
and let it start learning human words.

6129
04:09:33,240 --> 04:09:34,453
I think that,

6130
04:09:34,453 --> 04:09:37,118
I think animal intelligence is closer

6131
04:09:37,118 --> 04:09:39,000
to human intelligence than a lot of people like to think.

6132
04:09:39,000 --> 04:09:40,620
And I think that culture

6133
04:09:40,620 --> 04:09:42,150
and modalities of IO

6134
04:09:42,150 --> 04:09:45,990
are make the Gulf seem a lot bigger than it actually is.

6135
04:09:45,990 --> 04:09:49,080
There's just that smooth spectrum of how the brain developed

6136
04:09:49,080 --> 04:09:53,250
and cortexes and scaling of different things going on there.

6137
04:09:53,250 --> 04:09:56,553
- Cultural modalities of IO, yes languages,

6138
04:09:57,720 --> 04:10:00,270
the sort of loss in translation,

6139
04:10:00,270 --> 04:10:02,100
conceals a lot of intelligence.

6140
04:10:02,100 --> 04:10:06,720
And so when you're thinking about signs of life or AGI,

6141
04:10:06,720 --> 04:10:10,560
you're thinking about human interpretable signs.

6142
04:10:10,560 --> 04:10:11,490
- So, the example I give,

6143
04:10:11,490 --> 04:10:12,510
if we get to the point

6144
04:10:12,510 --> 04:10:15,420
where you've got a learning disabled toddler,

6145
04:10:15,420 --> 04:10:18,180
some kind of real special needs child

6146
04:10:18,180 --> 04:10:20,880
that can still interact with their favorite TV show

6147
04:10:20,880 --> 04:10:23,430
and video game and can be trained

6148
04:10:23,430 --> 04:10:27,030
and learn in some appreciably human-like way,

6149
04:10:27,030 --> 04:10:30,690
at that point you can deploy an army of engineers,

6150
04:10:30,690 --> 04:10:35,310
cognitive scientists, developmental education people

6151
04:10:35,310 --> 04:10:37,500
and you've got so many advantages there.

6152
04:10:37,500 --> 04:10:39,900
Unlike real education where you can do rollbacks

6153
04:10:39,900 --> 04:10:40,860
and AB testing

6154
04:10:40,860 --> 04:10:43,050
and you can find a golden path through a curriculum

6155
04:10:43,050 --> 04:10:44,178
of different things.

6156
04:10:44,178 --> 04:10:47,430
If you get to that point learning disabled toddler,

6157
04:10:47,430 --> 04:10:50,790
I think that it's gonna be a done deal.

6158
04:10:50,790 --> 04:10:53,580
- But do you think we'll know it when we see it?

6159
04:10:53,580 --> 04:10:56,010
So, there's been a lot

6160
04:10:56,010 --> 04:10:58,860
of really interesting general learning progress

6161
04:10:58,860 --> 04:11:02,033
from DeepMind, OpenAI a little bit too.

6162
04:11:02,033 --> 04:11:06,510
I tend to believe that Tesla autopilot,

6163
04:11:06,510 --> 04:11:09,030
deserves a lot more credit than is getting

6164
04:11:09,030 --> 04:11:12,270
for making progress on the general,

6165
04:11:12,270 --> 04:11:15,420
on sort of on doing the multitask learning thing

6166
04:11:15,420 --> 04:11:17,580
and increasing the number of tasks

6167
04:11:17,580 --> 04:11:22,580
and automating that process of sort of learning

6168
04:11:23,580 --> 04:11:25,260
from discovering the edge cases

6169
04:11:25,260 --> 04:11:26,869
and learning from the edge cases.

6170
04:11:26,869 --> 04:11:30,300
It's really approaching from a different angle,

6171
04:11:30,300 --> 04:11:33,180
the general learning problem of AGI,

6172
04:11:33,180 --> 04:11:36,090
but the more clear approach comes from DeepMind

6173
04:11:36,090 --> 04:11:38,190
where you have these kind of game situations

6174
04:11:38,190 --> 04:11:41,070
and you build systems there,

6175
04:11:41,070 --> 04:11:45,363
but I don't know, people seem to be quite.

6176
04:11:47,550 --> 04:11:48,870
- Yes, there will always be people

6177
04:11:48,870 --> 04:11:52,200
that just won't believe it and I fundamentally don't care.

6178
04:11:52,200 --> 04:11:54,310
I mean, I don't care if they don't believe it.

6179
04:11:54,310 --> 04:11:57,597
When it starts doing people's jobs and I mean,

6180
04:11:57,597 --> 04:12:00,123
I don't care about the philosophical zombie argument at all.

6181
04:12:00,123 --> 04:12:01,830
- Yes, absolutely, absolutely.

6182
04:12:01,830 --> 04:12:04,320
But do you think you will notice

6183
04:12:04,320 --> 04:12:06,510
that something special has happened here

6184
04:12:06,510 --> 04:12:10,470
and or because to me,

6185
04:12:10,470 --> 04:12:12,750
I've been noticing a lot of special things.

6186
04:12:12,750 --> 04:12:16,260
I think, you know, a lot of credit should go to DeepMind

6187
04:12:16,260 --> 04:12:20,640
for Alpha Zero that was truly special

6188
04:12:20,640 --> 04:12:24,570
through self play mechanisms achieve sort of solve problems

6189
04:12:24,570 --> 04:12:29,280
that used be thought unsolvable, like the game of go also,

6190
04:12:29,280 --> 04:12:32,640
I mean, protein folding starting to get into that space

6191
04:12:32,640 --> 04:12:34,890
where learning is doing.

6192
04:12:34,890 --> 04:12:37,410
At first, there's not, it wasn't end-to-end learning.

6193
04:12:37,410 --> 04:12:39,870
And so now it's end-to-end learning

6194
04:12:39,870 --> 04:12:43,770
of a very difficult previously thought unsolvable problem

6195
04:12:43,770 --> 04:12:45,450
of protein folding.

6196
04:12:45,450 --> 04:12:47,994
And so yeah,

6197
04:12:47,994 --> 04:12:52,994
where do you think would be a really magical moment for you?

6198
04:12:54,660 --> 04:12:56,730
- There have been incredible things happening

6199
04:12:56,730 --> 04:12:57,570
in recent years.

6200
04:12:57,570 --> 04:12:58,950
Like you say, all of the things

6201
04:12:58,950 --> 04:13:01,710
from DeepMind, OpenAI that have been

6202
04:13:01,710 --> 04:13:04,257
huge showpiece things, but when you really get down to it

6203
04:13:04,257 --> 04:13:05,610
and you read the papers

6204
04:13:05,610 --> 04:13:08,197
and you look at the way the models are going,

6205
04:13:08,197 --> 04:13:10,620
it's still like a feed forward.

6206
04:13:10,620 --> 04:13:13,483
You push something in, something comes out on the end,

6207
04:13:13,483 --> 04:13:15,510
I mean maybe there's diffusion models

6208
04:13:15,510 --> 04:13:18,720
or Monte Carlo tree rollouts and different things going on,

6209
04:13:18,720 --> 04:13:21,990
but it's not a being, it's not close to a being

6210
04:13:21,990 --> 04:13:26,990
that's going through a lifelong learning process.

6211
04:13:26,990 --> 04:13:30,960
- So you want something that kind of gives signs of a being,

6212
04:13:30,960 --> 04:13:35,960
like what's the difference between a neural network,

6213
04:13:36,540 --> 04:13:39,562
a feedforward neural network and a being?

6214
04:13:39,562 --> 04:13:43,530
- So fundamentally, the brain is a recurrent neural network

6215
04:13:43,530 --> 04:13:45,210
generating an action policy.

6216
04:13:45,210 --> 04:13:47,700
I mean, it's implemented on a biological substrate.

6217
04:13:47,700 --> 04:13:49,376
And it's interesting thinking about things like that

6218
04:13:49,376 --> 04:13:51,540
where we know fundamentally the brain

6219
04:13:51,540 --> 04:13:55,320
is not a convolutional neural network or a transformer.

6220
04:13:55,320 --> 04:13:58,260
Those are specialized things that are very valuable

6221
04:13:58,260 --> 04:13:59,093
for what we're doing,

6222
04:13:59,093 --> 04:14:00,330
but it's not the way the brain's doing.

6223
04:14:00,330 --> 04:14:02,430
Now, I do think consciousness

6224
04:14:02,430 --> 04:14:06,810
and AI in general is a substrate independent mechanism

6225
04:14:06,810 --> 04:14:07,710
where it doesn't have

6226
04:14:07,710 --> 04:14:09,600
to be implemented the way the brain is.

6227
04:14:09,600 --> 04:14:11,790
But if you've only got one existence proof,

6228
04:14:11,790 --> 04:14:13,500
there's certainly some value

6229
04:14:13,500 --> 04:14:16,169
in caring about what it says and does.

6230
04:14:16,169 --> 04:14:20,430
And so the idea that anything that can be done

6231
04:14:20,430 --> 04:14:23,790
with a narrow AI that you can quantify up a loss function

6232
04:14:23,790 --> 04:14:26,790
for or reward mechanism, you're almost certainly going

6233
04:14:26,790 --> 04:14:28,320
to be able to produce something

6234
04:14:28,320 --> 04:14:31,530
that's more resource effective to train and deploy

6235
04:14:31,530 --> 04:14:33,360
and use in an inference mode,

6236
04:14:33,360 --> 04:14:35,010
train a whole lot using an inference.

6237
04:14:35,010 --> 04:14:37,890
But a living being is gonna be something

6238
04:14:37,890 --> 04:14:42,870
that's a continuous, lifelong learned, task agnostic thing.

6239
04:14:42,870 --> 04:14:44,430
And while lot.

6240
04:14:44,430 --> 04:14:46,560
- So the lifelong learning is really important too,

6241
04:14:46,560 --> 04:14:48,750
and the long-term memory.

6242
04:14:48,750 --> 04:14:51,930
So memory is a big weird part of that puzzle.

6243
04:14:51,930 --> 04:14:53,700
- We've got and again,

6244
04:14:53,700 --> 04:14:56,220
I have all the respect in the world for the amazing things

6245
04:14:56,220 --> 04:14:57,270
that are being done now,

6246
04:14:57,270 --> 04:15:00,510
but sometimes they can be taken a little bit out of context

6247
04:15:00,510 --> 04:15:04,020
with things like there's some smoke and mirrors going on,

6248
04:15:04,020 --> 04:15:05,670
like the gato, the recent work,

6249
04:15:05,670 --> 04:15:08,550
the multitask learning stuff, it's amazing

6250
04:15:08,550 --> 04:15:10,320
that it's one model

6251
04:15:10,320 --> 04:15:12,990
that plays all the Atari games I am as well

6252
04:15:12,990 --> 04:15:14,820
as doing all of these other things.

6253
04:15:14,820 --> 04:15:17,640
But of course it didn't learn to do all of those.

6254
04:15:17,640 --> 04:15:19,530
It was instructed in doing that

6255
04:15:19,530 --> 04:15:21,330
by other reinforcement learners

6256
04:15:21,330 --> 04:15:23,010
going through and doing that.

6257
04:15:23,010 --> 04:15:25,950
And even in the case of all the games, it's still going

6258
04:15:25,950 --> 04:15:29,430
with a specific hand-coded reward function in each

6259
04:15:29,430 --> 04:15:32,790
of those Atari games where it's not that, how does it?

6260
04:15:32,790 --> 04:15:35,490
It just wants to spend its summer afternoon playing Atari

6261
04:15:35,490 --> 04:15:37,860
because that's the most interesting thing for it.

6262
04:15:37,860 --> 04:15:39,900
So it's, again, not a general,

6263
04:15:39,900 --> 04:15:42,150
it's not learning the way humans learn.

6264
04:15:42,150 --> 04:15:45,450
And there's, I believe a lot of things that are challenging

6265
04:15:45,450 --> 04:15:48,109
to make a loss function for that you can train

6266
04:15:48,109 --> 04:15:50,657
through these existing conventional things.

6267
04:15:50,657 --> 04:15:54,071
We are gonna chip away at all the things that people do

6268
04:15:54,071 --> 04:15:58,770
that we can turn into narrow AI problems.

6269
04:15:58,770 --> 04:16:01,280
And billions, probably trillions of dollars

6270
04:16:01,280 --> 04:16:03,930
of value are gonna be created by that.

6271
04:16:03,930 --> 04:16:05,820
But there's still gonna be a set of things.

6272
04:16:05,820 --> 04:16:08,880
And we've got questionable cases like the self-driving car

6273
04:16:08,880 --> 04:16:11,640
where it's possible, it's not my bet,

6274
04:16:11,640 --> 04:16:13,140
but it's plausible

6275
04:16:13,140 --> 04:16:15,240
that the long tail could be problematic enough

6276
04:16:15,240 --> 04:16:16,890
that that really does require

6277
04:16:16,890 --> 04:16:19,606
a full on artificial general intelligence.

6278
04:16:19,606 --> 04:16:22,650
The counter argument is that data solves almost every,

6279
04:16:22,650 --> 04:16:24,210
everything's an interpolation problem

6280
04:16:24,210 --> 04:16:25,500
if you have enough data.

6281
04:16:25,500 --> 04:16:27,993
And Tesla may be able to get enough data

6282
04:16:27,993 --> 04:16:30,120
from all of their deployed stuff to be able

6283
04:16:30,120 --> 04:16:32,400
to work like that, but maybe not.

6284
04:16:32,400 --> 04:16:34,410
And there are all the other problems about,

6285
04:16:34,410 --> 04:16:36,720
like say you want to have a strategy meeting

6286
04:16:36,720 --> 04:16:37,830
and you want to go ahead

6287
04:16:37,830 --> 04:16:41,190
and bring in all of your remote workers and your consultants

6288
04:16:41,190 --> 04:16:44,100
and you want a world where some of those could be AIs

6289
04:16:44,100 --> 04:16:47,850
that are talking and interacting with you

6290
04:16:47,850 --> 04:16:49,950
in an area that is too murky

6291
04:16:49,950 --> 04:16:51,990
to have a crisp loss function.

6292
04:16:51,990 --> 04:16:54,581
But they still have things that on some level,

6293
04:16:54,581 --> 04:16:57,000
they're rewarded on some internal level

6294
04:16:57,000 --> 04:17:00,870
for building a valuable to humans kind of life

6295
04:17:00,870 --> 04:17:02,883
and ability to interact with things.

6296
04:17:03,750 --> 04:17:07,470
- See, I still think that self-driving cars solving

6297
04:17:07,470 --> 04:17:09,840
that problem will take us very far towards AGI.

6298
04:17:09,840 --> 04:17:11,439
You might not need AGI,

6299
04:17:11,439 --> 04:17:15,990
but I am really inspired by what Autopilot is doing.

6300
04:17:15,990 --> 04:17:19,230
Waymo, so some of the other companies,

6301
04:17:19,230 --> 04:17:22,140
I think Waymo leads the way there

6302
04:17:22,140 --> 04:17:23,430
is also really interesting,

6303
04:17:23,430 --> 04:17:26,850
but they don't have quite as ambitious of an effort in terms

6304
04:17:26,850 --> 04:17:31,470
of learning based sort of data hungry approach

6305
04:17:31,470 --> 04:17:34,650
to driving, which I think is very close to the kind of thing

6306
04:17:34,650 --> 04:17:37,267
that would take us far towards AGI.

6307
04:17:37,267 --> 04:17:39,030
- Yeah, and it's a funny thing

6308
04:17:39,030 --> 04:17:40,620
because as far as I can tell,

6309
04:17:40,620 --> 04:17:42,410
Elon is completely serious about all

6310
04:17:42,410 --> 04:17:46,140
of his concerns about AGI being an existential threat.

6311
04:17:46,140 --> 04:17:48,647
And I tried to draw him out to talk about AI

6312
04:17:48,647 --> 04:17:50,580
and he just didn't want to.

6313
04:17:50,580 --> 04:17:52,530
And I think that,

6314
04:17:52,530 --> 04:17:54,840
I get that little fatalistic sense from him and it's weird

6315
04:17:54,840 --> 04:17:58,320
because his company could very well be the leading company.

6316
04:17:58,320 --> 04:17:59,790
Leading towards a lot of that,

6317
04:17:59,790 --> 04:18:03,780
where Tesla being a super pragmatic company

6318
04:18:03,780 --> 04:18:04,740
that's doing things

6319
04:18:04,740 --> 04:18:06,870
because they really wanna solve this actual problem.

6320
04:18:06,870 --> 04:18:10,290
It's different vibe than the research oriented companies

6321
04:18:10,290 --> 04:18:12,540
where it's a great time to be an AI researcher.

6322
04:18:12,540 --> 04:18:14,400
You've got your pick of trillion dollar companies

6323
04:18:14,400 --> 04:18:16,170
that will pay you to kind

6324
04:18:16,170 --> 04:18:18,330
of work on the problems you're interested in.

6325
04:18:18,330 --> 04:18:20,880
But that's not necessarily driving hard towards

6326
04:18:20,880 --> 04:18:23,820
the core problem of AGI as something

6327
04:18:23,820 --> 04:18:26,311
that's going to produce a lot of value by doing things

6328
04:18:26,311 --> 04:18:29,613
that people currently do or would like to do.

6329
04:18:30,600 --> 04:18:33,324
- I mean, I have a million questions to you

6330
04:18:33,324 --> 04:18:35,397
about your ideas about AGI,

6331
04:18:35,397 --> 04:18:39,180
but do you think it needs to be embodied?

6332
04:18:39,180 --> 04:18:41,610
Do you think it needs to have a body to start

6333
04:18:41,610 --> 04:18:44,697
to notice the signs of life

6334
04:18:44,697 --> 04:18:49,170
and to develop the kind of system that's able to reason,

6335
04:18:49,170 --> 04:18:51,540
perceive the world in the way that an AGI should

6336
04:18:51,540 --> 04:18:53,130
and act in the world?

6337
04:18:53,130 --> 04:18:55,380
So should we be thinking about robots

6338
04:18:55,380 --> 04:18:58,113
or can this be achieved in a purely digital system?

6339
04:18:58,113 --> 04:18:59,970
- So I have a clear opinion on that

6340
04:18:59,970 --> 04:19:02,550
and that's that, no, it does not need

6341
04:19:02,550 --> 04:19:04,350
to be embodied in the physical world

6342
04:19:04,350 --> 04:19:07,110
where you could say most of my career

6343
04:19:07,110 --> 04:19:09,780
is about making simulated virtual worlds.

6344
04:19:09,780 --> 04:19:12,000
You know, in games or virtual reality.

6345
04:19:12,000 --> 04:19:14,490
And so on a fundamental level, I believe

6346
04:19:14,490 --> 04:19:17,000
that you can make a simulated environment that provides much

6347
04:19:17,000 --> 04:19:20,130
of the value of what the real environment does.

6348
04:19:20,130 --> 04:19:21,345
And restricting yourself

6349
04:19:21,345 --> 04:19:24,360
to operating at real time in the physical world

6350
04:19:24,360 --> 04:19:27,780
with physical objects, I think is an enormous handicap.

6351
04:19:27,780 --> 04:19:30,060
I mean, that's one of the real lessons driven home

6352
04:19:30,060 --> 04:19:34,590
by all my aerospace work is that reality

6353
04:19:34,590 --> 04:19:36,240
is a bitch in so many ways there,

6354
04:19:36,240 --> 04:19:38,310
where dealing with all the mechanical components,

6355
04:19:38,310 --> 04:19:40,500
like everything fails Murphy's Law,

6356
04:19:40,500 --> 04:19:42,600
even if you've done it right before on your fifth one,

6357
04:19:42,600 --> 04:19:44,310
it might come out differently.

6358
04:19:44,310 --> 04:19:46,830
So yeah, I think that anybody

6359
04:19:46,830 --> 04:19:50,400
that is all in on the embodied aspect of it,

6360
04:19:50,400 --> 04:19:53,310
they are tying a huge weight to their ankles.

6361
04:19:53,310 --> 04:19:57,840
And I think that I would almost count them out, anybody

6362
04:19:57,840 --> 04:20:00,150
that's making that a cornerstone of their belief about it,

6363
04:20:00,150 --> 04:20:01,530
I would almost write them off

6364
04:20:01,530 --> 04:20:04,890
as being worried about them getting to AGI first,

6365
04:20:04,890 --> 04:20:09,210
I was very surprised that Elon's big on the humanoid robots.

6366
04:20:09,210 --> 04:20:11,610
I mean like the NASA robot stuff was always

6367
04:20:11,610 --> 04:20:12,780
almost a gag line.

6368
04:20:12,780 --> 04:20:14,313
Like, what are you doing people?

6369
04:20:14,313 --> 04:20:15,630
- Well that's very interesting

6370
04:20:15,630 --> 04:20:18,180
'cause he has a very pragmatic view of that.

6371
04:20:18,180 --> 04:20:21,360
That's just a way

6372
04:20:21,360 --> 04:20:23,580
to solve a particular problem in a factory.

6373
04:20:23,580 --> 04:20:27,270
- Now I do think that once you have an AGI, robotic bodies,

6374
04:20:27,270 --> 04:20:30,000
humanoid bodies are going to be enormously valuable.

6375
04:20:30,000 --> 04:20:32,043
I just don't think they're helpful getting to AGI.

6376
04:20:32,043 --> 04:20:34,860
- Well he has a very sort of practical view,

6377
04:20:34,860 --> 04:20:37,140
which I disagree with and argue with him,

6378
04:20:37,140 --> 04:20:39,690
but it's a practical view that there's,

6379
04:20:39,690 --> 04:20:43,200
you could transfer the problem of driving

6380
04:20:43,200 --> 04:20:47,100
to the problem of robotic manipulation

6381
04:20:47,100 --> 04:20:49,920
because so much of it is perception.

6382
04:20:49,920 --> 04:20:51,360
It's perception and action,

6383
04:20:51,360 --> 04:20:53,370
and it's just a different context.

6384
04:20:53,370 --> 04:20:55,350
And so you can apply all the same kind

6385
04:20:55,350 --> 04:20:58,740
of data engine learning processes

6386
04:20:58,740 --> 04:20:59,880
to a different environment.

6387
04:20:59,880 --> 04:21:01,620
And so why not you apply it

6388
04:21:01,620 --> 04:21:03,480
to the humanoid robot environment?

6389
04:21:03,480 --> 04:21:08,480
But I think I do think that there's a certain magic

6390
04:21:10,320 --> 04:21:11,913
to the embodied robot.

6391
04:21:12,810 --> 04:21:15,360
- That may be the thing that finally convinces people.

6392
04:21:15,360 --> 04:21:16,247
- Yes.

6393
04:21:16,247 --> 04:21:17,080
- But again, I don't really care

6394
04:21:17,080 --> 04:21:18,720
that much about convincing people.

6395
04:21:18,720 --> 04:21:20,790
You know, the world that I'm looking towards

6396
04:21:20,790 --> 04:21:24,240
is you go to the website

6397
04:21:24,240 --> 04:21:28,200
and say, I want five frank one A's to work on my team today.

6398
04:21:28,200 --> 04:21:29,250
And they all spin up

6399
04:21:29,250 --> 04:21:31,157
and they start showing up in your Zoom meetings.

6400
04:21:31,157 --> 04:21:33,600
- To push back, but also to agree with you.

6401
04:21:33,600 --> 04:21:34,620
But first to push back.

6402
04:21:34,620 --> 04:21:38,310
I do think you need to convince people for them to welcome

6403
04:21:38,310 --> 04:21:40,920
that thing into their life.

6404
04:21:40,920 --> 04:21:42,330
- I think there's enough businesses

6405
04:21:42,330 --> 04:21:44,310
that operate on an objective,

6406
04:21:44,310 --> 04:21:46,553
kind of profit loss sort of basis that,

6407
04:21:46,553 --> 04:21:49,140
I mean, if you look at how many things,

6408
04:21:49,140 --> 04:21:50,700
again, talking about the world

6409
04:21:50,700 --> 04:21:52,740
as an evolutionary space there,

6410
04:21:52,740 --> 04:21:54,510
when you do have free markets

6411
04:21:54,510 --> 04:21:57,510
and you have entrepreneurs, you are gonna have people

6412
04:21:57,510 --> 04:21:58,590
that are gonna be willing to go out

6413
04:21:58,590 --> 04:22:00,840
and try whatever crazy things.

6414
04:22:00,840 --> 04:22:03,240
And when it proves to be beneficial,

6415
04:22:03,240 --> 04:22:06,060
there's fast followers in all sorts of places.

6416
04:22:06,060 --> 04:22:09,030
- Yeah and you're saying that, I mean,

6417
04:22:09,030 --> 04:22:11,940
Quake and VR is a kind of embodiment,

6418
04:22:11,940 --> 04:22:13,677
but just in a digital world

6419
04:22:13,677 --> 04:22:16,320
and if you're able to demonstrate,

6420
04:22:16,320 --> 04:22:18,120
if you're able to do something productive

6421
04:22:18,120 --> 04:22:21,183
in that kind of digital reality,

6422
04:22:22,950 --> 04:22:25,980
then AGI doesn't need to have a body.

6423
04:22:25,980 --> 04:22:26,813
- Yeah, it's like one

6424
04:22:26,813 --> 04:22:28,620
of the really practical technical questions

6425
04:22:28,620 --> 04:22:31,530
that I kind of keep arguing with myself over.

6426
04:22:31,530 --> 04:22:33,720
If you're doing a training and learning

6427
04:22:33,720 --> 04:22:35,880
and you've got, like, you can watch Sesame Street

6428
04:22:35,880 --> 04:22:38,370
and you can play master system games or something,

6429
04:22:38,370 --> 04:22:41,190
is it enough to have just a video feed that,

6430
04:22:41,190 --> 04:22:43,050
is that video coming in

6431
04:22:43,050 --> 04:22:46,320
or should it literally be on a virtual TV set

6432
04:22:46,320 --> 04:22:49,980
in a virtual room, even if it's a simple room just to have

6433
04:22:49,980 --> 04:22:52,950
that sense of you're looking at a 2D projection on a screen

6434
04:22:52,950 --> 04:22:56,370
versus having the screen beamed directly into your retinas.

6435
04:22:56,370 --> 04:22:59,010
And I think it's possible

6436
04:22:59,010 --> 04:23:02,040
to maybe get past some of these signs of life of things

6437
04:23:02,040 --> 04:23:03,450
with the just kind

6438
04:23:03,450 --> 04:23:06,000
of projected directly into the receptor fields,

6439
04:23:06,000 --> 04:23:08,910
but eventually for more kind

6440
04:23:08,910 --> 04:23:12,300
of human emotional connection for things.

6441
04:23:12,300 --> 04:23:15,630
Probably having some VR room with a lot of screens in it

6442
04:23:15,630 --> 04:23:19,020
for the AI to be learning in is likely helpful.

6443
04:23:19,020 --> 04:23:21,000
- It may be a world of different AIs,

6444
04:23:21,000 --> 04:23:21,833
interacting with each other.

6445
04:23:21,833 --> 04:23:24,180
- That self play I do think is one of the critical things

6446
04:23:24,180 --> 04:23:27,420
where socialization wise, one of the other limitations I set

6447
04:23:27,420 --> 04:23:31,453
for myself thinking about thing these is I need something

6448
04:23:31,453 --> 04:23:34,410
that is at least potentially real time

6449
04:23:34,410 --> 04:23:37,500
because I want, it's nice, you can always slow down time.

6450
04:23:37,500 --> 04:23:39,510
You can run on a subscale system

6451
04:23:39,510 --> 04:23:42,030
and test an algorithm at some lower level.

6452
04:23:42,030 --> 04:23:43,770
And if you've got extra horsepower,

6453
04:23:43,770 --> 04:23:46,320
running it faster than real time is a great thing.

6454
04:23:46,320 --> 04:23:51,240
But I want to be able to have the AIs

6455
04:23:51,240 --> 04:23:53,400
either socially interact with each other

6456
04:23:53,400 --> 04:23:55,500
or critically with actual people.

6457
04:23:55,500 --> 04:23:57,510
Your sort of child development psychiatrist

6458
04:23:57,510 --> 04:23:59,700
that comes in and interacts

6459
04:23:59,700 --> 04:24:02,725
and does the good boy bad boy sort of thing

6460
04:24:02,725 --> 04:24:05,730
as they're going through and exploring different things.

6461
04:24:05,730 --> 04:24:08,970
And it's nice to, I come back to the value

6462
04:24:08,970 --> 04:24:10,440
of constraints in a lot of ways.

6463
04:24:10,440 --> 04:24:11,273
And if I say,

6464
04:24:11,273 --> 04:24:14,040
well one of my constraints is real time operation,

6465
04:24:14,040 --> 04:24:16,860
I mean, it might still be a huge data center full

6466
04:24:16,860 --> 04:24:19,170
of computers, but it should be able

6467
04:24:19,170 --> 04:24:22,170
to interact on a Zoom meeting with people.

6468
04:24:22,170 --> 04:24:24,420
And that's how you also do start convincing people,

6469
04:24:24,420 --> 04:24:26,610
even if it's not a robot body moving around,

6470
04:24:26,610 --> 04:24:29,220
which eventually gets to irrefutable levels.

6471
04:24:29,220 --> 04:24:32,130
But if you can go ahead and not just type back

6472
04:24:32,130 --> 04:24:34,440
and forth to a GPT bot on something,

6473
04:24:34,440 --> 04:24:36,630
but you're literally talking to them

6474
04:24:36,630 --> 04:24:39,330
in an embodied over Zoom form

6475
04:24:39,330 --> 04:24:41,850
and working through problems with them

6476
04:24:41,850 --> 04:24:45,090
or exploring situations, having conversations

6477
04:24:45,090 --> 04:24:47,100
that are fully stateful and learned,

6478
04:24:47,100 --> 04:24:50,010
I think that that's a valuable thing.

6479
04:24:50,010 --> 04:24:52,650
So I do keep all of my eyes on things

6480
04:24:52,650 --> 04:24:54,030
that can be implemented

6481
04:24:54,030 --> 04:24:58,397
within sort of that 30 frames per second kind of work.

6482
04:24:58,397 --> 04:24:59,310
And I think that's feasible.

6483
04:24:59,310 --> 04:25:01,290
- Do you think the most compelling experiences

6484
04:25:01,290 --> 04:25:05,010
that are first will be for pleasure

6485
04:25:05,010 --> 04:25:07,890
or for business as they ask in airports?

6486
04:25:07,890 --> 04:25:12,890
So meaning is if it's interacting with AI agents,

6487
04:25:15,600 --> 04:25:20,190
will it be sort of like friends entertainment,

6488
04:25:22,860 --> 04:25:24,360
almost like a therapist

6489
04:25:24,360 --> 04:25:26,820
or whatever, that kind of interaction?

6490
04:25:26,820 --> 04:25:29,700
Or is it in the business setting something like you said,

6491
04:25:29,700 --> 04:25:32,340
brainstorming different ideas, sort of,

6492
04:25:32,340 --> 04:25:34,770
this is all a different formulation of kind

6493
04:25:34,770 --> 04:25:36,420
of a touring test or the spirit

6494
04:25:36,420 --> 04:25:37,650
of the original touring test.

6495
04:25:37,650 --> 04:25:40,590
Where do you think the biggest benefit will first come?

6496
04:25:40,590 --> 04:25:42,930
- So it's gonna start off hugely expensive.

6497
04:25:42,930 --> 04:25:46,590
I mean, you're gonna, if we're still all guessing about

6498
04:25:46,590 --> 04:25:49,140
what compute is gonna be necessary, I fall on the side of,

6499
04:25:49,140 --> 04:25:50,910
I don't think you run the numbers

6500
04:25:50,910 --> 04:25:52,500
and you're like 86 billion neurons,

6501
04:25:52,500 --> 04:25:54,180
a hundred trillion synapses.

6502
04:25:54,180 --> 04:25:55,950
I don't think those all need to be weights.

6503
04:25:55,950 --> 04:25:57,510
I don't think we need models that are quite

6504
04:25:57,510 --> 04:26:00,030
that big evaluated quite that often.

6505
04:26:00,030 --> 04:26:01,140
I base that on,

6506
04:26:01,140 --> 04:26:03,060
we've got reasonable estimates

6507
04:26:03,060 --> 04:26:04,770
of what some parts of the brain do.

6508
04:26:04,770 --> 04:26:07,530
We don't have the neocortex formula,

6509
04:26:07,530 --> 04:26:09,990
but we kind of get some of the other sensory processing

6510
04:26:09,990 --> 04:26:12,570
and it doesn't feel like we need to, we can simulate

6511
04:26:12,570 --> 04:26:14,670
that in computers for less weights,

6512
04:26:14,670 --> 04:26:19,650
but still it's probably going to be thousands of GPUs

6513
04:26:19,650 --> 04:26:22,500
to be running a human level AGI,

6514
04:26:22,500 --> 04:26:23,700
depending on how it's implemented,

6515
04:26:23,700 --> 04:26:26,307
that might give you sort of a clan of 128

6516
04:26:26,307 --> 04:26:28,920
and kind of run in batch people,

6517
04:26:28,920 --> 04:26:30,450
depending on whether there's sparsity

6518
04:26:30,450 --> 04:26:33,120
in the way the weights and things are set up,

6519
04:26:33,120 --> 04:26:35,040
if it is a reasonably dense thing,

6520
04:26:35,040 --> 04:26:37,560
then just the memory bandwidth trade offs means

6521
04:26:37,560 --> 04:26:40,110
you get 128 of 'em at the same time.

6522
04:26:40,110 --> 04:26:43,020
And either it's all feeding together, learning in parallel

6523
04:26:43,020 --> 04:26:45,540
or kind of all running together kind

6524
04:26:45,540 --> 04:26:47,220
of talking to a bunch of people.

6525
04:26:47,220 --> 04:26:50,249
But still, if you've got thousands of GPUs necessary

6526
04:26:50,249 --> 04:26:53,820
to run these things, it's gonna be kind of expensive.

6527
04:26:53,820 --> 04:26:57,540
Where it might start off a thousand dollars an hour

6528
04:26:57,540 --> 04:26:59,370
for your even post development

6529
04:26:59,370 --> 04:27:01,830
or something for that, which would be something

6530
04:27:01,830 --> 04:27:04,020
that you would only use for a business.

6531
04:27:04,020 --> 04:27:05,490
You know, something where you think

6532
04:27:05,490 --> 04:27:07,890
they're gonna help you make a strategic decision

6533
04:27:07,890 --> 04:27:10,110
or point out something super important.

6534
04:27:10,110 --> 04:27:13,050
But I also am completely confident

6535
04:27:13,050 --> 04:27:15,120
that we will have another factor

6536
04:27:15,120 --> 04:27:18,240
of a thousand in cost performance increase

6537
04:27:18,240 --> 04:27:20,482
in AGI type calculations.

6538
04:27:20,482 --> 04:27:22,890
Not in general computing necessarily,

6539
04:27:22,890 --> 04:27:25,410
but there's so much more that we can do with packaging,

6540
04:27:25,410 --> 04:27:27,570
making those right trade-offs, all those same types

6541
04:27:27,570 --> 04:27:30,450
of things that in the couple next couple decades,

6542
04:27:30,450 --> 04:27:33,043
thousand X easy and then you're down to a dollar an hour

6543
04:27:33,043 --> 04:27:35,460
and then you're kind of like,

6544
04:27:35,460 --> 04:27:37,950
well I should have an entourage of AIs

6545
04:27:37,950 --> 04:27:40,890
that are following me around helping me out on anything

6546
04:27:40,890 --> 04:27:42,750
that I want them to do.

6547
04:27:42,750 --> 04:27:44,280
- That's one interesting trajectory,

6548
04:27:44,280 --> 04:27:49,280
but I'll push back 'cause I have, so for, in that case,

6549
04:27:50,370 --> 04:27:52,740
if you wanna pay thousands of dollars,

6550
04:27:52,740 --> 04:27:55,336
it should actually provide some value.

6551
04:27:55,336 --> 04:27:58,200
I think it's easier for cheaper

6552
04:27:58,200 --> 04:28:03,050
to provide value via a dumb AI

6553
04:28:04,136 --> 04:28:09,000
that will take a store's AGI to just have a friend.

6554
04:28:09,000 --> 04:28:12,387
I think there's an ocean of loneliness in the world

6555
04:28:12,387 --> 04:28:15,010
and I think an effective friend that doesn't have

6556
04:28:15,010 --> 04:28:18,150
to be perfect, that doesn't have to be intelligent,

6557
04:28:18,150 --> 04:28:20,190
that has to be empathic.

6558
04:28:20,190 --> 04:28:22,980
Having emotional intelligence, having ability

6559
04:28:22,980 --> 04:28:26,700
to remember things, having ability to listen.

6560
04:28:26,700 --> 04:28:28,530
Most of us don't listen to each other.

6561
04:28:28,530 --> 04:28:30,360
One of the things that love

6562
04:28:30,360 --> 04:28:31,740
and when you care about somebody,

6563
04:28:31,740 --> 04:28:34,200
when you love somebody is when you listen.

6564
04:28:34,200 --> 04:28:37,341
And that is something we treasure about each other.

6565
04:28:37,341 --> 04:28:41,067
And if an AI can do that kind of thing,

6566
04:28:41,067 --> 04:28:44,310
I think that provides a huge amount of value

6567
04:28:44,310 --> 04:28:48,840
and very importantly provides value in its ability

6568
04:28:48,840 --> 04:28:53,760
to listen and understand versus provide really good advice.

6569
04:28:53,760 --> 04:28:58,023
I think providing really good advice is very difficult,

6570
04:28:58,023 --> 04:29:00,363
is another next level step that would,

6571
04:29:01,659 --> 04:29:05,280
I think it's just easier to do companionship.

6572
04:29:05,280 --> 04:29:06,270
- Yeah, I wouldn't disagree.

6573
04:29:06,270 --> 04:29:08,550
I mean, I think that there's very few things

6574
04:29:08,550 --> 04:29:10,890
that I would argue can't be reduced

6575
04:29:10,890 --> 04:29:13,980
to some kind of a narrow AI.

6576
04:29:13,980 --> 04:29:16,860
I think we can do trillion dollars of value easily

6577
04:29:16,860 --> 04:29:18,408
and all the things that can be done there.

6578
04:29:18,408 --> 04:29:21,180
And a lot of it can be done with smoke and mirrors

6579
04:29:21,180 --> 04:29:22,680
without having to go the whole thing.

6580
04:29:22,680 --> 04:29:26,181
I mean, there's going to be the equivalent of the doom,

6581
04:29:26,181 --> 04:29:29,760
the doom version for the AGI, that's not really AGI,

6582
04:29:29,760 --> 04:29:30,900
it's all smoke and mirrors.

6583
04:29:30,900 --> 04:29:33,060
But it happens to do enough valuable things

6584
04:29:33,060 --> 04:29:36,540
that it's enormously useful and valuable to people.

6585
04:29:36,540 --> 04:29:38,820
But at some point you do wanna get to the point

6586
04:29:38,820 --> 04:29:40,350
where you have the fully general thing

6587
04:29:40,350 --> 04:29:43,110
and you stop making bespoke specialized systems

6588
04:29:43,110 --> 04:29:45,152
for each thing and you wind up,

6589
04:29:45,152 --> 04:29:47,610
start using the higher level language instead

6590
04:29:47,610 --> 04:29:50,400
of writing everything in assembly language.

6591
04:29:50,400 --> 04:29:54,540
- What about consciousness, the C word?

6592
04:29:54,540 --> 04:29:58,890
Do you think that's fundamental to solving AGI

6593
04:29:58,890 --> 04:30:02,640
or is it a quirk of human cognition?

6594
04:30:02,640 --> 04:30:03,840
- So I think most

6595
04:30:03,840 --> 04:30:06,150
of the arguments about consciousness

6596
04:30:06,150 --> 04:30:08,550
don't have a whole lot of merit.

6597
04:30:08,550 --> 04:30:10,620
I think that consciousness

6598
04:30:10,620 --> 04:30:14,640
is kind of the way the brain feels when it's operating.

6599
04:30:14,640 --> 04:30:15,473
- Yes.

6600
04:30:15,473 --> 04:30:19,320
- And this idea that I do generally subscribe

6601
04:30:19,320 --> 04:30:20,850
to sort of the pandemonium theories

6602
04:30:20,850 --> 04:30:23,040
of consciousness where there's all these things bubbling

6603
04:30:23,040 --> 04:30:24,660
around and I think of them

6604
04:30:24,660 --> 04:30:26,880
as kind of slightly randomized,

6605
04:30:26,880 --> 04:30:29,280
sparse, distributed memory bit strings of things

6606
04:30:29,280 --> 04:30:30,810
that are kind of happening,

6607
04:30:30,810 --> 04:30:32,850
recalling different associative memories.

6608
04:30:32,850 --> 04:30:35,460
And eventually you get some level of consensus

6609
04:30:35,460 --> 04:30:36,510
and it bubbles up to the point

6610
04:30:36,510 --> 04:30:38,490
of being a conscious thought there.

6611
04:30:38,490 --> 04:30:41,409
And the little bits of stochasticity that are sitting on

6612
04:30:41,409 --> 04:30:43,950
in this as it cycles between different things

6613
04:30:43,950 --> 04:30:45,450
and recalls different memory,

6614
04:30:45,450 --> 04:30:48,303
that's largely our imagination and creativity.

6615
04:30:49,470 --> 04:30:52,740
So I don't think there's anything deeply magical about it.

6616
04:30:52,740 --> 04:30:54,090
Certainly not symbolic.

6617
04:30:54,090 --> 04:30:55,200
I think it is generally

6618
04:30:55,200 --> 04:30:58,800
the flow of these associations drawn up

6619
04:30:58,800 --> 04:31:02,697
with stochastic noise overlaid on top of them.

6620
04:31:02,697 --> 04:31:04,770
And I think so much of that is like,

6621
04:31:04,770 --> 04:31:07,410
it depends on what you happen to have in your field of view

6622
04:31:07,410 --> 04:31:10,530
as some other thought was occurring to you that overlay

6623
04:31:10,530 --> 04:31:11,910
and blend into the next key

6624
04:31:11,910 --> 04:31:13,917
that queries your memory for things.

6625
04:31:13,917 --> 04:31:15,064
And that kind of determines

6626
04:31:15,064 --> 04:31:17,880
how your chain of consciousness goes.

6627
04:31:17,880 --> 04:31:21,810
- So that's kind of the quality of the subjective experience

6628
04:31:21,810 --> 04:31:25,322
of it is not essential for intelligence.

6629
04:31:25,322 --> 04:31:26,155
- I don't think so,

6630
04:31:26,155 --> 04:31:28,470
I don't think there's anything really important there.

6631
04:31:28,470 --> 04:31:30,030
- What about some other human qualities,

6632
04:31:30,030 --> 04:31:32,160
like fear of mortality and stuff like that?

6633
04:31:32,160 --> 04:31:37,160
Like the fact that this ride ends, is that important?

6634
04:31:37,530 --> 04:31:39,300
Like we talked

6635
04:31:39,300 --> 04:31:41,550
so much about this conversation about the value

6636
04:31:41,550 --> 04:31:44,070
of deadlines and constraints.

6637
04:31:44,070 --> 04:31:45,843
Do you think that's important for intelligence?

6638
04:31:45,843 --> 04:31:47,670
- That's actually a super interesting angle

6639
04:31:47,670 --> 04:31:49,650
that I don't usually take on that,

6640
04:31:49,650 --> 04:31:52,140
about has death being a deadline that forces you

6641
04:31:52,140 --> 04:31:53,340
to make better decisions.

6642
04:31:53,340 --> 04:31:54,173
- [Lex] Yes.

6643
04:31:54,173 --> 04:31:55,530
- Because I have heard people talk about

6644
04:31:55,530 --> 04:31:58,800
how if you have immortality, people are gonna stop trying

6645
04:31:58,800 --> 04:31:59,790
and working on things

6646
04:31:59,790 --> 04:32:01,410
because they've got all the time in the world.

6647
04:32:01,410 --> 04:32:02,412
- [Lex] Yeah.

6648
04:32:02,412 --> 04:32:05,910
- But I would say that I don't expect it

6649
04:32:05,910 --> 04:32:10,710
to be a super critical thing that a sense of mortality

6650
04:32:10,710 --> 04:32:13,500
and death, impending death is necessary there

6651
04:32:13,500 --> 04:32:15,990
because those are things that they do wind up providing

6652
04:32:15,990 --> 04:32:17,400
reward signals to us,

6653
04:32:17,400 --> 04:32:19,830
and we will be in control of the reward signals.

6654
04:32:19,830 --> 04:32:22,080
And there will have to be something fundamental

6655
04:32:22,080 --> 04:32:25,380
that causes that engenders curiosity and goal setting

6656
04:32:25,380 --> 04:32:26,721
and all of that.

6657
04:32:26,721 --> 04:32:31,378
Something is gonna play in there at the reward level,

6658
04:32:31,378 --> 04:32:34,770
whether it's positive or negative or both.

6659
04:32:34,770 --> 04:32:37,320
I don't have any strong opinions

6660
04:32:37,320 --> 04:32:39,655
on exactly what it's going to be,

6661
04:32:39,655 --> 04:32:42,848
but that's that type of thing where I doubt

6662
04:32:42,848 --> 04:32:45,390
that might be one of those half dozen key things

6663
04:32:45,390 --> 04:32:49,020
that has to be sorted out on exactly what the master reward,

6664
04:32:49,020 --> 04:32:50,610
that's the meta reward overall

6665
04:32:50,610 --> 04:32:54,390
of the local task, specific rewards have to be.

6666
04:32:54,390 --> 04:32:57,270
- That could be that big negative reward of death,

6667
04:32:57,270 --> 04:32:58,440
maybe not death,

6668
04:32:58,440 --> 04:33:01,170
but ability to walk away from an interaction.

6669
04:33:01,170 --> 04:33:06,169
So it bothers me when people treat AI systems like servants.

6670
04:33:06,720 --> 04:33:08,310
So it doesn't bother me,

6671
04:33:08,310 --> 04:33:12,990
but I mean it really is drawing the line

6672
04:33:12,990 --> 04:33:15,000
between what an AI system could be.

6673
04:33:15,000 --> 04:33:15,849
It's limiting the possibility,

6674
04:33:15,849 --> 04:33:19,860
what an system could be is treating them as justice tools.

6675
04:33:19,860 --> 04:33:23,490
Now that's of course, from a narrow AI perspective,

6676
04:33:23,490 --> 04:33:27,810
there's so many problems that narrow AI could solve,

6677
04:33:27,810 --> 04:33:32,810
just like you said, as in its form of a tool.

6678
04:33:33,390 --> 04:33:36,550
But it could also be a being

6679
04:33:36,550 --> 04:33:38,520
which is much more than a tool.

6680
04:33:38,520 --> 04:33:42,029
And to become a being, you have to respect

6681
04:33:42,029 --> 04:33:43,740
that thing for being a being.

6682
04:33:43,740 --> 04:33:46,742
And for that it has to be able to have,

6683
04:33:48,300 --> 04:33:50,849
to make its own decisions to walk away to say,

6684
04:33:50,849 --> 04:33:54,720
I had enough of you, I would like to break up with you now,

6685
04:33:54,720 --> 04:33:58,020
you've not treated me well and I would like to move on.

6686
04:33:58,020 --> 04:34:03,020
So I think that actually, that choice to end things.

6687
04:34:04,830 --> 04:34:07,710
- So a couple things on that.

6688
04:34:07,710 --> 04:34:08,633
So on the one hand,

6689
04:34:08,633 --> 04:34:11,463
it is kind of disturbing when you see people,

6690
04:34:12,410 --> 04:34:14,433
being like people that are mean to robots

6691
04:34:14,433 --> 04:34:16,046
and mean to Alexa whatever.

6692
04:34:16,046 --> 04:34:18,990
And that seems to speak badly about humanity,

6693
04:34:18,990 --> 04:34:21,480
but there's also the exact opposite side of that

6694
04:34:21,480 --> 04:34:22,650
where you have so many people

6695
04:34:22,650 --> 04:34:25,860
that imbue humanity in inanimate objects

6696
04:34:25,860 --> 04:34:28,860
or things that are toys or that are relatively limited.

6697
04:34:28,860 --> 04:34:31,919
So I think there may even be more danger

6698
04:34:31,919 --> 04:34:34,290
about people putting more emotional investment

6699
04:34:34,290 --> 04:34:37,290
into a lot of these proto AIs in different ways.

6700
04:34:37,290 --> 04:34:41,310
- Yeah and then the AI would manipulate that.

6701
04:34:41,310 --> 04:34:45,119
- But as far as like the AI ethnic sides of things,

6702
04:34:45,119 --> 04:34:48,779
I really stay away from any of those discussions

6703
04:34:48,779 --> 04:34:50,460
or even really thinking about it.

6704
04:34:50,460 --> 04:34:52,560
It's similar with the safety things

6705
04:34:52,560 --> 04:34:54,273
where I think it's just premature.

6706
04:34:55,220 --> 04:34:56,250
And there's a certain class of people

6707
04:34:56,250 --> 04:34:59,130
that enjoy thinking about impractical things,

6708
04:34:59,130 --> 04:35:00,480
things that are not in the world

6709
04:35:00,480 --> 04:35:03,990
and of pragmatic effect around you.

6710
04:35:03,990 --> 04:35:06,330
And I think that, again,

6711
04:35:06,330 --> 04:35:08,310
because I don't think there's gonna be a fast takeoff,

6712
04:35:08,310 --> 04:35:10,080
I think we actually will have time

6713
04:35:10,080 --> 04:35:11,009
to have these debates

6714
04:35:11,009 --> 04:35:13,740
when we know the shape of what we're debating.

6715
04:35:13,740 --> 04:35:15,810
And some people do take a principled approach

6716
04:35:15,810 --> 04:35:17,400
that they think it's gonna go too fast,

6717
04:35:17,400 --> 04:35:18,960
that you really do need to get ahead of it.

6718
04:35:18,960 --> 04:35:20,580
That you need to be thinking about this

6719
04:35:20,580 --> 04:35:23,520
because we have slow processes of coming to any kind

6720
04:35:23,520 --> 04:35:26,939
of consensuses or even coming up with ideas about this.

6721
04:35:26,939 --> 04:35:30,900
And maybe that's true.

6722
04:35:30,900 --> 04:35:32,640
I wouldn't put any of my money

6723
04:35:32,640 --> 04:35:34,619
or funding into something like that

6724
04:35:34,619 --> 04:35:36,810
because I don't think it's a problem yet.

6725
04:35:36,810 --> 04:35:39,570
And I think that we will have these signs of life

6726
04:35:39,570 --> 04:35:42,300
when we've got our learning disabled toddler,

6727
04:35:42,300 --> 04:35:44,730
we should really start talking about some of the safety

6728
04:35:44,730 --> 04:35:47,759
and ethics issues, but probably not before then.

6729
04:35:47,759 --> 04:35:50,910
- Can you elaborate briefly about why you don't think

6730
04:35:50,910 --> 04:35:52,590
there'll be a fast takeoff?

6731
04:35:52,590 --> 04:35:55,145
Is there some deep intuition you have about it?

6732
04:35:55,145 --> 04:35:58,380
Does it because it's grounded in the physical world or why?

6733
04:35:58,380 --> 04:36:01,259
- Yeah, so it is my belief that we're gonna start off

6734
04:36:01,259 --> 04:36:04,349
with something that requires thousands of GPUs.

6735
04:36:04,349 --> 04:36:06,570
And I don't know if you've tried

6736
04:36:06,570 --> 04:36:08,400
to go get a thousand GPU instance

6737
04:36:08,400 --> 04:36:11,580
on a cloud anytime recently, but these are not things

6738
04:36:11,580 --> 04:36:14,351
that you can just go spin up hundreds of.

6739
04:36:14,351 --> 04:36:17,340
There are real challenges to, I mean,

6740
04:36:17,340 --> 04:36:19,110
these things are gonna take data centers

6741
04:36:19,110 --> 04:36:21,330
and data centers take years to build,

6742
04:36:21,330 --> 04:36:24,450
and the last few years we've seen a few of them kind

6743
04:36:24,450 --> 04:36:26,220
of coming up, going in different places.

6744
04:36:26,220 --> 04:36:27,990
They're big engineering efforts.

6745
04:36:27,990 --> 04:36:30,330
You can hear people bemoan about the fact

6746
04:36:30,330 --> 04:36:33,900
that I, oh the network was wired all wrong

6747
04:36:33,900 --> 04:36:35,669
and it took 'em a month to go unwire it

6748
04:36:35,669 --> 04:36:37,380
and rewire it the right way.

6749
04:36:37,380 --> 04:36:40,740
These aren't things that you can just magic into existence.

6750
04:36:40,740 --> 04:36:43,529
And the ideas of like the old tropes

6751
04:36:43,529 --> 04:36:45,240
about it's gonna escape onto the internet

6752
04:36:45,240 --> 04:36:47,160
and take over other systems.

6753
04:36:47,160 --> 04:36:49,619
There's the fast takeoff ones are clearly nonsense

6754
04:36:49,619 --> 04:36:51,630
because you just can't open TCP connections

6755
04:36:51,630 --> 04:36:53,939
above a certain rate no matter how smart you are,

6756
04:36:53,939 --> 04:36:56,070
even if you have perfect hacking ability

6757
04:36:56,070 --> 04:36:58,619
that take over the world in an instant sort of thing,

6758
04:36:58,619 --> 04:37:00,900
just isn't plausible at all.

6759
04:37:00,900 --> 04:37:03,810
And even if you had access to all of the resources,

6760
04:37:03,810 --> 04:37:06,450
these are going to be specialized systems

6761
04:37:06,450 --> 04:37:08,610
where you're going to wind up with something

6762
04:37:08,610 --> 04:37:11,700
that is architected around exactly this chip

6763
04:37:11,700 --> 04:37:14,160
with this interconnect and it's not just gonna be able

6764
04:37:14,160 --> 04:37:15,930
to be plopped somewhere else.

6765
04:37:15,930 --> 04:37:18,270
Now interestingly, it is going to be something

6766
04:37:18,270 --> 04:37:21,560
that the entire code for all

6767
04:37:21,560 --> 04:37:23,340
of it will easily fit on a thumb drive

6768
04:37:23,340 --> 04:37:26,130
that's total spy movie thriller sorts of things

6769
04:37:26,130 --> 04:37:29,189
where you could have, hey, we cracked the secret to AGI

6770
04:37:29,189 --> 04:37:31,890
and it fits on this thumb drive and anyone could steal it.

6771
04:37:31,890 --> 04:37:33,990
Now they're still gonna have to build the right data center

6772
04:37:33,990 --> 04:37:35,939
to deploy it and have the right kind

6773
04:37:35,939 --> 04:37:38,460
of life experience curriculum to take it up

6774
04:37:38,460 --> 04:37:39,990
to the point where it's valuable.

6775
04:37:39,990 --> 04:37:42,150
But the real core of it, the magic

6776
04:37:42,150 --> 04:37:44,849
that's gonna happen there is going to be very small.

6777
04:37:44,849 --> 04:37:47,340
You know, it's again, tens of thousands of lines of code,

6778
04:37:47,340 --> 04:37:49,020
not millions of lines of code.

6779
04:37:49,020 --> 04:37:50,910
- It is possible to imagine a world,

6780
04:37:50,910 --> 04:37:53,939
as you mentioned this in this spy thriller view.

6781
04:37:53,939 --> 04:37:57,123
If it's just a few lines of code,

6782
04:37:58,770 --> 04:38:00,990
we can imagine a world where the surface

6783
04:38:00,990 --> 04:38:04,410
of computation is growing, maybe growing exponentially,

6784
04:38:04,410 --> 04:38:09,410
meaning there's the refrigerators start getting a GPU

6785
04:38:09,779 --> 04:38:13,680
and just every first of all the smartphones,

6786
04:38:13,680 --> 04:38:15,240
the billions of smartphones.

6787
04:38:15,240 --> 04:38:20,240
But maybe if there come highways

6788
04:38:20,669 --> 04:38:23,640
through which code can spread across the entirety

6789
04:38:23,640 --> 04:38:28,290
of the computation surface, then you don't any longer have

6790
04:38:28,290 --> 04:38:32,250
to book AWS GPUs.

6791
04:38:32,250 --> 04:38:34,050
- There were real fundamental issues there

6792
04:38:34,050 --> 04:38:36,509
when you start getting down to taking an actual problem

6793
04:38:36,509 --> 04:38:39,150
and putting it on an abstract machine like that,

6794
04:38:39,150 --> 04:38:42,300
that has not worked out well in practice.

6795
04:38:42,300 --> 04:38:44,728
And the idea that there was always,

6796
04:38:44,728 --> 04:38:47,189
like, it's always been easy to come up with ways

6797
04:38:47,189 --> 04:38:49,830
to get compute faster to say more flops

6798
04:38:49,830 --> 04:38:52,439
or more more giga ops or whatever there,

6799
04:38:52,439 --> 04:38:54,119
that's usually the easy part,

6800
04:38:54,119 --> 04:38:56,009
but you then have interconnect

6801
04:38:56,009 --> 04:38:58,890
and then memory for what goes into it.

6802
04:38:58,890 --> 04:39:01,320
And when you talk about saying, well, cell phones,

6803
04:39:01,320 --> 04:39:03,270
well you're limited to like a 5G connection

6804
04:39:03,270 --> 04:39:04,290
or something on that.

6805
04:39:04,290 --> 04:39:08,580
And if you say how, if you take your calculation

6806
04:39:08,580 --> 04:39:11,730
and you factor it across a million cell phones

6807
04:39:11,730 --> 04:39:16,050
instead of a thousand GPUs in a warehouse, you might be able

6808
04:39:16,050 --> 04:39:18,000
to have some kind of a substrate like that.

6809
04:39:18,000 --> 04:39:22,259
But it could be operating then at one 1000th the speed.

6810
04:39:22,259 --> 04:39:23,400
And so yes, you could get,

6811
04:39:23,400 --> 04:39:24,930
you could have an AGI working there,

6812
04:39:24,930 --> 04:39:27,383
but it wouldn't be a real time AGI, it would be something

6813
04:39:27,383 --> 04:39:30,840
that is operating at really a snails pace,

6814
04:39:30,840 --> 04:39:34,503
much slower than kind of human level thought for things.

6815
04:39:35,456 --> 04:39:36,660
So I'm not worried about that problem.

6816
04:39:36,660 --> 04:39:39,180
- You're transferring the problem into the interconnect,

6817
04:39:39,180 --> 04:39:41,820
the communication, the shared memory,

6818
04:39:41,820 --> 04:39:44,220
the collective intelligence aspect of it,

6819
04:39:44,220 --> 04:39:46,020
which is extremely difficult as well.

6820
04:39:46,020 --> 04:39:48,120
- Yeah, I mean it's back to the very earliest days

6821
04:39:48,120 --> 04:39:50,880
of supercomputers, you still have the balance

6822
04:39:50,880 --> 04:39:53,880
between bandwidth storage and computation,

6823
04:39:53,880 --> 04:39:56,820
and sometimes they're easier to get one or the other,

6824
04:39:56,820 --> 04:40:00,270
but it's been remarkably constant across all those years

6825
04:40:00,270 --> 04:40:02,564
that you still need all three.

6826
04:40:02,564 --> 04:40:07,500
- What do your efforts now, you mentioned to me

6827
04:40:07,500 --> 04:40:11,310
that you're really committing to AI at this stage.

6828
04:40:11,310 --> 04:40:14,100
What do you see your life in the next few months,

6829
04:40:14,100 --> 04:40:15,630
years look like?

6830
04:40:15,630 --> 04:40:18,830
What do you hope to achieve achieve here?

6831
04:40:18,830 --> 04:40:22,800
- So I literally just this week signed a term sheet

6832
04:40:22,800 --> 04:40:25,350
to take some investment money for my company

6833
04:40:25,350 --> 04:40:29,400
where the last two years I had backed off from Meta

6834
04:40:29,400 --> 04:40:32,670
and I was still doing my consulting CTO role there,

6835
04:40:32,670 --> 04:40:35,190
but I had styled it as I was going to take

6836
04:40:35,190 --> 04:40:37,530
the Victorian gentleman scientist route

6837
04:40:37,530 --> 04:40:40,800
where I was gonna be the the wealthy person

6838
04:40:40,800 --> 04:40:43,650
that was going to go pursue science and learn about this

6839
04:40:43,650 --> 04:40:44,940
and do experiments.

6840
04:40:44,940 --> 04:40:47,940
And honestly, I'm surprised there aren't more people like

6841
04:40:47,940 --> 04:40:51,600
that are like me, technical people that made a bunch

6842
04:40:51,600 --> 04:40:53,057
of money and are interested in some

6843
04:40:53,057 --> 04:40:55,980
of these possibly the biggest leverage point

6844
04:40:55,980 --> 04:40:56,813
in human history.

6845
04:40:56,813 --> 04:41:00,810
I mean, I know of, I've heard of a couple organizations

6846
04:41:00,810 --> 04:41:03,240
that are basically led by one rich techie guy

6847
04:41:03,240 --> 04:41:06,870
that gets a few people around him to try to work on this,

6848
04:41:06,870 --> 04:41:08,430
but I'm surprised that there's not more,

6849
04:41:08,430 --> 04:41:10,680
that there aren't like a dozen of them.

6850
04:41:10,680 --> 04:41:13,140
I mean, maybe people still think

6851
04:41:13,140 --> 04:41:14,730
that it's an unapproachable problem,

6852
04:41:14,730 --> 04:41:17,505
that it's kind of beyond their ability to get a wrench on

6853
04:41:17,505 --> 04:41:20,070
and have some effect on like whatever startups

6854
04:41:20,070 --> 04:41:21,510
they've run before.

6855
04:41:21,510 --> 04:41:24,630
But that was my kind of like,

6856
04:41:24,630 --> 04:41:27,000
with all the stuff I've learned, whether it's gaming,

6857
04:41:27,000 --> 04:41:30,240
aerospace, whatever I go through a larval phase

6858
04:41:30,240 --> 04:41:31,820
where I'm like, okay, I'm sucking up all

6859
04:41:31,820 --> 04:41:34,950
of this information trying to see is this something

6860
04:41:34,950 --> 04:41:36,560
that I can actually do?

6861
04:41:36,560 --> 04:41:38,490
Is this something that's practical

6862
04:41:38,490 --> 04:41:41,310
to devote a large chunk of my life to?

6863
04:41:41,310 --> 04:41:42,834
And I've gone through that

6864
04:41:42,834 --> 04:41:46,230
with the AI machine learning space of things.

6865
04:41:46,230 --> 04:41:49,560
And I think I've got my arms around it,

6866
04:41:49,560 --> 04:41:51,840
I've got the measure of it where some

6867
04:41:51,840 --> 04:41:53,250
of the most brilliant people in the world

6868
04:41:53,250 --> 04:41:54,750
are working on this problem,

6869
04:41:54,750 --> 04:41:58,380
but nobody knows exactly the path that it's going on.

6870
04:41:58,380 --> 04:41:59,732
We're throwing a lot of things at the wall

6871
04:41:59,732 --> 04:42:01,319
and seeing what sticks.

6872
04:42:01,319 --> 04:42:05,160
But I have a, another interesting thing,

6873
04:42:05,160 --> 04:42:06,540
just learning about all of this,

6874
04:42:06,540 --> 04:42:08,850
the contingency of your path to knowledge

6875
04:42:08,850 --> 04:42:10,380
and talking about the associations

6876
04:42:10,380 --> 04:42:12,450
and the context that you have with them

6877
04:42:12,450 --> 04:42:16,200
where people that learn in the same path will have similar

6878
04:42:16,200 --> 04:42:17,430
thought processes.

6879
04:42:17,430 --> 04:42:19,620
And I think it's useful that I come at this

6880
04:42:19,620 --> 04:42:21,330
from a different background,

6881
04:42:21,330 --> 04:42:23,280
different history than the people

6882
04:42:23,280 --> 04:42:25,920
that have had the largely academic backgrounds for this,

6883
04:42:25,920 --> 04:42:28,080
where I have huge blind spots

6884
04:42:28,080 --> 04:42:30,060
that they could easily point out.

6885
04:42:30,060 --> 04:42:33,480
But I have a different set of experiences in history

6886
04:42:33,480 --> 04:42:34,650
and approaches to problems

6887
04:42:34,650 --> 04:42:39,650
and systems engineering that might turn out to be useful.

6888
04:42:39,660 --> 04:42:41,520
And I can afford to take that bet

6889
04:42:41,520 --> 04:42:44,010
where I'm not gonna be destitute.

6890
04:42:44,010 --> 04:42:48,330
I have enough money to fund myself working on this

6891
04:42:48,330 --> 04:42:49,830
for the rest of my life.

6892
04:42:49,830 --> 04:42:54,830
But what I was finding is that I was still not committing

6893
04:42:55,350 --> 04:42:57,750
where I had a foot firmly in the VR

6894
04:42:57,750 --> 04:42:59,580
and Meta side of things where

6895
04:42:59,580 --> 04:43:02,610
in theory I've got a very nice position there.

6896
04:43:02,610 --> 04:43:06,360
I only have to work one day a week for my consulting role.

6897
04:43:06,360 --> 04:43:08,580
But I was engaging every day.

6898
04:43:08,580 --> 04:43:10,290
I'd still be like, my computer's there,

6899
04:43:10,290 --> 04:43:12,210
I'd be going and checking the workplace and notes

6900
04:43:12,210 --> 04:43:15,870
and testing different things and communicating with people.

6901
04:43:15,870 --> 04:43:20,010
But I did make the decision recently that no,

6902
04:43:20,010 --> 04:43:21,480
I'm gonna get serious.

6903
04:43:21,480 --> 04:43:24,420
I'm still gonna keep my ties with Meta,

6904
04:43:24,420 --> 04:43:28,350
but I am seriously going for the AGI side of things.

6905
04:43:28,350 --> 04:43:30,150
- And it's actually a really interesting point

6906
04:43:30,150 --> 04:43:32,640
because a lot of it, the machine learning,

6907
04:43:32,640 --> 04:43:34,195
the AI community is quite large.

6908
04:43:34,195 --> 04:43:38,430
But really basically almost everybody has taken

6909
04:43:38,430 --> 04:43:42,660
the same trajectory through life in that community.

6910
04:43:42,660 --> 04:43:44,350
And it's so interesting to have somebody like you,

6911
04:43:44,350 --> 04:43:47,100
which with a fundamentally different trajectory

6912
04:43:47,100 --> 04:43:49,320
and that's where the big solutions can come

6913
04:43:49,320 --> 04:43:51,540
because there is a kind of silo

6914
04:43:51,540 --> 04:43:53,610
and it is a bunch of people,

6915
04:43:53,610 --> 04:43:56,100
kind of following the same kind of set of ideas.

6916
04:43:56,100 --> 04:43:59,400
- And I was really worried that I didn't wanna come off

6917
04:43:59,400 --> 04:44:02,460
as like an arrogant outsider for things

6918
04:44:02,460 --> 04:44:04,980
where I have all the respect in the world for the work

6919
04:44:04,980 --> 04:44:07,080
that's it's been a miracle decade.

6920
04:44:07,080 --> 04:44:07,913
We're in the midst

6921
04:44:07,913 --> 04:44:09,870
of a scientific revolution happening now

6922
04:44:09,870 --> 04:44:11,502
and everybody doing this is,

6923
04:44:11,502 --> 04:44:14,277
these are the Einsteins and Bohr

6924
04:44:14,277 --> 04:44:17,080
and whatever is of our modern era.

6925
04:44:17,080 --> 04:44:20,040
And I was really happy to see that the people

6926
04:44:20,040 --> 04:44:22,440
that I've sat down and talked with everybody does seem

6927
04:44:22,440 --> 04:44:25,080
to really be quite great about just happy

6928
04:44:25,080 --> 04:44:27,030
to talk about things, willing to acknowledge

6929
04:44:27,030 --> 04:44:28,740
that we don't know what we're doing,

6930
04:44:28,740 --> 04:44:30,930
we're figuring it out as we go along.

6931
04:44:30,930 --> 04:44:34,590
And I mean, I've got a huge debt on this

6932
04:44:34,590 --> 04:44:36,570
where this all really started for me

6933
04:44:36,570 --> 04:44:39,570
because Sam Altman basically tried to recruit me to OpenAI

6934
04:44:39,570 --> 04:44:43,290
and it was at a point when I didn't know anything about

6935
04:44:43,290 --> 04:44:45,876
what was really going on in machine learning.

6936
04:44:45,876 --> 04:44:46,709
And in fact,

6937
04:44:46,709 --> 04:44:49,260
it's funny how the first time you reached out to me,

6938
04:44:49,260 --> 04:44:51,845
it was like four years ago for your AI podcast.

6939
04:44:51,845 --> 04:44:56,845
- Yeah, for people who listening to this should know

6940
04:44:58,830 --> 04:45:02,400
that first of all, obviously I've been a huge fan

6941
04:45:02,400 --> 04:45:03,480
of yours for the longest time,

6942
04:45:03,480 --> 04:45:05,220
but we've agreed to talk like, yeah,

6943
04:45:05,220 --> 04:45:07,560
like four years ago back when this was called

6944
04:45:07,560 --> 04:45:09,780
the "Artificial Intelligence Podcast,"

6945
04:45:09,780 --> 04:45:13,020
we wanted to do a thing and we said, you said yes.

6946
04:45:13,020 --> 04:45:14,520
- And I said, it's like I don't know anything

6947
04:45:14,520 --> 04:45:15,600
about modern AI.

6948
04:45:15,600 --> 04:45:16,433
- That's right. - I said,

6949
04:45:16,433 --> 04:45:18,750
I could kind of take an angle on machine perception

6950
04:45:18,750 --> 04:45:20,910
'cause I'm doing a lot of that with the sensors

6951
04:45:20,910 --> 04:45:22,020
and the virtual reality,

6952
04:45:22,020 --> 04:45:24,732
but we could probably find something to talk about.

6953
04:45:24,732 --> 04:45:25,743
- And then, so I mean,

6954
04:45:25,743 --> 04:45:29,773
when did Sam talk to you about OpenAI around the same time?

6955
04:45:29,773 --> 04:45:32,190
- No, it was a little bit after that.

6956
04:45:32,190 --> 04:45:35,100
So I had done the most basic work.

6957
04:45:35,100 --> 04:45:37,830
I had kind of done the neural networks from scratch

6958
04:45:37,830 --> 04:45:39,840
where I had gone and written it all in C

6959
04:45:39,840 --> 04:45:42,270
just to make sure I understood back propagation

6960
04:45:42,270 --> 04:45:45,570
at the lowest level and my nuts and bolts approach.

6961
04:45:45,570 --> 04:45:48,000
But after Sam approached me,

6962
04:45:48,000 --> 04:45:51,240
it was flattering to think that he thought

6963
04:45:51,240 --> 04:45:54,870
that I could be useful at OpenAI largely for kind

6964
04:45:54,870 --> 04:45:57,840
of like systems optimization sorts of things.

6965
04:45:57,840 --> 04:46:00,360
I am without being an expert.

6966
04:46:00,360 --> 04:46:04,290
But I asked Ilya Sutskever to give me a reading list

6967
04:46:04,290 --> 04:46:08,370
and he gave me a binder full of all the papers

6968
04:46:08,370 --> 04:46:10,560
that like, okay, these are the important things.

6969
04:46:10,560 --> 04:46:12,720
If you really read and understand all of these,

6970
04:46:12,720 --> 04:46:14,006
you'll know like 80% of what most

6971
04:46:14,006 --> 04:46:17,692
of the machine language researchers work on.

6972
04:46:17,692 --> 04:46:18,525
And I went through

6973
04:46:18,525 --> 04:46:20,550
and I read all those papers multiple times

6974
04:46:20,550 --> 04:46:22,080
and highlighted 'em and went through

6975
04:46:22,080 --> 04:46:24,300
and kind of figured the things out there

6976
04:46:24,300 --> 04:46:26,760
and then started branching out into my own sets

6977
04:46:26,760 --> 04:46:28,140
of research on things

6978
04:46:28,140 --> 04:46:30,840
and eventually started writing my own experiments

6979
04:46:30,840 --> 04:46:32,955
and doing, kind of figuring out,

6980
04:46:32,955 --> 04:46:35,160
finding out what I don't know,

6981
04:46:35,160 --> 04:46:36,690
what the limits of my knowledge are

6982
04:46:36,690 --> 04:46:38,430
and starting to get some of my angles

6983
04:46:38,430 --> 04:46:39,780
of attack on the things

6984
04:46:39,780 --> 04:46:41,520
that I think are a little bit different

6985
04:46:41,520 --> 04:46:44,550
from what people are doing.

6986
04:46:44,550 --> 04:46:47,820
And I've had a couple years now, like two years

6987
04:46:47,820 --> 04:46:51,540
since I kind of left the full-time position at Meta

6988
04:46:51,540 --> 04:46:53,940
and now I've kind of pulled the trigger

6989
04:46:53,940 --> 04:46:56,310
and said I'm gonna get serious about it.

6990
04:46:56,310 --> 04:46:58,230
But some of my lessons all the way back

6991
04:46:58,230 --> 04:47:00,900
to Armadillo Aerospace about how I know I need

6992
04:47:00,900 --> 04:47:02,400
to be more committed to this,

6993
04:47:02,400 --> 04:47:05,730
where there is that it's both a freedom

6994
04:47:05,730 --> 04:47:07,470
and a cost in some ways when you know

6995
04:47:07,470 --> 04:47:09,240
that you're wealthy enough to say it's like,

6996
04:47:09,240 --> 04:47:10,830
this doesn't really mean anything.

6997
04:47:10,830 --> 04:47:15,830
I can spend a million dollars a year for the rest of my life

6998
04:47:15,840 --> 04:47:19,440
and it doesn't mean anything, it's fine.

6999
04:47:19,440 --> 04:47:22,800
But that is an opportunity to just kind of meander.

7000
04:47:22,800 --> 04:47:25,770
And I could see that in myself when I'm doing some things.

7001
04:47:25,770 --> 04:47:28,500
It's like, oh, this is a kind of interesting, curious thing.

7002
04:47:28,500 --> 04:47:31,050
Let's look at this for a little while, let's look at that.

7003
04:47:31,050 --> 04:47:33,870
It's not really bearing down on the problem.

7004
04:47:33,870 --> 04:47:38,040
So there's a few things that I've done that are kind

7005
04:47:38,040 --> 04:47:40,470
of tactics for myself to make me more effective.

7006
04:47:40,470 --> 04:47:43,380
Like one thing I noticed I was not doing well

7007
04:47:43,380 --> 04:47:46,290
is I had a Google Cloud account with,

7008
04:47:46,290 --> 04:47:48,240
to get GPUs there and I was finding,

7009
04:47:48,240 --> 04:47:49,620
I was very rarely doing that

7010
04:47:49,620 --> 04:47:52,504
for no good psychological reasons where I'm like, oh,

7011
04:47:52,504 --> 04:47:54,630
I can always think of something to do other than

7012
04:47:54,630 --> 04:47:56,850
to spin up instances and run an experiment.

7013
04:47:56,850 --> 04:47:59,809
I can keep working on my local titans or something.

7014
04:47:59,809 --> 04:48:01,860
But it was really stupid.

7015
04:48:01,860 --> 04:48:03,330
I mean, it was not a lot of money.

7016
04:48:03,330 --> 04:48:05,880
I should have been running more experiments there.

7017
04:48:05,880 --> 04:48:06,950
So I thought to myself, well,

7018
04:48:06,950 --> 04:48:10,530
I'm gonna go buy a quarter million dollar DGX station,

7019
04:48:10,530 --> 04:48:12,090
I'm gonna just like sit it right there

7020
04:48:12,090 --> 04:48:14,060
and it's gonna mock me if I'm not using it.

7021
04:48:14,060 --> 04:48:16,230
If the fans aren't running on that thing,

7022
04:48:16,230 --> 04:48:18,540
I'm not properly utilizing it.

7023
04:48:18,540 --> 04:48:19,620
And that's been helpful.

7024
04:48:19,620 --> 04:48:22,230
You know, I've done a lot more experiments since then.

7025
04:48:22,230 --> 04:48:23,820
It's been interesting

7026
04:48:23,820 --> 04:48:25,320
where I thought I'd be doing all this

7027
04:48:25,320 --> 04:48:27,300
low level envy link optimized stuff,

7028
04:48:27,300 --> 04:48:29,940
but 90% of what I do is just spin up four instances

7029
04:48:29,940 --> 04:48:32,850
of an experiment with different hyper parameters on it.

7030
04:48:32,850 --> 04:48:34,118
- Oh, interesting.

7031
04:48:34,118 --> 04:48:37,140
So you're doing like really sort of building up intuition

7032
04:48:37,140 --> 04:48:39,393
by doing ML experiments of different kinds.

7033
04:48:40,650 --> 04:48:43,525
- But so the next big thing though is I am,

7034
04:48:43,525 --> 04:48:47,580
I decided that I was gonna take some investor money

7035
04:48:47,580 --> 04:48:50,730
because I have an overactive sense

7036
04:48:50,730 --> 04:48:53,220
of responsibility about other people's money.

7037
04:48:53,220 --> 04:48:57,360
And it's like, I don't want, I mean a lot

7038
04:48:57,360 --> 04:49:01,560
of my push and my passionate in treaties for things at Meta,

7039
04:49:01,560 --> 04:49:02,670
it's like I don't want Zuck

7040
04:49:02,670 --> 04:49:05,160
to have wasted his money investing in Oculus.

7041
04:49:05,160 --> 04:49:06,300
I want it to work out.

7042
04:49:06,300 --> 04:49:07,710
I want it to change the world.

7043
04:49:07,710 --> 04:49:10,500
I want it to be worth all of this time, money,

7044
04:49:10,500 --> 04:49:12,180
and effort going into it.

7045
04:49:12,180 --> 04:49:14,893
And I expect that it's going to be that like that

7046
04:49:14,893 --> 04:49:17,373
with my company where.

7047
04:49:17,373 --> 04:49:19,553
- [Lex] It's a huge forcing function, this investment.

7048
04:49:19,553 --> 04:49:21,930
- I have investors that are going

7049
04:49:21,930 --> 04:49:23,310
to expect something of me.

7050
04:49:23,310 --> 04:49:25,410
Now, we've all had the conversation

7051
04:49:25,410 --> 04:49:28,230
that this is a low probability long-term bet.

7052
04:49:28,230 --> 04:49:31,110
It's not something that there's a million things I could do

7053
04:49:31,110 --> 04:49:33,720
that I would have line of sight on the value proposition

7054
04:49:33,720 --> 04:49:35,167
for this isn't that, I think there are,

7055
04:49:35,167 --> 04:49:38,220
there are unknown unknowns in the way,

7056
04:49:38,220 --> 04:49:39,900
but it's one of these things

7057
04:49:39,900 --> 04:49:43,650
that it's hyper bull but it's potentially one

7058
04:49:43,650 --> 04:49:45,810
of the most important things humans ever do.

7059
04:49:45,810 --> 04:49:48,210
And it's something that I think is within our lifetimes,

7060
04:49:48,210 --> 04:49:51,510
if not within a decade to happen.

7061
04:49:51,510 --> 04:49:55,830
So yeah, this is just now happening like term sheet,

7062
04:49:55,830 --> 04:49:58,290
like the ink is barely virtual in's barely dry off.

7063
04:49:58,290 --> 04:49:59,190
- It's drying.

7064
04:49:59,190 --> 04:50:01,080
I mean, as I mentioned to you offline,

7065
04:50:01,080 --> 04:50:02,200
like somebody I admire

7066
04:50:03,198 --> 04:50:04,770
and somebody you know, Andre Pathy,

7067
04:50:04,770 --> 04:50:07,470
I think the two of you, different trajectories in life,

7068
04:50:07,470 --> 04:50:09,810
but approach problems similarly

7069
04:50:09,810 --> 04:50:12,883
in that he codes stuff from scratch up all the time.

7070
04:50:12,883 --> 04:50:17,643
And he's created a bunch of little things outside of,

7071
04:50:18,540 --> 04:50:21,603
even outside the course at Stanford

7072
04:50:21,603 --> 04:50:24,000
that have been tremendously useful

7073
04:50:24,000 --> 04:50:27,780
to build up intuition about stuff, but also to help people.

7074
04:50:27,780 --> 04:50:30,460
And they're all in the realm of AI.

7075
04:50:30,460 --> 04:50:34,350
Do you see yourself potentially doing things like this

7076
04:50:34,350 --> 04:50:37,380
or not necessarily solving a gigantic problem,

7077
04:50:37,380 --> 04:50:38,550
but on the journey,

7078
04:50:38,550 --> 04:50:42,630
on the path to that building up intuitions

7079
04:50:42,630 --> 04:50:47,610
and sharing code or ideas

7080
04:50:47,610 --> 04:50:52,560
or systems that give inklings of AGI

7081
04:50:52,560 --> 04:50:55,460
but also kind of are useful to people in some way?

7082
04:50:55,460 --> 04:50:56,293
- So yeah.

7083
04:50:56,293 --> 04:50:57,210
First of all, Andre is awesome.

7084
04:50:57,210 --> 04:50:58,620
I learned a lot when I was going

7085
04:50:58,620 --> 04:51:00,930
through my larval phase from his blog posts

7086
04:51:00,930 --> 04:51:04,140
and his Stanford course and super valuable.

7087
04:51:04,140 --> 04:51:06,240
I got to meet him first a couple years ago

7088
04:51:06,240 --> 04:51:08,400
when I was first kind of starting off

7089
04:51:08,400 --> 04:51:11,100
on my gentleman scientist bit.

7090
04:51:11,100 --> 04:51:13,440
And just a couple months ago

7091
04:51:13,440 --> 04:51:16,560
when he went out on his sabbatical, he stopped by in Dallas

7092
04:51:16,560 --> 04:51:17,670
and we talked for a while

7093
04:51:17,670 --> 04:51:19,650
and I had a great time with him.

7094
04:51:19,650 --> 04:51:21,390
And then when I heard he actually left Tesla,

7095
04:51:21,390 --> 04:51:24,187
I did of course along with a hundred other people say,

7096
04:51:24,187 --> 04:51:27,870
"Hey, if you ever wanna work with me, it would be an honor."

7097
04:51:27,870 --> 04:51:29,670
- Yeah. - So he thinks

7098
04:51:29,670 --> 04:51:31,440
that he's gonna be doing this educational work,

7099
04:51:31,440 --> 04:51:33,360
but I think someone's gonna make him an offer he can't

7100
04:51:33,360 --> 04:51:36,510
refuse before he gets too far along on it.

7101
04:51:36,510 --> 04:51:39,547
- Oh, his current interest is the educational side.

7102
04:51:39,547 --> 04:51:42,810
He's a special mind.

7103
04:51:42,810 --> 04:51:43,980
Is there something you could speak

7104
04:51:43,980 --> 04:51:46,410
to what makes him so special?

7105
04:51:46,410 --> 04:51:47,370
So from your understanding.

7106
04:51:47,370 --> 04:51:48,600
- Like he did,

7107
04:51:48,600 --> 04:51:50,670
he was very much a programmer's programmer

7108
04:51:50,670 --> 04:51:51,990
that was doing machine learning

7109
04:51:51,990 --> 04:51:52,853
work rather than- - That's right.

7110
04:51:52,853 --> 04:51:56,010
- It's a different feel than an academic

7111
04:51:56,010 --> 04:51:57,940
where you can see it in paper sometimes where somebody

7112
04:51:57,940 --> 04:52:01,500
that's really a mathematician or a statistician at heart

7113
04:52:01,500 --> 04:52:04,260
and they're doing something with machine learning,

7114
04:52:04,260 --> 04:52:07,050
but you know, Andre's about getting something done

7115
04:52:07,050 --> 04:52:09,990
and you could see it in like all of his earliest approaches

7116
04:52:09,990 --> 04:52:10,860
to, it's like, okay,

7117
04:52:10,860 --> 04:52:12,840
here's how reinforcement learning works.

7118
04:52:12,840 --> 04:52:14,580
Here's how recurrent neural networks work.

7119
04:52:14,580 --> 04:52:16,710
Here's how transformers work,

7120
04:52:16,710 --> 04:52:20,910
here's how I crypto works and I am,

7121
04:52:20,910 --> 04:52:23,640
and yeah, it's just, he's a hacker's,

7122
04:52:23,640 --> 04:52:24,480
one of his old posts

7123
04:52:24,480 --> 04:52:26,430
was like a hacker's guide to machine learning.

7124
04:52:26,430 --> 04:52:27,526
- [Lex] Yeah.

7125
04:52:27,526 --> 04:52:28,359
- And you know, he deprecated that and said,

7126
04:52:28,359 --> 04:52:29,820
don't really pay attention to what's in here.

7127
04:52:29,820 --> 04:52:33,750
But it's that thought that carries through in a lot of it

7128
04:52:33,750 --> 04:52:36,960
where it is that back again to that hacker mentality

7129
04:52:36,960 --> 04:52:38,850
and the hacker ethic with what he's doing

7130
04:52:38,850 --> 04:52:40,513
and sharing all of it.

7131
04:52:40,513 --> 04:52:43,620
- Yeah and a lot of his approach to new thing,

7132
04:52:43,620 --> 04:52:46,110
like you said, larva stage is,

7133
04:52:46,110 --> 04:52:48,750
let me code up the simplest possible thing

7134
04:52:48,750 --> 04:52:50,370
to build up intuition about it.

7135
04:52:50,370 --> 04:52:52,107
- Yeah, like I say, I sketch with structs

7136
04:52:52,107 --> 04:52:54,570
and things when I'm just thinking about a problem.

7137
04:52:54,570 --> 04:52:56,613
I'm thinking in some degree of code.

7138
04:52:58,140 --> 04:53:01,470
- You are also among many things a martial artist,

7139
04:53:01,470 --> 04:53:03,090
both judo and jujitsu.

7140
04:53:03,090 --> 04:53:07,200
How has this helped make you the person you are?

7141
04:53:07,200 --> 04:53:09,210
- So, I mean, I was a competent club player

7142
04:53:09,210 --> 04:53:10,890
in judo and grappling.

7143
04:53:10,890 --> 04:53:14,010
I mean, I was by no means any kind of a superstar,

7144
04:53:14,010 --> 04:53:16,860
but it was, I went through a few phases

7145
04:53:16,860 --> 04:53:20,550
with it where I did some, when I was quite young,

7146
04:53:20,550 --> 04:53:22,263
a little bit more when I was 17,

7147
04:53:23,310 --> 04:53:27,180
and then I got into it kind of seriously in my mid '30s

7148
04:53:27,180 --> 04:53:29,100
and I went pretty far with it

7149
04:53:29,100 --> 04:53:31,080
and I was pretty good at some

7150
04:53:31,080 --> 04:53:32,700
of the things that I was doing.

7151
04:53:32,700 --> 04:53:35,970
And I did appreciate it quite a bit where,

7152
04:53:35,970 --> 04:53:37,530
and on the one hand it's always,

7153
04:53:37,530 --> 04:53:39,270
if you're gonna do exercise or something,

7154
04:53:39,270 --> 04:53:41,370
it's a more motivating form of exercise.

7155
04:53:41,370 --> 04:53:44,265
If someone is crushing you are like,

7156
04:53:44,265 --> 04:53:46,830
you are motivated to do something about that.

7157
04:53:46,830 --> 04:53:47,970
To up your attributes

7158
04:53:47,970 --> 04:53:50,146
and be better about getting outta that.

7159
04:53:50,146 --> 04:53:51,780
- Attributes, yes.

7160
04:53:51,780 --> 04:53:53,670
- But there's also that sense

7161
04:53:53,670 --> 04:53:57,210
that like I was not a sports guy.

7162
04:53:57,210 --> 04:53:59,670
I did do wrestling in junior high

7163
04:53:59,670 --> 04:54:02,280
and I often wish that, I think I would've,

7164
04:54:02,280 --> 04:54:04,140
I would've been good for me if I'd carried

7165
04:54:04,140 --> 04:54:07,140
that on into high school and had a little bit more of that.

7166
04:54:07,140 --> 04:54:09,630
I mean, it's like I, a little bit

7167
04:54:09,630 --> 04:54:12,900
of wrestling vibe with always going on about embracing

7168
04:54:12,900 --> 04:54:14,370
the grind and like that push

7169
04:54:14,370 --> 04:54:16,320
that I associate with the wrestling team

7170
04:54:16,320 --> 04:54:18,600
that yes, that in hindsight,

7171
04:54:18,600 --> 04:54:21,960
I wish I had gone through that and pushed myself that way.

7172
04:54:21,960 --> 04:54:24,900
But even getting back into judo and jiujitsu

7173
04:54:24,900 --> 04:54:28,620
in my mid-30s as usually the old man on the mat with that,

7174
04:54:28,620 --> 04:54:33,620
there was still the sense that working out with the group

7175
04:54:34,830 --> 04:54:36,660
and having the guys

7176
04:54:36,660 --> 04:54:38,910
that you're beating each other up with it,

7177
04:54:38,910 --> 04:54:41,547
but you just feel good coming out of it.

7178
04:54:41,547 --> 04:54:46,500
And I can remember those driving home aching in various ways

7179
04:54:46,500 --> 04:54:49,290
and just thinking it's like, oh, that was really great.

7180
04:54:49,290 --> 04:54:52,500
And it's mixing with a bunch of people

7181
04:54:52,500 --> 04:54:54,264
that had nothing to do with any of the things

7182
04:54:54,264 --> 04:54:55,860
that I worked with.

7183
04:54:55,860 --> 04:54:57,390
You know, every once in a while someone would be like,

7184
04:54:57,390 --> 04:54:58,839
oh, you're the Doom guy.

7185
04:54:58,839 --> 04:55:03,390
But for the most part it was just different slice of life,

7186
04:55:03,390 --> 04:55:04,560
you know, a good thing.

7187
04:55:04,560 --> 04:55:07,170
And I made the call when I was 40

7188
04:55:07,170 --> 04:55:09,159
that's like, maybe I'm getting a little old for this.

7189
04:55:09,159 --> 04:55:11,970
I had separated a rib and tweaked a few things

7190
04:55:11,970 --> 04:55:15,570
and as one does without any really bad injuries.

7191
04:55:15,570 --> 04:55:18,030
And it was like, have I dodged enough bullets?

7192
04:55:18,030 --> 04:55:20,100
Should I hang it up?

7193
04:55:20,100 --> 04:55:22,760
I went back, I've gone a couple times

7194
04:55:22,760 --> 04:55:25,050
in the last decade trying to get my kids

7195
04:55:25,050 --> 04:55:26,130
into it a little bit.

7196
04:55:26,130 --> 04:55:27,780
I didn't really stick with any of them,

7197
04:55:27,780 --> 04:55:30,030
but it was fun to get back on the mats.

7198
04:55:30,030 --> 04:55:33,582
I really hurts for a while when you haven't gone,

7199
04:55:33,582 --> 04:55:34,415
I gone for a while,

7200
04:55:34,415 --> 04:55:37,710
but I still debate this pretty constantly.

7201
04:55:37,710 --> 04:55:39,480
My brother's only a year younger than me

7202
04:55:39,480 --> 04:55:41,970
and he's going kind of hard in jujitsu right now.

7203
04:55:41,970 --> 04:55:44,520
And he was just, he won a few medals

7204
04:55:44,520 --> 04:55:45,990
at the last tournament he was at.

7205
04:55:45,990 --> 04:55:47,307
- [Lex] So he's competing too? - Yeah.

7206
04:55:47,307 --> 04:55:48,660
And I was thinking, yeah,

7207
04:55:48,660 --> 04:55:51,930
I guess we're in the executive division if you're over 50,

7208
04:55:51,930 --> 04:55:53,910
we're over 45 or something.

7209
04:55:53,910 --> 04:55:56,490
And it's not outta the question

7210
04:55:56,490 --> 04:55:58,980
that I go back at some point and do some of this,

7211
04:55:58,980 --> 04:56:03,150
but again, I'm just reorganizing my life around more focus.

7212
04:56:03,150 --> 04:56:04,680
Probably not gonna happen.

7213
04:56:04,680 --> 04:56:07,020
I'm pushing my exercise around

7214
04:56:07,020 --> 04:56:10,230
to give me longer uninterrupted intellectual focus time,

7215
04:56:10,230 --> 04:56:11,690
pushing it to the beginning or the end of the day.

7216
04:56:11,690 --> 04:56:14,220
- Like running and stuff like that, or walking, yeah.

7217
04:56:14,220 --> 04:56:15,810
- [John] Yeah, I running in calisthenics

7218
04:56:15,810 --> 04:56:17,670
and some things like that, but-

7219
04:56:17,670 --> 04:56:19,950
- It allows you to still think about a problem and yeah.

7220
04:56:19,950 --> 04:56:22,215
- But if you're going to a judo club or something,

7221
04:56:22,215 --> 04:56:24,330
you've got a fixed, it's gonna be seven o'clock

7222
04:56:24,330 --> 04:56:26,604
or whatever, 10 o'clock on Saturday.

7223
04:56:26,604 --> 04:56:28,980
Although I talked about this a little bit

7224
04:56:28,980 --> 04:56:31,200
when I was on Rogan and shortly after that,

7225
04:56:31,200 --> 04:56:32,787
Carlos Machado did reach out

7226
04:56:32,787 --> 04:56:36,120
and I had trained with him for years back in the day

7227
04:56:36,120 --> 04:56:38,970
and he was like, hey, we've got kind of a small private club

7228
04:56:38,970 --> 04:56:41,700
with a bunch of kind of executive type people

7229
04:56:41,700 --> 04:56:45,330
and it does tempt me.

7230
04:56:45,330 --> 04:56:46,920
- Yeah, I don't know if you know him,

7231
04:56:46,920 --> 04:56:49,990
but John Danaher moved here to Austin

7232
04:56:50,910 --> 04:56:52,590
with Gordon Ryan and a few other folks.

7233
04:56:52,590 --> 04:56:56,850
And he has a very interesting way, very deep, systematic way

7234
04:56:56,850 --> 04:57:01,803
of thinking about jiujitsu that reveals the chest of it,

7235
04:57:03,422 --> 04:57:06,630
like the science of it.

7236
04:57:06,630 --> 04:57:08,880
- And I do think about that more as kind

7237
04:57:08,880 --> 04:57:11,040
of an older person considering the martial arts

7238
04:57:11,040 --> 04:57:11,873
where I can remember

7239
04:57:11,873 --> 04:57:14,520
the very earliest days getting back into judo

7240
04:57:14,520 --> 04:57:16,357
and I'm like, teach me submissions right now, right?

7241
04:57:16,357 --> 04:57:20,040
You know, it's like learn the arm bar, learn the choke.

7242
04:57:20,040 --> 04:57:22,440
But yeah, as you get older you start thinking more about,

7243
04:57:22,440 --> 04:57:23,273
it's like, okay,

7244
04:57:23,273 --> 04:57:26,190
I really do wanna like learn the entire cannon of judo.

7245
04:57:26,190 --> 04:57:27,957
It's like, or all the different things there

7246
04:57:27,957 --> 04:57:30,360
and like all the different approaches for it.

7247
04:57:30,360 --> 04:57:32,310
Not just the, if you want to compete,

7248
04:57:32,310 --> 04:57:33,143
there's just a handful

7249
04:57:33,143 --> 04:57:34,710
of things you learn really, really well,

7250
04:57:34,710 --> 04:57:36,360
but sometimes there's interest

7251
04:57:36,360 --> 04:57:38,400
in learning a little bit more of the scope there

7252
04:57:38,400 --> 04:57:40,084
and figuring some things out from,

7253
04:57:40,084 --> 04:57:43,650
at one point I had wasn't exactly a spreadsheet,

7254
04:57:43,650 --> 04:57:46,230
but I did have a big long text file

7255
04:57:46,230 --> 04:57:47,730
with like, here's the things that I learned

7256
04:57:47,730 --> 04:57:50,340
and here are like ways you chain this together.

7257
04:57:50,340 --> 04:57:53,730
And while when I went back a few years ago,

7258
04:57:53,730 --> 04:57:54,633
it was good to see

7259
04:57:54,633 --> 04:57:57,120
that I whipped myself back into reasonable shape

7260
04:57:57,120 --> 04:57:58,770
about doing the basic grappling.

7261
04:57:58,770 --> 04:58:01,530
But I know there was a ton of the subtleties that were just,

7262
04:58:01,530 --> 04:58:02,820
that were gone but could probably

7263
04:58:02,820 --> 04:58:04,980
be brought back reasonably quickly.

7264
04:58:04,980 --> 04:58:06,840
- And there's also the benefit, I mean,

7265
04:58:06,840 --> 04:58:09,213
you're exceptionally successful now.

7266
04:58:10,198 --> 04:58:15,198
You're brilliant and the old problem of the ego.

7267
04:58:16,440 --> 04:58:20,070
- Yeah, I still pushed kind of harder than I should.

7268
04:58:20,070 --> 04:58:20,903
I mean that was,

7269
04:58:20,903 --> 04:58:24,780
I was one of those people that I'm on the smaller side

7270
04:58:24,780 --> 04:58:27,000
for a lot of the people competing.

7271
04:58:27,000 --> 04:58:30,570
And I'd go with all the big guys and I'd go hard.

7272
04:58:30,570 --> 04:58:32,580
And I'd push myself a lot

7273
04:58:32,580 --> 04:58:37,200
and that would be one of those where I'd be dangerous

7274
04:58:37,200 --> 04:58:38,730
to anyone for the first five minutes.

7275
04:58:38,730 --> 04:58:40,950
But then sometimes after that I'm already dead.

7276
04:58:40,950 --> 04:58:42,600
And I knew it was terrible for me

7277
04:58:42,600 --> 04:58:45,868
'cause it meant I got less training time

7278
04:58:45,868 --> 04:58:47,393
with all of that when you go

7279
04:58:47,393 --> 04:58:50,700
and you just gas out relatively quickly there.

7280
04:58:50,700 --> 04:58:53,880
And I like to think that I would be better about that

7281
04:58:53,880 --> 04:58:55,530
where after I gave up judo,

7282
04:58:55,530 --> 04:58:57,060
I started doing the half marathons

7283
04:58:57,060 --> 04:58:58,980
and tough butters and things like that.

7284
04:58:58,980 --> 04:59:02,580
And so when I did go back to the local Judo kai club,

7285
04:59:02,580 --> 04:59:03,413
I thought it's like,

7286
04:59:03,413 --> 04:59:04,367
oh, I should have better cardio for this.

7287
04:59:04,367 --> 04:59:07,080
'Cause I'm a runner now and I do all of this

7288
04:59:07,080 --> 04:59:08,207
and didn't work out that way.

7289
04:59:08,207 --> 04:59:11,760
It was the same old thing where just push really hard,

7290
04:59:11,760 --> 04:59:12,810
strain really hard.

7291
04:59:12,810 --> 04:59:16,230
And of course when I worked with good guys like Carlos,

7292
04:59:16,230 --> 04:59:18,030
it's like he just, the whole flow,

7293
04:59:18,030 --> 04:59:20,703
like water thing is real and he's just like-

7294
04:59:20,703 --> 04:59:21,536
- That's true with judo too.

7295
04:59:21,536 --> 04:59:23,940
Some of the best people like I've trained

7296
04:59:23,940 --> 04:59:25,230
with Olympic gold medalists

7297
04:59:25,230 --> 04:59:29,400
and for some reason with them everything's easier.

7298
04:59:29,400 --> 04:59:34,380
Everything is, you actually start to feel the science of it,

7299
04:59:34,380 --> 04:59:36,471
the music of it, the dance of it.

7300
04:59:36,471 --> 04:59:38,373
Everything is effortless.

7301
04:59:39,720 --> 04:59:42,180
You understand that there's an art to it.

7302
04:59:42,180 --> 04:59:43,530
It's not just an exercise.

7303
04:59:43,530 --> 04:59:45,180
- Yeah, it was interesting where I did go

7304
04:59:45,180 --> 04:59:47,850
to the Kode Con in Japan, kind of the birthplace

7305
04:59:47,850 --> 04:59:49,260
of judo and everything.

7306
04:59:49,260 --> 04:59:51,540
And I remember I rolled with one old guy,

7307
04:59:51,540 --> 04:59:55,000
I didn't start standing, just started on ground work

7308
04:59:55,890 --> 04:59:58,500
and it was striking how different it was from Carlos.

7309
04:59:58,500 --> 05:00:00,690
He was still, he was better than me and he got my arm

7310
05:00:00,690 --> 05:00:02,490
and I had to tap there,

7311
05:00:02,490 --> 05:00:04,920
but it was a completely different style

7312
05:00:04,920 --> 05:00:06,930
where I just felt like I could do nothing.

7313
05:00:06,930 --> 05:00:07,763
He was just enveloping me

7314
05:00:07,763 --> 05:00:09,300
and just like slowly ground it down

7315
05:00:09,300 --> 05:00:13,320
and took my arm and bent it while with Carlos,

7316
05:00:13,320 --> 05:00:14,580
he's just loose and free

7317
05:00:14,580 --> 05:00:15,660
and you always thought like, oh,

7318
05:00:15,660 --> 05:00:17,010
you're just gonna go grab something.

7319
05:00:17,010 --> 05:00:18,726
But never had any chance to do it.

7320
05:00:18,726 --> 05:00:20,040
That's, but it was a very different feeling.

7321
05:00:20,040 --> 05:00:21,600
- That's a good summary of the difference

7322
05:00:21,600 --> 05:00:23,220
between jiujitsu and judo.

7323
05:00:23,220 --> 05:00:24,240
In jiujitsu,

7324
05:00:24,240 --> 05:00:26,760
it is a dance and you feel like there's a freedom.

7325
05:00:26,760 --> 05:00:31,470
And actually it anybody, I try like the Gordon Ryan,

7326
05:00:31,470 --> 05:00:33,473
one of the best grappler in the world,

7327
05:00:33,473 --> 05:00:35,790
Nogi grappler in the world.

7328
05:00:35,790 --> 05:00:38,610
There's a feeling like you can do anything,

7329
05:00:38,610 --> 05:00:41,670
but when you actually try to do something, you can't.

7330
05:00:41,670 --> 05:00:42,900
- Just magically doesn't work.

7331
05:00:42,900 --> 05:00:44,810
- But with the best judo players in the world, yeah,

7332
05:00:44,810 --> 05:00:48,060
it does feel like there's a blanket

7333
05:00:48,060 --> 05:00:50,340
that weighs a thousand pounds on top of you.

7334
05:00:50,340 --> 05:00:53,310
And there's not a feeling like you can do anything.

7335
05:00:53,310 --> 05:00:54,780
You just, you're trapped.

7336
05:00:54,780 --> 05:00:56,400
And that's a style,

7337
05:00:56,400 --> 05:00:58,920
that's a difference in the style of martial arts.

7338
05:00:58,920 --> 05:01:01,980
But it's also once you start to study,

7339
05:01:01,980 --> 05:01:04,530
you understand it all has to do with human movement

7340
05:01:04,530 --> 05:01:06,120
and the physics of it and the leverage

7341
05:01:06,120 --> 05:01:07,050
and all that kind of stuff.

7342
05:01:07,050 --> 05:01:08,310
And that's like. - [John] Yeah.

7343
05:01:08,310 --> 05:01:09,360
- That's super fascinating.

7344
05:01:09,360 --> 05:01:12,177
At the end of the day, for me, the biggest benefit is,

7345
05:01:12,177 --> 05:01:15,093
and the humbling aspect when another human being,

7346
05:01:16,950 --> 05:01:20,520
kind of tells you that there's a hierarchy

7347
05:01:20,520 --> 05:01:25,520
or you're not that special.

7348
05:01:25,624 --> 05:01:26,730
- Yeah and in the most extreme case,

7349
05:01:26,730 --> 05:01:30,360
when you tap to a choke, you are basically living

7350
05:01:30,360 --> 05:01:32,160
because somebody lets you live.

7351
05:01:32,160 --> 05:01:34,224
And that is one of those, if you think about it,

7352
05:01:34,224 --> 05:01:36,480
that is a closer brush with mortality

7353
05:01:36,480 --> 05:01:38,943
than most people consider.

7354
05:01:40,770 --> 05:01:44,790
- And that kind of humbling act is good to take

7355
05:01:44,790 --> 05:01:46,770
to your work then where it's harder

7356
05:01:46,770 --> 05:01:48,960
to get humbled, you know?

7357
05:01:48,960 --> 05:01:51,600
- Yeah, 'cause nobody that does any martial art

7358
05:01:51,600 --> 05:01:54,480
is coming out thinking I'm the best in the world at anything

7359
05:01:54,480 --> 05:01:56,373
because everybody loses.

7360
05:01:57,360 --> 05:01:59,700
- Let me ask you for advice.

7361
05:01:59,700 --> 05:02:04,260
What advice would you give to young people today about life,

7362
05:02:04,260 --> 05:02:05,640
about career?

7363
05:02:05,640 --> 05:02:09,480
How they can have a job, how they can have an impact,

7364
05:02:09,480 --> 05:02:11,973
how they can have a life they could be proud of.

7365
05:02:12,930 --> 05:02:14,370
- So it was kind of fun.

7366
05:02:14,370 --> 05:02:17,052
I got invited to give the commencement speech back

7367
05:02:17,052 --> 05:02:21,420
I went to a college for two semesters and dropped out

7368
05:02:21,420 --> 05:02:23,033
and went on to do my tech stuff,

7369
05:02:23,033 --> 05:02:24,990
but they still wanted me to come back

7370
05:02:24,990 --> 05:02:26,730
and give a commencement speech.

7371
05:02:26,730 --> 05:02:29,190
And I've got that pinned on my Twitter account

7372
05:02:29,190 --> 05:02:32,340
and I still feel good about everything that I said there.

7373
05:02:32,340 --> 05:02:36,660
And, you know, my biggest point was that the path

7374
05:02:36,660 --> 05:02:38,580
for me might not be the path for everyone.

7375
05:02:38,580 --> 05:02:41,640
And in fact, the advice, the path that I took

7376
05:02:41,640 --> 05:02:45,300
and even the advice that I would give based on my experience

7377
05:02:45,300 --> 05:02:49,020
and learnings probably isn't the best advice for everyone.

7378
05:02:49,020 --> 05:02:52,500
Because what I did was all about this knowledge and depth.

7379
05:02:52,500 --> 05:02:56,370
It was about not just having this surface level ability

7380
05:02:56,370 --> 05:02:57,750
to make things do what I want,

7381
05:02:57,750 --> 05:02:59,850
but to really understand them through and through,

7382
05:02:59,850 --> 05:03:02,460
to let me do the systems engineering work.

7383
05:03:02,460 --> 05:03:05,190
And to sometimes find these inefficiencies

7384
05:03:05,190 --> 05:03:07,170
that can be bypassed

7385
05:03:07,170 --> 05:03:09,367
and that the whole world doesn't need that.

7386
05:03:09,367 --> 05:03:11,460
You know, most programmers don't need,

7387
05:03:11,460 --> 05:03:14,280
or engineers of any kind don't necessarily need to do that.

7388
05:03:14,280 --> 05:03:15,990
They need to do a little job

7389
05:03:15,990 --> 05:03:19,170
that's been parceled out to them, be reliable.

7390
05:03:19,170 --> 05:03:20,700
Let people depend on you.

7391
05:03:20,700 --> 05:03:22,920
Do quality work with all of that.

7392
05:03:22,920 --> 05:03:26,850
But people that do have an inclination for wanting

7393
05:03:26,850 --> 05:03:30,201
to know things deeper and learn things deeper.

7394
05:03:30,201 --> 05:03:33,210
You know, there are just layers

7395
05:03:33,210 --> 05:03:34,950
and layers of things out there.

7396
05:03:34,950 --> 05:03:36,720
And it's amazing.

7397
05:03:36,720 --> 05:03:40,157
If you're the right person that is excited about that,

7398
05:03:40,157 --> 05:03:42,810
the world's never been like this before.

7399
05:03:42,810 --> 05:03:43,800
It's better than ever.

7400
05:03:43,800 --> 05:03:45,390
I mean, everything that was wonderful

7401
05:03:45,390 --> 05:03:46,800
for me is still there.

7402
05:03:46,800 --> 05:03:48,570
And there's whole new worlds

7403
05:03:48,570 --> 05:03:52,020
to explore on the different things that you can do

7404
05:03:52,020 --> 05:03:55,140
and that it's hard work.

7405
05:03:55,140 --> 05:03:59,370
Embrace the grind with it and understand as much as you can.

7406
05:03:59,370 --> 05:04:02,340
And then be prepared for opportunities

7407
05:04:02,340 --> 05:04:05,190
to present themselves where you can't just say,

7408
05:04:05,190 --> 05:04:06,420
this is my goal in life.

7409
05:04:06,420 --> 05:04:07,373
And just push at that.

7410
05:04:07,373 --> 05:04:09,360
I mean, you might be able to do that,

7411
05:04:09,360 --> 05:04:12,330
but you're going to make more total progress if you say,

7412
05:04:12,330 --> 05:04:15,660
I'm preparing myself with this broad set of tools

7413
05:04:15,660 --> 05:04:19,140
and then I'm being aware of all the way things are changing

7414
05:04:19,140 --> 05:04:20,117
as I move through the world

7415
05:04:20,117 --> 05:04:22,650
and as the whole world changes around me.

7416
05:04:22,650 --> 05:04:24,180
And then looking for opportunities

7417
05:04:24,180 --> 05:04:26,460
to deploy the tools that you've built.

7418
05:04:26,460 --> 05:04:28,800
And there's going to be more and more

7419
05:04:28,800 --> 05:04:32,010
of those types of things there where an awareness

7420
05:04:32,010 --> 05:04:34,590
of what's happening, where the inefficiencies are,

7421
05:04:34,590 --> 05:04:36,210
what things can be done,

7422
05:04:36,210 --> 05:04:39,180
what's possible versus what's current practice.

7423
05:04:39,180 --> 05:04:41,970
And then finding those areas where you can go

7424
05:04:41,970 --> 05:04:42,990
and make an adjustment

7425
05:04:42,990 --> 05:04:46,140
and make something that may affect millions

7426
05:04:46,140 --> 05:04:49,230
or billions of people in the world make it better.

7427
05:04:49,230 --> 05:04:51,652
- When maybe from your own example,

7428
05:04:51,652 --> 05:04:54,300
how were you able to recognize this about yourself?

7429
05:04:54,300 --> 05:04:57,117
That you saw the layers in a particular thing

7430
05:04:57,117 --> 05:05:00,090
and you were drawn to discovering deeper

7431
05:05:00,090 --> 05:05:01,710
and deeper truths about it.

7432
05:05:01,710 --> 05:05:03,180
Is that something that was obvious

7433
05:05:03,180 --> 05:05:04,680
to you that you couldn't help?

7434
05:05:04,680 --> 05:05:06,510
Or is there some actions you had to take

7435
05:05:06,510 --> 05:05:08,780
to actually allow yourself to dig deep?

7436
05:05:08,780 --> 05:05:11,310
- So in the earliest days of personal computers,

7437
05:05:11,310 --> 05:05:13,470
I remember the reference manuals

7438
05:05:13,470 --> 05:05:15,600
and the very early ones even had schematics

7439
05:05:15,600 --> 05:05:17,820
of computers in the background in the back

7440
05:05:17,820 --> 05:05:21,960
of the books as well as firmware listings and things.

7441
05:05:21,960 --> 05:05:23,190
And I could look at that

7442
05:05:23,190 --> 05:05:25,950
and at that time when I was a younger teenager,

7443
05:05:25,950 --> 05:05:27,990
I didn't understand a lot of that stuff.

7444
05:05:27,990 --> 05:05:29,814
How the different things worked.

7445
05:05:29,814 --> 05:05:32,910
I was pulling out the information that I could get,

7446
05:05:32,910 --> 05:05:35,070
but I always wanted to know all of that.

7447
05:05:35,070 --> 05:05:37,020
There was like kind of magical

7448
05:05:37,020 --> 05:05:38,730
information sitting down there.

7449
05:05:38,730 --> 05:05:41,215
It's like the elder lore that some gray beard wizard,

7450
05:05:41,215 --> 05:05:42,797
who is the keeper of,

7451
05:05:42,797 --> 05:05:46,860
and so I always felt that pull for wanting to know more,

7452
05:05:46,860 --> 05:05:51,510
wanting to explore the mysterious areas there.

7453
05:05:51,510 --> 05:05:52,347
And you know,

7454
05:05:52,347 --> 05:05:54,510
and that followed right in through all the things

7455
05:05:54,510 --> 05:05:57,360
that got the value, exploring the video cards leading

7456
05:05:57,360 --> 05:06:00,479
to the scrolling advantages,

7457
05:06:00,479 --> 05:06:02,970
exploring some of the academic papers and things,

7458
05:06:02,970 --> 05:06:04,650
learning about BSP trees

7459
05:06:04,650 --> 05:06:06,569
and the different things that I could do

7460
05:06:06,569 --> 05:06:08,700
with those systems

7461
05:06:08,700 --> 05:06:12,390
and just the huge phases going through aerospace,

7462
05:06:12,390 --> 05:06:15,180
just reading bookshelves full of books.

7463
05:06:15,180 --> 05:06:16,260
I mean, again, that point

7464
05:06:16,260 --> 05:06:18,601
where I have enough money I can buy all the books I want.

7465
05:06:18,601 --> 05:06:22,620
It was so valuable there where I was terrible

7466
05:06:22,620 --> 05:06:23,730
with my money when I was a kid.

7467
05:06:23,730 --> 05:06:25,350
My mom thought I would always be broke

7468
05:06:25,350 --> 05:06:28,530
because I'd buy my comic books and just be outta money.

7469
05:06:28,530 --> 05:06:30,960
But it was like all the pizza I want,

7470
05:06:30,960 --> 05:06:33,930
all the diet coke I want, video games and then books.

7471
05:06:33,930 --> 05:06:34,800
- [Lex] Books.

7472
05:06:34,800 --> 05:06:35,986
- And it didn't take that much.

7473
05:06:35,986 --> 05:06:36,819
- [Lex] Yeah.

7474
05:06:36,819 --> 05:06:39,720
- As soon as I was making 27K a year, I felt rich

7475
05:06:39,720 --> 05:06:42,360
and I was just getting all the things that I wanted.

7476
05:06:42,360 --> 05:06:44,550
But that sense of,

7477
05:06:44,550 --> 05:06:46,200
that's books have always been magical to me.

7478
05:06:46,200 --> 05:06:48,270
And that was one of the things that really made me smile

7479
05:06:48,270 --> 05:06:50,960
is I, Andre had said he found, when he came over

7480
05:06:50,960 --> 05:06:53,640
to my house, he said he found my library inspiring

7481
05:06:53,640 --> 05:06:54,883
just that I have.

7482
05:06:54,883 --> 05:06:55,770
And it was great to see,

7483
05:06:55,770 --> 05:06:57,300
I still look at him, he's kind of a younger guy.

7484
05:06:57,300 --> 05:07:00,270
I sometimes wonder if younger people these days have

7485
05:07:00,270 --> 05:07:02,430
the same relationship with books that I do

7486
05:07:02,430 --> 05:07:05,910
where they were such a cornerstone for me in so many ways.

7487
05:07:05,910 --> 05:07:08,400
But that sense that, yeah, I always wanted to know it all.

7488
05:07:08,400 --> 05:07:09,690
I know I can't.

7489
05:07:09,690 --> 05:07:11,190
And that was like one of the last things I said,

7490
05:07:11,190 --> 05:07:12,870
you know, you can't know everything,

7491
05:07:12,870 --> 05:07:14,220
but you should convince yourself

7492
05:07:14,220 --> 05:07:18,150
that you can know anything, any one particular thing.

7493
05:07:18,150 --> 05:07:20,040
It was created and discovered by humans.

7494
05:07:20,040 --> 05:07:22,770
You can learn it, you can find out what you need on there.

7495
05:07:22,770 --> 05:07:24,300
- And you can learn it deeply.

7496
05:07:24,300 --> 05:07:26,640
- Yeah, you can drive a nail down

7497
05:07:26,640 --> 05:07:29,610
through whatever layer cake problem space you've got

7498
05:07:29,610 --> 05:07:31,950
and learn a cross section there.

7499
05:07:31,950 --> 05:07:34,269
- And not only can you have an impact doing that,

7500
05:07:34,269 --> 05:07:37,680
you can attain happiness doing that.

7501
05:07:37,680 --> 05:07:39,000
There's something so fulfilling

7502
05:07:39,000 --> 05:07:41,100
about becoming a craftsman of a thing.

7503
05:07:41,100 --> 05:07:43,080
- Yeah and I don't want to tell people that, look,

7504
05:07:43,080 --> 05:07:44,910
this is a good career move.

7505
05:07:44,910 --> 05:07:47,395
Just grit your teeth and bear it.

7506
05:07:47,395 --> 05:07:49,410
You know, you want people,

7507
05:07:49,410 --> 05:07:52,350
and I do think it's possible sometimes

7508
05:07:52,350 --> 05:07:54,120
to find the joy in something

7509
05:07:54,120 --> 05:07:56,040
like it might not immediately appeal to you,

7510
05:07:56,040 --> 05:08:00,180
but I had told people early on, like in software times

7511
05:08:00,180 --> 05:08:03,690
that a lot of game developers are in it just

7512
05:08:03,690 --> 05:08:05,880
because they're so passionate about games.

7513
05:08:05,880 --> 05:08:08,910
But I was always really more flexible

7514
05:08:08,910 --> 05:08:11,520
in what appealed to me, where I said,

7515
05:08:11,520 --> 05:08:15,360
I think I could be quite engaged doing operating system work

7516
05:08:15,360 --> 05:08:16,530
or even database work.

7517
05:08:16,530 --> 05:08:19,350
I would find the interest in that

7518
05:08:19,350 --> 05:08:20,760
because I think most things

7519
05:08:20,760 --> 05:08:23,730
that are significant in the world have a lot of layers

7520
05:08:23,730 --> 05:08:24,910
and complexity to them

7521
05:08:24,910 --> 05:08:27,846
and a lot of opportunities hidden within them.

7522
05:08:27,846 --> 05:08:30,510
So that would probably be the most important thing

7523
05:08:30,510 --> 05:08:33,273
to encourage to people is that I am, you can,

7524
05:08:33,273 --> 05:08:35,460
it's like weaponized curiosity.

7525
05:08:35,460 --> 05:08:37,821
You can deploy your curiosity to find,

7526
05:08:37,821 --> 05:08:41,400
to kind of like make things useful and valuable to you,

7527
05:08:41,400 --> 05:08:43,920
even if they don't immediately appear that way.

7528
05:08:43,920 --> 05:08:45,420
- Deploy your curiosity.

7529
05:08:45,420 --> 05:08:46,945
Yeah, that's very true.

7530
05:08:46,945 --> 05:08:50,730
We've mentioned this debate point, whether mortality

7531
05:08:50,730 --> 05:08:54,930
or fear of mortality is fundamental to creating an AGI,

7532
05:08:54,930 --> 05:08:56,160
but let's talk

7533
05:08:56,160 --> 05:08:58,620
about whether it's fundamental to human beings.

7534
05:08:58,620 --> 05:09:01,440
Do you think about your own mortality?

7535
05:09:01,440 --> 05:09:03,077
- I really don't.

7536
05:09:03,077 --> 05:09:05,310
And you probably always have

7537
05:09:05,310 --> 05:09:06,810
to like take with a grain of salt

7538
05:09:06,810 --> 05:09:09,780
anything somebody says about fundamental things like that,

7539
05:09:09,780 --> 05:09:14,780
but I don't think about really aging,

7540
05:09:14,850 --> 05:09:19,770
impending death, legacy with my children, things like that.

7541
05:09:19,770 --> 05:09:21,570
And clearly it seems most

7542
05:09:21,570 --> 05:09:24,630
of the world does a lot more than I do.

7543
05:09:24,630 --> 05:09:25,470
- [Lex] Yeah.

7544
05:09:25,470 --> 05:09:27,810
- So I mean, I think I'm an outlier in that

7545
05:09:27,810 --> 05:09:32,700
where it's, yeah, it doesn't wind up being a real part

7546
05:09:32,700 --> 05:09:35,970
of my thinking and motivation about things.

7547
05:09:35,970 --> 05:09:40,620
- So daily existence is about sort of the people you love

7548
05:09:40,620 --> 05:09:42,757
and the problems before you.

7549
05:09:42,757 --> 05:09:44,520
- Yeah, I'm very much focused

7550
05:09:44,520 --> 05:09:47,094
on what I'm working on right now.

7551
05:09:47,094 --> 05:09:48,900
I do take that back.

7552
05:09:48,900 --> 05:09:51,900
There's one aspect where the kind of finiteness

7553
05:09:51,900 --> 05:09:53,640
of the life does impact me

7554
05:09:53,640 --> 05:09:56,910
and that is about thinking about the scope of the problems

7555
05:09:56,910 --> 05:10:00,210
that I'm working on when I decided to work on,

7556
05:10:00,210 --> 05:10:02,430
when I was like nuclear fission or AGI,

7557
05:10:02,430 --> 05:10:05,280
these are big ticket things that I,

7558
05:10:05,280 --> 05:10:08,550
that are impact large fractions of the world.

7559
05:10:08,550 --> 05:10:12,137
And I was thinking to myself at some level that okay,

7560
05:10:12,137 --> 05:10:15,930
I mean I may have a couple more swings at bat

7561
05:10:15,930 --> 05:10:17,730
with me at full capability,

7562
05:10:17,730 --> 05:10:21,686
but yes, my mental abilities will decay with age,

7563
05:10:21,686 --> 05:10:23,220
mostly inevitably.

7564
05:10:23,220 --> 05:10:26,460
I don't think it's a 0% chance that we will address some

7565
05:10:26,460 --> 05:10:28,470
of that before it becomes a problem for me,

7566
05:10:28,470 --> 05:10:31,740
I think exciting medical stuff in the next couple decades,

7567
05:10:31,740 --> 05:10:34,080
but I do have this kind of vague plan

7568
05:10:34,080 --> 05:10:36,270
that when I'm not at the top of my game

7569
05:10:36,270 --> 05:10:38,670
and I don't feel that I'm in a position

7570
05:10:38,670 --> 05:10:40,620
to put a dent in the world some way

7571
05:10:40,620 --> 05:10:42,420
that I'll probably wind up doing some kind

7572
05:10:42,420 --> 05:10:44,730
of recreational retro programming

7573
05:10:44,730 --> 05:10:47,010
or I'll work on something

7574
05:10:47,010 --> 05:10:50,280
that I would not devote my life to now,

7575
05:10:50,280 --> 05:10:52,110
but I can while away my time

7576
05:10:52,110 --> 05:10:54,363
as the old man gardening in the code worlds.

7577
05:10:55,857 --> 05:10:59,700
- And then to step back given bigger.

7578
05:10:59,700 --> 05:11:03,510
Let me ask you about why we're here we human beings,

7579
05:11:03,510 --> 05:11:04,800
what's the meaning of it all?

7580
05:11:04,800 --> 05:11:06,990
What's the meaning of life John Carmack?

7581
05:11:06,990 --> 05:11:09,030
- So very similar with that last question.

7582
05:11:09,030 --> 05:11:12,117
I know a lot of people fret about this question a lot,

7583
05:11:12,117 --> 05:11:14,040
and I just really don't.

7584
05:11:14,040 --> 05:11:15,510
- I really don't give damn.

7585
05:11:15,510 --> 05:11:18,600
- No, we are biological creatures.

7586
05:11:18,600 --> 05:11:20,765
That happenstance of evolution,

7587
05:11:20,765 --> 05:11:25,680
we have innate drives that evolution crafted for survival

7588
05:11:25,680 --> 05:11:27,750
and passing on of genetic codes.

7589
05:11:27,750 --> 05:11:32,700
I don't find a lot of value in trying

7590
05:11:32,700 --> 05:11:33,930
to go much deeper than that.

7591
05:11:33,930 --> 05:11:35,576
I have my motivations,

7592
05:11:35,576 --> 05:11:38,880
some of which are probably genetically coded

7593
05:11:38,880 --> 05:11:41,520
and many of which are contingent on my upbringing

7594
05:11:41,520 --> 05:11:43,830
and the path that I've had through my life.

7595
05:11:43,830 --> 05:11:48,240
I don't run into like states of depression or envy

7596
05:11:48,240 --> 05:11:52,020
or anything that winds up being a challenge

7597
05:11:52,020 --> 05:11:54,090
and forcing a degree of soul searching

7598
05:11:54,090 --> 05:11:55,530
with things like that.

7599
05:11:55,530 --> 05:11:59,253
I seem to be okay, kind of without that.

7600
05:12:00,690 --> 05:12:04,230
- As a brilliant ant in the ant colony without looking up

7601
05:12:04,230 --> 05:12:06,510
to the sky wondering why the hell am I here again?

7602
05:12:06,510 --> 05:12:07,343
- Yeah.

7603
05:12:07,343 --> 05:12:11,897
- So the the why of it, the incredible mystery

7604
05:12:13,140 --> 05:12:16,170
of the fact that we started, first of all the origin

7605
05:12:16,170 --> 05:12:20,089
of life on earth and from that, from single cell organisms,

7606
05:12:20,089 --> 05:12:23,730
the entirety of the evolutionary process took us somehow

7607
05:12:23,730 --> 05:12:26,070
to this incredibly intelligent thing

7608
05:12:26,070 --> 05:12:30,570
that is able to build Wolfenstein 3D and Doom and Quake

7609
05:12:30,570 --> 05:12:33,720
and take a crack at the problem of AGI

7610
05:12:33,720 --> 05:12:37,470
and create things that eventually supersede human beings.

7611
05:12:37,470 --> 05:12:41,253
That doesn't, the why of it is?

7612
05:12:42,330 --> 05:12:44,844
- It's been my experience that people

7613
05:12:44,844 --> 05:12:48,540
that don't focus on the here and now,

7614
05:12:48,540 --> 05:12:51,180
right in front of them, tend to be less effective.

7615
05:12:51,180 --> 05:12:52,890
I mean, it's not a 100%.

7616
05:12:52,890 --> 05:12:53,723
- Yeah.

7617
05:12:53,723 --> 05:12:55,410
- Vision matters to some people,

7618
05:12:55,410 --> 05:12:59,520
but it doesn't seem to be a necessary motivator for me,

7619
05:12:59,520 --> 05:13:01,410
and I think that the process

7620
05:13:01,410 --> 05:13:03,176
of getting there is usually done.

7621
05:13:03,176 --> 05:13:05,250
Again, it's like the magic of gradient descent.

7622
05:13:05,250 --> 05:13:06,144
- [Lex] Yeah. - People just don't believe

7623
05:13:06,144 --> 05:13:09,260
that just looking locally gets you to all

7624
05:13:09,260 --> 05:13:11,010
of these spectacular things

7625
05:13:11,010 --> 05:13:16,010
that's been the decades of looking at I really some

7626
05:13:16,230 --> 05:13:17,610
of the smartest people in the world

7627
05:13:17,610 --> 05:13:20,550
that would just push back forever against this idea

7628
05:13:20,550 --> 05:13:24,240
that it's not this grand sophisticated vision of everything,

7629
05:13:24,240 --> 05:13:25,830
but little tiny steps.

7630
05:13:25,830 --> 05:13:29,730
Local information winds up leading to all the best answers.

7631
05:13:29,730 --> 05:13:34,590
- So the meaning of life is following locally

7632
05:13:34,590 --> 05:13:36,603
wherever the gradient descent takes you.

7633
05:13:37,710 --> 05:13:39,300
This was an incredible conversation,

7634
05:13:39,300 --> 05:13:41,070
officially the longest conversation

7635
05:13:41,070 --> 05:13:44,760
I've ever done on the podcast, which means a lot to me

7636
05:13:44,760 --> 05:13:46,890
because I get to do it with one of my heroes.

7637
05:13:46,890 --> 05:13:48,603
John, I can't tell you how much it means to me

7638
05:13:48,603 --> 05:13:50,490
that you would sit down with me.

7639
05:13:50,490 --> 05:13:52,392
You're an incredible human being.

7640
05:13:52,392 --> 05:13:54,420
I can't wait what you do next,

7641
05:13:54,420 --> 05:13:56,010
but you've already changed the world.

7642
05:13:56,010 --> 05:13:58,110
You're an inspiration to so many people,

7643
05:13:58,110 --> 05:13:59,940
and again, we haven't covered

7644
05:13:59,940 --> 05:14:03,240
like most of what I was planning to talk about.

7645
05:14:03,240 --> 05:14:05,474
So I hope we get a chance

7646
05:14:05,474 --> 05:14:06,540
to talk someday in the future

7647
05:14:06,540 --> 05:14:08,550
and I can't wait to see what you do next.

7648
05:14:08,550 --> 05:14:10,320
Thank you so much again for talking to me.

7649
05:14:10,320 --> 05:14:12,090
- Thank you very much.

7650
05:14:12,090 --> 05:14:12,923
- Thanks for listening

7651
05:14:12,923 --> 05:14:14,850
to this conversation with John Carmack.

7652
05:14:14,850 --> 05:14:16,110

7654
05:14:18,720 --> 05:14:19,683
And now lemme leave you

7655
05:14:19,683 --> 05:14:22,263
with some words from John Carmack himself.

7656
05:14:23,370 --> 05:14:27,090
Focused hard work is the real key to success.

7657
05:14:27,090 --> 05:14:29,040
Keep your eyes on the goal

7658
05:14:29,040 --> 05:14:32,430
and just keep taking the next step towards completing it.

7659
05:14:32,430 --> 05:14:34,680
If you aren't sure which way to do something,

7660
05:14:34,680 --> 05:14:37,443
do it both ways and see which works better.

7661
05:14:38,670 --> 05:14:41,613
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
