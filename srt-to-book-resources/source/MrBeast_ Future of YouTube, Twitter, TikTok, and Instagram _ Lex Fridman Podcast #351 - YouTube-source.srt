1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,270
i'm here with mr beast

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,529
the brilliant mastermind behind some of the most popular videos ever created

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,070
do you think you'll ever make a video that gets 1 billion views

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,210
i think maybe one of the videos we've already made might get a billion views

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,049
which one

6
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:14,530
do you think

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,750
probably like the the squid game video with enough time

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,730
i mean it's only a year old and it's already on 300 million

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,050
or some of the newer ones we've done have gotten like 100 million views in a month

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:23,890
um

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,109
so those four projected over 10 years

12
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,369
because youtube's not going anywhere

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,449
probably one of those

14
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:29,949
so over time they don't necessarily plateau

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,970
what's interesting

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,770
we're literally jumping right now

17
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,370
i love it

18
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:33,670
it's good

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,090
um

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,790
so i i'm a firm believer

21
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,510
that it's much easier to hypothetically get 10 million views on one video

22
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,250
than a hundred thousand on a hundred

23
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,290
and part of why it's much easier in my opinion

24
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,850
is like if you make a really good video

25
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,570
it's just so evergreen

26
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,530
and it never dies

27
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,370
because youtube

28
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,370
when you open up youtube and look at the videos

29
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,210
they're just serving you

30
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,809
whatever they think

31
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,309
you'll like the best you know

32
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:54,910
and so

33
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,110
if you just make a great video and it's constantly just above every other video

34
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,949
you know

35
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,510
even two years down the road

36
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,190
then they'll just keep serving it

37
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,550
never stop

38
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,269
you know

39
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:06,909
which is why it's much easier to make one great video than a bunch of mediocre

40
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,450
ones

41
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,890
what about 1 billion subscribers

42
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,930
you've uh

43
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,110
passed

44
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,450
pewdiepie's the most subscribed to youtube channel

45
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:13,810
uh

46
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,610
when do you think you get a billion

47
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,450
uh

48
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,010
let me do some math real quick

49
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,049
so we're on 120

50
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,710
what do you think about this

51
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:21,009
no

52
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:21,670
i don't

53
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:21,790
honestly

54
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,270
i

55
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,390
because one thing you'll find if you want to gain subscribers

56
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,590
if you want to get views

57
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,710
if you want to make money and almost any metric in this

58
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:29,890
uh

59
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,729
video creation space

60
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,810
if you want something

61
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,310
it all comes back to

62
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,430
okay

63
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,670
well

64
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,630
then just make great videos

65
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:34,869
so

66
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,170
instead of like focusing on all these arbitrary vanity metrics

67
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,869
i just kind of focus on the one thing that gets me all that

68
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,250
which is make good videos

69
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,150
but and that

70
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,009
i do think we will when they hit a billion subscribers

71
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,509
i don't have a plan on going anywhere

72
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,909
even though we're only on 120 million right now

73
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,630
on the main channel

74
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,390
i think like we're doing around 10 million a month now

75
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,770
and um youtube

76
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:54,549
just yeah

77
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,930
i just don't see it going anywhere

78
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,689
and i don't see any reason why i'd ever get burnt out or quit

79
00:01:58,699 --> 00:01:59,530
so i think

80
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,009
with enough time

81
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,310
yes

82
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,509
i wanted to ask you those family friendly questions before i go to the doc question

83
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,030
so now we have dark questions right now

84
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,348
but if you wanted to hook them

85
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:09,669
you would start off with the dark questions

86
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,750
that's how you get them

87
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:10,869
okay

88
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,289
well

89
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,030
let me ask you about the uh

90
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,870
a twitter poll

91
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,110
you posted a ten thousand dollar death poll

92
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,709
he tweeted if someone offered you ten thousand dollars

93
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,910
but if you take it

94
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,290
a random person on earth dies

95
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,950
would you take the ten thousand dollars and

96
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:26,950
uh

97
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,510
forty five percent of people said

98
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,810
yes

99
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,550
that's at least at the time

100
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,050
i checked 850 000 people committing murder for just 8. 5 billion dollars in total

101
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,290
so

102
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:38,830
uh

103
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,930
what do you learn about human nature from that

104
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,550
that's a a good question

105
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:43,810
um

106
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:43,870
honestly

107
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,269
this is like late at night when i threw that up too

108
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:46,870
i was just like

109
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:46,989
huh

110
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:47,890
this will be a funny thing

111
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,290
i assumed it'd be 90 known like 10

112
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,470
yes

113
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,870
but there are a lot of serious people

114
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:53,890
um

115
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,489
for you guys listening

116
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,010
i just did this random twitter poll i was like

117
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,190
would you take 10 grand if it meant someone random in the world died

118
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,830
and a lot of the replies on this week were like hell

119
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,069
yeah

120
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:03,550
why not

121
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,349
and i was just not expecting that

122
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,550
um

123
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,870
and so i don't really know

124
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,610
i mean i feel like your take would be better than mine

125
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,989
was it disturbing to you

126
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,310
surprising to you a little bit

127
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,430
yeah

128
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,970
but i

129
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:13,629
you know

130
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,769
obviously a lot of people were trolling

131
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,610
but i actually

132
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:15,970
you know

133
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,810
you read through those replies

134
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,690
i do think like 10 of them were like dead serious

135
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,170
well

136
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,790
i think sometimes the trolling

137
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,030
and the laws reveal a thing we're too embarrassed to admit about the darker aspects of our nature

138
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,209
so i don't know if you listen to dan carlin's hardcore history podcast

139
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,510
he has a episode on painful payment

140
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,250
which he describes

141
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,390
throughout history

142
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,230
how humans have been really attracted to watching the suffering of others

143
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,590
so

144
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:42,970
um

145
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,269
public executions

146
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:44,950
all that kind of stuff

147
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,709
and he believes that's in all of us

148
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:47,830
that

149
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:48,849
for example

150
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:51,549
if something like a youtube or a different platform

151
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,790
stream to public execution or streamed the torture of another human being

152
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,470
a lot of people would

153
00:03:59,640 --> 00:03:59,890
uh

154
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,209
say that's deeply unethical

155
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,870
but they will still tune in and watch and that

156
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,970
where we're attracted to that drama and especially the most extreme versions of that drama

157
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,730
and so i think part of the laws reveals something that's actually true in that poll that

158
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,548
like your answer is so much better than mine

159
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,470
do you think about that

160
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,449
maybe even with the squid game like

161
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,410
so

162
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,250
i think

163
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,150
how many

164
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,169
how many views

165
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,490
does this game currently have 300

166
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,030
million

167
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,330
yeah

168
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,050
something like this

169
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,350
so just imagine a thought experiment

170
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,070
how many views that video would get if it was like real

171
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,310
yes

172
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,050
because i mean youtube was like

173
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,250
we'll turn the blind out

174
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,030
we won't take it down

175
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,210
yeah

176
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,530
i mean it

177
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,930
i've obviously i probably have billions of views

178
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,449
how do you think you will die and do you think you'll be during a video

179
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,130
probably doing something dumb

180
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,229
like going to space when i'm in the older

181
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,330
like trying to go to mars or something like that

182
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,870
i know

183
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,470
for a fact

184
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,370
it won't be on a video

185
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,770
every video we do with safety experts and stuff like that

186
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,850
so it's not really risk

187
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,650
but um

188
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,070
yeah

189
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:03,970
i could see myself

190
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,750
like you know

191
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,610
after a million people go to mars or something like that

192
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,150
i'd probably be like

193
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,550
you know what let's go and and something like that

194
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:09,790
maybe so

195
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,169
not in the name of a video

196
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,250
just no for the holiday

197
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,370
heck

198
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:12,790
no

199
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,370
are you open to taking risks when you shoot videos

200
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,210
you just went to antarctica

201
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,229
i mean like you're

202
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,150
you're putting yourself in the line a little bit right

203
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,750
of course

204
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,590
but you know

205
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:20,650
we

206
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,130
we've had that video in the works for three years and then we consult with tons of experts

207
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,490
radar the entire path we're gonna walk beforehand to see if there's crevasses

208
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,110
so we know there's no crevasses

209
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,130
we do training

210
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,970
we consult with experts and we have survival guides there with us and you know

211
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,810
monitor to the weather and everything

212
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,990
so it's like any variable that where we could get harmed

213
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,370
we just pre-planned for it

214
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,449
same thing with buried alive

215
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,210
like i had david blaine spent a week underground

216
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,770
and so i consulted with him and consulted with basically anyone who ever buried themselves alive

217
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,070
you know the coffin we used to bury me we did so many tests

218
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,430
like that

219
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,470
coffin was buried 10 times before i was

220
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,949
you know

221
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,690
for a little way longer than 50 hours

222
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,090
it tested the airflow and everything to the point

223
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,030
where i was safer in that coffin underground than i was above ground

224
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,210
like

225
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,910
so we just tend to just not leave anything up to chance

226
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,630
you know

227
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,550
another strange question

228
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:06,910
then

229
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,810
so you've recorded these videos to yourself

230
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,530
you know

231
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:11,830
five years

232
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,610
ten years from now

233
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,750
have you recorded a video that's to be released once you die

234
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,470
well

235
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:18,430
first off

236
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,729
i am just glad that not every one of your questions have to do with like views

237
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,690
or things like that

238
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,210
it's nice getting different questions so this is

239
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,690
this is good

240
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,870
um

241
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,470
no

242
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,430
seriously stuck

243
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,810
but it's fine

244
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,310
because a lot of people just be like

245
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,210
how much money do you make

246
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,569
you know

247
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:31,990
it's just something

248
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,169
i

249
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:32,410
just

250
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,430
everything's always about money

251
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,669
now

252
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,350
for when people talk to me

253
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,130
so it's nice

254
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,090
um

255
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,830
but for the videos i made

256
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,009
uh

257
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,789
for you guys

258
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,350
who probably don't follow me too closely

259
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,470
when i had 8 000 subscribers and i was a teenager

260
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,410
i filmed a bunch of videos and scheduled them years in the future

261
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,690
and i said i'd filmed one where i was like

262
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,729
hi me in a year and the video went up a year later

263
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,569
and it was just like hey

264
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,130
i think you'll have 100 000 subscribers

265
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,449
and then i did one where i was

266
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:55,449
like

267
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,530
hire me in five years

268
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,310
i was like

269
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,370
hey

270
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:57,789
in five years

271
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,569
i think you'll have a million

272
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,430
and then one that hasn't come out yet

273
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,330
but it comes out in two years

274
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,509
is

275
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,310
was high me in 10 years

276
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,870
and i try to predict 10 years later

277
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,770
how many subs i'd have

278
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,910
that's what he's referring to

279
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,449
and yes

280
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:07,750
there

281
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,350
there are some that are scheduled like 20 years in the future

282
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,610
and so if i don't die

283
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,509
i'll just move them up

284
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,009
and i remember

285
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,210
because i filmed these though

286
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,229
like seven years ago

287
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:17,410
but

288
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,310
uh

289
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,150
it was

290
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,310
i remember saying a line like you know

291
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,669
if i'm dead

292
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,770
then i'm currently just in a coffin and like

293
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:23,949
whatever

294
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,190
blah

295
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:24,729
blah

296
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:28,569
because the only way the video go up is if i'm not alive and if i'm not alive

297
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,090
then i won't be able to push back to schedule upload date

298
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,750
so go public

299
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:31,930
automatically

300
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:32,590
yes

301
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:33,370
and so

302
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,550
yeah

303
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,569
i have a couple of those

304
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:34,750
uh

305
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:35,349
like

306
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,310
if i knew i was gonna die of like cancer or something

307
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,810
i had like three months to live

308
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,190
i would vlog every day

309
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,150
i'd film so many videos

310
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,330
and then i would just schedule upload a video a week for like the next five years

311
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,289
so it's like i'm still alive and i would completely act like i'm still alive and everything

312
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:52,750
and i think something like that would be cool

313
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,849
it's i don't know why

314
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:55,330
but i've fantasized

315
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,530
not fantasize

316
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:57,669
but i've dreamed about that

317
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,090
a lot

318
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,210
like

319
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,169
i don't know if

320
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,970
if i only had 30 days to live

321
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,569
what would i do

322
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:05,590
and for me i would try to make like a decades worth of content and schedule upload it

323
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,210
so they automatically go public in the future

324
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,610
and so it's just like i never died i'm just there

325
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,330
yeah

326
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,349
it's a kind of immortality

327
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,310
but it's also kind of troll on the concept of time

328
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,610
yeah

329
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,270
that you can die in the physical space but persist in the digital space

330
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,729
i actually i recorded a video like that

331
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:27,669
because i had some concerns and i just thought it's also a good exercise to do

332
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:30,430
a video would like to be released if i die

333
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,010
and it was actually a really interesting exercise

334
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,029
it's cool

335
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,708
like it shows like what you really care about

336
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,149
i guess it's like writing a will

337
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,049
but when you're younger

338
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,370
you don't think about that kind of stuff

339
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,510
but exactly mine was just dumb

340
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:40,809
yeah

341
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,729
like i'm bones in a coffin

342
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:43,029
yeah

343
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,490
yours is probably so serious

344
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:45,850
no

345
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,589
it's fun actually what you realize

346
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,450
it's like there's no point to be serious at this point

347
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,709
it's a weird thing

348
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,390
i guess you've done this

349
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,610
but it's a weird thing to address the world when you

350
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:54,790
the

351
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,029
physically

352
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,330
you

353
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,110
is no longer there

354
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,290
so

355
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,430
like you know

356
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,130
this would only be released if you're no longer there

357
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,310
exactly

358
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,390
that's a weird exercise

359
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,790
you know what's funny of all the people listening to this

360
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:03,970
yeah

361
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,390
you know

362
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,269
we're probably the only two people that have made videos for

363
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,330
when we die it's like such a niche thing

364
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,589
and the fact that we're bonding over

365
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,250
it's kind of funny

366
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,990
i think people should think about doing that

367
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,010
it's not just about youtube

368
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,089
it's also social media

369
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,529
because think about it like there's going to be a last tweet and the last

370
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:21,190
i don't know

371
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,430
facebook post

372
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,450
their last instagram post

373
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,250
and uh

374
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:25,269
yeah

375
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:32,170
i feel like there's some aspects that's meditative to just even considering making a post like that

376
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,330
and also it's a way for your

377
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,029
the people that love you to kind of like celebrate

378
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,790
do you think that would help them cope or not like

379
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,370
if someone randomly watching this did film a video

380
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,330
you know

381
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,390
for

382
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,089
if they accidentally died in some freak accident to be given to their family

383
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:46,870
do you think that would

384
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,310
and it was like a genuine

385
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,510
i think it would really help

386
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,350
i mean it depends

387
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:50,950
because like

388
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,209
how would you even intro that

389
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:52,390
like

390
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,570
hey

391
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,110
mom

392
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,190
if you're seeing this

393
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,730
you know

394
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,630
it means i'm probably dead

395
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:55,870
yeah

396
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,170
exactly

397
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,550
that's how you enjoy it

398
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,390
that's the opener

399
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:58,810
oh

400
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,610
i just want you to know

401
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:00,730
yeah

402
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:01,269
i guess

403
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,510
yeah

404
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,670
and i guess you could say in a kind of funny way

405
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,630
but um

406
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,330
and just talk about the things that you that mean a lot to you

407
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,350
because otherwise you're at the risk of the last post you have is like

408
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,029
like i don't know

409
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,690
talking shit about

410
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,149
like mcdonald's mcdonald's exactly

411
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,410
and then you're dead

412
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,890
that's it

413
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,250
100 years

414
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,870
i don't know this

415
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,310
i i do recommend it

416
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,610
it's uh

417
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,870
like the stoics

418
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,550
meditate on death every day

419
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,269
in the same way you kind of meditate in your death when you make a video like that

420
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,190
because it's actually not just even talking to yourself

421
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,290
it's talking to the world and it

422
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,470
like

423
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,310
for some reason

424
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,610
at least

425
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:33,910
for me

426
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,950
they made it very concrete that there's going to be an end and i'm like

427
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,269
it's almost

428
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,230
it's over for me

429
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,190
if i'm making the video

430
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,850
it's over for me

431
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,990
it's just an interesting thought experiment

432
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,829
i recommend people

433
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,089
um

434
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:46,149
uh

435
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,110
try it

436
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,290
okay

437
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:47,829
uh

438
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,670
from

439
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,290
are you afraid of death

440
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,769
by the way

441
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:50,890
yes

442
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,329
i i

443
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,649
it's hard because like what

444
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,750
if you just die and then you just see nothing forever

445
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,769
you know

446
00:10:59,779 --> 00:10:59,829
yeah

447
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,190
the nothingness

448
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,329
it just fades the blackness

449
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,290
and you're just like that

450
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,350
for trillions upon trillions to billion squared years

451
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,790
and it's just

452
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,510
it's scary

453
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,190
but also before you're born

454
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,649
you don't remember those what x amount of years either

455
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:11,890
so

456
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,390
um

457
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,170
that gives me a little comfort

458
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,829
but no

459
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,450
it's definitely very scary

460
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,670
something i'd rather not think about until i'm like 80.

461
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,930
i'll deal with that problem

462
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,110
then

463
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,209
i i don't know if i told you this

464
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:25,570
but i'm kind of hopeful that someone like elon or one of these like freak

465
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,550
smart people will just like be like

466
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:27,910
you know what

467
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,269
screw it

468
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,490
i'm gonna figure out a way where we can slow down aging

469
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,810
get it where you know

470
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,589
we can live to be two

471
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,810
300 years old and just like set their sights on that

472
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,649
and then

473
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:36,430
just kind of save us

474
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,950
so it'd be really nice like it's

475
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,410
it's almost absurd to think

476
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,290
that in our lifetime they won't figure out a way to just even slightly slow down aging

477
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,149
where we could live to be like 120 or 130

478
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,470
and then that extra time

479
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,269
they won't figure out somewhere we could live to be 200.

480
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,810
like

481
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,410
obviously not immortal

482
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,269
but i don't

483
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,529
i don't see how in my lifetime

484
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,230
the life expectancy doesn't just expand

485
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:56,649
well

486
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,149
it also could be that the immortality is achieved in the digital realm

487
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,769
like it could be a long

488
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:02,829
be

489
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:03,970
long after you're gone

490
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,690
there's a mr beast

491
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,730
run by chad gbt type system

492
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:06,970
exactly

493
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,390
yeah

494
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,829
that consumes everything i ever said

495
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,810
everything i ever wrote and thought i don't want that

496
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,470
i want to live

497
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,610
what are you

498
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,329
smart people out there

499
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:13,930
figure it out

500
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,890
i'll keep you entertained

501
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,750
but i need you to figure out how to keep me alive

502
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,810
give me until 200. that will make me happy

503
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:20,649
well

504
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,310
that's

505
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,670
that's funny

506
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,130
who owns the identity of of mr beast wants

507
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,089
the physical body is gone

508
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:25,870
like

509
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,269
is it illegal to create another mr beast

510
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,649
that's chad gpt based

511
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,329
i don't know what the laws are on that

512
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:31,510
yeah

513
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:31,930
like

514
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,470
i mean

515
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,550
once i'm done i don't care

516
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:33,990
well

517
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,089
but you just said you did care

518
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:38,110
i mean there could be a ai

519
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,649
like many mr beasts that are created after after you're gone

520
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:41,890
yeah

521
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,950
i mean that would be cool to be able to like train up a model

522
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,089
and and let them loose

523
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,350
so my content lives on

524
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,709
i guess

525
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:47,829
yeah

526
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,250
yeah

527
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,470
but it somehow feels like it diminishes the video you contribute

528
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:53,769
yeah

529
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:54,010
yeah

530
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,550
it's an authentic

531
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:55,389
but it's also

532
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,290
there's

533
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,690
there's some aspect to the finiteness of the art being necessary for it

534
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:01,829
yeah

535
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,570
i want the second that thing starts spamming out videos

536
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,490
the videos lose all meaning and it's pointless

537
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,389
and it's a money grab

538
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,209
if you run youtube for

539
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:10,930
uh

540
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,910
how long should you run it for a year

541
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,029
uh

542
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,290
how would you change it

543
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,829
how would you improve

544
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:15,070
it

545
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,990
it's hard because you know

546
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,089
obviously i'm biased because we're doing really well

547
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,209
but i feel like when i open up youtube on my television

548
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,130
i get the videos i want to watch

549
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,730
i don't

550
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:25,990
i don't know

551
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,470
i don't

552
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,350
i don't ever open it and wonder like what are these

553
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,450
what are these 10 videos on my home page

554
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,410
when i click on video messages

555
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,970
i don't ever wonder what these are

556
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,089
like

557
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:34,269
i

558
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,070
i and maybe

559
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,050
it's because i'm very adamant about

560
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,190
like the kind of videos i watch

561
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,350
and i try not to watch videos that i don't want to get recommended more

562
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,970
because i just that's how i think

563
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,190
but i'm very happy with how it is

564
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,670
at the moment

565
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,810
i think one thing though that i just hate with the passion is the comment section on youtube

566
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,950
it's just so bad

567
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:51,970
um

568
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,910
but that i know that's not something that's gonna 10x the growth of the platform

569
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,110
but if you think about it

570
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,170
you go to reddit to read comments and somehow like that

571
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,329
you know usually the top 20 posts

572
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:01,870
uh

573
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,930
on a popular reddit post are not spam

574
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,070
you know what i mean

575
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,190
like

576
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,170
have you ever clicked on something on the front page of reddit

577
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,130
and then most upvoted reply to it is like go check out my site right here

578
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,990
and it's like trying to escape me out of a thousand dollars

579
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,170
yeah

580
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:14,649
yeah

581
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,690
i can't even think of one instance i've ever had that happen

582
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:16,870
so

583
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,829
like reddit

584
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,070
it's so nice to click on post and just see what people have to say

585
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,570
and i almost wish

586
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,930
like you had that same feeling when you read the comments a youtube video

587
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,170
instead

588
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,269
it's like it's so many people just copy

589
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,170
and pasting so many bots that just grab the top comment from your previous video and paste it over

590
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,970
so top comments on every videos are the same

591
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,870
and the things

592
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,410
that break through

593
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,950
that are just scammers trying to get you to give them a thousand dollars for a free

594
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,190
uh

595
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,730
you know

596
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,089
fake ad

597
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:43,029
that comment section is one of the most lively on the internet

598
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,470
so be amazing if youtube invested in creating an actual community like

599
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,410
where people could do high effort comments and be rewarded for it

600
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,829
like on reddit

601
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:51,070
yeah

602
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,550
like

603
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,750
actually right out along

604
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,889
that would make me so happy

605
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,630
because like when i upload a video

606
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,449
i usually go to twitter to see feedback

607
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,970
like i read my comments and i'll flip through newest

608
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,449
but it's just i feel like to read it

609
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:06,850
and twitter just give me so much better filtered feedback

610
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,050
especially now that

611
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,709
with twitter

612
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:08,889
blue

613
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,690
because people pay eight dollars a month

614
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:11,709
um

615
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:11,829
any

616
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,029
i've noticed

617
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,310
like any tweets i get from verified users now they're usually not just garbage troll takes

618
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,290
like these are people paying eight dollars a month

619
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,389
like they're usually relatively sensible

620
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,430
and so it's been pretty nice

621
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,610
like

622
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,269
after i upload my video

623
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,209
just go on the verified tab on twitter and just see what people have to say

624
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,110
and yeah

625
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:29,589
anyways

626
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,389
i live for the day that youtube's like that

627
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:31,930
uh

628
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,010
what do you think about twitter

629
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,110
what do you think about all the fun activity happening recently since

630
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,470
uh

631
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:38,769
elon

632
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,250
yeah

633
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,449
bought twitter

634
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,269
i think you should make me ceo like i tweeted

635
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:46,990
well

636
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,589
i should

637
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,130
i should say

638
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,209
sort of we had with

639
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,949
just like a couple hours ago

640
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,970
had a conversation with elon

641
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:52,389
and

642
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:52,630
uh

643
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,910
you guys had an exchange of some excellent ideas

644
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,089
so

645
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,510
yeah

646
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:55,930
i

647
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,990
i legitimately think obviously you're exceptionally busy

648
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,730
but i legitimately think it would be awesome if you somehow participate in the future of twitter

649
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:03,910
yeah

650
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,970
it would be fun because there's so much possibility of different ideas

651
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,589
first in the sort of the

652
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,250
uh

653
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,870
the content like dissemination

654
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,230
hosting and all the different recommendations like the search and discovery

655
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,490
all the things that youtube does

656
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:15,730
well

657
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,070
i think the most exciting thing is he's

658
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,269
you know

659
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,110
willing to move fast

660
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,709
and so i think there's going to be a lot of interesting things that come out of it

661
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,389
because he's just moving quick

662
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,290
and a lot of these more mature platforms just take years to do the simplest stuff

663
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,190
and they're very bureaucratic

664
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,630
and um

665
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,170
so it's gonna

666
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,810
i mean it'll be interesting to see which way it goes

667
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,250
when you just kind of take a move

668
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,149
quick break things

669
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,250
whatever type approach to social media

670
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,970
i'm actually pretty curious to see what futures he rolls out

671
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,350
so what will be your first uh

672
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,209
act as twitter ceo

673
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,070
i can't spoil it

674
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,250
okay

675
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,690
i gotta get hired

676
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,170
what do you think about video on the platform

677
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,190
i mean

678
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,250
yeah

679
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,509
do you think that's an interesting

680
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,389
or is it like messing with the the medium

681
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,649
the nature of the platform

682
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,550
i think twitter will always be closer to tick tock than it is to youtube

683
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,209
but i gotta

684
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:05,290
at least in this current form

685
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,470
i

686
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,010
i don't

687
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,169
i don't see 20 minute

688
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,329
one hour long videos or whatever

689
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:10,929
you know

690
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,910
even 15 minute videos being watched over there

691
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,010
i see it more as like the short and snappy stuff

692
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,849
closer to tick tock

693
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,369
but at the same time

694
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,829
twitter is a really good comment section for the internet

695
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,849
i mean it's almost weird

696
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,329
why

697
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:22,689
like

698
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,270
why doesn't twitter allow you to embed youtube videos

699
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:25,569
like

700
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:25,929
why

701
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:26,949
why does that

702
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,230
you should just ask elon that

703
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,410
like

704
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,730
i don't know if that's a youtube thing

705
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,210
but when

706
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:31,750
uh

707
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,710
youtuber posts the video

708
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,730
why do they have to link to youtube

709
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,950
why can't they just embed it on twitter and just play it there

710
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,669
i mean

711
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:37,809
wouldn't that just solve a lot of problems

712
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:38,049
yeah

713
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,110
but then the two companies that have to agree to integrate each other's content

714
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,770
i don't know

715
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,870
but it seems like a win-win i mean

716
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:43,990
well

717
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,250
it's more of a win for twitter

718
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,690
because then people don't have to leave the platform

719
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,090
i mean that would be the the easiest

720
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,990
but who gets

721
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:50,289
like

722
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,070
when you watch the ads on a youtube video that's embedded in twitter

723
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,030
who gets the money

724
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,929
it would still be youtube

725
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:56,710
but at least then

726
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,570
right now people just post a link

727
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,850
and it takes you off twitter and it just kills your session time on twitter

728
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,809
that's really interesting

729
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,470
but that

730
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,590
yeah

731
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,789
because the twitter

732
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,450
whatever the

733
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,789
the dynamics of the comments

734
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,309
especially once the spam bots are taken care of

735
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,630
twitter just works

736
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,470
it's really

737
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,650
so

738
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,870
reddit is a nice comment section for the internet

739
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,130
it's like slower pace

740
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,669
more deliberate

741
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,289
like a higher effort

742
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:19,570
twitter's like this high paced

743
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,789
like ephemeral kind of stream

744
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:22,929
but there's the vote

745
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:23,350
the upvoting

746
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,309
the downvoting works much better because you can do retweeting right

747
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:30,130
because the social network is much stronger than it is on youtube

748
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,030
like the interconnectivity

749
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:31,809
yeah

750
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,230
on reddit

751
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,190
you're gonna get the

752
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,950
the top replies are going to be the most refined ones

753
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,870
whereas twitter stuff floats to the top

754
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,530
that's not super refined

755
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,010
but

756
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,490
like you're saying

757
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,350
it's more off the cuff stream of consciousness

758
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,169
which a lot of people prefer gets a little more personal

759
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:50,890
how do you think twitter compares to youtube in terms of how you see its future unroll in 2023.

760
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,929
i mean i think youtube's gonna be youtube

761
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:54,850
and not much is really going to change

762
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,049
but it's going to keep growing just

763
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,250
because you know that's just what it does and because it's owned by google

764
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,510
um

765
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,110
but twitter

766
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,370
i don't know

767
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,049
i mean it's one of those things like you

768
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,850
you can't predict if i

769
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,330
you know

770
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,929
a year from now

771
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,910
an economy is going to be in a recession or booming

772
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,710
and i think twitter's kind of the same thing

773
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,610
one thing

774
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:12,910
for certain

775
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,289
a lot of things are going to be rolled out

776
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:15,510
but who knows honestly

777
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,130
you responded to elon saying twitter's unlikely to be able to pay creators more money than youtube

778
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,150
um

779
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,990
what do you think that is

780
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,169
well

781
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:23,710
yeah

782
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,530
because i i think the tweet i responded to is one where he was saying

783
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:27,789
um

784
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,690
that they

785
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,370
you know

786
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,010
users will jump over if twitter could potentially pay more

787
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:33,309
uh

788
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,210
than other platforms

789
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,410
and i was just saying

790
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,650
obviously

791
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,590
because google has google adwords and i mean that's google's whole thing

792
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,630
it's putting ads on stuff they've been doing it better

793
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,950
than anywhere else in the world for a very long time

794
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,929
it's very unlikely in the next few years that twitter is going to magically or any platform

795
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,710
you know

796
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,010
give a creator the ability to make higher cpms than on youtube

797
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,190
uh

798
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:51,789
it's

799
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,390
it's kind of crazy like some creators in in december

800
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,230
you know q4

801
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,090
because ad rates are higher because of christmas and everything

802
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,470
some creators literally make like 30

803
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,090
40 per thousand views

804
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,410
that's after youtube's cut like

805
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,270
it's almost like hard to think about

806
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,070
like how high the rpms get

807
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,490
and even then

808
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,289
once you pull out a financing cars

809
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,530
the highest cfm niches and you move into just normal stuff

810
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,610
it's still just crazy

811
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,010
the sheer volume of creators and the fact that all of them get these multi-dollar cpms at scales

812
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,030
it's pretty beautiful

813
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,110
so you do

814
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,630
i don't know what you would call them

815
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,789
but like integrated ads in your videos

816
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,450
and you do

817
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,049
i would say

818
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:26,169
masterfully

819
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,270
it's like part of the video you're talking about brand deals

820
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,929
brand deals

821
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,010
is that what you would call that

822
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,190
yep

823
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,330
so it's a brand deal

824
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,110
it's part of the video

825
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,570
it's still really exciting to watch

826
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,390
and yet there's a plug for the brand in general

827
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,169
just brand deals

828
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,309
since you brought it up

829
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:39,429
uh

830
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,450
integrating them

831
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:40,630
well

832
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,510
i think that's something a lot of creators don't do like

833
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,250
they'll just do a brand deal

834
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:45,789
out of the blue

835
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,309
they'll just be filming a video and then around the three minute mark

836
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,570
just start talking about a random company

837
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:49,750
yeah

838
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:50,830
and you

839
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,250
i feel like if you don't want viewers to click away

840
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,070
and you want people to not get pissed off and call you to sell out

841
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,870
you got to find a way to integrate in the content

842
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,450
and ideally use the money in the video to make it better

843
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,570
like

844
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,950
is the easiest thing you do

845
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,910
when you do a brand deal is just tell people how you're using money from the brand deal to make your content better

846
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,929
and if you do that

847
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:08,049
like

848
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,210
no one cares now they're supporting you for it

849
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,650
and you go from being a sellout to like

850
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:11,770
oh

851
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,289
i'm doing this to make better videos for you guys

852
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:14,710
you know

853
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,549
i don't know if you can share

854
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,049
but with those brands

855
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,510
when you have discussions with them

856
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,330
are they strict about how long you need to be talking about it

857
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,289
or is it more about their leaving control to you

858
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:27,789
about the artistic element of it

859
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,030
the problem is the the ones who don't give us the artistic element

860
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,169
we just don't really work with anymore

861
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,730
because it's just

862
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,330
you know

863
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,770
we get 100 million views of video now

864
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,929
and i can confidently say

865
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:41,710
i know how to entertain them and convert them better than these random brands

866
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,010
so

867
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,250
uh

868
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:42,970
yeah

869
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,590
if they don't give us that freedom

870
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,789
i just won't work with them

871
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,690
so you have that leverage

872
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,950
but for smaller creators

873
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:48,909
it's a lot harder

874
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,210
yeah

875
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,750
and they're

876
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,429
they're gonna just say 45 seconds

877
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,690
here's what you say

878
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,470
take it or leave it

879
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,669
and it's like pretty brutal

880
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,929
because i think

881
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,470
just in general

882
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,630
if brands were more accommodating

883
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,630
to let creators tell their story onto brandon

884
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,970
talk about the brand in a way that felt a little more natural

885
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,549
i i think it'd be less cringe it

886
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,990
people would be less likely to go

887
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,710
and you know

888
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:08,950
tough times

889
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,370
tap skip

890
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:09,610
and

891
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,450
uh

892
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,650
obviously it would convert better

893
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,110
but they're just so afraid and they want this standardized thing

894
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,970
say these words and 45 seconds

895
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,010
right here at this three minute mark

896
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:18,309
yeah

897
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,370
i often think about how to resist that

898
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,690
you just don't do them

899
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,870
though

900
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,110
right

901
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,350
not

902
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,130
on youtube

903
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,250
right

904
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,210
i do an audio

905
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,270
i do ads in the very beginning and i say you can skip them if you want

906
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,350
um

907
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,010
but brandon loves that i don't like the point is they

908
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,049
so the funny thing about podcasts is different than youtube videos

909
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,350
podcast

910
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,770
people actually do listen to ads a lot

911
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,130
because they it's slower paced and they like the the creator voice

912
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,990
like talking about the thing

913
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:47,950
um

914
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,049
but in general i just don't believe you should be talking about a thing for a minute exactly

915
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,850
and that's going to be effective

916
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,230
i want to see the data for that

917
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,309
i think what's much more fact

918
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,510
it was the way you do ads

919
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,330
which is like integrate into the content

920
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,610
like put a lot of effort into making a part of that

921
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,570
like doing the brand deals

922
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,309
and i just it's difficult to have that conversation

923
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,690
it's like a very strenuous conversation you have to have with with brands

924
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,150
you have to each one at a time

925
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,429
and i just wish there was more of a culture to say

926
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:22,990
like the quality of the ad read matters a lot more than the uh

927
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,210
like the silly parameters

928
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,530
like the timing of it

929
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,809
like how long it is the placement of it

930
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:29,470
all that kind of stuff

931
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,770
what percentage of your viewers do you think have seen one of my videos before

932
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,030
what percentage of the viewers on youtube

933
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,150
right

934
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,390
yeah

935
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,789
that's your viewers of the viewers on youtube

936
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:39,909
though

937
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,210
yes

938
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,590
okay

939
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,590
sure

940
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,490
or all of them

941
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,510
it's just interesting because you're

942
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,530
you're speaking very specifically

943
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,210
like about my brand deal process

944
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,650
and so in my head i'm like

945
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,650
i wonder what percentage of these people even have any idea what he's talking about

946
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,309
that's interesting

947
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,309
i love the thinking about numbers the whole time we're having this conversation

948
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,650
it's all i could think about is like god damn it

949
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:56,830
he's

950
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,250
there's

951
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,250
probably like 50 of these people have no fucking clue what he's saying

952
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,990
and we're about to torture him for five minutes

953
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,169
yeah

954
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,590
yeah

955
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:02,890
probably

956
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,289
but that's something i can't turn off in my brain

957
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:07,990
less than 50 is that a good thing or a bad thing

958
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,230
is that exciting to you that that there's like 50 of people

959
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,409
don't

960
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,630
i've not watched the mr beast video

961
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,770
isn't that an opportunity like

962
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,070
yeah

963
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,090
i guess there's an opportunity to grow

964
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,630
i don't know

965
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:16,690
honestly

966
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,730
i was just kind of excited to hang out with you

967
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:18,850
yeah

968
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,150
yeah

969
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,330
me

970
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,630
too

971
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,110
i mean

972
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:21,669
who cares

973
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:21,909
yeah

974
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,850
so it's kind of like having a buddy to go along the journey

975
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,190
as i'm just kind of eating shit and doing my normal ride

976
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,669
it was like kind of fun and also you just say really wise stuff constantly

977
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,150
okay

978
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:31,870
so

979
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,110
honestly

980
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:32,409
no

981
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:33,549
i never even put any thought into

982
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,030
like that

983
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,650
demographics of what i could gain

984
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,490
it's just interesting

985
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:36,909
because

986
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:37,990
like my retention brain

987
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,909
when you talk about something i'm instantly like

988
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,210
hmm

989
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,370
what value are they gonna get

990
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,510
how many of them are going to be interested

991
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,770
what percentage of people do

992
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,250
i think we'll lose

993
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,429
and i'm like running all those calculations in the background and that whole conversation

994
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:49,750
like the law is anyway

995
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,250
it's just something i can't turn off my

996
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,870
like bells were like

997
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,429
this is bad

998
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,230
what are the different strategies for high retention for your videos in general

999
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,950
it's like

1000
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,970
how do you cook good food

1001
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,809
you know what i mean

1002
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,270
that's like the same kind of question i see

1003
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,770
so there's so many different ways that you

1004
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,270
so it boils down to

1005
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,230
i mean

1006
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:08,950
uh

1007
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,230
do you think it's at the level of a story

1008
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,429
or do you think like literally watching five seconds at a time

1009
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,750
am i gonna tune out here

1010
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,710
am i gonna tune out here

1011
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,669
am i going to tune out here

1012
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:19,450
that's all of it

1013
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,789
you need the overarching narrative and then you also need the micro

1014
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,789
where every second you know needs to be entertaining

1015
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,510
and you

1016
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:25,690
basically

1017
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,809
what's interesting is the longer people watch something

1018
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,850
the more likely they are to keep watching

1019
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:37,210
so you don't have to try as hard in the hypothetically back half of a video as you do in the front like

1020
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,370
even right now we're so deep into this

1021
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,450
where a lot of people listening are probably just going to keep listening relatively close to the endless

1022
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,650
we just have a really boring part of this conversation because they're just they're saying it

1023
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:47,770
they're

1024
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,190
they're immersed

1025
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,330
um

1026
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,690
and so a big like to really boil it down to a simple level

1027
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,650
you just want to get people

1028
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,950
where they're immersed in the content and then just kind of hold them there

1029
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,409
we had this discussion offline and by the way

1030
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:02,110
i should mention that this is like late at night

1031
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,730
it is what times

1032
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,390
it's uh

1033
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,830
nine o'clock and i

1034
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,070
uh

1035
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,750
i only slept one hour last night because i'm an idiot and i flew to the wrong location

1036
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,250
well here we're like

1037
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,490
hey

1038
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,710
book your hotel on a flight

1039
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,010
he's like

1040
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,130
no

1041
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,549
i got it

1042
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:15,970
we're like you

1043
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,210
sure

1044
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,289
we can just do it

1045
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:17,830
we always do this

1046
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,130
he's like

1047
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,309
no

1048
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:18,850
i got it

1049
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,150
i got it

1050
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,049
he's gonna have to rub it in

1051
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:20,529
i know

1052
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,970
and then today i come to find out

1053
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,710
he flew to the wrong airport

1054
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,909
the airport with the uh

1055
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,710
our city with a similar name to ours

1056
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,370
the same name

1057
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,809
same name in a different state

1058
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,870
and i was like that's why you should let us book it

1059
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,890
and so he saw one hour of sleep and he's literally been dying all day before this podcast

1060
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,570
he downed like two things of coffee

1061
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,190
we've been going all day hard

1062
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,370
uh

1063
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:39,850
yeah

1064
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,210
i've been

1065
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,390
uh

1066
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,289
got to interact with you

1067
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,570
i should say that this gave me an opportunity to

1068
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,169
i gotta

1069
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,010
uh

1070
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,950
ride from a stranger and it was an incredible person that got to interact with them

1071
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,809
so it's like there's so many kind people around here

1072
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,850
just like this kind of southern energy

1073
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,750
and then i got to go to a diner because i could you know

1074
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,350
there's only one hour between me arriving and having to fly out

1075
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,429
so i went to a diner

1076
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,309
there's a really kind waitress that called me

1077
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:06,549
uh

1078
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:06,850
honey

1079
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,350
so that's a beautiful moment

1080
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:08,890
you know

1081
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,490
i was so confused

1082
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,490
you tweeted about that and like steel's like

1083
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,750
like my assistant

1084
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:13,870
uh

1085
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,590
lex isn't here yet and i saw your tweet and i was like he's here

1086
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,610
he was like

1087
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:18,669
no

1088
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,330
he's still flying

1089
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,929
i was like four

1090
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,010
like an hour ago

1091
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,690
he just tweeted about a nice diner

1092
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:23,169
yeah

1093
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:25,029
it was a diner

1094
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,830
it was a diner in a different state

1095
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,330
and then you had to fly

1096
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,690
over here

1097
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:28,870
yeah

1098
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,350
that was

1099
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,010
and then i called you

1100
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,490
you didn't answer

1101
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,309
i was like something's not had enough

1102
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:33,630
yeah

1103
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,710
i feel like it's such an idiot because

1104
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,370
um

1105
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,750
apparently the world

1106
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,250
uh

1107
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,270
has cities like springfield

1108
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,510
right

1109
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,549
like there's like

1110
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,750
every single state has a springfield

1111
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:43,929
oh

1112
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,590
really

1113
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,909
but i think so

1114
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,630
i think that's whatever

1115
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,190
that's like a simpsons joke

1116
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,610
right that

1117
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:48,789
like

1118
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,529
it's uh

1119
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,750
the the city and and the simpsons of springfield

1120
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,990
and i think every single state or most of them have a springfield

1121
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,190
and the same is true for

1122
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,429
like

1123
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:57,669
uh

1124
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,090
georgetown

1125
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,770
i think the most part

1126
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,450
i forget what the most popular one was

1127
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,809
but there's like a list of these people get when they run out of ideas

1128
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:05,590
they just keep us

1129
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,029
if they're your achilles heel

1130
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,650
anyway

1131
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,070
i got to

1132
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,750
i got to meet a bunch of people from

1133
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,230
uh

1134
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,490
from your team

1135
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,929
it's just an incredible human being

1136
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:15,789
so let me just ask on that topic

1137
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,130
how do you hire a great team like

1138
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,690
what have you learned about hiring for

1139
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:21,309
um

1140
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,770
everything for it for the main channel that you do

1141
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:23,970
uh

1142
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,210
for the

1143
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:25,330
the

1144
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:25,929
react again

1145
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,289
uh

1146
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,809
the the gaming channel to

1147
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:28,809
uh

1148
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:29,950
mr beast burger to

1149
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,490
uh

1150
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,210
feastables

1151
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,409
all that the big thing is especially in this content creation

1152
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,770
because it's not like anything that's done on netflix or or different

1153
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,250
uh

1154
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,730
content

1155
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:40,029
medians

1156
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:40,510
i

1157
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,909
i really need people who are coachable and like

1158
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:45,909
really see the value in what i care about

1159
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,250
because it's a very specific way of going about things

1160
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,690
and it's a like a thing

1161
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,490
there's no one like plug and play

1162
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:51,669
like

1163
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:54,070
if netflix wanted to hire someone to do a documentary

1164
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,570
there's probably tens of thousands of people you could hire that have worked on documentaries before

1165
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,870
but if you want to hire someone to make super viral youtube videos

1166
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,890
you know

1167
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,429
like we do

1168
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:05,770
there's just no one you you can really pull from

1169
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:05,950
like

1170
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,330
sometimes i'll hire people from

1171
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,630
uh

1172
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,010
game shows right

1173
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,490
they have all these preconceived notions about pacing and how a video should be

1174
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,190
and you have to spend like the first year like breaking all these habits

1175
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:16,270
and you know

1176
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,590
and they think they're better than you

1177
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:17,710
like

1178
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,330
a lot of people in traditional think they're better

1179
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,010
and they think their way is better than what we do

1180
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:28,090
and so for me it's almost easier to hire people that are just hard workers that are obsessed

1181
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,090
and really coachable and just train them how to like

1182
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,870
be good at content creation production than to hire someone from like traditional

1183
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,789
which is the only way to really do it

1184
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,649
because there's not that many youtube channels that have scaled up

1185
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:41,529
so it's not like there's a huge talent pool of people who've worked on youtube channels

1186
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:42,549
um

1187
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,850
so it's easier just to train someone than just pull them from traditional

1188
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,870
because traditional people

1189
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,669
just i don't know they have all these opinions

1190
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,909
and things and they just think our way of going about things is dumb

1191
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,330
yeah

1192
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,230
so you want people who have the humility to have a beginner's mind

1193
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,070
even if they have experience

1194
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,390
see the value like actually

1195
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,130
you'll still get it

1196
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,730
it's so crazy

1197
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,549
like especially some of my other friends that are skilling up their youtube channels

1198
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,590
there's people that will come on and you'll ask them like

1199
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,730
what do you want to be doing in five years

1200
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,450
and instead of saying

1201
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:07,809
oh

1202
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,010
i want to be working on this channel

1203
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,549
they'll be like

1204
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:09,610
oh

1205
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,169
i hope to be workout movies or this

1206
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:13,149
and they see like working on a youtube channels

1207
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,490
the launch pad to go into traditional and it's like

1208
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:15,669
no

1209
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,529
like you just don't get it

1210
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:18,970
this is the future is the end goal

1211
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,110
this is your career

1212
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,370
um

1213
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,490
and so i'm just so tired of having those kinds of conversations like

1214
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,770
i feel like people really should be coming around

1215
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,230
are there like recurring interview questions that you ask is there is there ways to get

1216
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:32,710
yeah

1217
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,610
the biggest thing is like what do you want to be doing in 10 years and their answer isn't

1218
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,330
you know

1219
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,169
making content on youtube

1220
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:42,130
or you know if their answer is anything like movies or traditional stuff like that

1221
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,149
it's like just a hell

1222
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:43,330
no

1223
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,890
like it just won't even remotely work

1224
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,070
oh

1225
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,230
so you really want people to believe in the vision of youtube

1226
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,409
yeah

1227
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,070
i mean

1228
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,250
ideally

1229
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:48,970
it's like

1230
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,149
oh

1231
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:49,690
working here

1232
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,529
you know what i mean

1233
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,669
so it's less about the medium and more about just being on a great team that's doing epic stuff

1234
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:54,850
yeah

1235
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,210
well

1236
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,630
and yeah

1237
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,529
the media as well

1238
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:00,130
because those it's just it's hard to put into words

1239
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:00,850
but there's

1240
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,450
it's just two completely different ways of going about things you know

1241
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,549
like our videos aren't scripted and you know it's a lot more run and gun and when we

1242
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,789
if we hypothetically blow up a giant car or whatever

1243
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,029
like

1244
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,230
you only have one take

1245
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,830
you know

1246
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,010
i mean

1247
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,190
so

1248
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,090
um

1249
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,570
and it's not scripted

1250
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,070
and so you have to over film

1251
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,529
overshoot things over compensate for

1252
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:21,970
like the dumb way of going about it

1253
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,590
a lot of traditional people would be like

1254
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:23,649
well

1255
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,330
just plan what you're gonna say and just playing the angles

1256
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,429
you can cut the cameras in half you can save 50 grand

1257
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:27,610
here

1258
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,149
you can save

1259
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:28,870
you know

1260
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:28,990
75

1261
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:29,590
000

1262
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,090
editing this and that and it's like

1263
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,210
yeah

1264
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,190
but that's not authentic like that's

1265
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,789
you know

1266
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,210
but you

1267
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:35,409
you get it

1268
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:35,529
it's

1269
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,350
it's almost so obvious that it hurts to have to like

1270
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,309
constantly have these conversations

1271
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,289
but so where we live in

1272
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,210
but there's also detail like there's a taste

1273
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,590
like i've watched a bunch of videos with you and it's clear to you that you've gotten really good

1274
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,929
i don't know what the right word is

1275
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,070
style or taste

1276
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,270
to be able to know what's good

1277
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,230
and not in terms of retention

1278
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,070
in terms of

1279
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,130
yeah

1280
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,970
just stylistically

1281
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:55,630
visually

1282
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,830
i don't have to think

1283
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,870
i can just watch a video and it just it just screams in my head like this is what

1284
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,130
this is what should change

1285
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,390
based on the you know million videos i've watched and all these viral videos are consumed

1286
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,350
like this is

1287
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,409
blah

1288
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:08,830
blah

1289
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,390
what's optimal and things like that

1290
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,549
it's almost like your brain's like a

1291
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,870
you know

1292
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,649
like a neural net

1293
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:20,049
like if you consume enough viral videos and enough good content that you just kind of start to like

1294
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:20,950
train your brain to like

1295
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,710
see it and see these patterns that happen in all these viral videos

1296
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,850
and so that

1297
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,830
anytime i watch a video or a movie or anything

1298
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,929
i just can't stop thinking about what is optimal

1299
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,909
and so it's like it gives me a headache

1300
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,309
sometimes when i watch something too slow or i don't think it's optimal

1301
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,529
obviously my taste isn't the end-all feel

1302
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:36,730
um

1303
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,590
but that's something that kind of torments me

1304
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,190
if that makes any sense

1305
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,090
oh

1306
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,830
you can't enjoy a slow moving

1307
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,130
no

1308
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,169
i can't movie and and that's not to say

1309
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,909
there's attention on the godfather is horrible

1310
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,210
yeah

1311
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:46,630
no

1312
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:46,929
exactly

1313
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,750
i've tried to watch that movie like three times but and that's not to say

1314
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,529
slow movies are bad

1315
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:51,669
like there's an audience for it

1316
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,490
it's just obviously not what i've trained my brain to like

1317
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,710
and and social media and youtube

1318
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,549
right now

1319
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,529
like that's just not the meta and in general

1320
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:00,130
like you said

1321
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,730
in neural network

1322
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,510
you're training your brain in part on actual data

1323
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,470
right

1324
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,549
so you're actually

1325
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,330
it's data driven

1326
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,429
so you're looking at like in terms of thumbnails and titles and different aspects of the first five

1327
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,470
ten seconds and then throw out the video

1328
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:14,830
the retention

1329
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,450
all that you're looking at all that

1330
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,610
uh

1331
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,269
for your own videos

1332
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,950
to understand how to do it better

1333
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,450
so that's where the neural network is training

1334
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:22,809
yeah

1335
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:26,049
basically there are ways you can kind of see

1336
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:27,730
like the most view videos on youtube every day

1337
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,390
and stuff like that

1338
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,370
and i just kind of consume those every single day

1339
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,289
and i've been doing that for way too many years

1340
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:36,549
and then you just start to notice patterns like the thumbnails on the most view videos

1341
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,049
or videos that go super viral

1342
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,130
tend to be clear

1343
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,390
tend to not have much clutter

1344
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,470
tend to be pretty simple

1345
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:41,649
titles

1346
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,210
tend to be less than 50 characters

1347
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,350
intros tend to be this

1348
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,730
stories tend to be this

1349
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,390
and you just kind of like after you see those thousands and then tens of thousands of time

1350
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,149
it just starts to click in your head like this is what it looks like

1351
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:52,630
you know

1352
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,970
so how are you able to transfer that taste that you've developed to the team

1353
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,870
so for like

1354
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,309
because you said like broad things

1355
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:05,049
but i'm sure there's a million detailed things like what zoom to use on the face to use in the thumbnail

1356
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,350
right

1357
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,490
like the answer is

1358
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,290
whatever makes the best video

1359
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:09,790
because the problem is the more

1360
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,429
which i have so many friends who are like this

1361
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:15,010
they'll make like checklists for their editor or something like you know

1362
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,070
uh

1363
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,929
this be in this beat and you need to have

1364
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:17,830
like a three part arc

1365
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,429
and then this

1366
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:18,969
but the

1367
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,629
the problem is

1368
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,469
that's how you

1369
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:20,589
the

1370
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,349
the more constraints you put on the team

1371
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,830
the more repetitive and less innovation you get

1372
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,449
and the more like you know

1373
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:28,989
after 10 videos

1374
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,830
people are gonna be like

1375
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,010
all right

1376
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,550
i've already seen this

1377
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,530
so to me and i'm 24

1378
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,849
and you know i'm probably

1379
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,770
my mindset will change over the next 10 years

1380
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,629
i just haven't been in this industry too long

1381
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,949
but the only way to like

1382
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,230
really make innovative content and keep things fresh

1383
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,230
is to not put constraints on or put as little as possible

1384
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:47,290
and so that's why i'm very hesitant on all that stuff

1385
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,030
because the more i say

1386
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,929
the more they're gonna be like

1387
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:50,050
oh

1388
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,770
then that's what we do

1389
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,730
and then you know

1390
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,290
i'll say one time like

1391
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,530
oh

1392
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,070
you know

1393
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,190
ideally

1394
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,409
there's a cut every three seconds and the next thing you know

1395
00:34:56,418 --> 00:34:57,129
every video

1396
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,869
there's like cut every three seconds or whatever

1397
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:03,130
so it's it's hard because i try to give uh

1398
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,410
as little train

1399
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,970
not training but as little

1400
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,210
uh

1401
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,310
facts or as possible

1402
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:09,849
and more

1403
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,630
just make suggestions

1404
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:11,650
if that makes any

1405
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,030
you mean publicly or to your team

1406
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,510
to my team

1407
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:13,690
yeah

1408
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,970
what's so we talked about

1409
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,790
sort of uh teaching your voice or your style

1410
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,910
whatever we want to call it to other people on the team

1411
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,250
so they can be kind of a mr beast replacement

1412
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,150
so what's the process of teaching that

1413
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,630
so you don't wanna

1414
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:28,750
no

1415
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,970
you're more talking about like

1416
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,210
uh

1417
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,490
what i would call almost like cloning right like

1418
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,050
like tyler and other things like that

1419
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,230
yeah

1420
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,470
so

1421
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,329
when we were hanging out today

1422
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:40,089
i was showing him how we have multiple people and they come

1423
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:40,210
it's

1424
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,130
it's almost like talking to the cameras

1425
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,310
yeah

1426
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,869
it turns slowly to the camera

1427
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,190
i was like

1428
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,369
anyways

1429
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,210
have

1430
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,310
it is it weird to you to not be looking at the camera

1431
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,329
this whole interview

1432
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,790
i constantly have been turning towards the camera like

1433
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,030
yeah

1434
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,630
i'm talking to him

1435
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:52,750
yes

1436
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,650
it's a habit

1437
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,010
uh

1438
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,650
because my whole life i've just been talking to a camera

1439
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,390
who are you thinking about when you're looking at the camera

1440
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,349
do you like

1441
00:35:59,359 --> 00:35:59,770
imagine somebody

1442
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,570
i'm fully thinking about

1443
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,790
the person just sitting watching it

1444
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,450
and i almost

1445
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,109
it's weird

1446
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,369
but i'm looking at the camera

1447
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:07,390
i don't see a camera

1448
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,890
i'm like in a haze

1449
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,470
picturing what the viewer is seeing when they watch it

1450
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,650
yeah

1451
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,190
that makes sense

1452
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,450
and that's where i'll be saying things and or doing something and then

1453
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,290
like when i'm watching

1454
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,710
i'm like

1455
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,790
that's not what i want

1456
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,990
and then i'll freeze up

1457
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,130
it's very weird when i'm filming

1458
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,829
and then for people who haven't worked with me too much

1459
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:24,250
they'll think

1460
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,430
like

1461
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,570
i don't know

1462
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:25,990
it's very weird

1463
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,670
like the how i go about it

1464
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,630
because i'll just be doing whatever

1465
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,710
like lighting a firework

1466
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,250
all right

1467
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,570
this is a thousand dollar firework

1468
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,490
i'll go to lighting and i'll like freeze

1469
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,630
because in my head i'm like this

1470
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,410
i don't know

1471
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,849
i don't like how that float or how that shot looked

1472
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,270
because i

1473
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,869
it's weird

1474
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:40,329
i can perfectly picture what i'm filming

1475
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,369
by just looking at the camera and then putting myself through the lens of the camera while making content

1476
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,349
and i can do it at the same time

1477
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,109
so you're like real time editing in my video

1478
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:50,290
yeah

1479
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,630
that's something that didn't at the start

1480
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,470
come natural to me

1481
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,250
but in the last

1482
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,990
probably like five years it's happened

1483
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,270
and so i would say it's one of my greatest strengths

1484
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,710
but i don't know how i developed it

1485
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,210
but anytime i'm filming anything like

1486
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,410
it's almost like the like right side of my brain i just can just look at it

1487
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,390
and i see exactly what i'm filming and i can just picture it

1488
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:07,630
well

1489
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,470
there's probably recording the video being the talent for the video

1490
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,250
and then watching the editing and like analyzing you careful and do that over and over again

1491
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,030
you'll do that over and over you

1492
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,869
ten thousand times

1493
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:16,990
yeah

1494
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,930
you do the editing more than the being in front of the camera

1495
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,109
so

1496
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,190
like you

1497
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,790
you start to see yourself from that third person perspective

1498
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:25,329
exactly

1499
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,050
then

1500
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,849
maybe that actually helps with the nerves of it

1501
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:28,030
too

1502
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,089
like you see it as creating a video versus performing

1503
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:31,930
uh

1504
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:32,890
right

1505
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,010
yeah

1506
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,490
yeah

1507
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,089
i think

1508
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:34,270
so

1509
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,810
you know

1510
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:34,990
i

1511
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,290
it's weird i've never been nervous talking to a camera

1512
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,589
it's it's harder for me to talk to a person that doesn't talk to a camera

1513
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,810
which i feel like a lot of people say that

1514
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,530
though that are whatever

1515
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,849
make content right

1516
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,150
interesting

1517
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,890
i've heard that so many times

1518
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,450
or maybe not

1519
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,470
maybe i'm just awkward enough

1520
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,190
maybe they're practiced

1521
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,670
i

1522
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,150
to me

1523
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,270
it's

1524
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,650
i mean both are terrifying

1525
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,070
but being in front of the camera by yourself is so much easier

1526
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,310
really

1527
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,030
yeah

1528
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:58,690
so much easier

1529
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,829
i preferred a million times over [applause] but that's my whole life

1530
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:03,430
you know

1531
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,990
so it's just that's why it's interesting

1532
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,970
like you've spent more of your time talking to people

1533
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,089
yeah

1534
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,869
it comes natural

1535
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:10,570
and i talk to a piece of plastic

1536
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:10,810
oh

1537
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:11,109
yeah

1538
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,250
i guess you're talking to a person too

1539
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,990
they're just then on the other side of the camera

1540
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,109
yeah

1541
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,490
there's just a pixel on the screen

1542
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,050
so so cloning

1543
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,890
how do you

1544
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,670
how do you achieve this

1545
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:18,730
oh

1546
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:18,849
yeah

1547
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:19,150
that's right

1548
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,690
that's all right

1549
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,430
so i was showing him

1550
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,250
that i have a lot of people in the company who are able to think like me

1551
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,430
and

1552
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:24,730
uh

1553
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,410
basically make decisions like i would make if i was like

1554
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,609
if you were asked

1555
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,570
hey in this video

1556
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,890
should we climb a mountain

1557
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,270
or should we dig a hole right

1558
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,349
and like you know

1559
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,550
they would pick the same answer

1560
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,170
i'd pick 90 plus percent of the times

1561
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,230
and so one example is tyler who i was showing you

1562
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,290
and he was pitching some content and you could see it like this

1563
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,369
he was on point and

1564
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,270
uh

1565
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,570
basically

1566
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,730
for just four or five years

1567
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,230
we just spent an absurd amount of time together and worked on every single video together and we worked

1568
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:53,589
uh

1569
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,250
side by side

1570
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,690
and same thing with

1571
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:55,990
uh

1572
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:56,710
my ceo

1573
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,010
james

1574
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,930
he literally lived with me for a couple years

1575
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,550
i'm a big fan of

1576
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,829
just like finding people who are super obsessed and all in and a players that you know

1577
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,130
they really just want to be great and then just dumping everything

1578
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:09,910
and

1579
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,109
like you were saying

1580
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,369
because i'd love to find that

1581
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,730
uh

1582
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,650
and develop that you're saying

1583
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,070
you're basically

1584
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,930
for a long time

1585
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,670
just said everything you were thinking to them

1586
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,270
exactly like

1587
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:19,750
uh

1588
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,050
james

1589
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,630
the the guy who's basically my right handman right now

1590
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:23,589
um

1591
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,550
for two years he lived with me and we probably talk on average of those two years

1592
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,329
seven hours a day

1593
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:28,750
i mean

1594
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,650
anytime i had a phone call

1595
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,750
i'd throw it on speaker and i'd let him listen anything

1596
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,730
i was reading any content i was consuming

1597
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:34,869
like really just

1598
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,670
training his brain to think like me

1599
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,510
so that way

1600
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:38,349
um

1601
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:42,130
he could just do things without my input without me having to constantly watch over him

1602
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,790
or give him advice

1603
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,150
and

1604
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,890
and that's where we've gotten like

1605
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,270
so for the first six months he didn't do anything

1606
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,450
he just studied me and studied everything i cared about and how i spoke

1607
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:49,930
and blah

1608
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,410
blah

1609
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,810
and then the next six months he started taking on some responsibilities

1610
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,150
and now he can just run the company

1611
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,270
and you know i don't ever really have to check in on him like i

1612
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,690
most

1613
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,849
the decisions he makes are exactly what i would do

1614
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:01,869
um

1615
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:04,990
and so i i call that cloning i don't know what other people would

1616
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,270
but it's just like finding people that are really obsessed

1617
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,710
and they just kind of really want it and just being like giving them an avenue to like

1618
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,670
get it

1619
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,510
if that makes any sense

1620
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,130
another way to see it is

1621
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,750
you're converging towards a common vision

1622
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,470
and that makes like brainstorming much more productive

1623
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,890
yeah

1624
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,070
it just makes it where i don't have to be so involved in everything

1625
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,810
because i just have these people i know

1626
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,950
will think like

1627
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,369
i will

1628
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:27,550
uh

1629
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,530
at least relatively close to it

1630
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,070
so i can kind of almost be in multiple places at once per se

1631
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,990
and so these things that you know

1632
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,490
i still approve every idea we film and you know everything before we film it all the creative

1633
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,630
i approve it

1634
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,410
but i don't have to like

1635
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,890
be in the weeds and nuances and do all this minor stuff

1636
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,210
i can just let them handle it

1637
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,349
i can just do the more macro things

1638
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,810
i got a chance to sit in to a lengthy brainstorming session with tyler and others

1639
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,250
that was really cool

1640
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,550
can you talk about the process of that of

1641
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,210
uh

1642
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,930
people pitching ideas and you pitching alternatives or shutting down ideas

1643
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,210
and it's just going like plowing through ideas

1644
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:07,630
very good

1645
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,750
i mean you kind of just describe exactly what we did

1646
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:10,930
yeah

1647
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:11,950
i mean

1648
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,750
but the ideas are really really good

1649
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,589
it's just tossing out like different categories of ideas and then also fine-tuning them to see

1650
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,609
like you know

1651
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:21,970
i changed

1652
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,730
like thinking about the titles and the stuff i worked so well off of inspiration

1653
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,589
it's like that's a something like give

1654
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,130
give me anywhere

1655
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,050
i don't know space

1656
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,050
yeah

1657
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,609
like i went to space

1658
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:35,710
you know what happens if you love a nuke in space

1659
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,790
or i went to the moon

1660
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,329
i went to mars

1661
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:37,570
right

1662
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,430
because you said that one word

1663
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,950
it was able to inspire me to come up with four ideas

1664
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:48,130
and so that's just it's for me if you the way to get 100 million views on videos

1665
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:48,849
you need something original

1666
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,150
creative

1667
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,250
something people really need to see

1668
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:51,369
ideally

1669
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,470
never been done before all these like things

1670
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,030
and so you need like

1671
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,470
if you want to consistently go supervisor

1672
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,210
you need just a constant stream of ideas

1673
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,770
and the only way i've really found

1674
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,510
that i can consistently come up with 100 million view videos is to intake inspiration

1675
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,070
and then see what my brain outputs

1676
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:09,310
and so that's kind of at its core foundation

1677
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:14,829
what i'm doing there is just like in taking a lot of random inspiration to see what spawns in my mind

1678
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,210
so i can output it

1679
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,349
but the neural network of your brain is generating the video

1680
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:21,130
the title

1681
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,790
the thumbnail

1682
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,690
all that jointly

1683
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,230
exactly

1684
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,390
and that only comes because i spent 10 years of my life just obsessively studying all that stuff

1685
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,750
because you

1686
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,369
i mean it seems like you would literally potentially shut down a video just

1687
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:34,690
because you can't come up with a good title

1688
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:34,990
yeah

1689
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,490
or a thumbnail

1690
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:36,670
yeah

1691
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,250
i mean that's what happened to 70 of those in that pitch session

1692
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,910
i was just like

1693
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,030
oh

1694
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,490
what was one of them genius versus 100 people or

1695
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:42,849
yeah

1696
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:43,329
like

1697
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,010
maybe average intelligence versus genius

1698
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:45,550
yeah

1699
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,690
i was like

1700
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,890
what the heck is the thumbnail

1701
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,030
even if the title was good

1702
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,210
yeah

1703
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:49,390
yeah

1704
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,890
i mean there's so many

1705
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,369
but yeah

1706
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:51,970
people don't click

1707
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,510
they don't watch

1708
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,490
that's so interesting

1709
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:55,690
but you developed over time

1710
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,910
the ability to kind of give it

1711
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,089
what

1712
00:42:58,099 --> 00:42:59,650
what makes for a good title short

1713
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,150
not just short

1714
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,750
it's also

1715
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,710
i mean if someone reads it

1716
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,430
are they like

1717
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,109
do they have to watch it

1718
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:12,910
is it just so intrinsically interesting that it's just gonna fuck with them if they don't click on it

1719
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,450
you know what i mean

1720
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,890
so it doesn't have to be short

1721
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,990
but it has to be like

1722
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,130
you almost want to have a retention to word by word reading

1723
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:21,730
ideally

1724
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,710
it's a title also that

1725
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:24,730
um

1726
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,329
you know

1727
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:26,530
because the titles don't live in a vacuum

1728
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:26,770
right

1729
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:28,569
so it has to lead into the content

1730
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:29,170
so ideally

1731
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:32,890
the title represents content that you would want to watch for 20 minutes

1732
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,109
so if it's a 20 minute video and the title is

1733
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:35,890
i stepped on a bug

1734
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,030
it's not gonna

1735
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,230
because it's all of it combined

1736
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,329
it's the click-through rate is going to be much lower

1737
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:41,109
and then

1738
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,069
if it was like a five second video

1739
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,089
people might click it

1740
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:43,930
so you gotta like

1741
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,910
even nuances of the length of the video

1742
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,609
based against the title will affect whether people want to click it

1743
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:49,930
because sometimes they just all add up

1744
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,829
i mean it's that

1745
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:51,069
yes

1746
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:51,550
ideally

1747
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,869
you want it below 50 characters

1748
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,130
because above 50 characters

1749
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,910
on certain devices

1750
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,230
you run the chance of it going

1751
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,349
dot

1752
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:57,010
dot dot

1753
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,310
so

1754
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,109
like i took a light pole

1755
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,730
and i saw how many dollar bills i could stack on top and they would just go dot dot

1756
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,470
because it's too long and it can't finish it

1757
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,369
and that's the worst thing

1758
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:09,190
because then people don't even know what they're clicking on and so it's going to do even worse

1759
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:10,390
um

1760
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:10,450
short

1761
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:11,109
simple

1762
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:11,589
ideally

1763
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,450
and just so freaking interesting

1764
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,230
they have to click

1765
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,250
and it is a good segue into the content and represents the length of the content

1766
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,150
and there's probably stuff

1767
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,849
it's hard to kind of convert into words for you

1768
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:27,190
like i stepped on a bug versus stepping in a bug versus mr b stepped on the bus

1769
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,369
well

1770
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,190
i mean that bug stepping that up

1771
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:30,550
so it's like

1772
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:30,730
yes

1773
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,589
the more extreme the opinion

1774
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:32,950
typically

1775
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,030
the higher the click-through rate

1776
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,510
if you can

1777
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:34,630
like

1778
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:35,109
uh

1779
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,569
pay it off in the content

1780
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,490
then it just supercharges it

1781
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:39,790
so like

1782
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,770
oh so you have a kind of estimate of the experience

1783
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,030
this water

1784
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:43,450
right

1785
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,270
if you're like fiji water sucks

1786
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:46,569
yeah

1787
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,650
that would do fine

1788
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,849
but if you said fiji water is the worst water bottle or the worst water

1789
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:52,869
i've ever drank in my life

1790
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:52,990
yeah

1791
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,210
way more extreme opinion would do way better

1792
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,930
but you have to deliver

1793
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,050
yeah

1794
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,490
but then you have to deliver

1795
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,750
because the more extreme you are

1796
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,829
the more extreme you have to be in the video

1797
00:44:59,839 --> 00:44:59,950
yeah

1798
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,890
that's almost inspiration for you to step up

1799
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,069
yeah

1800
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,569
but you can

1801
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:06,310
you can be more extreme in a positive way

1802
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,150
a lot of people

1803
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:07,569
it's easier

1804
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:07,869
though

1805
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,310
pause it

1806
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,089
uh

1807
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:10,990
negative

1808
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,390
clickbait is much easier than positive cliff

1809
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,230
it just is

1810
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,210
it's so much easier to get negative clicks

1811
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,030
and so a lot of people are just in my opinion

1812
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,690
you know

1813
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,970
a little bit lazier and they just take the route like

1814
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,150
oh

1815
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,430
well this one gets the same amount of clicks and it's easier

1816
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,089
less effort

1817
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,410
the positive one is doing a large number of numbers of something

1818
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,369
like i

1819
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,589
i spent this number of hours doing this or whatever

1820
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:34,270
if you just wanted to help people or right

1821
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,930
it's just harder to get 10 million views on a video helping people

1822
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,150
than it is to get 10 million views on a video tearing down a celebrity

1823
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,210
you know what i mean or whatever negative video you want to insert there

1824
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:43,450
well

1825
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,470
that said

1826
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,730
most of your videos are pretty positive

1827
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,810
so what's

1828
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,510
but not a lot of people do those kinds of videos because they're hard

1829
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:49,690
yeah

1830
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:50,349
they're hard

1831
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:52,510
some of that is giving away money

1832
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:52,810
right

1833
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,290
yeah

1834
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,490
um

1835
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,510
what's the secret to that

1836
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,490
what's how do you do do that

1837
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:57,790
right

1838
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,030
yeah

1839
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,170
like give away money or in a video that made to make it compelling

1840
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,030
um

1841
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,390
is it

1842
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,970
so there's a number that is better than another number

1843
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:07,329
right

1844
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,490
the higher number is always better than the other number

1845
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:09,790
yeah

1846
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,630
for the most part

1847
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,770
and you know it's interesting

1848
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,410
like some videos will give away a million dollars

1849
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,670
some videos will give away half a million

1850
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,510
there's not really

1851
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,349
i guess

1852
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,670
so i'm retracting what i just said

1853
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,690
i was more joking with that

1854
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,450
but there's no difference whether i put 500k or a million

1855
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,730
it's probably not even really a difference between 100k a million

1856
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,630
i haven't really looked into it

1857
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,230
like some of our mostly videos are not us giving away a million dollars

1858
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,750
and sometimes the million dollar videos just don't do as well as the other ones

1859
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,550
so there there's a certain point

1860
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,089
where a dollar amount is just a large dollar amount to an average human

1861
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:39,430
and so i think that point is 100k

1862
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,810
like anything above 100k

1863
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,569
the average human's just like that's a lot of money

1864
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:44,109
you know it

1865
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:44,290
doesn't

1866
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,470
it doesn't 100k a million like it doesn't really move the needle

1867
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:48,310
if that makes sense

1868
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,690
which that's a very nuanced piece of information that applies to very few people

1869
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,290
but yeah

1870
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:54,069
well

1871
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:54,310
no

1872
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,790
i think it applies

1873
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:55,450
it's fascinating

1874
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:56,290
it's fascinating

1875
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:56,710
human

1876
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,829
our relationship with money is fascinating like

1877
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,630
why is it so exciting to get

1878
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,310
i mean i

1879
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:04,270
you know

1880
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,810
the times i found like 20 bucks in the ground are like incredible

1881
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:08,710
really

1882
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,730
i don't know why

1883
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:09,910
right

1884
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,270
why

1885
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,770
why are you so happy

1886
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,010
like

1887
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,349
what exactly is so joyful about that

1888
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,030
i mean it depends where you are in life

1889
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,170
what the situation is

1890
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,410
yeah

1891
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:18,730
i don't know

1892
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,069
there's also a gamified aspect to it it's exciting

1893
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:21,609
yes

1894
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,030
no

1895
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:22,869
i get it

1896
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,550
like why people want to see people win money

1897
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,650
it's just interesting that past 100 grand

1898
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:26,950
it's

1899
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,569
it doesn't really seem to make a difference

1900
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,710
like it's the same

1901
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:29,829
basically

1902
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,569
so you found

1903
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:34,450
that to be true with all the money you've given away that i just didn't click through it

1904
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,730
like obviously in terms of someone receiving it

1905
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:36,910
yeah

1906
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,589
a million dollars changes their life drastically

1907
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,010
more

1908
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:39,790
like

1909
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,690
that's the difference

1910
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:40,810
like

1911
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,230
oh you

1912
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:41,829
if you wanted to

1913
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,829
you could really quit your job as opposed to 100k is like not really

1914
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,089
you probably do

1915
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:47,349
like a scientific study

1916
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,950
like a formula giving away money to click-through rate

1917
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,190
yeah

1918
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,470
there could be some kind of digestion return

1919
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,190
it definitely the

1920
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,829
the returns level off dramatically after 100k

1921
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,270
that's basically the premise

1922
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,050
what about ten thousand

1923
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,430
uh

1924
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:00,430
no

1925
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:00,970
there's ten

1926
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:01,930
a hundred thousand

1927
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,010
is that it's funny because this is such a small niche thing

1928
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:06,369
but yeah

1929
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,810
100 000 does it from what i see in our videos get more clicks than ten thousand

1930
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:13,450
but the difference between a hundred thousand million is just so little

1931
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,410
i just i think

1932
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:14,829
big number

1933
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:17,290
big number to a lot of people past that point

1934
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:17,410
yeah

1935
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,670
so for 100

1936
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,150
000

1937
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,950
you can like give an average salary

1938
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,950
you could probably live for a year given give them a day out

1939
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,910
average salaries in america

1940
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,109
so that's like a big

1941
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:26,470
that feels

1942
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:26,770
yeah

1943
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,569
i think it's also just more when they read the title

1944
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:29,890
it's just like it's a lot of zeros

1945
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,630
fuck loads of zeros

1946
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:31,869
okay

1947
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:32,109
click

1948
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:32,530
yeah

1949
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,410
oh man

1950
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:35,770
that's fascinating

1951
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,210
so on the thumbnail side again

1952
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:39,550
that's going to be much harder to say

1953
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:39,670
probably

1954
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:41,410
um

1955
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,310
but you know

1956
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:42,430
offline

1957
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,030
you know i got a chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails and it's fascinating

1958
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,869
which ones do well

1959
00:48:46,879 --> 00:48:51,310
and which ones don't is there something you could say about what are the elements of a thumbnail

1960
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,089
that work well

1961
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,410
is this also deeply

1962
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:53,710
well

1963
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,430
that's where

1964
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:54,609
yeah

1965
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:55,690
it's the same thing like

1966
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,710
how do you cook good food

1967
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,670
but um

1968
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,410
it's easier if you pull up a thumbnail

1969
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,130
i could be like

1970
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:00,790
that's why that's good

1971
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,569
that's why that's bad

1972
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:02,170
that's uh

1973
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,210
like an example would be like one of my friends

1974
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:04,630
i was

1975
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,270
he just uploaded a video recently and i called him

1976
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:07,690
i was like

1977
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,130
what is this because he's a very

1978
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,670
very smart guy

1979
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,690
and then the thumbnail

1980
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:10,990
he's

1981
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,730
he's getting chased by cops

1982
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,010
but the cops are wearing yellow vests

1983
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,329
so they didn't look at cops

1984
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:16,869
i was like

1985
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:16,990
whoa

1986
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,810
why are the cops in your thumbnail wearing yellow vests

1987
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,670
it's like that makes it so much more boring

1988
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,190
and he was like carrying a flag

1989
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,650
but the poll and the color of the flag were the same color

1990
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,569
so it's like it's a lot harder to see the flag

1991
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:29,290
i was like

1992
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:29,349
also

1993
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,630
you're wearing like a shirt with like five different colors like

1994
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:36,190
so it's like it's hard to tell what even what your outline is

1995
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,410
and then in the background there were cars and i was like

1996
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:38,470
oh

1997
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,550
if you have cops chasing you

1998
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,569
why not make the cars cop cars and you know and it's like

1999
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:44,349
because in my head i'm like

2000
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:44,410
dang

2001
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,130
if he just did those

2002
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,210
like four or five things

2003
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,410
the video probably got

2004
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,790
like seven next the views

2005
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,109
how much iteration

2006
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,430
because i also got a chance to see the number of iterations you do on a on

2007
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,410
just it's a problem

2008
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,390
now it's an addiction

2009
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,230
is it

2010
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,310
so you kind of

2011
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,030
there's

2012
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,710
a lot of the versions were really good

2013
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:02,950
yeah

2014
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,390
how do you know when to like

2015
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:04,990
i love how you

2016
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,950
when we pulled up that

2017
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,250
uh

2018
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,630
the burger one and we were flipping through them

2019
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:07,930
you're like

2020
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,290
that's really good

2021
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,710
i was like

2022
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:08,770
oh

2023
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,869
that's version like one of like a thousand

2024
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,790
but even the sketch

2025
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:13,750
the idea was good

2026
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,290
like already

2027
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,210
even the original idea is strong

2028
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,510
yeah

2029
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,290
so we

2030
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,250
one of our coming up videos

2031
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,810
we made the world's largest plant-based burger

2032
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,569
and the thumbnail we were thinking is like me standing beside the bird

2033
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:23,410
because it's six feet tall

2034
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,849
that's that's what he's talking about

2035
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:25,390
so like

2036
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,730
just picture a giant six foot tall burger super wide

2037
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:28,930
thousands of pounds

2038
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,890
and then i'm beside it

2039
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,829
and then it's like eating the world's largest burger like you

2040
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:34,569
that's just something you have to click like

2041
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:35,470
so you were saying

2042
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,450
like how would you describe a good thumbnail like that

2043
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,470
you know what i mean like

2044
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,670
but i think you said the one i noticed first that was good

2045
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,670
where you were very small in it relative to the

2046
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,690
and you didn't like that one

2047
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,130
i needed to come forward a little bit

2048
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,829
and also the photo we took was

2049
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,069
uh

2050
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:51,970
just my upper body

2051
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,089
yeah

2052
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:54,130
so they photo manipulating created my legs

2053
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:54,430
photoshop

2054
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,470
and that's why i said i didn't like it

2055
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,210
because my right leg was a little like off

2056
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,950
it was like bent the wrong way

2057
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,410
does the physics and thumbnail have to even make sense

2058
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,470
i mean you can just like exaggerate the head size and all that kind of yeah

2059
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:08,589
100

2060
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:08,890
yeah

2061
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,329
things don't have to be relative

2062
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:10,630
yeah

2063
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,450
you can have a car in the background be three times the size

2064
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:13,630
yeah

2065
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,170
because

2066
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:14,530
yeah

2067
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,430
every one of my thumbnails

2068
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,530
my face is in the you know

2069
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,069
left side

2070
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:18,609
very big

2071
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:19,809
so brand recognition

2072
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,890
so just people know

2073
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:21,309
oh

2074
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,829
especially because now that a lot of people copy our videos

2075
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,869
it's just nice to like you know

2076
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:27,730
everyone else might make thumbnails like this

2077
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,930
but this is mine and obviously we usually over deliver and do bigger stuff

2078
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,210
would you recommend to other creators that wanna that

2079
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,410
wanna make it big to

2080
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:36,910
and they see mr beast

2081
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,349
and they look up to you to copy some elements of you or to really try to be unique

2082
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:41,710
unique

2083
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:42,670
100

2084
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:42,910
unique

2085
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,490
you're not the next mr beast quote

2086
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,109
feels weird saying that third person

2087
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,230
but whatever is not gonna do what i'm doing better

2088
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,910
they're gonna just invent their own lane

2089
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,650
like you're just not going to do what i do

2090
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,190
better than me

2091
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,150
you know

2092
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,050
i have so many

2093
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,270
i literally have the best people in the world working here and i

2094
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,250
i reinvest everything i make even to this day

2095
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:00,910
you know what i mean

2096
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,089
like

2097
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:01,450
it's absurd

2098
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,030
the amount of money i spent on content and i don't care

2099
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,809
i'll just stop sleeping

2100
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,890
and i'll just film every other day like you're just not gonna beat me at my own game

2101
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,490
and that's fine

2102
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:09,910
you shouldn't

2103
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,450
like i didn't get where i am by just beating someone else out there again

2104
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,630
i just found my own lane and innovated and adapted and so yeah

2105
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,430
there's a lot of people that do copy me

2106
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,510
and it's fine

2107
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,470
whatever do it

2108
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,050
but just know you're not gonna get to where i am doing that

2109
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:23,890
um

2110
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,030
and so i'd advise you

2111
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,970
don't you give away a lot of the secrets

2112
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,230
basically everything

2113
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,470
yeah

2114
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,609
about how you operate

2115
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,270
is there

2116
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:31,510
uh

2117
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,470
i don't hold anything back

2118
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,369
go for it

2119
00:52:33,379 --> 00:52:33,730
you know

2120
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,390
how do you think about that

2121
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,869
because that's also

2122
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,650
that's pretty rare

2123
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,309
i think

2124
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:38,170
and this is a definitely not

2125
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:38,530
uh

2126
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,510
most people in my stance

2127
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,809
i don't think would take this or my position would take this stance

2128
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:47,650
but i see every other youtuber or so person on social media

2129
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,630
even because we're also focused super heavily on youtube

2130
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,390
but last year we're also the most followed tick tock creator in the world

2131
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:52,630
as well

2132
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,990
i actually remember most subscribed to youtube channel world and the most followed tick tock account in the world

2133
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:56,710
um

2134
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:56,829
but

2135
00:52:57,059 --> 00:52:57,309
uh

2136
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,150
in general

2137
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,109
i just see everyone else

2138
00:52:59,119 --> 00:52:59,890
as uh collaborators

2139
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:00,670
not competitors

2140
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,210
i

2141
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,609
i don't think giving advice and helping other creators do well in any way harms me

2142
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:08,410
and i think it only brings more value to my life

2143
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:13,270
how is it jumping on tick tock and trying to understand that platform from scratch

2144
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:13,569
yeah

2145
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,170
so

2146
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,050
from being a successful youtuber to understand a totally different algorithm

2147
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:18,369
fundamentally different algorithm

2148
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,510
it's interesting

2149
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,050
well

2150
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:20,770
not even just the algorithm

2151
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,490
just the content

2152
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:26,470
like i'm going from basically 15 minute short films to one sub

2153
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:26,950
one minute

2154
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,730
vertical content

2155
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,930
at least a whole different

2156
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:30,010
just ballpark

2157
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,450
um

2158
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,970
and so the first little while is doing tick tock

2159
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:39,010
it was just kind of figuring out how what does mr beast look like in this short form content

2160
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,470
but recently we've really started to catch our stride

2161
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,190
and come up with some original concepts and figure out how to innovate over there

2162
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:45,910
just like we did on youtube

2163
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,410
because i don't want it

2164
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,809
i didn't want it to just be shitty youtube videos

2165
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,170
yeah

2166
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:50,770
you know

2167
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,309
and so

2168
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:52,450
like an example is

2169
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,050
um

2170
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,970
we played the rock for 100k and rock paper scissors and the loser had to donate 100k to charity

2171
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,390
we did

2172
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:58,930
um

2173
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:02,589
we went to random people on a campus and we offered them

2174
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:05,470
so i said i'll give you a hundred dollars if you fly to paris

2175
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,190
to give me a baguette

2176
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:07,450
and then they said no

2177
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,450
and i was like i'll give you 300 if a lot of hairs and give me a big hat

2178
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,030
and i was expecting this person to say no and it go up to like 10 grand

2179
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,809
he's like yes

2180
00:54:13,819 --> 00:54:15,369
and so he flew to paris

2181
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,589
got a baguette and brought it back and gave it to me

2182
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,530
and that across everything got like 450 million views

2183
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,430
and because it's just really cool just to see this random guy get on a plane

2184
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,550
spend a day in paris and we cut it up real nicely and bring it back

2185
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,150
and so we're starting to find just tons of original content over there

2186
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,609
but it seems like an epic video to make for one minute

2187
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:33,730
exactly

2188
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,470
no one on short forms doing it

2189
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,130
that's the thing

2190
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:36,490
it's like okay

2191
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,170
it's just so funny

2192
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,809
because like tick tock's been big for a while now years

2193
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,010
and then

2194
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:42,550
um

2195
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,210
you know

2196
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:43,329
as

2197
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,930
as we started to really figure out things on the youtube channel and get it cranking

2198
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,890
where i have some free time

2199
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,069
we

2200
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,829
we set our sights on tick tock and like okay

2201
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,809
what are people not doing

2202
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:54,069
how do we make it better

2203
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:54,910
put in more effort

2204
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,630
make it good

2205
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,430
and we did the same thing we did at youtube

2206
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,650
just different over on tick tock and it worked

2207
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,309
and now we're the fastest growing or most followed tick tock account in 2022

2208
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,309
and it's just funny that no one else did that

2209
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,170
and you're not afraid to do epic stuff

2210
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,910
which also during the brainstorming

2211
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,369
some of the ideas you're like

2212
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:13,210
that's better as a short

2213
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,410
that's crazy

2214
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:14,829
yeah

2215
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,089
can you remember one

2216
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:17,410
because i remember i said that a bunch

2217
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,130
but i can't think of what

2218
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:21,430
all i remember is that they were like epic videos

2219
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:22,930
like

2220
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:23,530
really

2221
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:25,930
you're going to do that for a one minute video

2222
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,230
yeah

2223
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:26,950
that's crazy

2224
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:27,550
so like

2225
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,890
are you posting similar content to a youtube short

2226
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:30,730
as a tick tock

2227
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,030
yeah

2228
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,170
those would just double up

2229
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:32,950
it's just hard

2230
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,609
you know

2231
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:36,369
what's actually pretty fascinating in people who do social media

2232
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:37,869
listening to this will probably find this pretty interesting

2233
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,130
because the picture of like the content creation meta three years ago versus now

2234
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,349
where you can make sub one minute

2235
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:47,890
vertical content and it go viral on tick tock and go viral on youtube

2236
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,010
shorts

2237
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,270
go viral on instagram

2238
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,450
reels

2239
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,770
it goes viral on facebook

2240
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,970
it goes reddit

2241
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,970
you know you swipe through vertical content now and twitter

2242
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,530
when you click on a video and you flip through it

2243
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,510
so this is actually very weird

2244
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,950
this is the first time in the history of

2245
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:01,690
i guess western social media

2246
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,530
that one form of content could actually go super viral on every single platform

2247
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:06,970
it's never been like that before

2248
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,530
so they're going viral individually

2249
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,990
they're not like like something or whatever

2250
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,190
i can post something on tick tock

2251
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,990
they'll get 100 million views and then post it on shorts

2252
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,849
and it'll get 200 million views and then post it on instagram

2253
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:18,910
and i get 50 million views and then you know i haven't yet

2254
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,170
but you know you can then turn around

2255
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,690
and tweet it and get tens of millions of views and you can post it on reddit

2256
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,589
get tons of interviews

2257
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:23,829
and

2258
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:28,450
and facebook and get tens of millions of views and that that just wasn't a thing three years ago

2259
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,890
twitter didn't have when

2260
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,170
because a lot of you probably don't even know this

2261
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,790
but when you tap on a video now and you swipe down

2262
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,990
it just turns into tick tock

2263
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,670
that wasn't a thing even a year ago

2264
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:36,910
reddit

2265
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,530
that wasn't a thing a year ago

2266
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,730
probably two years ago

2267
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,809
that wasn't a thing on instagram

2268
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,250
three years ago

2269
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,270
that wasn't a thing on youtube

2270
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,470
right with youtube shorts

2271
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,730
so this is all new

2272
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:45,970
and

2273
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:46,569
uh

2274
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:47,109
i don't

2275
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:47,650
it's weird

2276
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,569
i haven't heard a single person talk about it

2277
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,130
but this is the first time

2278
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:55,270
where content can actually go viral on every single platform

2279
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:58,569
and you don't have to write or film a video for facebook film

2280
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:00,369
a 12 minute video for youtube film

2281
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,770
a sub 60 second video for tick tock

2282
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,290
write a tweet for twitter and post this on reddit

2283
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,030
you can just do the same thing on every platform

2284
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:14,710
and the fact that your content has gone viral on multiple platforms regularly means that virality is not accidental

2285
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:17,170
sometimes it can be

2286
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:17,530
of course

2287
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,010
but it's

2288
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,210
it's just it can be engineered

2289
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:19,690
it's

2290
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:19,990
yeah

2291
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,190
so many people say it's luck

2292
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,170
and they're like you're just lucky or this or that

2293
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,150
but what are we up to

2294
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,950
probably like a thousand videos over 10 million views

2295
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,349
like we don't ever have a dud like you can call it luck

2296
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,550
but i think it could be trained

2297
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:30,910
i

2298
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,829
i counsel youtubers all the time

2299
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:36,970
and show them how to go from getting a couple million views a month to 10 million views a month

2300
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,510
very easily

2301
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,010
if i'm even certain

2302
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:39,369
ones

2303
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,530
like just one of my friends

2304
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,490
like he was just really struggling

2305
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:47,170
and so i just started showing him basically everything i know and just doing like once every week

2306
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,410
sometimes

2307
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,490
once every two weeks

2308
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,089
calls and it went from ten thousand dollars a month on youtube to over four hundred thousand

2309
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,950
just doing these little counseling calls

2310
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,589
and so i mean people can make excuses all they want

2311
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:58,450
and say it's just luck or say you know

2312
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,230
um

2313
00:57:59,520 --> 00:57:59,770
well

2314
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:00,430
anyways

2315
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,230
i don't even want to quote all the other stuff

2316
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,210
but it's just it is

2317
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,290
it is a teachable skill

2318
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,069
it's a learnable skill

2319
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:10,809
you can study your way to consistently make viral videos

2320
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:11,770
no matter how small your channel is

2321
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:12,670
even if you have zero subscribers

2322
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,630
you could

2323
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:13,750
if

2324
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,910
if you actually studied hard enough and like

2325
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,150
basically

2326
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,349
if you knew what i knew

2327
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,010
and some of these

2328
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,630
so i don't sound so arrogant

2329
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,050
also

2330
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:22,990
like some of these other friends i have that i'd say are the smartest people in the world

2331
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,069
when it comes to content creation online

2332
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,710
if you had the knowledge that was in our heads

2333
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,210
you could do it very easily

2334
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,890
i see people do it all the time

2335
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:30,849
um

2336
00:58:30,859 --> 00:58:35,349
and what's even more interesting is i go on podcasts and i say everything i know

2337
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,150
and these people are also very open

2338
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:37,930
some of them

2339
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:41,170
i know it's all out there and a lot of people

2340
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,170
instead of just studying that and trying to absorb and apply it in their own way

2341
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:44,589
they're just like

2342
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:44,710
no

2343
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,069
it's just luck

2344
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:45,670
you know

2345
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,010
so you do lay it all out there

2346
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,650
but i gotta push back to one interesting thing

2347
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:50,829
i

2348
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:54,730
i think a crucial component of your success is the idea stage

2349
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:55,750
the idea generation

2350
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,609
the brainstorm i heard today

2351
00:58:57,619 --> 00:58:59,710
but getting really good at generating idea is

2352
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,970
so it's not

2353
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,930
it's not just the uh

2354
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,490
the selection of the thumbnail and the title

2355
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,390
that creative process

2356
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,770
it's also just the the engine of generating really good ideas

2357
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,549
of course

2358
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:13,089
and getting that

2359
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:13,569
i mean

2360
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:14,589
i i would say

2361
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:18,069
that is probably the thing that needs to be trained the most for most creators

2362
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:18,670
right that

2363
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:18,970
they're

2364
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,829
they just don't put enough ideas on paper

2365
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:21,010
yes

2366
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,650
but also a lot of creators also

2367
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:24,309
just

2368
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:24,490
don't

2369
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:25,869
you know

2370
00:59:25,879 --> 00:59:26,589
which i didn't either

2371
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:27,490
for the longest time

2372
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,869
just didn't don't make good enough content

2373
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:29,650
you know

2374
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:29,710
content

2375
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,430
that's worthy of getting 10 million views in the idea or the execution of the idea

2376
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:33,609
both

2377
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,569
i mean

2378
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:34,690
like

2379
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,290
think about how many people just make videos they film in under 20 minutes

2380
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:40,030
and they don't really put any effort into it

2381
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,170
and like you know

2382
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,950
it's like my first 500 videos didn't deserve to get a million views

2383
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,849
like there's a reason they did

2384
00:59:45,859 --> 00:59:46,270
they're terrible

2385
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:46,990
you know

2386
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,589
but at the time i thought they did right now i'm in the mindset of a lot of small youtubers

2387
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:53,049
or i thought those videos deserved a million views

2388
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:54,069
and i thought the algorithm hated me

2389
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,190
but i watched them back now and i can tell you exactly why the videos was fucking horrible

2390
00:59:57,299 --> 00:59:58,089
you know what i mean

2391
00:59:58,099 --> 00:59:58,210
well

2392
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,130
so what was the breakthrough for you to start realizing

2393
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,930
to start having a self-awareness you know about these videos aren't good enough

2394
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,290
you're probably still going through that you're probably still growing to see like

2395
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:08,530
yeah

2396
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,549
every six months

2397
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:14,049
you should look back and hate your videos or at least see things you could improve and be like

2398
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:14,230
oh

2399
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,010
i could have done this better

2400
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:15,130
that

2401
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:15,609
better

2402
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:16,390
if not

2403
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,510
then you're not learning quick enough in my opinion

2404
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:22,150
at least where's the source of that learning even for you now

2405
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,410
uh

2406
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,069
just look at it

2407
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:24,849
i just got back from him

2408
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:24,970
no

2409
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:25,210
i'm

2410
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,190
i just got back from a mastermind where i just got

2411
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,790
like you know

2412
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,170
10 of the smartest people i knew

2413
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:32,549
and we just locked ourselves in a cabin and taught each other stuff constantly

2414
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:33,849
every day

2415
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:34,809
not every day

2416
01:00:34,819 --> 01:00:34,990
now

2417
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,770
probably every other day

2418
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,270
i go on a walk and i just call random people

2419
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,530
i'll just say teach me something

2420
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:38,650
and

2421
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:39,490
uh

2422
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,930
i mean it's just

2423
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:41,170
uh

2424
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,069
you just have to have a never-ending thirst for learning link

2425
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,030
that's very imperative

2426
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,410
especially if you want

2427
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:47,530
like

2428
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,270
if you want to get on top and then stay on top

2429
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,829
the only way to do it is just to constantly be learning

2430
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,930
or someone who is learning is just gonna

2431
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,650
you know

2432
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:54,970
have a leg up on you in the knowledge game

2433
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,589
and what kind of stuff

2434
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:00,970
are you because you you've talked about offline that you just love learning of all kinds

2435
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,329
it doesn't matter

2436
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:03,010
but in terms of videos

2437
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:03,670
are you studying

2438
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:03,910
videos

2439
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,869
are you studying recently

2440
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,130
not as much

2441
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:06,670
i'm more

2442
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,770
because to get to the videos i want

2443
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,910
i have to build this business

2444
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,630
and scale up

2445
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,950
and hire so one of my recent time has been like my teenage years were spent studying virality

2446
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,150
and studying content creation

2447
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,490
now i'm studying how to build a content company so i can actually produce the crazy ideas i want to produce

2448
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,450
if that makes any sense

2449
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:22,690
so

2450
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:23,109
yeah

2451
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,309
and that's the business side

2452
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:24,609
uh

2453
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:25,930
we talked about hiring

2454
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,549
do you have trouble firing people

2455
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:27,790
no

2456
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,470
i'm pretty sure almost every person

2457
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:29,770
yeah

2458
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,510
actually every person i've ever heard

2459
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,349
we just give them severance

2460
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,290
and i like to see it more as it's no

2461
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:35,530
ill

2462
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:35,770
well

2463
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:35,890
like

2464
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:36,730
if there's like

2465
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:37,690
if i fired you

2466
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,230
if is

2467
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,130
there's some other job

2468
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,329
you want me to help you get

2469
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:41,530
i'll dm them on twitter

2470
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,430
like you know

2471
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,210
if you want to go work for

2472
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,410
i don't know

2473
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,230
insert whatever mtv give me someone to dm

2474
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:47,770
i'll dm

2475
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,549
like you know

2476
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,589
i i try to make it more like a transition

2477
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,930
and do whatever we can to make it as easy as something

2478
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,990
was just not working for you because you want people like you said

2479
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,349
super passionate

2480
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:57,609
because at the end of the day

2481
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:58,869
if you hold someone that you

2482
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,230
uh

2483
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,609
onto someone that you don't see

2484
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:01,510
being here in 10 years

2485
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,349
you're just doing a disservice

2486
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,010
you're just giving them more ingrained more and rooted and where where they are

2487
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:06,970
um

2488
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,390
and the sooner you do it and help them move on to their like new life

2489
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:10,809
the better

2490
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:14,049
given all the wisdom you have now

2491
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:17,470
if you were to give advice to somebody or if you were to start over again

2492
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:18,430
uh

2493
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:20,470
you had no money

2494
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,690
what would be the first 10 videos you tried to

2495
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:22,809
uh

2496
01:02:22,859 --> 01:02:24,730
to make on a new channel

2497
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,030
i guess that's advice for a new person and nobody knows you

2498
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:28,089
yeah

2499
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,049
and nobody knows me

2500
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:29,109
yeah

2501
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,290
like

2502
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:29,470
hypothetically

2503
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,369
i have a mask on

2504
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:31,030
and you also

2505
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,049
i guess don't have the wisdom

2506
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:32,410
well

2507
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,150
if i don't have what i have in my head

2508
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,109
then i would say

2509
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,589
just fail like just a lot of people get analysis paralysis

2510
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:42,010
and they'll just sit there and they'll plan their first video for three months

2511
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:42,549
and yeah

2512
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,049
i'm any of you listening

2513
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:44,410
if

2514
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:44,950
if you

2515
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,190
especially

2516
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:46,630
if you have zero videos on your channel

2517
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,190
your first video is not going to give views

2518
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:48,490
period

2519
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,369
it's not your first ten are not gonna give views

2520
01:02:51,379 --> 01:02:52,690
i can very confidently say that

2521
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,309
so stop sitting there

2522
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,329
and thinking for months

2523
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:59,530
and months on end and just get to work and start uploading like all you need to do this

2524
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,910
this applies to people who have not uploaded videos but have dreams of being a youtuber is make 100 videos

2525
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,190
and improve something every time do that

2526
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,750
and then on your 101st video

2527
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,530
we'll start talking like

2528
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,790
maybe you can get some views

2529
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,190
but you know your first hundred are gonna

2530
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,730
there are very freak cases like liza koshy or emma chamberlain

2531
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:18,190
who have really good personalities and it doesn't take them

2532
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:18,369
so

2533
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,510
as many videos

2534
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,470
and it's just like people who are seven foot five and making an nba like

2535
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:23,770
yes

2536
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:25,210
there are free cases you can find

2537
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,250
but for the average person like us

2538
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:27,910
you know

2539
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,150
who don't have these exceptional personalities and you know backgrounds in filmmaking

2540
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,849
just make 100 videos improve something each time

2541
01:03:33,859 --> 01:03:35,890
and then talk to me on your 101st video

2542
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,010
well

2543
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,329
the improve something

2544
01:03:37,339 --> 01:03:38,770
his time is the tricky one

2545
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,450
how do you improve something each time

2546
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,230
the second one

2547
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,609
just i don't know

2548
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:43,809
put more effort into the script

2549
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:45,849
the third one try to learn a new editing trick

2550
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:49,569
the fourth one try to figure out a way that you can have better inflections in your voice

2551
01:03:49,579 --> 01:03:51,369
the fifth one try to you know

2552
01:03:51,379 --> 01:03:53,230
study a new thumbnail tip and implement it

2553
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,670
the sixth one try to figure out a new title

2554
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,990
there's infinite ways

2555
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,790
that's the beauty of content creation online

2556
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,510
there's literally infinite ways from the coloring to the frame rate to the editing to the filming

2557
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,049
to the production

2558
01:04:02,059 --> 01:04:02,710
to the jokes

2559
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,250
to the pacing

2560
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:06,369
to every little thing can be improved and they can never not be improved

2561
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:06,849
there's no

2562
01:04:06,859 --> 01:04:08,650
there's literally no such thing as a perfect video

2563
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,109
so if you knew everything

2564
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:11,710
you know now

2565
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,089
but no money

2566
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:13,750
step one

2567
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,309
would i just brainstorm like okay

2568
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,329
i don't have money

2569
01:04:16,339 --> 01:04:18,010
what are some viral things like

2570
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:18,970
i mean

2571
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,369
the first thing that comes to my mind is something as simple as

2572
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:22,270
when i count to a hundred thousand

2573
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,250
which is what i did do and i i was poor

2574
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:25,270
um

2575
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:25,990
and like that worked

2576
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,530
but like

2577
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,369
what's something like that

2578
01:04:27,379 --> 01:04:27,849
i could do

2579
01:04:27,859 --> 01:04:29,470
that would be even more attention

2580
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:30,369
yeah

2581
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:34,630
you were as part of the brainstorm you would throw out a lot of ideas

2582
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,490
and people throw out a bunch of ideas

2583
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,630
and one of the questions is

2584
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,589
is this even doable

2585
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,010
right

2586
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:39,730
yeah

2587
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:40,450
first off

2588
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,750
come up with ideas you think would do well and then ask yourself later if they're doable

2589
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:44,049
yeah

2590
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:44,470
because there's

2591
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:46,329
there's different ways you can accomplish something

2592
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,089
don't be cynical about the doability of stuff

2593
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:49,270
yeah

2594
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:54,730
because there really are so many different ways you can accomplish a goal like um

2595
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,530
when we give away an island

2596
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:58,030
like we give our 100 million subscribers island

2597
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,210
yeah

2598
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:58,930
you know

2599
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,450
you can't find private islands that you know

2600
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,210
don't look like shit for less than 10 million dollars so this isn't doable

2601
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:04,510
right

2602
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:05,109
all right

2603
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:05,950
the idea doesn't exist

2604
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:07,930
not doable exit off

2605
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,069
but then you know

2606
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:10,690
you dig into it and you

2607
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,170
you know

2608
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,609
find different alternatives and you find okay

2609
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:17,109
what if we just buy a two million dollar island that sucks and then spend a million dollars

2610
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:17,710
you know

2611
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,430
importing some sand

2612
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,270
let's build a beach

2613
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,410
let's import 300 trees

2614
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,490
let's put a little bit of canals

2615
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:21,849
cut

2616
01:05:21,859 --> 01:05:22,450
some pass boom

2617
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,150
now it's a really nice island

2618
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,710
but it's actually affordable

2619
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,569
because we don't have 10 million dollars to spend on video

2620
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:32,470
but we can afford to spend three and a half and lose whatever a million dollars on that video

2621
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:32,589
so

2622
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:32,950
like

2623
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,089
that's an example of like

2624
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:34,329
yeah

2625
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,829
if you just went off the gut test

2626
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:36,730
you're like this isn't doable

2627
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,450
you know

2628
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:38,470
every island is 10 million dollars

2629
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:38,829
we're screwed

2630
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:39,309
like

2631
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:39,790
if we go cheaper

2632
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,109
it's just a terrible island

2633
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,290
no

2634
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,030
and so if you like

2635
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,089
there are so many different ways you can achieve what you want

2636
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:47,230
you've really got to push through notes

2637
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,329
which not a lot of people do you have to have

2638
01:05:49,339 --> 01:05:52,690
like a more of a dominant personality and just a willingness to

2639
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:53,829
um

2640
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:54,849
when people tell you it's not possible

2641
01:05:54,859 --> 01:05:58,450
just actually go through all the variables and eliminate them all yourself

2642
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:01,690
have a stubbornness and

2643
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:02,230
uh

2644
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,130
resilience to failure

2645
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:05,589
maybe for what we do and creators online

2646
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,290
it's very imperative that you have that

2647
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,190
a no

2648
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,089
isn't a no deal that you really have to like think and um

2649
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:13,930
and just like we

2650
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,849
we take a personality test and like

2651
01:06:15,859 --> 01:06:19,510
just having a dominant personality is a better indicator that when someone tells you

2652
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:19,630
oh

2653
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,730
there's no way you're going to build a brick wall for under 100 grand

2654
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,230
you know you'll be like okay

2655
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,109
and then still go check the next 10 vendors and you know

2656
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:26,710
figure it out

2657
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:27,549
yeah

2658
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,210
uh

2659
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,690
what advice would you give to an already established channel

2660
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,349
like with one

2661
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:32,650
two

2662
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:32,829
three

2663
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:33,670
four million subscribers

2664
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,829
how to like 10x

2665
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:36,309
it

2666
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:36,609
like

2667
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:37,510
increase it

2668
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:38,770
um

2669
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:39,190
without losing

2670
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:39,730
maybe

2671
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:39,970
yeah

2672
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:40,930
that's where it's very specific

2673
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:42,250
like channel by channel

2674
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,510
you can't give general advice

2675
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:43,869
okay

2676
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:44,230
yeah

2677
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,549
because if i do

2678
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:49,690
millions of creators are gonna see this and then they're gonna do it and i'm gonna fuck them over

2679
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,170
you know

2680
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:50,289
oh

2681
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:50,650
i see

2682
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,650
so let's say i had like two million subscribers on this podcast

2683
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:53,829
yeah

2684
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:54,430
like

2685
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,730
how would you 10x that without sacrificing what it is

2686
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:58,750
10x is

2687
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,170
your stuff

2688
01:06:59,180 --> 01:06:59,710
does it matter

2689
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,210
so we you've talked about with success

2690
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:01,630
yeah

2691
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:05,589
it's different for everyone like is 10xing your definition of success

2692
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:05,829
no

2693
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,190
well

2694
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:07,150
then it's gonna

2695
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,869
right off the bat

2696
01:07:07,879 --> 01:07:10,089
it's hard because if you don't give a shit about 10x thing

2697
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:11,109
it's even harder for 10x

2698
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:12,069
um

2699
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,809
he does this because he likes helping people

2700
01:07:13,819 --> 01:07:15,970
that's one thing i found throughout this day

2701
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,809
every time i talk data

2702
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:20,410
it's so funny with him because it's like you know you could do this to get more views

2703
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,430
and he'll just be like blank

2704
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:22,630
i'll be like that

2705
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,170
doesn't register anything

2706
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,190
he's just like

2707
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:24,490
doesn't care

2708
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,150
which is

2709
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:25,569
it's really

2710
01:07:25,579 --> 01:07:26,650
i'm really nervous about that

2711
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,270
i'm really nervous about the numbers affecting

2712
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,069
because it's so fun

2713
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:30,970
oh yeah

2714
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,130
it's so fun to focus on the numbers and i'm

2715
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,390
i'm really worried about that

2716
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,170
but at the same time

2717
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,329
you should be cognizant of that

2718
01:07:37,339 --> 01:07:42,789
because you've created not just some of the most watched videos but some of the most amazing videos ever

2719
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:43,809
so it's

2720
01:07:43,819 --> 01:07:45,250
there's a strong correlation

2721
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:45,789
there

2722
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,970
it's not like you're selling your soul to make a highly viewed video

2723
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:49,750
it's actually

2724
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,950
if you look at the metrics

2725
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,490
it helps you understand what is compelling and not

2726
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,890
and so i feel like i am

2727
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:58,270
uh

2728
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:05,410
i feel like there's some value to investigate what work when people tune on and when

2729
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,270
not to be more data driven

2730
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:08,049
even on podcasts

2731
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:09,430
but i'm really afraid

2732
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,450
on the flip side

2733
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,549
i think part of the appeal is that you don't care about that kind of stuff

2734
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,330
but there there could be stuff that doesn't have to do anything with that

2735
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,210
it has to do with stylistic choices of lighting and cameras

2736
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,469
or maybe with

2737
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:21,009
uh

2738
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:23,229
um

2739
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:23,710
for example

2740
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:24,210
topics

2741
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:25,229
yeah

2742
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:26,710
you know

2743
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:26,770
like

2744
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,069
even what you've asked me here is like different than what most people ask me

2745
01:08:30,078 --> 01:08:30,189
yeah

2746
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:30,910
so it could be

2747
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,270
i mean

2748
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,589
and it'd be nice to understand that

2749
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,069
but yeah

2750
01:08:33,078 --> 01:08:33,250
again

2751
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,770
i'm worried about polluting at the end of the day

2752
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:35,890
it's

2753
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:36,069
it's

2754
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:37,569
this is a true case of

2755
01:08:37,578 --> 01:08:38,170
it's your own intuition

2756
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:40,390
like you know your viewers better than anyone else

2757
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,948
it's whatever see

2758
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,149
i'd like to push back on that

2759
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,350
i really don't you do

2760
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:45,250
who else

2761
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,810
name one person who knows your viewers better than you

2762
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:48,069
uh

2763
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,229
somebody that looks at numbers of podcasts

2764
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:50,710
no

2765
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:51,850
you know your viewers

2766
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,350
you know you're the only

2767
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,429
how many episodes have you done

2768
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:54,549
uh

2769
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:54,850
350.

2770
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:55,630
exactly

2771
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,069
but i'm not paying it

2772
01:08:57,078 --> 01:08:59,830
you're the only one who's watched every second of all 350 of them

2773
01:08:59,840 --> 01:08:59,948
probably

2774
01:08:59,959 --> 01:09:00,549
that's just

2775
01:09:00,559 --> 01:09:01,448
that's just not no

2776
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,049
you haven't

2777
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,130
but the okay

2778
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:03,670
well

2779
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,630
because you did it

2780
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,009
so you do know what's in all of them

2781
01:09:06,019 --> 01:09:06,130
sure

2782
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,689
your content is you people

2783
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,130
i'm telling you you do

2784
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,210
and this is just one of those moments

2785
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,710
where you're an intelligent guy and you just have to trust your like instincts like

2786
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,609
just think what is the typical x viewer and what do they want

2787
01:09:18,618 --> 01:09:19,810
i don't think like that

2788
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:20,410
my tip

2789
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,488
but that's all you would have to do

2790
01:09:21,499 --> 01:09:22,689
and whatever your gut tells you

2791
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,370
that would be the best guess

2792
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,890
you don't know what the typical viewer is

2793
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:27,009
though

2794
01:09:27,019 --> 01:09:27,549
i don't

2795
01:09:27,559 --> 01:09:27,850
i know

2796
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:30,250
because to investigate that would be very

2797
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:30,549
very difficult

2798
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,229
and then you have to start looking at the numbers

2799
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,130
you have to start to like

2800
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:33,609
consider demographics

2801
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:38,948
the only way i know that anybody even watches it is because i'll sometimes run into people

2802
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,649
like when i run along the river and they'd be like

2803
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,189
i love you

2804
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:42,310
lex

2805
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,089
it's like okay

2806
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:43,270
well

2807
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:43,509
that

2808
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:43,810
that's

2809
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,630
that's the data point and they're like cool people

2810
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,350
but you know

2811
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:47,710
i don't know any

2812
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:48,009
like

2813
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,330
i don't have any other

2814
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:51,429
it's difficult man

2815
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,569
it's difficult to know

2816
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:55,030
it's difficult to know who listens to boxes

2817
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:55,690
the difficult

2818
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:57,070
do you have a sense of who's

2819
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:57,730
i mean

2820
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,650
like you're so huge that everybody watches

2821
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:00,310
yeah

2822
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:00,790
uh

2823
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,510
but no

2824
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:01,989
i still do

2825
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:02,469
i would say

2826
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:05,050
if you were to just put a gun to my head and you're

2827
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:05,410
you're like

2828
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:05,830
all right

2829
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,949
we're gonna pick a random person that watched your last video and you have to like

2830
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,150
roughly guess what they are

2831
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:10,750
and if you're not close

2832
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:11,590
we'll kill you

2833
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,310
i would say

2834
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,070
probably like a teenager that plays video games

2835
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:15,850
like some

2836
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,670
something like that would be probably the typical one

2837
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,409
and then there are people that are

2838
01:10:20,419 --> 01:10:21,190
maybe a little bit younger

2839
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,170
a lot of people are are older as well

2840
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,390
but in a ramble random sample size

2841
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:25,510
yeah

2842
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,150
it's probably like i'm a male boy that plays video games like

2843
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,590
that's the best way i would describing it

2844
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,030
but i don't try to pertain to them

2845
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,310
i just make whatever i think is interesting and good content

2846
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,210
um

2847
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,530
and this is what we were talking about before

2848
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,310
even though

2849
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,250
hypothetically 35 to 40 of my audience is

2850
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:39,489
uh

2851
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:39,850
women

2852
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:40,449
which is

2853
01:10:40,459 --> 01:10:41,350
you know less than a majority

2854
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,510
if we get 100 million views of video

2855
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,730
that's still 30 to 40 million females that watch every video

2856
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,350
which is probably the largest

2857
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:47,710
uh

2858
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,969
you know views per video for women on the whole platform

2859
01:10:51,979 --> 01:10:52,870
which you wouldn't think that

2860
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,409
you know

2861
01:10:53,419 --> 01:10:53,530
uh

2862
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:54,190
like

2863
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,150
i can't think of a single other creator that gets more women to watch their videos than that

2864
01:10:58,860 --> 01:10:59,110
um

2865
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,090
and so it's just anything

2866
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,890
even like people above the age of 30

2867
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,630
even if it's only like three or four percent

2868
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,150
that's still three to four percent of 100 million views

2869
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,350
there's a lot of people that age

2870
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,710
so we we hit a large group of uh

2871
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,510
of kind of every demographic

2872
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,370
if that makes any sense

2873
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,929
so what if we look at other

2874
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,750
maybe more challenging kinds of channels or not

2875
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,130
but if we look at educational

2876
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:21,850
for example

2877
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:22,330
like lectures

2878
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,530
or if we look

2879
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,130
yeah

2880
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:24,370
educational

2881
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:25,810
it could be short videos

2882
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,050
like

2883
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,750
how would you 10x that like

2884
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:29,469
uh

2885
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,870
something on robotics and biology

2886
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:32,650
on science

2887
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:33,250
on engineering

2888
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,929
on all of that

2889
01:11:34,939 --> 01:11:36,610
that's more educational focused

2890
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,830
we would honestly just have to pull the

2891
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,730
because it's the same way

2892
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,810
if you went to gordon ramsay

2893
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,090
you said how would a new cook cook better

2894
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,290
you know it's like

2895
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,250
even then

2896
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:45,850
that's not even specific

2897
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,110
you have to go channel by channel

2898
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:47,770
you really do

2899
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,489
or i'm

2900
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,630
i'm giving horrible advice

2901
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,770
because if there was these

2902
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,310
just school rules

2903
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,210
everyone would do it

2904
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:52,810
you know what i mean

2905
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:52,929
like

2906
01:11:52,939 --> 01:11:54,310
if there's these magical little principles

2907
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,890
how quickly when you look at a channel

2908
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,570
can you kind of give advice

2909
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:58,870
yeah

2910
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,050
it's

2911
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,090
it's like surface love at the start

2912
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:01,570
and then the more

2913
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,350
if we watch 10 videos

2914
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,630
i feel like i'd have a good profile and i could tell you

2915
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,469
in my opinion

2916
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,250
you know one

2917
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,830
especially once i look at the analytics and i get more ingrained in

2918
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:08,890
like

2919
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,010
okay

2920
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:09,850
the typical viewers

2921
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:10,270
this

2922
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:10,929
they're from here

2923
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:11,830
here's how they're feeling

2924
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,670
you know

2925
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,690
because there are people who make videos for rednecks and like the rednecks

2926
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:21,250
taste of content is just so much different than obviously women watching makeup videos

2927
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:23,050
which are so much different than you know

2928
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,730
teenage boys watching a minecraft video

2929
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:25,929
they're just all different

2930
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:27,730
so the biggest thing you have to do is put

2931
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:28,330
put your head

2932
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:32,350
your head in the headspace of the viewer and see the content how they would

2933
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,330
because if you just try to only give your taste

2934
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:36,610
which is what a lot of people do and things from your perspective

2935
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:39,850
it's very biased and it's just not going to work for everyone

2936
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,710
and that's actually how you do more harm than good

2937
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,150
which is something i'm very careful of

2938
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:43,330
yeah

2939
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,730
but at the same time just generating a lot of ideas

2940
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:46,630
i think the first time

2941
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,409
i've talked to you

2942
01:12:47,419 --> 01:12:47,890
was on clubhouse

2943
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,310
actually

2944
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:48,670
yeah

2945
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:53,890
i mentioned something about robots and like almost immediately went to generating a bunch of ideas around audiobooks

2946
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:54,610
uh

2947
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,949
it's just 100 robots versus a hundred humans

2948
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,250
yeah

2949
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,230
how far can a robot throw a potato

2950
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,190
i think your idea

2951
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:00,370
like

2952
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,590
i think the first idea was because you just said so many ideas

2953
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,790
i never even thought of

2954
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,170
but it's

2955
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:05,290
it's

2956
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,610
it shows the value of

2957
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,030
uh

2958
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,550
basically brainstorming with people that think differently

2959
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,750
but at the end of the day

2960
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,590
my ideas are probably

2961
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,370
you know

2962
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,610
might lean towards some people a little bit younger than your audience

2963
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:16,330
like some of the stuff

2964
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:16,449
yeah

2965
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,650
but there's still the ideas

2966
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:17,770
like

2967
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:18,190
i think

2968
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,570
the first one you said because we're talking about

2969
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:19,690
uh

2970
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,230
quadruped

2971
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:21,790
like a robot dogs

2972
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:27,610
you said to replace a biological dog with a robot dog and see if the owner notices something

2973
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:31,270
you're just quickly brainstorming different ideas of like how this was years ago

2974
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:31,750
i remember that

2975
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,170
yeah

2976
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,210
which is just i mean it's like

2977
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:34,510
oh yeah

2978
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,550
i never really thought about that kind of

2979
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,449
so it's the basic

2980
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:43,150
the tension between what does it take for a robot and our ai system to replace the biological systems

2981
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:43,750
that we

2982
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,989
the biological creatures that we that we love in our lives

2983
01:13:46,999 --> 01:13:47,170
yeah

2984
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:47,469
and

2985
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,929
but like that was like the um

2986
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:56,050
the pace of idea generation was the thing that struck me today

2987
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:57,070
and in general

2988
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,830
it's like that's how you get at good videos

2989
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,330
is you keep keep things

2990
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:06,010
it's much easier to make a video around a good idea obviously than a bad one

2991
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,690
you're just setting yourself up for success

2992
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,050
okay

2993
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,130
so that's for

2994
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:09,370
uh

2995
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:10,449
10x thing already popular

2996
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:11,530
um

2997
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:11,650
channel

2998
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,390
what's the hardest number

2999
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:13,870
you said

3000
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:14,050
uh

3001
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:16,030
the numbers that matters

3002
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:16,750
click-through rate

3003
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,250
average view duration and and

3004
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:18,550
uh

3005
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:18,969
surveys

3006
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:21,190
what's the hardest number to

3007
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:21,550
uh

3008
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,290
optimize for probably surveys

3009
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:24,310
you know

3010
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:24,969
do you have any

3011
01:14:24,979 --> 01:14:26,830
do you have an insight into the surveys at all

3012
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:26,890
no

3013
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,310
not really

3014
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,530
but if you just click on a bunch of random videos online

3015
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,730
you'll eventually get a survey

3016
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:31,750
what's this video

3017
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:31,870
transformative

3018
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:32,469
heartwarming

3019
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,590
inspiring what people rate does make a difference

3020
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:36,489
um

3021
01:14:36,499 --> 01:14:38,830
and it's like you can get people to click a video

3022
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,610
you can get them to watch it

3023
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,530
but you can't really fake whether or not they're satisfied

3024
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,030
like they don't lie

3025
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:43,510
the service

3026
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,170
you know

3027
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:44,890
um

3028
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:45,610
you know

3029
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,210
maybe one person here

3030
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:46,870
they're my troll

3031
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,130
but once you're aggregate enough

3032
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:50,409
it's a pretty clear telltale of the video

3033
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,090
so either you're making a great video

3034
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:52,570
or you're not

3035
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,370
what is it

3036
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:54,550
uh

3037
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:58,050
minimizing the non regrettability

3038
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,050
yeah

3039
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,730
i think elon tweeted

3040
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,350
that's what he's trying to do on twitter

3041
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:02,710
twitter

3042
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:03,489
and that's interesting

3043
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:03,850
that's

3044
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,170
that's basically the survey metric

3045
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,909
how happy you are that you've been using the platform

3046
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:07,210
yeah

3047
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:07,630
you know

3048
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:07,690
untreated

3049
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,590
we want to limit the amount of regrettable minutes people spend on twitter

3050
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:11,770
and

3051
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:12,550
uh

3052
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,210
the first thing i thought

3053
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,710
it's like that's something youtube already has

3054
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,130
a lot

3055
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,810
like their whole survey system

3056
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:17,710
when feedback loop

3057
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,449
how tough is it to take on youtube

3058
01:15:19,459 --> 01:15:21,790
you think like um

3059
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,030
for twitter

3060
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,650
yeah for twitter for anybody else

3061
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:24,909
um

3062
01:15:24,919 --> 01:15:27,130
i mean it's gonna be basically impossible

3063
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:28,989
i mean youtube's not going anywhere

3064
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,390
and i mean i don't know

3065
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:31,510
i

3066
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:31,630
don't

3067
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,150
i don't think anyone's gonna do what youtube does better than them

3068
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:34,390
uh

3069
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:39,250
at least not in the next 10 years you asked on twitter

3070
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:43,750
would you rather have 10 million dollars or 10 million subscribers on youtube

3071
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:44,310
uh

3072
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:48,250
what would your own answer be at various stages in your career

3073
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:48,370
if

3074
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:48,670
uh

3075
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:48,969
if

3076
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,530
if i had nothing

3077
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,850
i would say 10 million dollars

3078
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:52,150
so

3079
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,270
because with 10 million dollars you can hire some people

3080
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,390
and pump out content with like a million or two

3081
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,350
get 10 million subscribers

3082
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,730
and then keep the other 8 million

3083
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,570
so that's if you believe in your ability to grow a channel

3084
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:05,050
if you

3085
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:05,230
uh

3086
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:05,530
well

3087
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,070
if you

3088
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:06,190
yeah

3089
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,710
if you don't believe in your ability to grow channel

3090
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,870
then you shouldn't take the 10 million subscribers

3091
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,489
because you're just gonna kill the channel

3092
01:16:12,499 --> 01:16:15,670
so the 10 million is definitely a better question would be

3093
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,070
would you rather have a million dollars or 10 million subscribers

3094
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,210
that's where it gets a little tricky

3095
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,469
because now it's like

3096
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:20,650
hmm

3097
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:22,390
you know a million dollars

3098
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,409
life-changing amount of money

3099
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:23,730
uh

3100
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,330
but you know

3101
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:25,750
if you sim

3102
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,469
i know what you're doing

3103
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:28,929
you probably make a million dollars off a 10 million subscriber channel

3104
01:16:28,939 --> 01:16:30,550
but it is a little bit

3105
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,610
a million dollars might not be enough to to build a strong team

3106
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:35,170
because you don't know how to do it

3107
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,370
so you might waste all that money

3108
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:36,550
yeah

3109
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,810
or they just keep it and retire

3110
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:38,110
yeah

3111
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:38,590
okay

3112
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:39,190
that's true

3113
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:39,429
yeah

3114
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,750
because 10 million's just so high

3115
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,130
it's like just never work again

3116
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,390
who cares for the average human

3117
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,350
that's so much money

3118
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,610
it's interesting to me

3119
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,070
also do the value of the subscriber versus the value of the dollar

3120
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,050
um

3121
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,510
i suppose how valuable is a subscriber for

3122
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,130
uh

3123
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:54,610
like

3124
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,630
what percentage of the videos

3125
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:55,810
like

3126
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:56,290
how

3127
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:56,409
active

3128
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,969
are the subscribers and watching the video

3129
01:16:58,679 --> 01:16:58,929
um

3130
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,070
for you

3131
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:00,730
that's hard

3132
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:01,390
i don't know

3133
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,670
i was actually thinking more about the subscriber to dollar

3134
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:03,909
like

3135
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,350
if someone has 10 million subscribers

3136
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,670
have they made 10 million dollars

3137
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,370
i don't know why that that kind of popped in my head

3138
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,690
it's an interesting thought

3139
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:13,030
uh

3140
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:13,870
do you ever

3141
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,770
when you analyze

3142
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:15,310
uh

3143
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:15,969
videos

3144
01:17:15,979 --> 01:17:21,969
do you ever analyze videos like we've talked about offline of other videos across the youtube in general

3145
01:17:21,979 --> 01:17:22,630
just to understand

3146
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,070
trying to understand social behavior

3147
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:24,969
all your

3148
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:25,570
not all

3149
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,610
but a lot of questions are analytics based

3150
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:28,030
yeah

3151
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:28,330
yeah

3152
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:28,810
it's so

3153
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,530
because i love it

3154
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:29,650
uh

3155
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:30,310
i mean

3156
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,390
it's just a giant social experiment

3157
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,610
right like what people like to watch what people share

3158
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:34,090
yeah

3159
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,050
it's like a fascinating

3160
01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:36,370
so i hate that

3161
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:36,489
so

3162
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,510
like i said before

3163
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,230
what percentage of your audience do you think care about this kind of stuff like this

3164
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,370
deeply about youtube analytics

3165
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:46,150
i think a large amount care about

3166
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:47,650
uh

3167
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,070
curiosity and exploration of interesting ideas

3168
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,810
so in that sense

3169
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:52,989
yeah

3170
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,070
this would

3171
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:54,670
this was fitted

3172
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,929
i love it

3173
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:56,949
this is funny

3174
01:17:56,959 --> 01:17:58,750
this isn't me like trying to like

3175
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,050
i

3176
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:02,409
i love you and i actually i love future magnus one and i

3177
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:02,830
um

3178
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,390
and even your hikaru one was really good

3179
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,230
a bunch of other ones

3180
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:07,210
but i think we're getting to the point now

3181
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:11,050
where only analytics junkies would want to keep hearing more analytics talk

3182
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:15,010
and the normie is probably like they've had their dose of youtube talk for the next three years

3183
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,750
maybe i'm wrong

3184
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,170
hey comment

3185
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:17,830
if i'm wrong

3186
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,310
i could be

3187
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,150
i don't know your audience

3188
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:19,449
see

3189
01:18:19,459 --> 01:18:21,610
this is where you would tell me

3190
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,270
shut up

3191
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,409
i know my audience

3192
01:18:23,419 --> 01:18:24,010
you dumbass

3193
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,210
and i don't at all

3194
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:26,170
i actually

3195
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,969
i just follow the threat of curiosity

3196
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,670
and i think there's just a lot of curious humans in the world and and to me it's like

3197
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:39,670
so the question about analytics is the question of basically stepping away

3198
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,610
stepping outside of yourself and thinking

3199
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,409
why the hell do i like tick tock so much

3200
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:45,790
why do i like twitter so much

3201
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,370
why do i like youtube so much and getting

3202
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:50,110
even if you're not a creator

3203
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,850
getting an insight into that is really interesting

3204
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:53,590
it's like what

3205
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:54,850
uh

3206
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:55,510
because

3207
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,290
because all these platforms are fundamentally changing the nature of content

3208
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,150
people are reading books less

3209
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,370
they're probably going to be watching movies less and less

3210
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:05,050
they're probably going to be watching netflix

3211
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:05,830
less and less

3212
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:11,350
do you ever think about the the sort of the darker side of youtube and um

3213
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,810
with shadow banning and censorship and all that kind of topics

3214
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,150
especially if you see it in other platforms like twitter

3215
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:16,449
that

3216
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:17,110
yeah

3217
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:17,290
that

3218
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,010
uh

3219
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,150
elon

3220
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,949
recently highlighted the shadow banning that was happening and in general

3221
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,750
the censorship that was happening on those platforms

3222
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:29,890
do you think about the role of centralized control

3223
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,330
which information isn't or isn't made available through search and discovery

3224
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,650
i'll be honest

3225
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,750
i never really think about it

3226
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,170
so

3227
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:38,830
uh

3228
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,170
you just you just try to make fun videos

3229
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:41,409
that

3230
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:41,770
yeah

3231
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:42,070
more

3232
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,330
i'm kind of more in my own lane

3233
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,230
but it's not like that

3234
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,790
i don't just specifically think about

3235
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,530
i just like a lot of stuff in general

3236
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:49,150
like i'm just kind of in my own lane

3237
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,409
thinking about my own stuff

3238
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:50,650
uh

3239
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,270
but you know

3240
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:52,870
now you asked

3241
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,230
i'm curious

3242
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,750
what are your thoughts on on youtube and that kind of stuff

3243
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:55,810
well

3244
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,250
i'm generally against centralized

3245
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,390
um censorship or shadow banning

3246
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,650
shadow banning is the worst one

3247
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:08,830
because not that the goal of creating a healthy platform where you're having great conversations

3248
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:09,370
and

3249
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:09,870
uh

3250
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:12,250
videos that are not spreading misinformation

3251
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,290
that sounds like an admirable goal

3252
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,110
but that's too difficult of a job for a centralized entity

3253
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:18,370
that's too big of a yeah

3254
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:20,290
and then there's the mis information stuff

3255
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:21,190
and then there's also

3256
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:24,310
just like the videos where they do something that causes

3257
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:24,670
uh

3258
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,590
what what happened back in the the

3259
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:26,770
where

3260
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:27,510
uh

3261
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:28,510
adpocalypse

3262
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:29,409
you know

3263
01:20:29,419 --> 01:20:30,070
and a lot of creators

3264
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:34,449
revenue plummets because people are are doing videos that advertisers don't deem acceptable

3265
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,890
and then now all these big advertisers are pulling and the little guys are getting hit

3266
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,130
and

3267
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,030
because adverage drop

3268
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,590
by 30 and the person who just quit his job to go full-time consecration now can't sustain it

3269
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,250
so it's also

3270
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,770
it's like a lot of different variables as well

3271
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:49,090
that makes it so complicated

3272
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:49,630
well

3273
01:20:49,739 --> 01:20:50,830
i think the big thing is transparency

3274
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,670
especially around shadow banning for for people i agree on shadow banning

3275
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,210
uh

3276
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,230
you should be transparent

3277
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,790
you should let people know it

3278
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:58,750
it

3279
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,290
you know

3280
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,090
obviously there has to be some type of controls

3281
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:02,230
people can't just post whatever

3282
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,330
and so if you're pulling those levers

3283
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,890
they should at least know

3284
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,130
yeah

3285
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,030
so they know how

3286
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:07,210
uh

3287
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:09,250
how to improve their content

3288
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,150
they can understand it

3289
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:10,630
they can

3290
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:10,810
exactly

3291
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:11,230
uh

3292
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,150
if it's a wrong shadow

3293
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:13,449
banning

3294
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:13,929
like

3295
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:17,110
it's a society that we should not shadow ban this kind of content

3296
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:18,010
that means exactly

3297
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:19,750
you should be publicly discussing it

3298
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,590
because if not

3299
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,550
and if it's not known

3300
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,050
then it's just kind of like

3301
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:23,170
well

3302
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:25,150
then who's pulling the strings and like how

3303
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,290
do we know they're not just manipulating things to get whatever message they want out there

3304
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,130
and silence other ones

3305
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:30,429
yeah

3306
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,710
and there could be sort of in the background government influence

3307
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:33,550
which is

3308
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,050
where actual freedom of speech comes into play that the government should not have any control

3309
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:42,310
or be able to put pressure on censorship of speech

3310
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,770
and it gets weird if none of that is being

3311
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,210
there's no transparency around it

3312
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:46,449
yeah

3313
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:47,230
let's see

3314
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,429
but to be fair

3315
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:50,110
that's a huge responsibility

3316
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:54,610
the amount of content that youtube is uploaded on youtube

3317
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,650
that is shared by youtube

3318
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:57,310
viewed by you

3319
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,449
but even more of a reason why it

3320
01:21:58,459 --> 01:22:00,610
it would probably makes sense to be transparent

3321
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,190
yeah because then people can help fact check it

3322
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:04,330
that's right

3323
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:07,210
but that that requires building a platform that makes that easy right

3324
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,210
like uh to

3325
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,909
to make fact checking easy to make the like

3326
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:17,170
twitter now has like being able to share context and all that kind of stuff that crowdsource

3327
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:17,949
it

3328
01:22:17,959 --> 01:22:18,010
crowdsources

3329
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,929
the way wikipedia crowdsource it

3330
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:20,409
i mean there's

3331
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:21,790
it's right

3332
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,949
and then you open a random wikipedia article

3333
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,469
but like you know

3334
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:31,270
people criticize wikipedia because there is a political lean to the editors of wikipedia

3335
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,290
and then they get

3336
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:36,010
there's some articles that definitely have a bias to them

3337
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:36,790
and all that kind of stuff

3338
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,870
it's a difficult problem

3339
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,429
it's a difficult problem to solve that

3340
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:39,730
ultimately

3341
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,590
as much as possible

3342
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:47,350
it would be nice for the viewer to have control of that versus the the entity that's hosting it

3343
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,550
so for the viewer to decide

3344
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:48,790
yeah

3345
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,429
i'm just going to make fun cool videos

3346
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:51,610
yeah

3347
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:51,969
yeah

3348
01:22:51,979 --> 01:22:52,929
you know

3349
01:22:52,939 --> 01:22:53,890
let's go to antarctica again

3350
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:55,270
how was that

3351
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,710
how was going to you just came back from antarctica

3352
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:57,429
that was

3353
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:58,390
i watched the video

3354
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,469
that was

3355
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:00,489
that was fun

3356
01:23:00,499 --> 01:23:01,630
that was a really fun video

3357
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:02,230
thank you

3358
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:03,190
um

3359
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:03,790
there's

3360
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,010
i mean there's a lot of things i can comment about that

3361
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:06,610
but what was that

3362
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:11,830
what was the hardest part of making that video the hardest part was just getting out there

3363
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:12,850
it's just so remote

3364
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:17,469
and you know you land the plane on just this ice runway

3365
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:20,830
and it's so sketchy and then once the plane takes off

3366
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,890
you're just there and you're the most remote place in the planet

3367
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,270
and it's

3368
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:26,530
it's just

3369
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:27,429
it's very breathtaking

3370
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:28,449
i don't

3371
01:23:28,459 --> 01:23:30,670
if you have the chance to ever go to antarctica

3372
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,989
i would recommend it

3373
01:23:31,999 --> 01:23:34,270
it was probably like the in the video

3374
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:34,989
we climbed a mountain

3375
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:35,710
um

3376
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,190
that wasn't named

3377
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,030
so we can name it

3378
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,510
and like standing on top of that mountain and just seeing kindling nothing

3379
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,290
and because

3380
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:44,350
once you get outside the outskirts and you get deep in antarctica

3381
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:45,310
there's no penguins

3382
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,750
nothing lives there at all

3383
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:47,590
um

3384
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,390
and so there's just nothing in every direction

3385
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:54,010
it's just snow and these crazy beautiful mountains and some of them sticking to the clouds

3386
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,929
and it was in the um

3387
01:23:55,939 --> 01:23:57,070
if you go during summer time

3388
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,150
the sun never goes down

3389
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,050
so the sun's up

3390
01:23:59,060 --> 01:23:59,170
24

3391
01:23:59,180 --> 01:23:59,350
7

3392
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,650
and it's just like spinning in circles at the top of the planet or whatever

3393
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:03,550
it looks like the top

3394
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:04,390
um

3395
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:04,510
yeah

3396
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,710
you guys come with it several times

3397
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,070
how beautiful

3398
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:06,250
yes

3399
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,210
and so it's just

3400
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:07,449
yeah

3401
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,770
it's just very beautiful

3402
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,770
what about shooting itself like the technical aspects of shooting it

3403
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:12,070
oh

3404
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:12,909
i mean

3405
01:24:12,919 --> 01:24:13,030
well

3406
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,130
so somehow we lucked out

3407
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:15,550
one of the days

3408
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,710
it was like the warmest day in like forever

3409
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,969
that's been in antarctica

3410
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:20,350
it's like it was positive

3411
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:20,770
uh

3412
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:21,190
degrees

3413
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,270
but at certain parts

3414
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,230
there's also like negative 20

3415
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:23,770
negative 30

3416
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:25,570
and that's where the cameras

3417
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,370
you constantly have to be switching out the batteries

3418
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:30,550
and heating them up and like putting them basically in like your pants

3419
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,170
or they'll just get way too cold

3420
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:32,350
and

3421
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:33,190
uh

3422
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,870
we were prepared for much worse

3423
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:38,230
but it ended up being much better than we thought so for that video

3424
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:38,710
but in general

3425
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,969
maybe some other challenging videos

3426
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:44,170
how does how do you go from the idea stage to the actual execution to the final video

3427
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,429
what's can you take me through

3428
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:46,330
like a full process of

3429
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:46,810
like

3430
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,510
we're talking about some crazy wild ideas today

3431
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:52,870
how do you go from that to a final video where you click publish

3432
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:53,290
well

3433
01:24:53,699 --> 01:24:54,489
i mean obviously

3434
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:55,270
first things

3435
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:55,449
first

3436
01:24:55,459 --> 01:24:57,550
you gotta figure out the idea and then it just depends

3437
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,949
i mean pick any video you can think of on my channel

3438
01:24:59,959 --> 01:25:00,850
i can take you through it

3439
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:01,929
uh

3440
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:03,550
uh

3441
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:03,909
well

3442
01:25:03,919 --> 01:25:04,570
what about the

3443
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,989
in a circle you have to stay in a circle for uh

3444
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:08,710
400 days

3445
01:25:09,179 --> 01:25:09,429
yeah

3446
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,989
so for that one step

3447
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:11,350
one

3448
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,310
one of the most popular

3449
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:12,489
yeah

3450
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,050
that video did really well

3451
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:14,230
yeah

3452
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:14,770
so we

3453
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,210
um

3454
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:16,929
problem is

3455
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:17,230
uh

3456
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:17,949
we have to

3457
01:25:17,959 --> 01:25:20,890
this is where you get really into the nuances of the company

3458
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,110
because we have a lot of videos going out

3459
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,850
you can't just in a vacuum be like

3460
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:25,090
all right

3461
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,110
we're not doing anything for 100 days

3462
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:26,949
we're only filming this

3463
01:25:26,959 --> 01:25:30,909
so step one is we had to build an independent crew that could actually do that for 100 days

3464
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,270
that way everyone else could keep working on the normal videos and not just screw everything up

3465
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:34,570
yeah

3466
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:35,530
um

3467
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:35,590
so

3468
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:36,489
step one

3469
01:25:36,499 --> 01:25:37,510
you build that team

3470
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:37,690
okay

3471
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,710
we got the team

3472
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:38,890
now

3473
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,730
what do we need

3474
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:41,530
well to do this

3475
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,210
we need probably like 10 cameras

3476
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,530
at least rolling at all times

3477
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:44,710
so

3478
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:45,429
uh

3479
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:49,150
we're probably gonna need to get a trailer and hook up a bunch of storage and stuff

3480
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:54,310
so to just carry the sheer volume of footage we're gonna have and so get a trailer set up

3481
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,989
the cameras go on the field

3482
01:25:55,999 --> 01:25:56,530
paint a circle

3483
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:57,429
now we need a house

3484
01:25:57,439 --> 01:25:58,690
go buy a house

3485
01:25:58,700 --> 01:25:59,409
bring it out there

3486
01:25:59,419 --> 01:25:59,650
uh

3487
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:00,670
and then it's like

3488
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:00,969
oh wait

3489
01:26:00,979 --> 01:26:03,370
i think it'd be funny if i brought the house in on the intro for

3490
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:03,489
yeah

3491
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:04,389
you know

3492
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:06,790
find a crane that can lift up a house so i can drive it in

3493
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,570
and drop it in the intro

3494
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,850
and that's like an iterative process where you're like

3495
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:09,969
okay

3496
01:26:09,979 --> 01:26:10,630
this would be funnier

3497
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,889
so this is not all up front

3498
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:12,070
yeah

3499
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,030
it's like your

3500
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:13,270
ideally

3501
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,110
it would be

3502
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,370
but as you kind of see things

3503
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,530
you get inspired and then you think of more and more

3504
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:17,710
uh

3505
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:19,510
and then this would be better with a crane

3506
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:19,750
yeah

3507
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,790
it'd be better if i dropped out of the house

3508
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:21,909
yeah

3509
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:25,030
that was crazy that you decided to do that

3510
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:25,150
uh

3511
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,610
so fearless in the kind of crazy stuff

3512
01:26:27,659 --> 01:26:28,449
you're willing to do

3513
01:26:28,459 --> 01:26:30,250
exactly what i'm a broken record

3514
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,750
but whatever makes the best video possible

3515
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:32,110
yeah

3516
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:32,409
that's

3517
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:33,370
that's all you

3518
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:34,150
you focus on

3519
01:26:34,219 --> 01:26:34,469
okay

3520
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:35,469
so

3521
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:36,190
uh

3522
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:38,469
what about the delegation of like

3523
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:38,650
who

3524
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,330
gets to what are the cameraman

3525
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:41,949
like the people operating the cameras

3526
01:26:41,959 --> 01:26:42,190
what

3527
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:42,550
uh

3528
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,290
who's responsible for different things

3529
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,210
this is like a distributed process like

3530
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:46,570
well

3531
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,170
that's where whoever the lead cam would be on that video would just decided that one

3532
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,070
because we shot over 100 days

3533
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:55,330
we didn't a lot of it was just sean and the guy who was in the circle just vlogging

3534
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,650
i'm just gave him a camera

3535
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:56,770
yeah

3536
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:57,909
and he figured it out

3537
01:26:57,919 --> 01:26:59,290
and then we'd have like for him

3538
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,750
just set hours each day that i can't remember would come

3539
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,590
so if he had any content

3540
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,650
he needed extra hands instead of just having someone on standby 24

3541
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,929
7. it made more sense to do set hours nice

3542
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:09,190
um

3543
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,090
and uh

3544
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:10,510
yeah

3545
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:11,050
it was

3546
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,190
it was hard

3547
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,989
but you know it's funny and hindsight

3548
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:14,949
it sounds so simple

3549
01:27:14,959 --> 01:27:15,670
you know

3550
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:16,929
and i i guess

3551
01:27:16,939 --> 01:27:17,650
like the more

3552
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,870
because that one is relatively simple

3553
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:20,290
i guess

3554
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,909
because it's a low number of people

3555
01:27:21,919 --> 01:27:22,030
yeah

3556
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,770
the hard part about that is just the time right

3557
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,730
like you know

3558
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,110
i checked in on them so many different days

3559
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,909
and it's like an hour here

3560
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:29,170
two hours or two hours there

3561
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:32,170
over a hundred days adds up to be a ton of time

3562
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:32,350
and

3563
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,670
and even then

3564
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,389
like you know

3565
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:36,010
if you have a 10 person crew

3566
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,409
you know paying them daily rates for 100 days

3567
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:39,730
it just all that adds up

3568
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:40,510
what about

3569
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,469
like the 100 versus 100

3570
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:41,830
100

3571
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:42,429
uh

3572
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,190
adults versus the other kids

3573
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:46,830
was

3574
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:47,830
uh

3575
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:48,909
bringing that to life

3576
01:27:48,919 --> 01:27:50,110
that seems like exceptionally challenging

3577
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:50,590
yeah

3578
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,590
basically the thought process was we did 100 kids or sorry

3579
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:53,889
100 boys

3580
01:27:53,899 --> 01:27:54,550
100 girls

3581
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:54,790
yeah

3582
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,690
people loved it

3583
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:55,750
honestly

3584
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,550
i didn't think they'd like it as much as they did

3585
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,929
video did really really well

3586
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,850
so the second i saw that video was crushing

3587
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:01,630
i was like all right

3588
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,350
we're doing it again

3589
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,790
but last time we did it

3590
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:04,389
we did in our studio

3591
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:05,290
so we built a

3592
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,010
a giant room

3593
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,210
put 100 girls in

3594
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:07,989
it sounds bad

3595
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,070
when i explain it like this

3596
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,330
and then a gyrant put 100 boys

3597
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:10,630
yeah

3598
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:11,710
and we're like after 100 hours

3599
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,170
which everyone has the most people give them half a million dollars

3600
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,310
so did well

3601
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:15,969
so we're like

3602
01:28:15,979 --> 01:28:16,150
all right

3603
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:16,750
we're gonna do it again

3604
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,730
so we threw out all these different ideas

3605
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:21,190
it was like 100 football players versus 100 cheerleaders

3606
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,389
100 this 100 that

3607
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:22,870
and

3608
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:23,409
uh

3609
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:24,850
100 prisoners versus 100 cops

3610
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:26,050
just craziest ideas

3611
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,510
and we settled on 100 kids versus 100 adults

3612
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:29,889
um

3613
01:28:29,899 --> 01:28:31,989
and then the next step was like

3614
01:28:31,999 --> 01:28:32,949
how do we make it better

3615
01:28:32,959 --> 01:28:35,350
the kids versus adults are the sorry

3616
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,370
the boys versus girls

3617
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:39,489
the first one we did was inside and the problem was every time it was night

3618
01:28:39,499 --> 01:28:40,570
when we did these long time lapses

3619
01:28:40,679 --> 01:28:42,429
you couldn't see the sun go up and down

3620
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:43,090
so we're like

3621
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:43,210
okay

3622
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:43,630
this time

3623
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,230
i want to do it outside

3624
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,370
that's why the cubes are outside

3625
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:46,690
um

3626
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:47,590
and instead of doing circles

3627
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:48,670
we want to make them cubes

3628
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,469
and then you know

3629
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:51,250
as figuring out

3630
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:51,850
do we want that

3631
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:52,150
yeah

3632
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:55,989
there's just those videos came up at least today as ones that are like

3633
01:28:55,999 --> 01:28:57,370
really complicated in terms of the audio

3634
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:57,969
in terms of how

3635
01:28:57,979 --> 01:28:58,150
yeah

3636
01:28:58,380 --> 01:28:58,630
film

3637
01:28:58,739 --> 01:28:58,989
it

3638
01:28:58,999 --> 01:28:59,170
yeah

3639
01:28:59,180 --> 01:28:59,710
that's the problem

3640
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,270
we had a lot of audio issues because

3641
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:01,449
uh

3642
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,670
in the first one we didn't have a roof on it

3643
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,330
the second one

3644
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:05,290
there was a roof

3645
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,070
so there's a lot of reverb

3646
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,030
which then

3647
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,350
in editing made it brutal

3648
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,150
like half the shots weren't usable

3649
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,770
and it really screwed us over

3650
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:15,550
so we had to do a lot of frankensteining in the editing to make up for basically my ignorance

3651
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:17,650
so you mentioned that you were surprised

3652
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:19,330
how well that that one did

3653
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:24,250
a lot of creators talk about getting depressed when

3654
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:25,330
um

3655
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:28,210
the videos don't do as well as they kind of expect it

3656
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:31,510
there's the kind of feeling you can get really worn out by that dude

3657
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:31,870
yeah

3658
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:32,830
um

3659
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,550
you do your yourself feel that and also do you have advice

3660
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,110
for others that feel this

3661
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:39,190
um

3662
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:39,250
yeah

3663
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,290
it's weird because i am a numbers guy

3664
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,070
but also it

3665
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:43,449
it used to

3666
01:29:43,459 --> 01:29:45,429
it used to

3667
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:45,790
very much

3668
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,550
especially when i was like betting everything i had on a video

3669
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,270
when it did bad

3670
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,290
i was devastating

3671
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:55,389
i'd cry and i'd be depressed for days and it really would have a severe impact on my mood

3672
01:29:55,399 --> 01:29:56,590
but i don't know

3673
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:56,650
now

3674
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:57,250
it doesn't really matter

3675
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,090
it's uh

3676
01:29:58,139 --> 01:29:59,350
if a video that's bad

3677
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,850
i just look at it and i'm like

3678
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:00,969
oh

3679
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:01,989
why'd this video do bad

3680
01:30:01,999 --> 01:30:02,190
uh

3681
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:03,190
probably

3682
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:03,429
oh

3683
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:04,690
there's a little retention dip there

3684
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:06,550
i don't think people like the thumbnail

3685
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,510
maybe we should switch it

3686
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,469
i just look at it

3687
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:09,130
objectively unemotional

3688
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,969
and then just move on and i feel like that's a much healthier way of going about it

3689
01:30:12,979 --> 01:30:18,130
so if a creator is listening like that is the ideal way to um

3690
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:19,690
respond to a video that's doing bad

3691
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:21,730
just remove emotion from the equation

3692
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:24,370
and just look at it and figure out how you can search the next one

3693
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:25,510
is there tricks to detect

3694
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:28,510
being able to detach yourself from the from that

3695
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:28,750
because

3696
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:29,650
because i

3697
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:30,610
in your case

3698
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:31,810
i mean that's true for creators

3699
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,590
but in your case

3700
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:35,350
there's like a lot of money on the

3701
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:35,469
line

3702
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:35,590
yeah

3703
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:35,830
well

3704
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:36,610
there's videos

3705
01:30:36,739 --> 01:30:36,989
yeah

3706
01:30:37,739 --> 01:30:38,350
so much time

3707
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:38,889
but no

3708
01:30:39,179 --> 01:30:39,790
i mean you

3709
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,090
just

3710
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:40,989
i mean

3711
01:30:40,999 --> 01:30:41,409
i don't know

3712
01:30:41,419 --> 01:30:42,250
the only real answer is

3713
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:43,210
it's just the conscious effort

3714
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,550
you just have to unemotionally look at the video

3715
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:48,909
determine the problems and then move on like there's there is no secret

3716
01:30:48,919 --> 01:30:49,750
you know what i mean

3717
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,290
it's just that's

3718
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,010
it's that

3719
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,810
and if you really can't bring yourself to do it

3720
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:53,290
then you're just screwed

3721
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:53,650
honestly

3722
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,389
maybe you're not meant for this game

3723
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:56,770
okay

3724
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:00,489
so that's part of the development as the creator is like being able to be a different longevity

3725
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,210
yes

3726
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:01,449
yeah

3727
01:31:01,459 --> 01:31:05,469
you have to unemotionally be able to look at videos that flop and figure it out

3728
01:31:05,479 --> 01:31:05,590
uh

3729
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:06,070
because

3730
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,929
if not just getting you can

3731
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:09,429
not every video can be a one out of ten

3732
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:10,630
and so when a video does bad

3733
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:13,270
you know that that just stress and depression

3734
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:15,429
it's just gonna eventually get to you in the long run

3735
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:17,050
so you said you've uh

3736
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:18,070
failed in a bunch of videos

3737
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,090
uh

3738
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,670
sort of taking them to completion

3739
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,650
so what are some of the biggest fails

3740
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:24,190
yeah

3741
01:31:24,659 --> 01:31:24,909
weirdly

3742
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:25,570
enough

3743
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,130
as we've matured and we've done this more

3744
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:28,570
we don't have that problem as much

3745
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:31,030
especially that we're getting into the multi-million dollar budgets per video

3746
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,850
it's like failure is not really an option anymore

3747
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:36,489
so i'm a little more particular about what i do

3748
01:31:36,499 --> 01:31:37,570
but back in the day

3749
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:37,750
yeah

3750
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:41,350
like we would do a video where we spent 24 hours on a desert island

3751
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:41,550
and

3752
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:42,550
uh

3753
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:42,969
we filmed

3754
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:43,929
it did it all

3755
01:31:43,939 --> 01:31:46,449
and i just i didn't like it after the edit

3756
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,889
so i just grabbed the voice

3757
01:31:47,899 --> 01:31:51,670
and we went back to the deserted island and spent another 24 hours there and refilmed it

3758
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:52,510
um

3759
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:52,630
or

3760
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:53,530
uh

3761
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:56,770
could that have been caught and prevented at the idea stage

3762
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,429
like where

3763
01:31:57,439 --> 01:31:57,670
like

3764
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:58,030
no

3765
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:58,630
it's a good idea

3766
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:00,250
it was just poor execution to be honest

3767
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:00,850
when we were out there

3768
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:01,150
it was hot

3769
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:01,750
we were

3770
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,010
we're just like we all

3771
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:04,570
at one point just kind of wanted to die

3772
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:05,230
it was just miserable

3773
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:06,250
so how do we

3774
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,449
how do you avoid that these days

3775
01:32:07,459 --> 01:32:07,570
uh

3776
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:08,290
well

3777
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,330
i just thought it was a little cooler to be honest

3778
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:13,750
and then we had literally the amount of fun we had in the video was like 10 times higher

3779
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:14,650
oh interesting

3780
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:15,790
so you like

3781
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,650
there's some practical details that you just learned

3782
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:17,830
yeah

3783
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,610
i don't know what it takes

3784
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:22,270
videos that where it's very hot or or it's on water

3785
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,230
because i get super seasick

3786
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,989
it's like a kind of like 10 things that

3787
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:27,429
if they have these variables

3788
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,170
i'm down to do it

3789
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:32,830
but my fun meter is not as high as normal

3790
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:32,830
uh

3791
01:32:33,139 --> 01:32:35,170
like we tried to sp

3792
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:35,290
um

3793
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,750
anytime we do anything on a boat

3794
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,290
like when we spent 24 hours of beer in a triangle or when i tried to spend

3795
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:41,650
like

3796
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:42,730
which i didn't get up

3797
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:44,530
but i try to spend like 100 hours at sea or whatever

3798
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:45,429
just like on a raft

3799
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:46,750
it's just like i

3800
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,730
it makes me want to throw up and i get so seasick

3801
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,750
i can't even see straight

3802
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,350
but there are just some videos that require me to be on a boat

3803
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,190
so i just suck it up

3804
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:55,150
um

3805
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:55,270
so

3806
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,310
when you spend months in creating a video

3807
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,650
i know this is probably stressful to some creators

3808
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:00,630
uh

3809
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:01,630
like

3810
01:33:01,739 --> 01:33:02,469
how much stress

3811
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,449
how do you feel when you have to click

3812
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:04,690
publish

3813
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,050
uh

3814
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:05,889
video

3815
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:06,150
no

3816
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,469
not much you're able to detach yourself

3817
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:08,590
yeah

3818
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:09,510
again

3819
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:11,650
in old me tons

3820
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:17,230
i mean i'd be like scratching and nervous and like my hands would be sweating like to the point

3821
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,130
where i'm almost about to puke

3822
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:18,550
i'm like

3823
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,870
i really hope people like this

3824
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,250
but you know

3825
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:22,150
i don't know

3826
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,409
i think that's just part of maturing it

3827
01:33:23,419 --> 01:33:23,710
there's different

3828
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,969
and as a content creator

3829
01:33:24,979 --> 01:33:25,570
there's different phases

3830
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:25,989
and

3831
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:26,350
uh

3832
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,850
you just like

3833
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:29,170
once you get over the

3834
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:31,690
the fear that you're just gonna wake up one day and be irrelevant

3835
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:32,590
you know

3836
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,070
and you

3837
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:33,250
just

3838
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:33,670
you know

3839
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:33,909
accept that

3840
01:33:33,919 --> 01:33:38,110
like you believe in yourself and you believe in your content and that you can continue to be relevant

3841
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,429
then you don't

3842
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:40,030
i don't know

3843
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:40,150
you

3844
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:40,630
kind of

3845
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,190
it's a little bit easier to attach yourself

3846
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:42,610
i guess

3847
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:44,050
and that's i

3848
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:45,550
it's a much healthier place to be

3849
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:46,630
you can't do this for 10 years

3850
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:50,230
if every little thing just causes these huge emotional reactions

3851
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:51,010
it's like

3852
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:53,949
that's why a lot of creators go a little

3853
01:33:53,959 --> 01:33:54,370
you know

3854
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:54,429
mentally

3855
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,429
insane you know you have to get out of that that game

3856
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:57,790
right

3857
01:33:58,020 --> 01:33:59,350
because it really messes with you

3858
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,909
we've talked about this a little bit

3859
01:34:00,919 --> 01:34:02,409
but how do you define

3860
01:34:02,419 --> 01:34:04,510
and how do you suggest others define success

3861
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,850
some people success is retiring

3862
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:15,010
their mom is inspiring people and educating them

3863
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:15,790
and you know

3864
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,570
whatever they're peaking

3865
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:16,989
their curiosity

3866
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:18,550
um

3867
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,270
for other people

3868
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,469
it's just quitting their job

3869
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:23,290
so you have to self-reflect on what your definition of success is

3870
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:26,530
because i think a lot of creators kind of don't really think

3871
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,230
don't introspect like they kind of want to keep getting more and more subscribers

3872
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:33,190
kind of thing

3873
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:33,670
and yeah

3874
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,130
but subscribers is just a vanity metric

3875
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,030
you know

3876
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:37,870
it doesn't

3877
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:42,370
subscribers don't correlate to views sure or views what

3878
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:42,550
yeah

3879
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:42,969
i know

3880
01:34:42,979 --> 01:34:43,750
but that's more

3881
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,710
that was a drag to you

3882
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,670
that was more direct to people listening

3883
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,090
because

3884
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:46,270
uh

3885
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,850
a lot of people do really care about subscribers or even followers

3886
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:49,690
like on tick tock

3887
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:52,389
but if you look like your view

3888
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:53,110
if on youtube

3889
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:53,290
very

3890
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:54,070
very

3891
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:54,250
few

3892
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:54,489
percent

3893
01:34:54,499 --> 01:34:57,489
if even a percent of your views come from the sub feed

3894
01:34:57,499 --> 01:34:57,670
right

3895
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:58,630
you know

3896
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:59,650
they're almost all home features

3897
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,010
suggested

3898
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,469
what's the last time you clicked on your sub feed to watch a video

3899
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:03,610
oh almost never

3900
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:03,850
yeah

3901
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:04,150
yeah

3902
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,770
maybe five years ago it used to be a thing

3903
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,130
it's not anymore

3904
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:06,850
no one does

3905
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:07,750
um

3906
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,949
and it's getting harder and harder to find

3907
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:10,810
i subscribe to way too many channels

3908
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:11,350
i think

3909
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:11,469
yeah

3910
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:14,110
that's what everyone does and you subscribe to 10 channels

3911
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:14,710
they're great

3912
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:18,850
but two years later your taste evolves and it's like it's a mess and so um

3913
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,770
subscribers don't really matter

3914
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:22,810
followers on tick tock don't really matter

3915
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:23,770
um

3916
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:24,909
so anyways

3917
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:25,690
it

3918
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:26,590
really

3919
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,570
they really are the definition of a vanity metric

3920
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:31,030
and but what about views they do

3921
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:31,210
obviously

3922
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,190
because if people are showing up time and time again

3923
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:33,850
that's what matters

3924
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:34,150
okay

3925
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,870
so that that's a good thing to

3926
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:38,110
uh

3927
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:38,770
define a success

3928
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:39,730
i just feel like

3929
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:40,449
um

3930
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,489
that too can be a problem

3931
01:35:43,139 --> 01:35:43,389
because

3932
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:43,690
uh

3933
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:46,690
i would say

3934
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,010
you know

3935
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:48,790
if i wanted to be successful

3936
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,590
like it's a young creator

3937
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,870
i might start copying mr beast or something like that

3938
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,050
right

3939
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:53,290
yeah

3940
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:53,530
like

3941
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:53,889
there's

3942
01:35:53,899 --> 01:35:58,210
you start trying to take shortcuts as opposed to find your your own unique voice

3943
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:58,449
right

3944
01:35:59,100 --> 01:35:59,350
so

3945
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,929
like chasing views is a problem too

3946
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,030
it feels like or no

3947
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:05,110
um

3948
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,730
it's as long as you detach yourself from them

3949
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:09,270
i mean if you're lazy

3950
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:10,270
yeah

3951
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:14,530
and you just want to copy someone else and not experiment and find your own way but yeah

3952
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:16,630
i mean you can't make that excuse for them

3953
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:20,290
and someone just isn't coming up with original stuff and putting in the effort

3954
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:20,830
you can't just say

3955
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:20,949
oh

3956
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:22,330
it's because they're chasing views

3957
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:24,070
we need some different metric from the chase

3958
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:24,250
no

3959
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,989
they just need to find their own way

3960
01:36:25,999 --> 01:36:26,110
well

3961
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:32,409
it just feels like unique type of content will often lead to sacrifice in the number of views in the short term

3962
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,090
by the long term

3963
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:34,510
you win

3964
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:36,190
okay

3965
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,630
or if you do win you

3966
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:38,590
you win more

3967
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,210
i guess would be a better way putting it

3968
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,250
do you think you will ipo

3969
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,850
miss mr beast burger or feastables in the next five

3970
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,949
ten years beast burger or feasible snow

3971
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,250
i

3972
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,889
i kind of think they're something actually

3973
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:51,550
you know what

3974
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:54,010
i just realized that this is our first time talking about those

3975
01:36:54,199 --> 01:36:56,050
we're like an hour and a half in

3976
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:56,530
that's so funny

3977
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:57,909
we started talking about what

3978
01:36:58,219 --> 01:36:58,469
uh

3979
01:36:59,219 --> 01:37:00,850
my retention brain kicked in

3980
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:02,949
um

3981
01:37:02,959 --> 01:37:05,170
i wonder if you have retention brain for

3982
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:05,830
like life itself

3983
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,710
i do every time i'm talking to someone i can

3984
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,250
i'm like

3985
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:09,429
okay

3986
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,570
what about

3987
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:11,230
like loved ones

3988
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:16,449
like spending time with loved ones thinking like we could be doing something much better right now

3989
01:37:16,459 --> 01:37:16,570
yes

3990
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,050
no

3991
01:37:17,219 --> 01:37:18,610
that is a serious problem

3992
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:18,850
uh

3993
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:19,630
with

3994
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:20,230
well

3995
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:22,389
so we'll pause the b square

3996
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:22,630
question

3997
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:22,870
yes

3998
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:23,710
but that's why

3999
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:23,949
uh

4000
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:24,969
my current girlfriend

4001
01:37:24,979 --> 01:37:25,210
uh

4002
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:28,030
which i was telling you before when we were talking about this is

4003
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:30,310
she has a genuine love for learning

4004
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,870
and that's something i have

4005
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:31,989
like

4006
01:37:31,999 --> 01:37:35,290
i always feel like i need to be learning something to justify the time i'm spending

4007
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,110
and so that's why it's such a nice trait

4008
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,230
because i feel like that time is being used optimally

4009
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,469
because whether we're watching a documentary or we're going in in

4010
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:45,010
you know

4011
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:46,810
taking an iq tests or reading about

4012
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:47,230
whatever

4013
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,330
just why modern art is the thing

4014
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:49,810
i don't know

4015
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,310
whatever weird thing we decided to do

4016
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,570
i'm always learning and improving

4017
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:54,130
so it justifies the time

4018
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:54,310
so

4019
01:37:54,659 --> 01:37:56,409
to maximize retention in your relationship

4020
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:57,610
yeah

4021
01:37:57,620 --> 01:38:00,130
you want to spend time with that time learning as much as possible

4022
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:00,429
yeah

4023
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:05,409
which conveniently i don't have to force right or i want to be recharging

4024
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:06,429
so i

4025
01:38:06,439 --> 01:38:07,150
when i do work

4026
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:07,630
i can

4027
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:07,989
you know

4028
01:38:07,999 --> 01:38:08,409
hit the ground harder

4029
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:12,610
and luckily we're into a lot of the same things which you know happen to be learning

4030
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:13,449
sometimes it's not learning

4031
01:38:13,459 --> 01:38:15,489
like maybe watching an anime or something like that

4032
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:16,449
um

4033
01:38:16,459 --> 01:38:18,429
but i'm a big believer and you're either

4034
01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:19,330
if you

4035
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:19,449
well

4036
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:20,290
if you

4037
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:22,870
if your goal is to be like a super successful entrepreneur

4038
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:28,030
you need to either be working or you need to be doing something that decompresses and recharges you

4039
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:28,630
so you can work again

4040
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,270
if your goal is to be like a really kick-ass entrepreneur

4041
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,389
obviously we're boiling this down to like a very basic thing

4042
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:36,909
and so the the things you're doing

4043
01:38:36,919 --> 01:38:39,130
your down time when you're not working

4044
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:39,790
if it doesn't recharge

4045
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:40,330
you

4046
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:40,690
you're screwed

4047
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,610
you're just a ticking time

4048
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:43,389
but i'm waiting to implode

4049
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:44,650
um

4050
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:47,650
and so you gotta like heavily recharge and like

4051
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,810
so like watching for me

4052
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,429
anime or whatever it is

4053
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:52,270
playing a board game

4054
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:55,389
like that is actually kind of crucial to my success

4055
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,810
which takes a lot of maturing to come to that conclusion

4056
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:02,530
because i used to be the kind of guy that wanted to work every hour of the day

4057
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:05,650
and i would try to train myself to not need that stuff

4058
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:06,130
and i

4059
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:06,909
you know

4060
01:39:06,919 --> 01:39:09,010
and i almost resented like that

4061
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:12,610
i i have to do these kinds of things and it would piss me off because it's not optimal

4062
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:13,570
and you know

4063
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:15,190
i just really want to make content and entertain people

4064
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,929
but yeah

4065
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:18,550
as someone who's gone down that road

4066
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,449
and you know

4067
01:39:19,459 --> 01:39:21,010
you just work every day for two

4068
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:21,730
three months straight

4069
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:23,170
and you know every hour of the day

4070
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:26,409
and then you just a bomb waiting to explode and lose your mind

4071
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:29,409
and the only real sustainable thing is to just like

4072
01:39:29,419 --> 01:39:31,630
give yourself time to recharge in between working

4073
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,929
so there's a kind of balance you have to find

4074
01:39:34,939 --> 01:39:35,770
you have to even

4075
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,170
and i hate it more than anyone else

4076
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:38,650
because i

4077
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:39,190
you know

4078
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,389
you hate not working

4079
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:40,630
yes

4080
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:43,989
because it's just not optimal for time like it's

4081
01:39:43,999 --> 01:39:44,230
it's

4082
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:44,530
it's

4083
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,150
as a human

4084
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:50,230
i do need to occasionally watch a mindless show and play a board game

4085
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:50,469
yeah

4086
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,110
and it took me a very long time to like

4087
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,090
come to peace with that and not

4088
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:57,370
i would have like borderline panic

4089
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,389
attacks when i do it

4090
01:39:58,399 --> 01:39:58,690
because i just

4091
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:00,429
what am i doing right now

4092
01:40:00,439 --> 01:40:01,210
why am i doing this

4093
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:01,810
i should be

4094
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:02,409
you know

4095
01:40:02,419 --> 01:40:03,610
like what if

4096
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:06,190
one day i have to lay off an employee because we're not doing so well

4097
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:06,370
like

4098
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,090
how could i justify watching this this show or whatever i'm doing right now

4099
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:10,510
you know

4100
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,010
it's like there's a lot of things like

4101
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:15,489
that that go on in your head but it's necessary before we return to

4102
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:15,790
uh

4103
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:16,870
mr beast burger

4104
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,050
what is like

4105
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:21,310
is this one on the topic

4106
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:23,409
what is a perfect day in the life

4107
01:40:23,419 --> 01:40:25,690
perfectly productive day in the life of mr beast look like

4108
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,190
oh boy

4109
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:27,429
well

4110
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,110
i mean or like a stand

4111
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,510
i mean the perfectly productive day as we filmed my main channel video

4112
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,969
because those get 100 million a pop

4113
01:40:33,979 --> 01:40:35,949
i mean it doesn't really get any better than that

4114
01:40:35,959 --> 01:40:37,090
what about

4115
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:39,429
like the average day when you're not on the set

4116
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:39,610
yeah

4117
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:40,510
and you're like

4118
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,850
because you're running a lot of things

4119
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:42,969
right

4120
01:40:42,979 --> 01:40:43,210
yeah

4121
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:45,250
so right now we have our snack brand feastables

4122
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:48,070
we have a restaurant chain piece burger and then we

4123
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:48,610
basically

4124
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:49,030
which

4125
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,610
we haven't even really launched any products yet

4126
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:54,070
but we have the the data company that i was showing you

4127
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,630
where we're gonna roll out some tools for creators

4128
01:40:55,739 --> 01:40:57,550
and then we have the reacts channel

4129
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:58,389
the gaming channel

4130
01:40:58,399 --> 01:40:58,929
the main channel

4131
01:40:58,939 --> 01:40:59,889
and then we have my charity

4132
01:40:59,899 --> 01:41:00,909
which also has a channel

4133
01:41:01,739 --> 01:41:01,989
um

4134
01:41:01,999 --> 01:41:05,830
and so kind of how i've structured my life right now

4135
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:06,030
uh

4136
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:07,030
is

4137
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:07,630
whatever

4138
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,409
i have free time

4139
01:41:08,419 --> 01:41:09,489
we just kind of go

4140
01:41:09,499 --> 01:41:09,610
hey

4141
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:09,850

4142
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:13,449

4144
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:16,870

4148
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,130
the guy who runs my tick tocks like i need this tick tock filmder

4149
01:41:22,139 --> 01:41:22,389

01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:22,570
you know

4151
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:22,989
beast burger is

4152
01:41:22,999 --> 01:41:23,170
like

4153
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,130
i need this menu item approved

4154
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:25,449
do we need to talk about this marketing thing

4155
01:41:25,459 --> 01:41:28,150
and then we kind of just look at what everyone needs and we're like that

4156
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:30,010
one looks like the most important we'll do that

4157
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:30,429
and then

4158
01:41:30,439 --> 01:41:32,409
so it's just kind of like

4159
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:33,190
you know

4160
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,230
if i just did that for every company in a day

4161
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,130
then that's optimal

4162
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,350
if i just kind of like an optimal day for me

4163
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:41,230
would be going down the eight companies and just whatever they're like

4164
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,630
two to three biggest pain points or things to need from me

4165
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:47,770
and just doing those based on priority and then trying to keep it as short as possible

4166
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:48,130
yeah

4167
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:49,989
to just the things that you're needed on

4168
01:41:49,999 --> 01:41:51,489
it doesn't get more optimal than that

4169
01:41:51,499 --> 01:41:54,190
if i clear the bottlenecks or some bottlenecks for all my companies

4170
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,230
then it's yes

4171
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,429
that's a perfect day

4172
01:41:57,439 --> 01:41:57,670
yeah

4173
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:58,989
i mean even just me

4174
01:41:58,999 --> 01:42:03,369
because you're like you're showing me around and you're being a great and gracious host

4175
01:42:03,379 --> 01:42:04,630
but on top of that

4176
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:05,590
you're just doing all these meetings

4177
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:05,889
you

4178
01:42:05,899 --> 01:42:06,070
you

4179
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,250
basically

4180
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:07,750
i felt bad at some points

4181
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:08,350
i was like

4182
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:08,469
oh

4183
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:10,510
i just tricked him into going to meetings with me

4184
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,710
he's like my little meeting buddy

4185
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:12,070
yeah

4186
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:13,270
i mean it was

4187
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:13,810
it was fun

4188
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:14,830
it's fun to see it

4189
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,550
it was fun to see how effectively you've delegated

4190
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,750
you basically trust the team to do a really good job on the various things

4191
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:27,969
and there's just a strong team that's able to carry the five on all the different tasks

4192
01:42:28,139 --> 01:42:28,389
yeah

4193
01:42:28,619 --> 01:42:29,230
from the

4194
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,030
from the brainstorming and the main channel to the reacts

4195
01:42:31,139 --> 01:42:31,570
and so on

4196
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:31,750
yeah

4197
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:32,710
it's really interesting

4198
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:33,670
i mean it's

4199
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,010
it's really interesting what it takes to build a team like that

4200
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:38,650
because you very quickly build the very large team

4201
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:40,090
that's that's able to scale

4202
01:42:40,139 --> 01:42:41,350
which is very scary

4203
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,489
because it's my first

4204
01:42:42,499 --> 01:42:43,389
you know

4205
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:45,909
i i'm 24. you know

4206
01:42:45,919 --> 01:42:47,530
and i think i was telling you this earlier it's funny

4207
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:49,869
because six years ago i had to raise my hand to go use the bathroom

4208
01:42:49,879 --> 01:42:54,070
and now i'm in charge of hundreds of people and entertain hundreds of millions of people

4209
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,389
and so it is crazy

4210
01:42:55,399 --> 01:42:57,010
just how quick it comes up

4211
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:00,610
and i wish i was a little bit older

4212
01:43:00,659 --> 01:43:02,710
so i could have ran a couple companies

4213
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:06,550
and failed a few companies in the past and like learn from those and apply those here

4214
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,469
because i know for a fact when i'm 34

4215
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:09,790
i'm 24 now when i'm 34.

4216
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:10,270
i'll

4217
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:12,489
i'll know so much more about running a business

4218
01:43:12,499 --> 01:43:14,949
and scaling and hiring and and how to lead people and

4219
01:43:14,959 --> 01:43:15,190
better

4220
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,790
effectively communicate

4221
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,610
and all these different skill sets that will make them a better leader that

4222
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:19,389
uh

4223
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,369
that's the only thing that sucks is

4224
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:21,790
uh

4225
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:22,750
i just don't have those

4226
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,730
because i just haven't been through the lessons

4227
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:28,750
and i just have such a lucrative thing on my plate right now

4228
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,909
and it just sucks that i have to learn the lessons with the lucrative thing

4229
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:31,690
you know what i mean

4230
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:31,869
yeah

4231
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:32,710
because you

4232
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,570
you already have so much influence

4233
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:35,230
so much impact

4234
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,750
but you have effectively scaled

4235
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:38,170
what

4236
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:39,850
what lessons do you draw from that

4237
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:42,250
how to effectively scale as a 24 year old

4238
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:42,429
like

4239
01:43:42,659 --> 01:43:42,909
yeah

4240
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:47,469
that's something i feel like i actually could give a lot of value to to young people who are doing it

4241
01:43:47,479 --> 01:43:50,230
like older people who've built five companies or whatever they do

4242
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:51,010
um

4243
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:51,909
i probably couldn't

4244
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,170
you know they're gonna be like

4245
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:53,290
oh

4246
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:53,770
this is so obvious

4247
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:54,010
but

4248
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,090
um

4249
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,050
for uh

4250
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:58,270
younger first-time business owners

4251
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,810
you kind of just experiment to be honest

4252
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:02,050
and

4253
01:44:02,219 --> 01:44:02,469
uh

4254
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:03,670
but for us like

4255
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:04,570
it's just a new space

4256
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:08,889
no one had really ever skilled up a 100 person team to build make content on youtube

4257
01:44:08,899 --> 01:44:09,969
so there wasn't no

4258
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:10,330
uh

4259
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,590
i spent all this time

4260
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,909
like i hired one person from disney to at one point to come in and help

4261
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,889
and obviously that was a dumb idea

4262
01:44:17,899 --> 01:44:19,510
looking back on it but you know i thought

4263
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:19,630
oh

4264
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:20,949
they make great stuff

4265
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:21,969
people want to watch

4266
01:44:21,979 --> 01:44:23,830
and they come over here and help me build a team

4267
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,850
and you know they build it more the traditional way and not like how it should be online

4268
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:29,409
and and so then it's like okay

4269
01:44:29,419 --> 01:44:31,690
and now i'm not trying to trash people

4270
01:44:31,739 --> 01:44:33,070
like they all tried their best

4271
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:37,570
but then i try hire this one person who does this different type of uh media

4272
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:39,070
and runs a 100 person team

4273
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:41,590
and then you come in here and they try to build it that way

4274
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,050
they don't really listen to you or value or or see the difference

4275
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:48,429
and i i tried basically for building this company with like four

4276
01:44:48,439 --> 01:44:51,429
or five different people who worked in different veins of media

4277
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:54,610
and you know every single time it

4278
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,790
just like they just don't get it and they like they don't understand my world

4279
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:58,869
and the

4280
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,110
the eventual solution was just like throw up my sleeves and do it myself

4281
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:02,710
you know

4282
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:02,770
with

4283
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:03,310
like james

4284
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,429
where i hit man and just like no no one's ever done this

4285
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:09,670
and like no one's gonna just give us a golden carrot and tell us how to build this company

4286
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:12,790
we got to figure the fuck out ourselves and you have to kind of build up people from scratch

4287
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:13,030
then

4288
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:13,270
yeah

4289
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:17,230
exactly all the stuff i was talking about earlier and all the the lessons i learned along the way

4290
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,130
um

4291
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:18,429
and sophie

4292
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:18,909
for me

4293
01:45:18,919 --> 01:45:19,810
that was a big part of like

4294
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:25,449
and try to stop trying to have someone build this company for me and just do it myself

4295
01:45:25,459 --> 01:45:28,330
because it's scary like my whole life studying youtube videos of virality

4296
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:29,350
not business building

4297
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,270
but fuck i was like

4298
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,409
i guess we just got to do it ourselves

4299
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:32,770
and

4300
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:33,850
um

4301
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:36,730
and that's where things really start to click and we got the exponential growth

4302
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:38,650
we started getting the right people and training them the right way

4303
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:40,030
and you know

4304
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:44,290
just throwing conventional stuff out the door and focusing on what's actually practical for youtube

4305
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,949
which is just completely different than traditional media

4306
01:45:48,659 --> 01:45:52,810
so you train people and then those people train people and and so on

4307
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:52,989
yeah

4308
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,190
i mean it's just even like

4309
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:56,949
you know how you do the lighting on sets or like

4310
01:45:56,959 --> 01:45:58,210
how you do the audio or

4311
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:58,389
or

4312
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:58,810
um

4313
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,250
you know

4314
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:00,909
not writing scripts

4315
01:46:01,139 --> 01:46:02,110
so you know

4316
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,790
we're just not as efficient with our filming

4317
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,830
like sometimes i have to have 30 cameras running

4318
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:06,010
why

4319
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:07,150
because it's not scripted

4320
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:07,929
i don't

4321
01:46:07,939 --> 01:46:09,969
i don't know what chris is gonna do when we start filming

4322
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:11,830
he might run over there

4323
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,389
but guess what we got to have it planned

4324
01:46:13,399 --> 01:46:14,230
because there's only one shot

4325
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:14,830
i can't

4326
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:15,250
you know

4327
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,090
tell them not to do that

4328
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:16,270
yeah

4329
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,110
that's the shooting

4330
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,489
but then there's also the editing

4331
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:18,790
yeah

4332
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:19,989
and then the editing as well

4333
01:46:19,999 --> 01:46:20,590
and not having guardrails

4334
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:21,969
and kind of

4335
01:46:21,979 --> 01:46:22,570
you know

4336
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:22,630
i

4337
01:46:22,739 --> 01:46:24,010
at the end of the day

4338
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:25,210
it's whatever i want the video

4339
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:27,790
their job is to make a video that they think i'll like

4340
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,690
because it's my channel

4341
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:30,909
but you know you can achieve that kind of

4342
01:46:30,919 --> 01:46:31,030
however

4343
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:32,650
and um

4344
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:33,969
and so it's just everything's just different

4345
01:46:33,979 --> 01:46:34,989
you know it's much more

4346
01:46:34,999 --> 01:46:35,590
i guess

4347
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:38,110
like a startup as opposed to um

4348
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:40,090
are you often surprised like with the result

4349
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,949
like you think

4350
01:46:41,959 --> 01:46:42,310
a certain

4351
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:42,429
like

4352
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,690
we watched the video today

4353
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:44,469
that was really nice

4354
01:46:44,479 --> 01:46:46,869
those different than you would have potentially edited

4355
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:47,350
yeah

4356
01:46:47,639 --> 01:46:49,210
are you sometimes surprised by

4357
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:51,010
like a decision editor makes

4358
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:51,550
it's like okay

4359
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,469
that's not the way i would have done it

4360
01:46:53,479 --> 01:46:54,730
but it's actually this is a cool idea

4361
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:55,030
yeah

4362
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:55,810
of course

4363
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:55,989
yeah

4364
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:56,350
now

4365
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:57,190
um

4366
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:01,690
the thing my biggest fear is i don't ever want to get trapped in like a bubble of

4367
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:02,110
you know

4368
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,330
because we are getting 100 million views of video on the main channel

4369
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:04,510
like

4370
01:47:04,739 --> 01:47:09,130
but i don't want to get in this feedback loop of just my ideas are great

4371
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,630
or or not feedback loop

4372
01:47:10,679 --> 01:47:11,889
but stop learning and improving

4373
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:15,909
because it is easy sometimes to be like what we're doing is working

4374
01:47:15,919 --> 01:47:16,989
we need to just keep doing it

4375
01:47:16,999 --> 01:47:19,389
i want to keep learning and trying new things

4376
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:23,290
and i guess one way i'd put is like you don't when

4377
01:47:23,699 --> 01:47:26,290
when you're on a a come up or you're growing

4378
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:27,429
you don't want to

4379
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:27,610
uh

4380
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:29,170
test new things once

4381
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,130
uh

4382
01:47:30,179 --> 01:47:32,110
you start to plateau or have a downtrend

4383
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:33,850
because if you're like

4384
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:34,510
you know you

4385
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:35,050
you're skyrocketing

4386
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:35,770
right

4387
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:37,690
you're up up and then you level off

4388
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:39,130
you start to go down and you're like

4389
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:39,250
oh

4390
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:40,030
this isn't working anymore

4391
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:40,690
let's start experimenting

4392
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:41,230
well

4393
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,929
if you have a bad experiment now you're in like a tailspin

4394
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:46,270
you're nose diving and you have one more bad experiment

4395
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:47,110
you're like screwed

4396
01:47:47,219 --> 01:47:47,889
kind of i'm oversimplify

4397
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:52,929
you want to test things while you're still growing to keep the growing from happening

4398
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,489
because once you like

4399
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:55,750
have you know again

4400
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,070
very oversimplifying that

4401
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:57,909
like you know

4402
01:47:57,919 --> 01:47:58,630
kind of level off

4403
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:00,550
you do a couple tests that go wrong

4404
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,150
am i

4405
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:01,750
you're like screwed

4406
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:03,130
you know you're already out the door

4407
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:04,690
now you're just confirming that you're out the door

4408
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:05,770
an online entertainment

4409
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,050
so that's kind of how i see it

4410
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:11,350
so i think it's very imperative that you're constantly always experimenting and trying things

4411
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,670
even if you're getting crazy

4412
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,810
unheard of growth

4413
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,489
and so that

4414
01:48:15,499 --> 01:48:18,909
outside of the thing that brought you to the dance

4415
01:48:18,919 --> 01:48:20,590
you just dived right into

4416
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:20,969
uh

4417
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:23,050
mr beast burger and feastables

4418
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,670
this is a whole nother industry

4419
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:25,330
like

4420
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:26,650
what was that like

4421
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:26,830
well

4422
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:27,790
so beast burger

4423
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:34,449
we kind of it was supposed to be like just a pop-up like we just partnered with someone who had 300 restaurants

4424
01:48:34,459 --> 01:48:36,250
and we're just like you know

4425
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:37,330
um

4426
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:38,110
let's let's just

4427
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:38,469
uh

4428
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:40,150
sell beast burgers for a day or two

4429
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:40,989
let's let's see what happens

4430
01:48:40,999 --> 01:48:43,690
we didn't really think it would be as big as it was

4431
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:45,790
but those first like that first day

4432
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:46,449
you know

4433
01:48:46,459 --> 01:48:50,170
we do six figures in sales and they all sell out and they're running to local walmarts

4434
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,369
they can't keep up with the demand

4435
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:52,630
and it's like okay

4436
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:52,810
well

4437
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:55,330
maybe let's just leave it open a week

4438
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:55,510
whatever

4439
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:56,650
um

4440
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:59,530
and we're just doing crazy revenue and it's like okay

4441
01:48:59,540 --> 01:48:59,650
well

4442
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:00,909
let's add some more restaurants

4443
01:49:00,919 --> 01:49:04,690
and let's just leave them open for a month and we're just still doing six figures a day

4444
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,850
and it kind of just went from this thing that was

4445
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:08,949
i don't know it wasn't really

4446
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,989
i don't really plan on running a restaurant chain

4447
01:49:11,159 --> 01:49:12,489
but here i am

4448
01:49:12,499 --> 01:49:16,630
but didn't that in some sense also open your mind to something like festivals

4449
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:17,170
feasible

4450
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,730
is something i've always wanted to do

4451
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:19,630
because i i think

4452
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:20,889
just in general

4453
01:49:20,899 --> 01:49:21,010
uh

4454
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:25,869
american snacks are just full of so much horrible ingredients

4455
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:26,830
to be honest

4456
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:27,429
and they're not

4457
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:28,210
i don't know

4458
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:32,350
i feel like there also just hasn't been any innovation in american snacks in quite a while

4459
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:33,310
um

4460
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,469
and so that's just something i've always been pretty passionate about

4461
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:36,070
the thing

4462
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,090
we built that from scratch

4463
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:39,969
so we hired the ceo and built a team around them

4464
01:49:39,979 --> 01:49:40,389
and we

4465
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:43,690
we spent probably over two and a half years before we even launched

4466
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,190
just like building the right team

4467
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:48,369
figuring things out and making sure it was actually ran the way i wanted

4468
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:49,690
um

4469
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:51,610
which feasible has just been crushing

4470
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:52,030
it's

4471
01:49:52,739 --> 01:49:53,889
it's very interesting

4472
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:54,310
uh

4473
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,989
this is something i've never talked about publicly

4474
01:49:56,219 --> 01:49:57,909
but having products in retail

4475
01:49:58,199 --> 01:49:59,469
it's like before feastables

4476
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,150
everything i had done was online

4477
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,889
so if you wanted to

4478
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:05,290
you know anything from the cocoa peace brand

4479
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:07,449
you'd have to buy it online and ship it to you

4480
01:50:07,459 --> 01:50:08,070
but feastfuls

4481
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:09,909
now that you know

4482
01:50:09,919 --> 01:50:11,050
because our first product

4483
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:11,530
chocolate bars

4484
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,690
we started putting that in retail locations

4485
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:14,170
so

4486
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:14,530
like

4487
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:14,889
for example

4488
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:15,130
walmart

4489
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:15,630
it's

4490
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:17,290
it's crazy

4491
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:17,650
like

4492
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:18,250
it's just

4493
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,090
it doesn't make sense

4494
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:20,830
how if you're which

4495
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,030
i guess it does for

4496
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:24,010
because we get 100 million views of videos

4497
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:24,790
so a lot of people know us

4498
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,810
if i go stand in walmart

4499
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,969
those people recognize me and ask for photos

4500
01:50:27,979 --> 01:50:29,050
like if i still don't enough

4501
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:31,330
i could take 150 photos today in walmart 200

4502
01:50:31,619 --> 01:50:32,350
whatever it is

4503
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:34,690
so obviously it makes sense those people go find feastfuls

4504
01:50:35,159 --> 01:50:37,929
but then you just multiply that by every walmart in america

4505
01:50:37,939 --> 01:50:39,130
and it just gets so crazy

4506
01:50:39,239 --> 01:50:42,190
and i didn't think we'd be doing the kind of revenue we are

4507
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,130
and we're about to launch in some other

4508
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:46,690
i don't know if i'm allowed to say so whatever

4509
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:47,889
but other big retail

4510
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:49,030
you know

4511
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,170
locations and convenience stores

4512
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:50,710
and like

4513
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:52,630
by the end of next year we could be in like 40

4514
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:53,949
fifty thousand locations

4515
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,889
and the numbers just don't make sense

4516
01:50:56,899 --> 01:50:57,550
so you know

4517
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,710
what are some interesting challenges about scaling there

4518
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,909
that surprised you

4519
01:51:00,919 --> 01:51:01,630
the biggest problem

4520
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:05,710
which i didn't think would be was just keeping the shelves and walmart stock

4521
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:06,550
to be honest

4522
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,869
like it would have to supply

4523
01:51:07,879 --> 01:51:08,830
it was supply chain

4524
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:09,429
it was brutal

4525
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:09,730
well

4526
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:10,030
even then

4527
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:10,210
sometimes

4528
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:11,170
like you know

4529
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:12,310
you get them the stuff

4530
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,150
and they're like

4531
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,610
it takes them like a day or two to put it out in that specific location

4532
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:19,869
and i i had to stop promoting it

4533
01:51:19,879 --> 01:51:21,130
because every time i'd mention it

4534
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:24,369
like 40 of people would just be like it's not there

4535
01:51:24,379 --> 01:51:26,110
it's not in walmart or i can't buy it

4536
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:32,290
and so there's like a three ish month period where i just didn't promote festivals

4537
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,810
because i was scared that someone would go by

4538
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:35,830
and this is not there

4539
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:36,369
and so like

4540
01:51:36,379 --> 01:51:39,070
it took us a very long time to catch up to the demand

4541
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:39,969
and also

4542
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:41,889
it's not like we have unlimited money

4543
01:51:41,899 --> 01:51:45,909
so but now we're relatively caught up in um

4544
01:51:45,919 --> 01:51:46,330
keeping up

4545
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:47,170
but it's gonna be interesting

4546
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,550
because now this year in 2023

4547
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:49,630
we're gonna

4548
01:51:49,699 --> 01:51:49,949
basically

4549
01:51:50,699 --> 01:51:51,850
you know

4550
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,489
10x the amount of locations they're in

4551
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:54,730
so

4552
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:54,969
or

4553
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,770
and we're gonna try to launch new products

4554
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:59,590
so we're in for an interesting ride

4555
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,969
but yeah

4556
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:01,989
i just hate

4557
01:52:01,999 --> 01:52:04,510
i hate when i tell people you know like

4558
01:52:04,619 --> 01:52:04,869
hey

4559
01:52:04,879 --> 01:52:07,929
go try this product and then they go in their local walmart and eventually other places

4560
01:52:07,939 --> 01:52:08,770
and it's not there

4561
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:09,369
it's just so brutal

4562
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:12,670
you know they made that whole journey out there and they didn't get it

4563
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:13,929
and so that that was

4564
01:52:13,939 --> 01:52:14,170
really it

4565
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:15,130
um

4566
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:16,330
besides that

4567
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:16,570
no

4568
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:17,110
it's

4569
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:19,150
it's been doing way better than i ever thought

4570
01:52:20,219 --> 01:52:20,469
uh

4571
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:26,050
you've talked to a couple places about maybe doing mobile games or computer games in the future

4572
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:26,170
yeah

4573
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:26,650
yeah

4574
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:27,969
is that something you're still considering

4575
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:28,449
yes

4576
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:29,770
um

4577
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:29,830
because

4578
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:30,250
uh

4579
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:31,510
you know

4580
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,850
do you normally talk with people as much as we talked beforehand

4581
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:34,989
is that

4582
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:35,170
no

4583
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:35,889
no

4584
01:52:35,899 --> 01:52:38,949
that that was the pro who spent all day today

4585
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:40,929
look in my head

4586
01:52:40,939 --> 01:52:43,150
everything you asked me is stuff we already talked about

4587
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:43,869
not really well

4588
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:44,350
no

4589
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:44,530
no

4590
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:44,770
not everything

4591
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:45,550
i take it back

4592
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:45,790
but sorry

4593
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:46,869
the last two questions

4594
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:47,170
yes

4595
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,730
and so it's just funny

4596
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:49,630
because what

4597
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:50,590
no

4598
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,369
i tried it's okay

4599
01:52:51,379 --> 01:52:54,489
there's a different style of asking those questions because i

4600
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:54,790
i

4601
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,270
on purpose

4602
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:57,130
didn't dig further with you

4603
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:57,369
uh

4604
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,150
i could tell

4605
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:58,270
yeah

4606
01:52:58,440 --> 01:52:59,650
so i can tell you

4607
01:52:59,660 --> 01:52:59,830
okay

4608
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:00,489
this is

4609
01:53:00,499 --> 01:53:00,850
by the way

4610
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:00,909
okay

4611
01:53:00,919 --> 01:53:01,389
all right

4612
01:53:01,399 --> 01:53:01,510
well

4613
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:09,690
this is the first time i've ever talked to somebody as much as i did with you beforehand

4614
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:10,690
yeah

4615
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:11,409
well

4616
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:13,090
on the same day

4617
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:15,250
i know we're not even saying okay

4618
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:15,369
together

4619
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,230
one hour

4620
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:17,350
yeah

4621
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:18,750
literally

4622
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:20,170
it's funny

4623
01:53:20,699 --> 01:53:20,949
um

4624
01:53:20,959 --> 01:53:23,469
this is a hilarious and awesome social experiment

4625
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,090
i think i picked this hotel and i just like harassed him all day to hang out with me

4626
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:28,570
and then

4627
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:28,750
great

4628
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:29,350
here we are

4629
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:29,530
now

4630
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:30,250
i love it

4631
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:31,150
um

4632
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:32,770
i was secretly recording the whole time

4633
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:32,889
just

4634
01:53:32,899 --> 01:53:33,250
you know

4635
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:33,610
i'm just kidding

4636
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:33,850
anyway

4637
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,469
so what was the question

4638
01:53:36,199 --> 01:53:36,449
yeah

4639
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:38,650
so the interesting thing is

4640
01:53:38,699 --> 01:53:38,949
uh

4641
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,750
with beast burger and feastables that

4642
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:41,830
um

4643
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:42,909
there's physical goods

4644
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:46,570
as opposed to like making mobile games or pc game

4645
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:47,469
whichever one we end up doing

4646
01:53:47,479 --> 01:53:48,310
which is software

4647
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:51,369
and i actually have a giant international audience

4648
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:52,030
like

4649
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:53,230
um

4650
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:55,150
most of my audience is obviously outside of america

4651
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:58,929
and so the problem we're running into is it just takes time to build up the supply chain

4652
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:01,270
and get feastables in southeast asia

4653
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,590
get festivals in india

4654
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,290
get festivals in brazil and mexico and all these other places

4655
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:08,830
where we have giant pockets of our audience and same thing with peaceful

4656
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,929
it's just it's going to take probably years

4657
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:11,230
uh

4658
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:13,330
unless we partner with someone who already has the distribution

4659
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:14,290
which we're figuring out

4660
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,090
but the udf software is

4661
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,690
i can make a hypothetical game or whatever we end up doing

4662
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,250
and all my fans

4663
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:22,330
can you know

4664
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:25,510
use it tomorrow the day i mentioned it

4665
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:29,290
and so if i promote something in a video to 100 million people and it's like

4666
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:29,469
uh

4667
01:54:29,479 --> 01:54:30,130
you know

4668
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:30,790
basically like a game

4669
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,110
they can all download it

4670
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:33,429
so there you know

4671
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:34,210
um

4672
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:36,850
but if i promote a feast rules bar right now

4673
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:39,489
it's only in america because we're struggling just to keep up with american demand

4674
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:41,409
we haven't even gotten the chance to go outside america

4675
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:42,670
so i i alienate

4676
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:43,510
i'm uh

4677
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:44,710
a majority of my audience

4678
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,989
and it feels so shitty to just from

4679
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:47,710
you know

4680
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:49,150
mention something that most of them can't buy

4681
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:52,630
but on the flip side you can't just spawn this crazy infrastructure

4682
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:55,750
and just have tens of millions of bars

4683
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:59,170
and all your products in every single store across the world before you promote it

4684
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:00,850
so you can't put the egg before the chicken

4685
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,270
and so

4686
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:02,409
um

4687
01:55:02,419 --> 01:55:03,010
it's like that

4688
01:55:03,239 --> 01:55:03,489
that's

4689
01:55:03,499 --> 01:55:04,690
that's what i'm excited about

4690
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:09,250
i want to get into less physical stuff and more stuff that everyone matters can actually use

4691
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:10,030
this is the thought process

4692
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:12,130
especially if there's a social element to the gaming too

4693
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:13,510
because it's not unlike feastables

4694
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:15,310
like that's a product you consume

4695
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,150
you missed it

4696
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,050
when you're setting it for this

4697
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:17,530
we were

4698
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:17,710
uh

4699
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:18,550
doing some

4700
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:22,150
basically just laying out every everything that we're planning for

4701
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:25,210
so our interfaces where we want to start hiring the team to build it

4702
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:26,830
and we're kind of just laying out the game

4703
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:28,929
and i was actually really curious to get your thoughts

4704
01:55:28,939 --> 01:55:29,710
but i can't say it

4705
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:30,670
because whatever i say

4706
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:32,889
someone's just gonna take it and run with it

4707
01:55:32,899 --> 01:55:36,130
but you're pretty good idea about the kind of games you're thinking about

4708
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:36,190
yeah

4709
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:38,590
i mean i can imagine we also talked a little bit about it

4710
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:39,489
it's super awesome

4711
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:40,389
good one

4712
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:41,650
i did so much good talk

4713
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,250
all right

4714
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:43,330
the juicy talks having you

4715
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:43,750
she's like

4716
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:44,530
i gotta go set up

4717
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:44,710
well

4718
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:45,850
you know i

4719
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:47,050
i already heard a lot awesome

4720
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:47,710
i mean

4721
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:50,530
but that is a different kind of team you would need to hire

4722
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:50,650
yeah

4723
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:52,150
is that a little

4724
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:52,270
uh

4725
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:57,730
nerve-wracking like going into a new field and trying to a little bit

4726
01:55:57,740 --> 01:55:58,750
but then i remind myself like

4727
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:00,790
like steve jobs didn't know how to code right

4728
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:03,610
and you know he just he just knew what a good product was

4729
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:06,670
and i feel like as someone who wasted so much of his lives playing video games

4730
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:07,750
i have a good sense of it

4731
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:08,650
and that might be ignorance

4732
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:09,070
well

4733
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:09,850
that's really important

4734
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:10,150
right

4735
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:10,869
it's not about coding

4736
01:56:11,159 --> 01:56:12,489
it's about what makes for a good game

4737
01:56:12,499 --> 01:56:12,610
exactly

4738
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:13,330
and again

4739
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:14,650
that might genuinely be ignorant

4740
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:15,850
so maybe i end up

4741
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:16,389
you know

4742
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:18,369
getting bit in the butt because of what i'm saying now

4743
01:56:18,379 --> 01:56:19,510
but i think

4744
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:20,830
just like with youtube

4745
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:26,170
i just want to obsess over making a great product and things that i think my audience will love

4746
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:26,650
and i think

4747
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:28,330
as long as i keep that as my north star will do

4748
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:28,449
well

4749
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:29,290
uh

4750
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:32,590
what is the path to being worth 100 billion look like

4751
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:35,110
doesn't have to be worth 100 billion look like

4752
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,250
i don't know

4753
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:36,670
because okay

4754
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:37,150
okay

4755
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:37,810
let me just like

4756
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:38,230
pause here

4757
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:42,190
24 and there's so much awesome scaling so many great ideas

4758
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:42,489
you

4759
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,230
you think about different trajectories

4760
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:45,030
yeah

4761
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:46,030
uh

4762
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,730
what those possible trajectives might look like

4763
01:56:49,139 --> 01:56:49,389
yeah

4764
01:56:49,619 --> 01:56:52,389
i mean if the goal was to just be worth 100 billion dollars

4765
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:52,630
yes

4766
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:56,350
i'm my goal of a broken record

4767
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:57,670
so make the best view impossible

4768
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:59,889
because i know whatever else i want will come

4769
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:00,190
obviously

4770
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:02,350
the video is the foundation

4771
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:02,650
yeah

4772
01:57:02,699 --> 01:57:06,850
exactly so to pat to 100 billion dollars just keep getting 100 million views of video

4773
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:07,210
you know what i mean

4774
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:08,170
um

4775
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:08,770
but or more

4776
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:09,429
oh yeah

4777
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:09,730
or more

4778
01:57:09,740 --> 01:57:10,810
exactly if we can keep growing

4779
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:11,949
but you know

4780
01:57:11,959 --> 01:57:14,230
if we can keep feasibles

4781
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:15,369
growing right

4782
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:16,810
and we eventually spend international

4783
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,630
and one day we're in 100 000 retail locations

4784
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:22,929
and we're selling the same amount of excuse or units per skews

4785
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:23,889
like we're currently doing

4786
01:57:23,899 --> 01:57:24,070
uh

4787
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:25,869
i mean that would crush

4788
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:26,349
and then

4789
01:57:26,359 --> 01:57:26,530
obviously

4790
01:57:27,179 --> 01:57:27,429
ideally

4791
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:29,290
one day we open up hundreds of beast burgers

4792
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:30,909
we get it where we turn out

4793
01:57:30,919 --> 01:57:31,389
you know

4794
01:57:31,399 --> 01:57:31,690
like supercell

4795
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:32,830
a couple hit games

4796
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:35,050
i don't want to make dozens or hundreds of games

4797
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:37,030
i just want to make games that are just great

4798
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:37,989
and you know

4799
01:57:37,999 --> 01:57:39,190
we rarely drop them while we do

4800
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,670
they're bangers

4801
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:40,929
um

4802
01:57:40,939 --> 01:57:41,349
and just

4803
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:41,710
you know

4804
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,250
whatever other stuff

4805
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:43,929
we end up doing all that combined

4806
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:45,429
i mean it's just interesting

4807
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:46,869
because like what

4808
01:57:46,879 --> 01:57:50,050
what's a show that's pulled 100 million views per episode

4809
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:50,230
basically

4810
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:52,570
that's like we're doing like

4811
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:53,650
you know

4812
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:53,830
i mean

4813
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,869
like the super bowl gets praised because they get 100 million viewers

4814
01:57:55,879 --> 01:57:56,949
but i can't think of a show

4815
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:58,270
um

4816
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:59,530
maybe in reruns or something

4817
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:01,030
so there's also a show that's has

4818
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:01,570
uh

4819
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:03,849
has a singular kind of figure

4820
01:58:04,199 --> 01:58:04,449
yeah

4821
01:58:04,619 --> 01:58:06,190
that you can now use as a

4822
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:06,429
like

4823
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,170
i don't have a network tell me what to do

4824
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:09,190
i don't have anyone like

4825
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,210
i can do whatever i want

4826
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:11,770
so it's a very interesting position

4827
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:16,330
because i put out content and 100 million people show up and then i also have a gaming channel

4828
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:16,929
i put out content

4829
01:58:16,939 --> 01:58:18,369
15 million people show up in a reaction

4830
01:58:18,379 --> 01:58:19,090
i put out content

4831
01:58:19,139 --> 01:58:22,210
10 million people show up and have a tick tock and i put out content and on average

4832
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:23,949
20 million people show up and like

4833
01:58:23,959 --> 01:58:24,610
and i

4834
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:24,790
so

4835
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:26,889
as long as i can keep that going

4836
01:58:26,899 --> 01:58:28,150
and then we build these businesses

4837
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:28,810
it's like

4838
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:31,989
it's honestly pretty scary to see what will happen

4839
01:58:31,999 --> 01:58:32,590
you know

4840
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:32,710
uh

4841
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:33,670
over the years

4842
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:34,989
because feastables launched

4843
01:58:35,219 --> 01:58:35,889
you know

4844
01:58:35,899 --> 01:58:36,489
last year 2022

4845
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:39,010
so it's a relatively new thing and beast burger

4846
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:42,369
we just started scaling up the physical side and we haven't obviously even launched any mobile games yet

4847
01:58:42,379 --> 01:58:44,469
so i think i'm at the antithesis of it

4848
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:47,949
i don't see a world where my youtube channels are relevant in the next couple of years

4849
01:58:47,959 --> 01:58:49,330
i just this is what i live for

4850
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:50,830
and so if i can keep that going

4851
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:54,250
and then really start to expand these businesses that leverage off of it

4852
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:54,369
then

4853
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:55,330
yeah

4854
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:56,230
i mean

4855
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:59,230
hopefully there's the day one where i could give away a billion dollars in a video

4856
01:58:59,240 --> 01:58:59,349
honestly

4857
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:00,909
that that

4858
01:59:00,919 --> 01:59:01,150
yeah

4859
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:02,770
that would be one hell of a video

4860
01:59:03,719 --> 01:59:03,969
um

4861
01:59:03,979 --> 01:59:05,590
let me ask you the ridiculous question

4862
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:08,110
since you went from being broke to being

4863
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:08,550
uh

4864
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:09,550
rich

4865
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:10,270
although you keep

4866
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:11,110
uh

4867
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:12,369
spending all your money

4868
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:13,510
um

4869
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:13,630
but

4870
01:59:13,639 --> 01:59:13,889
uh

4871
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:16,030
does money buy happiness

4872
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,830
how has money changed

4873
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:19,150
sort of your

4874
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,570
your happiness in life

4875
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:23,889
it's money by happiness

4876
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:24,969
um

4877
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:25,750
no

4878
01:59:26,219 --> 01:59:26,469
not

4879
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:28,330
i mean to a point

4880
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:28,449
yes

4881
01:59:28,459 --> 01:59:30,310
once you can take care of your health

4882
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:31,929
you can take care of

4883
01:59:31,939 --> 01:59:35,110
like any immediate dangers and you can take care of your family

4884
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:35,290
relatively

4885
01:59:35,699 --> 01:59:35,949
no

4886
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,150
it doesn't like

4887
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:38,230
but those things do like

4888
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:39,310
when i first came into money

4889
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:42,849
one of the first things i did was retire my mom and like that brought me tons of happiness

4890
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:43,570
you know what i mean

4891
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:44,170
and like

4892
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:44,949
you know

4893
01:59:44,959 --> 01:59:47,830
if my brother had a medical emergency and and we couldn't afford it

4894
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:48,909
and i made money to afford it

4895
01:59:48,919 --> 01:59:49,630
that would bring tons of happiness

4896
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:50,170
you know

4897
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:50,230
so

4898
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:51,670
once you take care of those basic necessities

4899
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,010
so we'll say makeover hypothetically a million dollars

4900
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:54,190
no

4901
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:54,790
it

4902
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,530
it really doesn't like adding an extra zero going from 10 million to 100 million or whatever it is

4903
01:59:59,540 --> 02:00:00,489
makes no difference

4904
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:05,110
so you're given that or just fearless and spending the money

4905
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:05,230
yeah

4906
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:05,650
well

4907
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:06,250
let me reframe

4908
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,810
i guess it could for some people

4909
02:00:07,820 --> 02:00:08,050
if

4910
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:11,830
if you really i don't know you spent your whole life obsessing over cars

4911
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,290
it probably would bring you a little bit of joy to buy a nice lamborghini

4912
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:14,710
i

4913
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:17,290
i'm coming more from the frame of mind of of an entrepreneur

4914
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:21,130
someone who's really obsessed with business ability for me and a lot of my friends and people

4915
02:00:21,140 --> 02:00:21,610
i hang around

4916
02:00:21,620 --> 02:00:22,510
what brings us

4917
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,550
happiness is winning and building companies

4918
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,469
and do you know

4919
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:27,849
changing the world like that

4920
02:00:28,199 --> 02:00:28,929
that is fun

4921
02:00:28,939 --> 02:00:29,889
it's a complex problem

4922
02:00:29,899 --> 02:00:33,310
you can wake up every day and it gives you something to obsess over and devote your life to

4923
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:34,929
where it's just having money

4924
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:36,310
doesn't you know

4925
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:36,790
well

4926
02:00:37,139 --> 02:00:39,369
one interesting question for you psychologically

4927
02:00:39,719 --> 02:00:39,969
so

4928
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:43,869
because you have become wealthy and because you give

4929
02:00:43,879 --> 02:00:44,110
like

4930
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:46,150
part of your work is giving away a lot of money

4931
02:00:47,099 --> 02:00:47,349
um

4932
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:55,510
do you find it hard to find people you can trust is do people see you basically as a source of money as opposed to another human being

4933
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,730
it's weird because you would think

4934
02:00:57,740 --> 02:00:57,969
yes

4935
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:01,150
but i i feel like i also know the right places to look

4936
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:01,929
um

4937
02:01:01,939 --> 02:01:02,290
but yeah

4938
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:06,070
if i just walked into target and try to make friends with 10 random people

4939
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:06,550
of course

4940
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:07,510
um

4941
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:07,989
you gotta

4942
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:09,070
uh

4943
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:10,929
so you can kind of sense

4944
02:01:10,939 --> 02:01:11,110
oh

4945
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:11,650
yeah

4946
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:12,730
that's the right thing

4947
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:13,290
yeah

4948
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:14,290
that's

4949
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:14,830
yeah

4950
02:01:15,179 --> 02:01:16,330
it's so obvious

4951
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:17,909
so i don't even want to go into descriptions

4952
02:01:18,659 --> 02:01:19,710
but honestly

4953
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,790
a lot of my friends are like

4954
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:22,210
uh

4955
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:22,690
chandler

4956
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:25,030
i i played literally with him

4957
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:25,929
um

4958
02:01:25,939 --> 02:01:26,830
and tyler

4959
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:27,790
the guy

4960
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,230
i mean i went to school with him

4961
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:29,349
chris

4962
02:01:29,639 --> 02:01:30,610
he was my first subscriber

4963
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:32,170
um

4964
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:33,730
carl was here after we got big

4965
02:01:33,740 --> 02:01:34,150
but whatever

4966
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,409
he's friends with the boys

4967
02:01:35,419 --> 02:01:39,070
and it is a lot of my closer friends

4968
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,270
even like my youtube friends

4969
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,010
i i knew before i was big

4970
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:45,429
so maybe there is some mirror to that

4971
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:45,730
maybe it is

4972
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:45,969
i

4973
02:01:45,979 --> 02:01:46,570
i don't know

4974
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:47,949
i've never really put too much thought into it

4975
02:01:47,959 --> 02:01:50,770
maybe there's a reason i hang around a lot of these people i knew before i got paid

4976
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:53,530
because it's much easier and they help you keep

4977
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:53,889
like

4978
02:01:54,119 --> 02:01:54,369
uh

4979
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:57,429
your radar sharp of who can and can't be trusted

4980
02:01:57,540 --> 02:01:58,630
because you know you can trust them

4981
02:01:58,640 --> 02:01:58,869
yeah

4982
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,989
it's difficult when you become richer and richer and more powerful

4983
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:02,290
well

4984
02:02:02,699 --> 02:02:03,250
one day

4985
02:02:03,719 --> 02:02:04,750
one time when you get rich

4986
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:05,590
oh yeah

4987
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:06,010
not even richer

4988
02:02:06,119 --> 02:02:06,790
but more fan

4989
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:07,869
one thing i thought is

4990
02:02:07,879 --> 02:02:10,989
as i climbed this like ladder of youtube and got bigger

4991
02:02:10,999 --> 02:02:12,790
i thought there would be tons of people like me

4992
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:12,969
people

4993
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:15,070
how to like that

4994
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:15,190
takes

4995
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:16,869
like the kamikaze approach to building a business

4996
02:02:16,879 --> 02:02:18,310
you just throw all your money in it

4997
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:18,849
you throw all your time

4998
02:02:18,859 --> 02:02:20,230
you throw all your energy throw everything

4999
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:20,590
yeah

5000
02:02:20,699 --> 02:02:21,369
you're just like

5001
02:02:21,379 --> 02:02:21,790
fuck it

5002
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:22,510
this is this

5003
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:23,050
i'm dead

5004
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:23,290
yeah

5005
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:25,330
i thought there would be hundreds of these

5006
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:25,570
yeah

5007
02:02:25,619 --> 02:02:27,130
and and there isn't there is

5008
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:32,110
i mean there's like maybe one or two and i talked to those motherfuckers every single day

5009
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:33,310
i'm sick and tired of talking to them

5010
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:33,790
but i love them

5011
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:34,510
um

5012
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:36,250
but it's just so interesting

5013
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:38,710
because like every level i got up like i get a million subscribers

5014
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:39,670
like all right

5015
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:42,429
where's all these guys in the million subscribers that are fucking psychopaths

5016
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:43,630
and then you know

5017
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:44,409
you know

5018
02:02:44,419 --> 02:02:47,349
there are people become like conservative as they get

5019
02:02:47,359 --> 02:02:47,530
like

5020
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:48,190
they get more

5021
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:49,330
especially as they get bigger

5022
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:49,570
yeah

5023
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:50,710
and you know

5024
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:51,429
20 million subscribers

5025
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:53,469
30. it's like every step of the way

5026
02:02:53,479 --> 02:02:55,810
it's like i just got more and more lonely

5027
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:56,770
to be honest

5028
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:57,489
since you

5029
02:02:57,540 --> 02:03:01,750
you know it sounds cliche and you hear that kind of shit in movies and you're like

5030
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,590
that's not how it works

5031
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:04,449
but it is like there's

5032
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,150
there's just not many people that just want to give up everything

5033
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:10,929
go all in and obsess over making the greatest goddamn videos every single day of their life

5034
02:03:10,939 --> 02:03:15,550
like they're really hard to find and be able to sacrifice everything for that video

5035
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:15,790
yeah

5036
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:16,270
like

5037
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:18,849
basically you put all the money right back in

5038
02:03:18,859 --> 02:03:19,030
yeah

5039
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,110
or the people doing it

5040
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:21,130
they're on just a small scale

5041
02:03:21,239 --> 02:03:22,449
and if i talk to them

5042
02:03:22,459 --> 02:03:24,969
it's just 99. 9 of the time i'm teaching them things

5043
02:03:24,979 --> 02:03:26,230
and it's like

5044
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:26,889
so it's lonely

5045
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:31,869
because there's not too many people especially in the creative space that are as crazy as you

5046
02:03:31,879 --> 02:03:32,110
yeah

5047
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:33,010
it is 100

5048
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:33,250
it's

5049
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:34,150
it's

5050
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:34,330
so

5051
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:35,710
it's not what i

5052
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:36,190
i was expecting

5053
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:37,989
i was expecting there'd be a lot of people like me

5054
02:03:37,999 --> 02:03:39,130
but well

5055
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:41,830
i guess the guy would talk to elon musk

5056
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:43,150
is a bit like you in

5057
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:43,510
that sense

5058
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:43,690
yeah

5059
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:44,770
just in a different domain

5060
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:45,190
yeah

5061
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:45,610
yeah

5062
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:45,670
exactly

5063
02:03:46,139 --> 02:03:48,610
just willingness to put it all back in right

5064
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:49,929
and that's why i found right now

5065
02:03:49,939 --> 02:03:55,570
a lot of the people i relate to don't even make youtube videos like they're just like i'm viewing more

5066
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:58,330
and more away from fellow content creators and more to just

5067
02:03:58,340 --> 02:03:59,230
you know

5068
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:02,230
i'm just looking for those other people who just share a little bit of it

5069
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:04,389
so i don't feel so fucking crazy all the time

5070
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:05,590
like you know what i mean

5071
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:06,310
um

5072
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:06,429
and

5073
02:04:06,439 --> 02:04:06,969
like people

5074
02:04:06,979 --> 02:04:09,369
i feel normal around and they tend to just be doing the randomest things

5075
02:04:09,379 --> 02:04:10,330
but you know

5076
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:12,250
loving it well i think that's really inspiring

5077
02:04:12,599 --> 02:04:12,849
it's

5078
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:13,449
uh

5079
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:19,449
it's like the bukowski line to find what you love and let it kill you is really put everything

5080
02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:22,750
put everything into the thing you love

5081
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:22,929
that

5082
02:04:23,219 --> 02:04:25,150
that's like the way to really create special stuff

5083
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:26,409
but it's also the way to

5084
02:04:26,419 --> 02:04:26,590
yeah

5085
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:29,050
you have to be careful

5086
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:29,830
given this advice

5087
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,630
because they're like

5088
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:34,389
they're like bodybuilders who'll be like

5089
02:04:34,399 --> 02:04:35,469
just go to the gym

5090
02:04:35,479 --> 02:04:35,949
be disciplined

5091
02:04:36,179 --> 02:04:36,550
i'm disciplined

5092
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:37,330
go to gym

5093
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:39,730
but i would argue for those people

5094
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:41,290
it's like it's not even discipline

5095
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:43,330
they just enjoy weightlifting right

5096
02:04:43,639 --> 02:04:45,790
because there are people who are jacked

5097
02:04:46,139 --> 02:04:48,130
but they don't make much money or run a business

5098
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:48,250
right

5099
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:49,210
if they're that disciplined

5100
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:50,170
they would

5101
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:51,790
they would be hitting every area of their life

5102
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:52,630
they just really like business

5103
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:55,989
and there's people like me who just to an extreme level

5104
02:04:55,999 --> 02:04:56,889
love building companies

5105
02:04:57,179 --> 02:04:57,429
right

5106
02:04:57,439 --> 02:04:58,869
it's not even discipline for me

5107
02:04:58,879 --> 02:04:59,770
it's just in my blood

5108
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:00,790
it's what i wake up

5109
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,690
i don't think about it

5110
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:02,290
i don't push myself

5111
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:04,750
i don't need to watch a fucking motivational video to go work

5112
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:06,070
i just do it

5113
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:09,130
it's programmed in me at this point and i couldn't imagine a world

5114
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:10,510
where i don't wake up and do it every day

5115
02:05:11,219 --> 02:05:11,469
um

5116
02:05:11,479 --> 02:05:15,190
but i think that a little bit of it is genetics

5117
02:05:16,139 --> 02:05:16,389
um

5118
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:17,290
and just how you're hardwired

5119
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:17,830
uh

5120
02:05:18,179 --> 02:05:19,810
not that it can't be trained or taught

5121
02:05:19,820 --> 02:05:21,070
and not that you know

5122
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:23,230
and obviously the friend group you're in influences these things

5123
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:24,550
and over time i think can change it

5124
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:27,310
but someone's just not gonna be able to flip a switch

5125
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:30,369
and then just start doing a kamikaze approach to building a business

5126
02:05:30,379 --> 02:05:33,670
just like a lot of people try to flip a switch and start bodybuilding and quit

5127
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:34,690
majority of the time

5128
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:35,349
you know

5129
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:37,150
that's just not innate to them

5130
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:40,270
but i think a lot of us have the capacity to do that in some domain

5131
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:40,690
yeah

5132
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:41,290
i think

5133
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:42,010
if you went about strategically

5134
02:05:42,239 --> 02:05:46,090
if you surrounded yourself with fellow like-minded people and you know

5135
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:46,810
slowly over time

5136
02:05:46,820 --> 02:05:47,530
switched it

5137
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:47,650
uh

5138
02:05:48,179 --> 02:05:49,270
but if you just try to like hardcore

5139
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:49,989
do it

5140
02:05:49,999 --> 02:05:50,889
you're just going to lose your mind

5141
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:54,250
do you ever worry about your mental health

5142
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:56,889
did you take step to protect it to

5143
02:05:57,179 --> 02:05:57,429
uh

5144
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:58,150
yeah

5145
02:05:58,560 --> 02:05:59,889
to like for the long run

5146
02:05:59,899 --> 02:06:02,349
to make sure you have the mental strength to go on

5147
02:06:02,359 --> 02:06:02,469
yes

5148
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:02,830
weirdly

5149
02:06:03,179 --> 02:06:03,429
enough

5150
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:08,170
the best thing for my mental health was giving in to my innate nature to work

5151
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:12,730
and the most depressed i get is when i try to restrict it and like i don't work weekends

5152
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:13,989
so i don't work this day

5153
02:06:13,999 --> 02:06:16,630
what's best for me is just to work when i feel like working

5154
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:20,710
and then just not work when i don't like and just have no constraints

5155
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:22,989
because there are just some nights where i don't want to sleep

5156
02:06:22,999 --> 02:06:25,510
and for whatever reason i feel compelled to go all night

5157
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,349
whatever like

5158
02:06:26,699 --> 02:06:27,369
just do it

5159
02:06:27,379 --> 02:06:27,730
you know

5160
02:06:27,740 --> 02:06:27,849
do

5161
02:06:27,859 --> 02:06:28,510
whatever you want

5162
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:31,690
it's what i tell my like working brain

5163
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:32,830
um

5164
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:35,409
and i just give in to it and i feel that's where i feel the happiest

5165
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,489
and and then

5166
02:06:36,499 --> 02:06:36,489
um

5167
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:37,389
you know

5168
02:06:37,399 --> 02:06:39,969
it's typically like when i'm really in the grind mode

5169
02:06:39,979 --> 02:06:41,230
it'll be like seven or eight days

5170
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:42,790
it's just non-stop going going

5171
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:43,929
and then it's like

5172
02:06:43,939 --> 02:06:44,110
oh

5173
02:06:44,219 --> 02:06:45,310
i'll realize like

5174
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:45,489
oh

5175
02:06:45,499 --> 02:06:49,570
i need some recharge time and then go fucking binge a season of anime

5176
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:49,810
yeah

5177
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:51,130
but listen here

5178
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:51,969
but that's the thing

5179
02:06:51,979 --> 02:06:55,570
like people will tell you don't work weekends or don't do this or don't work past this or blah

5180
02:06:55,619 --> 02:06:55,869
blah

5181
02:06:55,879 --> 02:06:56,469
give you all these constraints

5182
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:57,550
but for me

5183
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:58,449
and it's unconventional

5184
02:06:58,800 --> 02:06:59,889
i just give into it

5185
02:06:59,899 --> 02:07:03,070
i think there's something really to be said for that

5186
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:05,170
i i try to surround myself with people that

5187
02:07:05,699 --> 02:07:06,909
like what i don't

5188
02:07:06,919 --> 02:07:08,889
when i pull an all-nighter they don't go

5189
02:07:08,899 --> 02:07:10,330
like you should get more sleep

5190
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:12,610
there's a reason i pulled that all-nighter like

5191
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:14,050
if i'm really passionate about something

5192
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:14,650
they say

5193
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:19,869
they basically encourage it because i i have no problem getting sleep and getting rest

5194
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:21,310
um

5195
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:23,949
what i need in my life is people that encourage you to kind of keep going

5196
02:07:23,959 --> 02:07:26,830
keep going with the thoughts that you're passionate about normal people

5197
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:28,869
they don't want that life and they probably shouldn't

5198
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,010
it's not good for you

5199
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:30,670
um

5200
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,150
but yeah

5201
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:31,270
is

5202
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:33,909
if you hang around people like just whatever

5203
02:07:33,919 --> 02:07:37,810
different people you're gonna feel crazy and it's gonna wear on you

5204
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:37,929
whereas

5205
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:39,250
if you're around similar people

5206
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:41,469
it just it's so much easier

5207
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,670
like if you

5208
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:44,469
you know

5209
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:45,310
um

5210
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:46,570
i've started weightlifting more

5211
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:47,050
and like

5212
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:51,190
one thing that's helped is just having jack people around me because they naturally just eat healthier

5213
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:52,090
they do

5214
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:52,210
like

5215
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:56,710
they naturally just have freaking grilled chicken and all this shit and high protein meals

5216
02:07:56,820 --> 02:07:59,230
and it's just like easier for me to just piggyback and be like

5217
02:07:59,240 --> 02:07:59,409
oh

5218
02:07:59,419 --> 02:08:00,670
can you just order me whatever you're getting

5219
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:00,849
uh

5220
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:01,929
and they're like

5221
02:08:01,939 --> 02:08:03,369
i gotta go to the gym and i'll be like

5222
02:08:03,379 --> 02:08:03,610
oh shit

5223
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:04,449
i'll just join you

5224
02:08:04,459 --> 02:08:04,750
you know

5225
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:05,469
and it's like

5226
02:08:05,479 --> 02:08:06,730
it's just it's cheat codes

5227
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:07,150
you know

5228
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:07,330
i mean

5229
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:09,070
just surround yourself with people that you want to be

5230
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:10,449
and it makes it like 70

5231
02:08:10,459 --> 02:08:10,690
easier

5232
02:08:11,159 --> 02:08:11,710
in my opinion

5233
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:13,270
it's like that is the cheat code to life

5234
02:08:14,099 --> 02:08:14,349
um

5235
02:08:14,359 --> 02:08:15,489
and i wish i

5236
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:16,270
obviously

5237
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:17,949
your audience is definitely a lot older

5238
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:18,909
but you know

5239
02:08:18,919 --> 02:08:20,230
to the older people listening like

5240
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:21,010
if you have

5241
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:24,610
are in a place of mentorship for someone younger or have influence over younger people

5242
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:26,469
you should really try to drill

5243
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:30,190
that in their heads like the people are there around 100 dictates the outcome

5244
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:32,290
i would not be on 120 million subscribers

5245
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:33,489
if i didn't find

5246
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:33,790
uh

5247
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:35,290
when i was around a million

5248
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:37,389
i had a couple friends that were just also psychopaths

5249
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:38,530
you know

5250
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:39,909
i outgrew them

5251
02:08:39,919 --> 02:08:41,290
but at the time it was great

5252
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:43,210
and i wouldn't be where i am today if it wasn't for them

5253
02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:44,409
um

5254
02:08:44,419 --> 02:08:46,330
and just all along the way

5255
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:51,310
the friends that i hung out with had such a dramatic impact on wearing them

5256
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:51,369
like

5257
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:53,889
i'd probably have 80 million less subscribers

5258
02:08:54,179 --> 02:08:54,790
you know

5259
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:55,090
if it was

5260
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:58,150
if i wasn't so strategic about hanging out with people that i add value to

5261
02:08:58,160 --> 02:08:59,349
and they also add value to me

5262
02:08:59,359 --> 02:09:04,630
so the advice for young people would be to be very selective about the people you saw yourself

5263
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:05,349
so selective

5264
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:05,770
it's

5265
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:06,190
it's crazy

5266
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:07,349
like chris

5267
02:09:08,099 --> 02:09:09,250
you know he's i

5268
02:09:09,599 --> 02:09:09,849
i

5269
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:12,489
he's really funny and that's why he's great for the videos

5270
02:09:12,499 --> 02:09:16,750
and part of why he's so funny is he consumes copious amounts of cartoons and just funny content

5271
02:09:17,099 --> 02:09:18,190
and so i'll find

5272
02:09:18,239 --> 02:09:18,489
like

5273
02:09:18,659 --> 02:09:20,170
when i spend more time with chris

5274
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:23,409
i'll start just quoting these weird cartoons and shows

5275
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:25,210
and like my speech will literally change

5276
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:28,330
and just after like a week of spending more time with them

5277
02:09:28,340 --> 02:09:28,929
it has

5278
02:09:28,939 --> 02:09:29,050
like

5279
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:30,250
it's like that quick enough effect

5280
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:31,210
you know

5281
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:31,330
now

5282
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:33,070
picture that over the course of years

5283
02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:33,790
i mean

5284
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:33,909
yeah

5285
02:09:33,919 --> 02:09:35,230
it has such a huge influence

5286
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:38,770
like pluck one of their friends out and hypothetically put me in there

5287
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:39,130
and yeah

5288
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:39,969
you know

5289
02:09:39,979 --> 02:09:42,369
there's no doubt if they're trying to become a content creator

5290
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:43,869
there are odds of success is 10x

5291
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:44,230
right

5292
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:45,550
obviously you can't do that

5293
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:49,270
but you got to find your closest version of it and just be selective

5294
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:49,690
yeah

5295
02:09:49,860 --> 02:09:51,790
but this also applies not just to younger

5296
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:52,989
to older people to agree

5297
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:53,949
but they

5298
02:09:53,959 --> 02:09:54,070
it's

5299
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:55,210
it's even more

5300
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:58,030
i like when i was a teenager

5301
02:09:58,139 --> 02:09:58,510
i just

5302
02:09:58,520 --> 02:09:58,869
you know

5303
02:09:58,879 --> 02:09:59,889
i couldn't relate to many people

5304
02:09:59,899 --> 02:10:01,570
i just i was like a fucking freaking nature

5305
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:04,869
because no one was obsessed with building businesses or any of this kind of stuff

5306
02:10:04,879 --> 02:10:05,650
and so like

5307
02:10:05,660 --> 02:10:06,190
back then

5308
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:08,050
you know that advice would have been helpful

5309
02:10:08,099 --> 02:10:09,070
maybe not that particular

5310
02:10:09,119 --> 02:10:11,170
but just knowing that there are

5311
02:10:11,180 --> 02:10:11,530
you know

5312
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:12,730
it's not that you're a freaking nature

5313
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:14,650
you just haven't found people that have the same interests

5314
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:18,190
so the task is not to feel sorry for yourself or somehow change yourself

5315
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:20,349
it's more to finally find people you fit in with

5316
02:10:20,359 --> 02:10:20,469
yeah

5317
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:20,710
yeah

5318
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:22,810
assuming which you know

5319
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:23,889
you're not getting comproment

5320
02:10:24,239 --> 02:10:24,489
uh

5321
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:25,030
like

5322
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:25,590
assume

5323
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:26,949
it's not something bad

5324
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:27,310
right

5325
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:27,690
like

5326
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:31,630
if your hobby is shooting things you know or shooting things

5327
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:32,230
you shouldn't be shooting

5328
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:32,830
you know

5329
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:34,210
don't find people that encourage that

5330
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:37,449
but outside of that

5331
02:10:37,459 --> 02:10:37,869
for sure

5332
02:10:37,879 --> 02:10:38,070
uh

5333
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:39,070
actually

5334
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:42,250
as an answer to what is the best advice someone ever gave you

5335
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:44,409
you said you're crazy until you're successful

5336
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:45,790
then you're a genius 100

5337
02:10:46,139 --> 02:10:47,650
all along the way

5338
02:10:47,660 --> 02:10:49,330
people gave me so much

5339
02:10:50,239 --> 02:10:53,650
you know advice on why i shouldn't be doing it

5340
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:54,190
why i'm crazy

5341
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,750
every step of the way

5342
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:58,270
people wanted to tell me why i shouldn't be doing this and should get alive

5343
02:10:58,280 --> 02:10:59,650
should stop being too obsessed

5344
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:00,010
everything

5345
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:01,090
everything under the book

5346
02:11:01,619 --> 02:11:01,869
um

5347
02:11:01,879 --> 02:11:02,290
and then

5348
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:02,710
once i'm successful

5349
02:11:02,820 --> 02:11:03,849
those same people are like tank

5350
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:06,190
you're a genius

5351
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:06,429
wow

5352
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:07,210
you

5353
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:07,389
really

5354
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:08,650
you pulled that off

5355
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:10,570
those are probably the same people that will give you advice

5356
02:11:10,619 --> 02:11:15,310
now you're the most successful video creator of all time

5357
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:17,650
stick to that anytime you want to do something new

5358
02:11:17,699 --> 02:11:17,949
right

5359
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:18,730
yeah

5360
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:19,150
uh

5361
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:19,690
they'll

5362
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:22,929
they'll like pressure you not to do the um

5363
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:24,489
you know

5364
02:11:24,499 --> 02:11:28,330
feastables or or mobile gaming or whatever lays beyond

5365
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:28,630
yeah

5366
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,730
it's funny how people don't well

5367
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:31,210
honestly

5368
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:32,770
they're the type of people i just don't talk to anymore

5369
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:35,530
i don't even know what they have to say now

5370
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:37,510
so most people on the team are like yes

5371
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:38,710
and they're like whatever

5372
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,790
the idea you got

5373
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:39,969
they

5374
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:41,170
they're with it

5375
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:41,349
no

5376
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:42,610
it's weird

5377
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:43,570
we actually have a

5378
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:45,610
my team pushes back on me pretty hardcore

5379
02:11:46,159 --> 02:11:47,650
which i want

5380
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:48,489
i don't want yes man

5381
02:11:48,499 --> 02:11:49,090
and yeah

5382
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:49,210
they're

5383
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:49,810
they're like

5384
02:11:49,860 --> 02:11:50,110
uh

5385
02:11:50,219 --> 02:11:51,310
they're james

5386
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:52,570
you know

5387
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:54,610
the ceo who helped me build all this

5388
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:55,090
um

5389
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:55,690
he's very adamant

5390
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:59,710
like we're not yes men and and he trains people to really think for themselves and even

5391
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:01,270
when i give them orders like really think like

5392
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:01,869
is this optimal

5393
02:12:01,980 --> 02:12:02,830
is there context

5394
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:06,670
or information jimmy could be missing that i can provide that could help him make a more updated decision

5395
02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:07,389
like i'm not

5396
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:08,230
um

5397
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:08,349
god

5398
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,010
you know

5399
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:09,130
what

5400
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:08,230
i mean

5401
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:09,730
like i'm human

5402
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:12,190
i make errors and so don't take what i say

5403
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:12,790
that's the bible

5404
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:14,710
so even

5405
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,369
like in the brainstorming

5406
02:12:15,659 --> 02:12:16,150
and so on

5407
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:16,510
they can

5408
02:12:16,679 --> 02:12:17,409
they can push back

5409
02:12:17,419 --> 02:12:17,590
yeah

5410
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,190
you can see it

5411
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:18,369
like tyler

5412
02:12:18,379 --> 02:12:19,449
anytime i said something

5413
02:12:19,459 --> 02:12:20,770
he would give me feedback and push back

5414
02:12:20,780 --> 02:12:21,489
which is what i want

5415
02:12:21,499 --> 02:12:22,389
i don't want him just to be like

5416
02:12:22,399 --> 02:12:22,510
yes

5417
02:12:22,679 --> 02:12:23,710
you're fucking genius

5418
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:24,489
good job

5419
02:12:24,499 --> 02:12:24,610
jimmy

5420
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:25,810
you know i don't need that

5421
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:26,230
you know

5422
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:26,650
i need negatives

5423
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:28,210
uh

5424
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,389
you talked about being in a relationship

5425
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:32,110
what role

5426
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:34,690
jimmy does love playing the human condition

5427
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:37,090
i think

5428
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:38,170
well

5429
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:38,830
roll this

5430
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:39,070
well

5431
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:41,230
the big thing is love can be scary

5432
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:41,830
because this is

5433
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:42,429
you know

5434
02:12:42,439 --> 02:12:45,130
the human you're gonna spend the most amount of time with in your life

5435
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:45,909
you know

5436
02:12:45,919 --> 02:12:46,150
and so

5437
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:47,469
for projected over 50 years

5438
02:12:47,479 --> 02:12:48,730
they can be a liability or an asset

5439
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:49,690
i love the magic tricks

5440
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:50,469
you know

5441
02:12:50,479 --> 02:12:50,710
i love

5442
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:50,829
no

5443
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:51,429
but seriously

5444
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:54,010
it's got to be someone that makes you better for me

5445
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:56,170
i can't truly love someone that doesn't make me better

5446
02:12:56,180 --> 02:12:56,349
because

5447
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:56,650
yeah

5448
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:57,670
in the long run

5449
02:12:57,680 --> 02:12:57,790
yeah

5450
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:58,090
across

5451
02:12:58,320 --> 02:12:58,570
across

5452
02:12:58,739 --> 02:12:58,989
because

5453
02:12:59,040 --> 02:12:59,530
if not

5454
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:00,790
then it's like it's a negative

5455
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:01,449
you know

5456
02:13:01,459 --> 02:13:03,130
to everything i've spent my life building

5457
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:03,130
yeah

5458
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:03,310
um

5459
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:06,010
but luckily i'm very happy with the

5460
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:07,630
the partner i haven't like we were talking about before

5461
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:09,130
i do think she makes me better

5462
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:10,270
there's a lot of actually positives

5463
02:13:10,619 --> 02:13:11,050
i've noticed

5464
02:13:11,099 --> 02:13:12,429
even things as simple as

5465
02:13:12,439 --> 02:13:12,610
like

5466
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:13,329
you know

5467
02:13:13,339 --> 02:13:14,710
i struggle to turn off my brain at night

5468
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:16,270
because i'm just thinking about all the businesses

5469
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:19,690
and how we could do better or whatever weird thing i have on my mind

5470
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:20,409
but you know

5471
02:13:20,419 --> 02:13:21,190
just chatting with her

5472
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:26,469
and hanging out with her helps me like basically just shut my brain off and like mellow out

5473
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:26,829
and even

5474
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:29,829
like there's just a ton of little things like that that i've noticed are positives

5475
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:33,190
especially when you really look for them that are easy to gloss over

5476
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:33,909
if you're not

5477
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:35,050
um

5478
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:36,670
and so for me

5479
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:36,849
yeah

5480
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:38,889
i have someone who i think it's very beautiful

5481
02:13:38,899 --> 02:13:39,429
very intelligent

5482
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:40,329
makes me better

5483
02:13:40,339 --> 02:13:41,710
it's constantly pushing me

5484
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:42,909
okay with me working hard

5485
02:13:42,919 --> 02:13:43,750
makes me smarter

5486
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:49,989
and just all these different things that i think for me love just makes me a better person

5487
02:13:49,999 --> 02:13:50,770
you know what i mean

5488
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:52,150
which makes me love her even more

5489
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:52,929
does that make sense

5490
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:53,190
absolutely

5491
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:55,449
what advice would you give on

5492
02:13:55,459 --> 02:13:55,630
uh

5493
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:57,010
finding somebody like that

5494
02:13:58,260 --> 02:13:58,510
um

5495
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:01,630
just really don't give up until you

5496
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:03,250
you find someone that you know

5497
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:05,409
there's so many people on the planet

5498
02:14:05,419 --> 02:14:06,550
i mean there really is there

5499
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:10,510
there's billions of the odds are in your favor of yeah

5500
02:14:10,619 --> 02:14:10,869
like

5501
02:14:10,879 --> 02:14:14,650
just don't settle and find someone that you know makes you happy

5502
02:14:17,239 --> 02:14:17,489
yeah

5503
02:14:18,239 --> 02:14:19,030
just like you said

5504
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:22,389
surround yourself with people that make you a better person

5505
02:14:22,399 --> 02:14:23,170
in the same case

5506
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:27,010
surround yourself with that one special person that really makes you a better person and for

5507
02:14:27,179 --> 02:14:28,630
and maybe that's just an entrepreneurial brain

5508
02:14:28,739 --> 02:14:29,349
looking at it

5509
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:31,210
not everyone's to hyper optimize their life like me

5510
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:32,230
but for me to like

5511
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:32,829
truly love someone

5512
02:14:32,839 --> 02:14:35,110
they have to make me a better person in every way

5513
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:35,349
yeah

5514
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:35,530
yeah

5515
02:14:36,540 --> 02:14:36,790
well

5516
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:40,210
what do you hope you're 24. we thought we started talking about death

5517
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:44,110
let's let's finish talking about death what do you hope your legacy is

5518
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:44,889
when you

5519
02:14:44,899 --> 02:14:46,869
when we look a hundred years from now

5520
02:14:46,879 --> 02:14:47,050
and

5521
02:14:47,219 --> 02:14:47,469
yeah

5522
02:14:47,479 --> 02:14:47,710
alien

5523
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:51,969
the ai has completely taken over and the aliens visit and discuss with the ai

5524
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:56,409
what this last of special humans that existed on earth was like

5525
02:14:56,419 --> 02:14:56,590
what

5526
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:58,449
what do you hope they say about you

5527
02:14:59,639 --> 02:14:59,889
um

5528
02:15:08,119 --> 02:15:09,670
it's a deep one

5529
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:12,610
as probably just that

5530
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:14,770
because it's hard

5531
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:15,310
right

5532
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:18,730
like i said before elon is over double my age

5533
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:22,630
i could live every second i've lived up to this point in my life and still have elon's age

5534
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:23,710
so i have so much time

5535
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:27,730
i just hope whatever it is that it's a net positive on the world

5536
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:35,230
and it impacts billions of people in a positive way that makes lasting change

5537
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:38,230
so you admire people like steve jobs

5538
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:42,730
and elon musk for having sort of reached for that goal as well

5539
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:42,909
yeah

5540
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:43,989
of course

5541
02:15:43,999 --> 02:15:45,429
to help to help millions

5542
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:47,770
i mean the iphone's the most successful product ever invented

5543
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:49,929
it's hard not to admire what he created

5544
02:15:49,939 --> 02:15:50,469
you know

5545
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:51,550
um

5546
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:52,090
the same with

5547
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:52,570
sort of

5548
02:15:52,580 --> 02:15:53,829
as johnny ive talks about

5549
02:15:53,839 --> 02:15:54,790
like the

5550
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:59,469
the passion the effort they put into the designing the iphone that

5551
02:16:00,119 --> 02:16:02,949
like little bit of love is transferred to the whole world

5552
02:16:02,959 --> 02:16:04,989
like they get to experience the joy of that from the designer

5553
02:16:05,159 --> 02:16:07,329
it's what a beautiful thing to do

5554
02:16:07,339 --> 02:16:07,750
you know

5555
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:08,829
i mean i couldn't think of anything better

5556
02:16:09,119 --> 02:16:09,969
you know

5557
02:16:09,979 --> 02:16:10,989
to create something that

5558
02:16:11,159 --> 02:16:12,790
even after you're dead for decades

5559
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:16,750
just has such a profound impact on basically half the human population

5560
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:17,050
yeah

5561
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:17,949
it's wild

5562
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,570
brings joy to people

5563
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:19,750
yeah

5564
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:21,010
um

5565
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:21,130
well

5566
02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:22,210
i hope you do just that man

5567
02:16:22,220 --> 02:16:25,210
you've already done it for millions and millions and millions and millions of people

5568
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:26,170
and i hope you keep doing it

5569
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:26,829
i'm ex

5570
02:16:26,839 --> 02:16:27,610
i can't like

5571
02:16:28,199 --> 02:16:31,389
it's so exciting to see what happens this year and next year

5572
02:16:31,399 --> 02:16:32,230
i know

5573
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:33,609
like this is the limit

5574
02:16:33,619 --> 02:16:33,728
yeah

5575
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:34,750
i can't

5576
02:16:34,978 --> 02:16:35,709
i mean

5577
02:16:35,719 --> 02:16:35,830
uh

5578
02:16:36,359 --> 02:16:37,269
the videos

5579
02:16:37,279 --> 02:16:38,530
but ever all the other businesses

5580
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:39,670
you're in and you

5581
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:40,330
as a human being

5582
02:16:40,340 --> 02:16:40,870
as you grow

5583
02:16:40,879 --> 02:16:42,189

as everyone knows

5586

you have a kind heart and the fact that you're really damn good at
