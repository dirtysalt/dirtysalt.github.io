1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,585
You spend more on medical R&D than Germany does.

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:03,962
Yeah, we're at the nation state level.

3
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,839
It'll be, yeah, $14 billion this year.

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,090
Can you imagine this?

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,216
Like, we go to a restaurant tonight

6
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,677
and a bottle of, like, a hundred dollar Napa Cabernet

7
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,762
is like $14,000.

8
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,556
But then the waiter says, "Don't worry,

9
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,765
that's not your copay."

10
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:16,599
Yeah.

11
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,686
I have like at least one or two AIs running

12
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,271
every minute of every meeting I'm in

13
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,565
and I just am asking it science questions.

14
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,733
Which one do you use for science?

15
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,945
Either Claude or the xAI.

16
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,656
What would you guess the average caloric consumption

17
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,158
per day in America is?

18
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,284
3,600 calories.

19
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,535
Yeah.

20
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,369
Isn't that incredible?

21
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,412
I'm the 11th CEO of the company.

22
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,331
That's one less than popes in that period of time.

23
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,462
Where did you learn to pour?

24
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,255
I actually learned in Ireland.

25
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,465
Okay, do you want me to leave it down?

26
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,258
You're the expert here.

27
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,218
Okay, oscillate this way.

28
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,595
That's an excellent pint.

29
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,763
Yeah.

30
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,681
Dave Ricks is CEO of Eli Lilly,

31
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,308
which is now a $700 billion company

32
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,810
and the world's most valuable pharma company.

33
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,520
Eli Lilly is 150 years old.

34
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,646
They grew up as the first company

35
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,066
to mass produce insulin in the 20th century.

36
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,443
But today most of the company's business

37
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,738
is in the new GLP-1 diabetes and weight loss drugs

38
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,406
where they've become the market leader.

39
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,451
Simultaneously, Eli Lilly is upending the traditional model

40
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,828
by selling directly to their consumers over the internet

41
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,871
with LillyDirect

42
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,956
rather than through the traditional middleman.

43
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,041
All right, cheers.

44
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,875
Cheers. Cheers.

45
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,709
Thanks for coming.

46
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,128
Good to be here. I'm very impressed

47
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,004
that you came and you just poured

48
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,131
your own pint. Poured my own pint, yeah.

49
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,716
Major flex. Have glass, will pour.

50
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,426
Exactly. Well, actually a good place to start.

51
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,096
Tell us about your NVIDIA announcement that you just had.

52
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,765
Yeah, so today at the, what's it called,

53
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,767
GTC conference they have,

54
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,852
they unveiled that we're well underway,

55
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,145
actually it should be done by the end of the year,

56
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,565
but building a supercomputer on-prem for us

57
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:51,027
really just to run proprietary drug discovery models.

58
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,278
We think it's the biggest

59
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,407
biologically-focused supercomputer there is.

60
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,368
And certainly the biggest pharma's done

61
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,579
with B300s, the latest chip set.

62
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,207
And, yeah, we're only constrained by power,

63
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,291
like everyone else.

64
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,460
But, yeah, we've built a bunch of tools,

65
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,877
we'll run them on that,

66
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:13,299
and scientists use it to sort of co-invent, co-develop.

67
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,926
Focus mostly on chemistry to begin with,

68
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,302
but we'll expand from there.

69
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,722
And so is the idea here you have some target,

70
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,184
you've had some challenges actually drugging it,

71
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,187
and so you give it to one of these new chemistry models

72
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,023
and you ask it whether it can come up with something

73
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,650
totally orthogonal beyond what—

74
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,901
Correct, yeah. A human might have tried.

75
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:35,113
So take a really good popular example

76
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,198
is like GLP-1.

77
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,660
So that's a hormone peptide that we all excrete.

78
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,080
It engages targets that are what we call

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,665
G protein-coupled receptors.

80
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,669
So they're hard to drug targets on the outside of cells.

81
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,630
And to try to mimic a big huge protein

82
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,674
with a very small chemical

83
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,718
is a complicated undertaking.

84
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,178
And by the way, do only that

85
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,471
and not other things that are untoward.

86
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,433
And so this is sort of a frontier of drug discovery

87
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,685
that's been tough and very empirical.

88
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,229
That's a hot area for this kind of technology

89
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,649
because these strange arrangements of atoms

90
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,319
don't look like other drugs that have come before,

91
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,571
but they do follow the principles of organic chemistry

92
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,115
and seem to engage these targets effectively.

93
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,283
I don't know of one

94
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,494
that's come through the machine-driven discovery process,

95
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,079
which is really machine plus human,

96
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,289
that's made it to the clinic yet,

97
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,665
but they're coming.

98
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,334
And I think that's exciting

99
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,294
because those have been structures that are,

100
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,296
they don't exist in nature,

101
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,591
and yet the machines are alien

102
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,886
and they can predict these interactions.

103
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,806
I'm always struck by Derek Lowe's arguments

104
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:48,228
where he's always sounding this note of caution I guess

105
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,772
about the optimism

106
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,608
and maybe what he might view as boosterism

107
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,276
around AI and biomedicine

108
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,862
where, as I see at least, his two claims

109
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,115
are, one, it's really hard to select the targets

110
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,617
and AI doesn't help you that much there.

111
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,451
No.

112
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,996
And then so much fails at, like, human toxicity.

113
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,665
And again, at least so far,

114
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,501
AI has not been all that helpful at that step.

115
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,169
Yes. Do you agree with him

116
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,798
or is he overrating, you know, these particular challenges

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,509
and maybe underrating the challenges that AI does help solve

118
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,802
or, you know, thoughts on that argument?

119
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,681
Probably we need to create the equivalent

120
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,474
of what got created with human language,

121
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,645
which is a more complete repository of biological knowledge

122
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,021
to train against

123
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,816
before the machines get a lot better.

124
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,818
And today, I don't know, I would estimate

125
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,071
we might know 10%-15% of human biology.

126
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,864
So the machine's not going to be good at all

127
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,159
until we get way above 50%.

128
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,452
That probably requires,

129
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,747
you know, robotic 24/7 experiments

130
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,332
just to create training data sets

131
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,460
and, you know, sort of this kind of big lift effort.

132
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,921
The kind of thing actually NIH should be doing right now,

133
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,214
I would think.

134
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,175
But that effort's not ongoing, at least in our country.

135
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,886
But I think if that gets going, I think we'll know more

136
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,556
and the machines get better at the harder big problems,

137
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,433
system prediction.

138
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,768
Patrick and I did not,

139
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,228
well, just didn't finish any college.

140
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,564
So not only don't have a, you know, formal training

141
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,398
in computer science,

142
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,858
but don't have formal training in anything.

143
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:21,070
You did not come up through the science side of Eli Lilly,

144
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,114
but you seem extremely comfortable with the science.

145
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,242
What has been your method for ingesting all this stuff,

146
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,785
like, and especially as you're essentially

147
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,454
making science decisions at the end of the day

148
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,622
with the top-level capital allocation decisions?

149
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,042
Just how do you learn? No, that's right.

150
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,710
I think we probably make three or four

151
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,836
important decisions a year

152
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,046
and they're all science.

153
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,255
I don't know. Stay curious.

154
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,381
Mm-hm. Read.

155
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,215
Read what?

156
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,675
I read a lot of medical journals.

157
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,594
I go to conferences where data is presented.

158
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,304
I spend time with our scientists.

159
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,138
Stay curious.

160
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,014
Yeah. Yeah.

161
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,976
Now I have like at least one or two AIs running

162
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,436
every minute of every meeting I'm in

163
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,730
and I just am asking it science questions.

164
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,900
So you found for your learning ChatGPT or whatever your—

165
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,276
I don't use that one for science.

166
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,070
ChatGPT's too verbal. Wait, so which one

167
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,738
do you use for science?

168
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,367
I tend to use either Claude

169
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,745
or the xAI one.

170
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,288
I find it more terse

171
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,707
and the references actually check out more often.

172
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,459
Sometimes the AIs produce references

173
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,878
and they're actually not the thing that it said

174
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,506
and that takes too much work to go cross reference.

175
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,467
So for an autodidact, presumably the emergence of LLMs

176
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,594
has been transformative for you.

177
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,179
Yeah, well, I think for learning,

178
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,889
that's a whole nother topic we could talk about,

179
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,391
but you have to sort of question

180
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,436
the, like, pedagogical kind of method period.

181
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,146
If you can just learn continuously—

182
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,980
It's mastery learning for everyone.

183
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,981
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

184
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:39,899
So you take advantage of that.

185
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,858
But, you know, early in my career,

186
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,027
I started in our business development M&A group

187
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,278
and I spent my whole time with scientists

188
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,865
looking at little companies and projects in other companies

189
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,451
and trying to understand what they were worth.

190
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,120
Well, then you have to understand what they do

191
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,871
and, you know, I found that part of the industry,

192
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,249
I didn't expect that when I came to Lilly.

193
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,418
I came to the company accidentally by the way.

194
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,002
But when I found that, I was like, "Wow."

195
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:00,837
I loved it.

196
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,004
This is so interesting.

197
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,423
And then I had a moment

198
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,591
where one of the projects I worked on

199
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,301
became a medicine in the US

200
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,762
and my mother was diagnosed with a condition

201
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,930
and she got put on it.

202
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,975
And so then that's the magic.

203
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,477
It's like, okay, you can work on things that change people,

204
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,521
but the people you care about, that's—

205
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,355
You saw the full

206
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,606
end-to-end impact. That's what purpose is.

207
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,441
Yeah, exactly.

208
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,151
From lab, exactly.

209
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:23,985
So special.

210
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,027
Your four big decisions a year

211
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,779
that are kind of grounded in science,

212
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,283
how quantitative versus qualitative do these end up being?

213
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,410
Are you Rick Rubin, where it's all taste based

214
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,454
and you just like the feel of this direction?

215
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,998
Or are you Billy Beane where it's a "Moneyball" type,

216
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,667
you know, the ROI pencils and—

217
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,920
I think the system does a lot of the Billy Beane.

218
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,506
I think that's a change at Lilly

219
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,841
that's made us more successful.

220
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,011
I think we've actually put together a decision process

221
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,055
that's quite a bit more rigorous than it used to be

222
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,933
and that leads to fewer bad decisions.

223
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:56,767
That's good.

224
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,645
So that's sort of like the bumpers on the bowling alley

225
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,521
that you put up.

226
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,107
But then within that,

227
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,194
whether it's a strike or a single pin,

228
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,071
that's a little bit of the judgment and taste.

229
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,656
And there, though, you know, wisdom of crowds,

230
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,408
I think we have a great leadership team

231
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,995
and we all come with equal voice and sort of debate.

232
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,414
We actually have a rule to like never decide in one meeting.

233
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,415
So you're asking about the day,

234
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,459
but we, like, come back to it,

235
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,752
think about what others said

236
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,795
and kind of push it again.

237
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,380
And are you deciding?

238
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,256
Ultimately yes.

239
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,966
Nothing happens unless I say go,

240
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,928
and if I don't like it, then it definitely doesn't go.

241
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,971
But people will often persuade me

242
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,640
and I definitely change my mind.

243
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,933
And some of these are projects within the company.

244
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,936
So what's the structure of the industry?

245
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,438
We have huge expenditures on R&D,

246
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,856
I think more than any other sector,

247
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,857
as a percent of revenue,

248
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,735
we'll spend almost 25% of sales this year.

249
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,819
I like your way— On R&D.

250
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,987
I like your way of putting it

251
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,032
that you spend more on medical R&D than Germany does.

252
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,034
Yes, yeah, we're at the nation state level.

253
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,411
It'll be, yeah, $14 billion this year.

254
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,329
Total NIH,

255
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,415
which is the biggest thing on earth that spends money,

256
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,583
is 40.

257
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,544
So that's— It's up there.

258
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,670
It's getting close, yeah.

259
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,505
But some of those are projects

260
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,381
we've been working on it for a while

261
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,382
and now we have a data set,

262
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,717
now we need to make a decision to go to the final stage.

263
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,010
The final stage of testing,

264
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,846
the average drug costs $3.5-4 billion to make.

265
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,974
More than 60% of that is the last step.

266
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,268
So that call is the big one.

267
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,520
The earlier ones of, like, go forward,

268
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,981
okay, it's a lot of small things that add up.

269
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,774
You can waste a lot of money if you do that poorly,

270
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,860
but, you know, there's a portfolio, so that's unlikely.

271
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,322
But usually we're carrying five to 10 projects

272
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,157
in the latest phase and those are—

273
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,909
And so you're saying like the phase III trial—

274
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,452
Phase III, exactly. That's the question.

275
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,787
Yeah, that's the question.

276
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,622
What to test it in, how to test it,

277
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,582
what's the design of that,

278
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,543
go,/no-go, against that criteria.

279
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,964
And that stage, yeah, is going to be burning

280
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,925
a billion plus a year.

281
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,427
So it's a big investment.

282
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,261
Per program.

283
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,930
Yeah, and, of course, the returns

284
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,640
on most drugs that make it through that

285
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,601
are not positive.

286
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,936
So it's not just can you get through that,

287
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,938
but will you produce something useful enough

288
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,773
to create excess value for society

289
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,108
but also the company

290
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,943
to keep the whole thing running?

291
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,986
That's the exercise.

292
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,072
Okay, so to this point, the dynamics

293
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,450
and the funding of clinical trials determine

294
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,245
so much of the portfolio dynamics for you.

295
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,288
I think anyone who comes across

296
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:27,293
these clinical trial figures and mechanics asks themselves,

297
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,210
"Why?" How could this be?

298
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,337
Yes.

299
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,213
So I looked at— It's a great question.

300
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,089
I looked at the numbers.

301
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:37,053
So apparently the median clinical trial enrollee,

302
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,679
it now costs $40,000.

303
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,058
You know, the median US wage is $60,000.

304
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,934
So we're talking two thirds.

305
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:48,898
Why and why couldn't it be a 10th or a hundredth

306
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,107
of what it is?

307
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,692
Yeah, brilliant question,

308
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,236
and one we've spent a lot of time working on.

309
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,154
We've done a lot of things

310
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,864
to improve the drug development process.

311
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,115
So taking a systems approach.

312
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,492
And I think one of the reasons

313
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,245
Lilly has probably the highest return on investment in R&D

314
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,664
in the industry

315
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,250
is because not the picking of winners and losers,

316
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,420
but actually the process by which we run it.

317
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,382
I think that's at least as valuable as what we've done.

318
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,216
And we can come back to that if you want.

319
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,468
But the piece we've really not moved

320
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:21,097
is the enrollment of clinical trials,

321
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,849
this is going to sound super arcane when I go through it,

322
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,519
and the cost, which is escalating about 7%-8%

323
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,271
over the last decade.

324
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,148
That's about the same as the healthcare system.

325
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,525
And that's not an accident.

326
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,611
When people go, "Why does a trial cost so much?"

327
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,239
Well, we're taking the sickest slice

328
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,450
of the healthcare system that are costing the most

329
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,119
and we're ingesting them,

330
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,412
we're taking them out of the healthcare system

331
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,996
and putting them in a clinical trial.

332
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,707
Typically we pay for all care.

333
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,875
So we are literally running the healthcare system

334
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,086
for those individuals.

335
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,881
And that is, in some ways,

336
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,091
for control,

337
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,926
because you want to have the best standard of care,

338
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,262
so your experiment is properly conducted

339
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,763
and it's not just left to the whims

340
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,807
of hundreds of individual doctors

341
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,976
and people in Ireland versus the US

342
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,561
getting different background therapies.

343
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,355
So you standardize that, that costs money

344
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,274
because you're sort of leveling up a lot of things.

345
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,861
But then also, in some ways,

346
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,363
you're paying a premium

347
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,324
to both get the treating physicians

348
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,995
and having a great care to get the patient.

349
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,496
We don't offer them remuneration,

350
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,956
but they get great care,

351
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,125
an inducement to be in the study

352
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,794
because you're subjecting yourself quite often,

353
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,628
not all the case,

354
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,173
but to something other than the standard of care,

355
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,133
either placebo or this,

356
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,551
or in more specialized care,

357
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,262
often it's standard care plus X

358
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,264
where X could actually be doing harm, not good.

359
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,225
So people have to go into that in a blinded way.

360
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,395
And I guess the consideration is you'll get the best care.

361
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,607
Of the $40,000, how much of that should I look at

362
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,067
as inducement and encouragement for the patient

363
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,360
and how much should I look at it

364
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,571
as the cost of doing things

365
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,198
given the regulatory apparatus that exists?

366
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,492
The patient part is like the level up part

367
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,287
and I would say 20%-30% of the cost of studies

368
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,705
typically would be this.

369
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,374
So you're buying the best standard of care.

370
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,210
You're not getting something less.

371
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,377
That's medicine costs,

372
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,838
you're getting more testing, you're getting more visits.

373
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,133
And then there is a premium that goes to institutions,

374
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,803
not usually to the physician, the institution,

375
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,222
to pay for the time of everybody involved in it

376
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,807
plus something.

377
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,892
We read a lot about it in the NIH cuts,

378
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,103
the 60% Harvard markup or whatever.

379
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,272
There's something like that in all clinical trials too.

380
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,775
Overhead, coverage, whatnot.

381
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,361
But it's paying for things that aren't in the trial.

382
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,780
US healthcare is famously the most expensive in the world.

383
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,781
Yes. Do you run trials

384
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,657
outside the US?

385
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,575
Yeah, actually most.

386
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,618
Most of it, yeah. So, yeah.

387
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,037
I mean, we want to actually do more in the US.

388
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,748
This is a problem, I think, for our country.

389
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,542
Like, take cancer care where you think,

390
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,377
"Okay, what's the one thing

391
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,962
the US system is really good at?"

392
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,880
Like if I had cancer, I'd come to the US.

393
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,298
That's definitely true.

394
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,676
But only 4% of patients who have cancer in the US

395
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,344
are in clinical trials,

396
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,889
whereas in Spain and Australia, it's over 25%.

397
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,726
And some of that is because they've optimized the system

398
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,937
so it's easier to run and then enroll,

399
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,940
which I'd like to get to, people in the trials.

400
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,651
But some of it is also that the background of care

401
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,485
isn't as good.

402
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,155
So that level up inducement is better for the patient

403
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:25,990
and the physician.

404
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,324
Here, the standard's pretty good.

405
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,743
So people are like, "Meh, do I want to do something

406
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,204
where there's extra visits and travel time?"

407
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,789
There's another problem in the US,

408
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,333
which is we have really good standards of care

409
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,961
but also quite different performing systems

410
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,796
and we often want to place our trials

411
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,090
in the best performing systems that are famous,

412
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,759
like MD Anderson or the Brigham,

413
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,220
and those are the most congested with trials

414
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,180
and therefore they're the slowest and most expensive.

415
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,559
So there's a bit of a competition for place

416
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,476
that goes on as well.

417
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,228
But, overall, I would say,

418
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,814
like, in our diabetes and cardiovascular trials,

419
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,483
many, many more patients are in our trials

420
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,110
outside the US than in

421
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,239
and that really shouldn't be other than cost of the system,

422
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,533
and to some degree, the tuning of the system,

423
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,327
like I mentioned with Spain and Australia,

424
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,912
toward doing more clinical trials.

425
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,414
For instance, like, here in the US,

426
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,667
everywhere, you get ethics clearance, we call IRB.

427
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,669
The US has a decentralized system,

428
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,672
so you have to go to every system you're doing a study in.

429
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,050
Some countries, like Australia, have a single system.

430
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,760
So you just have one stop

431
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,054
and then the whole country is available to recruit,

432
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,388
those types of things.

433
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,973
You said you want to talk about enrollment?

434
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,058
Yeah, yeah, it's fascinating.

435
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,852
So drug development time in the industry

436
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,562
is about 10 years in the clinic,

437
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,939
a little less right now.

438
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,982
We're running a little less than seven at Lilly.

439
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,109
So that's the optimization I spoke about.

440
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,781
But actually, half of that seven is we have a protocol open.

441
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,200
That means it's an experiment we want to run.

442
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,409
We have sites trained,

443
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,453
they're waiting for patients to walk in their door

444
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,622
and to propose, "Would you like to be in the study,"

445
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,499
but we don't have enough people in the study.

446
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,127
So you're in the serial process, diffuse serial process,

447
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,337
waiting for people to show up

448
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,756
and you think, "Wow, that seems like

449
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,299
we could do better than that.

450
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,969
If Taylor Swift can sell out a concert in a few seconds,

451
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
why can't I fill an Alzheimer's study?

452
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,555
There seem to be lots of patients."

453
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,849
But that's healthcare.

454
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,601
It's very tough.

455
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,645
We've done some interesting things recently

456
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,479
to work around that.

457
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,983
One thing that's an idea that partially works now

458
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,110
is culling existing databases

459
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,611
and contacting patients.

460
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,737
Proactive outreach. Right,

461
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,365
where you have, like, their lab values from,

462
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,616
where before there wasn't a treatment,

463
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,826
now there is one being studied,

464
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,868
would you like to be a part of it?

465
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,911
That's something we're doing now

466
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,788
with our Lp program.

467
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,164
That's a cholesterol subtype

468
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,541
where there was nothing to do about it.

469
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,210
A lot of people have had it tested and it's high.

470
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,378
You could say, "Hey, you're high.

471
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,504
Would you like to do something now?"

472
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,673
But it's still a lot to be done there

473
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,384
and the data that's sitting in electronic health records

474
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,218
in our country

475
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,636
is very poorly organized.

476
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,305
So it would be good to optimize that.

477
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,098
I think the other

478
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,058
is actually just go directly to the patients.

479
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,226
So who has the most interest?

480
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,602
It's usually the patient.

481
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,771
And then physicians and their institution

482
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,814
may not be in the trial

483
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,815
or they might not be interested

484
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,900
in spending much time on this and people—

485
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,901
That's kind of what I want.

486
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,113
I want to get an email, as you say,

487
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:14,950
you know, the system knows, you know, my health data

488
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,660
and what conditions I have and so forth,

489
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,204
and be told that a package will be arriving tomorrow

490
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:21,040
with a drug.

491
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,790
I can take the drug if I want to,

492
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,916
if I want to participate in this trial.

493
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,127
You can include whatever disclosures.

494
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,963
And, you know, some nice person

495
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,631
will come every month or whatever and take—

496
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,507
Or just telephonically visit you.

497
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,342
Yeah. Take my vitals, exactly,

498
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,303
and measure my blood pressure and what have you.

499
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,971
Are all these intermediaries in the systems

500
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,849
in, you know, the hospitals and so forth,

501
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,350
are they required intrinsically

502
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,685
for the kinds of trials you want to run?

503
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,312
Obviously varies a little bit on the condition or the drug.

504
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,271
Depends on the disease.

505
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,397
Yeah, yeah. Right, right.

506
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,316
Well, I guess, yeah, so how much of it

507
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,776
is there in fact intrinsically required

508
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,986
given, you know, the characteristics of the condition

509
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,198
and how much is it this is how things are done?

510
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,116
Yeah, what you described is actually a great vision

511
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,159
for where we want to go.

512
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,037
We've executed one of these at scale,

513
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:00,954
which is fully enrolled,

514
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,123
which was our Alzheimer's prevention study.

515
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,583
It's a more complicated medicine.

516
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,043
It's an infused medicine.

517
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,338
But we ran this with one investigator in the United States

518
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,549
and we screened over 80,000 people.

519
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,301
By the way, it's the fastest accrued

520
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,761
Alzheimer's study in history,

521
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,054
even though it's pre-Alzheimer's.

522
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,057
It's people with the amyloid precursor protein,

523
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,642
but not dementia.

524
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,018
It's fully enrolled.

525
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:23,852
We've treated people,

526
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,020
actually no one's left on treatment.

527
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,063
We're just watching them now,

528
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,898
because the treatment's a nine-month course

529
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,816
to deplete amyloid

530
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,110
and see if that can prevent the symptoms.

531
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,070
So that was a very successful trial.

532
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,904
Just what you said.

533
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,406
They got instructions to be in the study.

534
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,699
There was a televisit.

535
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,744
They got some diagnostic tests, blood-based,

536
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,620
that went in and said,

537
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,997
"Okay, this is sort of an indicator

538
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:44,915
you might have high amyloid,"

539
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,459
then you can go to get a PET scan, and if that was positive,

540
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,169
you could be enrolled in the study.

541
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,003
Pretty successful.

542
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,171
So we'd like to replicate that.

543
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,550
I think one very interesting thing in the future of medicine

544
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,636
is that I think we will have a lot more

545
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,596
preventative medicines in the future.

546
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,723
And I think this type of study in particular

547
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,433
is well suited to prevention

548
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,061
because you have sort of the people

549
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,729
who are worried about their wellness,

550
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,981
so they're motivated.

551
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,815
They have means.

552
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,983
They're in the middle of their life.

553
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,067
They're working.

554
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,528
They don't have complications of comorbidities and so forth.

555
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,029
They want to be in the study,

556
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,823
and I think they would like to prevent

557
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,658
terrible conditions like Alzheimer's.

558
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,287
So that's an exciting new chapter we can push.

559
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,788
So you know Paul Janssen?

560
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,081
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

561
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:26,915
So-

562
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,208
Explain who Paul Janssen is. Come on.

563
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,585
Paul Janssen, as I understand it,

564
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,754
was behind the discovery, invention, what have you,

565
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,257
of more medications than any other single—

566
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,633
I think a Belgian guy.

567
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,885
Yeah, exactly, yes, yes.

568
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,428
I think it's— Who invented a number of—

569
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,973
79 or 80 approved— The MVP of medicine.

570
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,975
Michael Jordan of the NIH. Beyond MVP.

571
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:45,976
Yes.

572
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,227
Okay, so amazing guy.

573
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,605
When some outsider comes

574
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,774
to the clinical trial process and system

575
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,985
and just the development pipeline overall,

576
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,238
maybe they naively think, "Wow, this seems so torturous,

577
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,824
so expensive, so bureaucratic," what have you.

578
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,658
But that's how it's gotta be.

579
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,618
But that's how it's gotta be.

580
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,622
You know, or if they think it can be otherwise,

581
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,956
you might think that they're naive, right?

582
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,834
There's a video interview with Janssen from,

583
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,668
I think it's from the '90s,

584
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,586
it's from, you know, quite a while ago,

585
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,629
I mean, he's dead now,

586
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,382
where he's recounting the history of his career.

587
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,926
He started the company in 1953.

588
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,955
We could go go back to doing it the way we used to

589
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,789
and it's kind of a,

590
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,834
it's a societal choice to make it so bureaucratic.

591
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,004
I guess it's an explicit and implicit one.

592
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:41,508
The explicit part is through time, there have been accidents

593
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,968
and nothing is perfect.

594
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:47,097
We probably have 2,000 manmade approved medicines

595
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,975
versus natural products or vitamins or other things

596
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,812
and maybe 400 unique mechanisms.

597
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,355
So there's clustering.

598
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,567
Within those, there have been problems

599
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,776
and there's also been problems

600
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,361
that turned out not to be problems.

601
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,989
And so our detection ability is flawed.

602
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,242
Because of that, I think each time that occurs,

603
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,578
there was intervention in the system,

604
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,830
which is sort of a global consensus,

605
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,373
but mostly the developed economies

606
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,791
kind of harmonize their systems

607
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,335
either directly or indirectly

608
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,296
to say, "Oh, no, let's require more information

609
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,465
or rebalance the risk-benefit."

610
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,591
We've had this ratchet.

611
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,508
Have we gone too far?

612
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,677
I think that it's a function

613
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,596
of what the technology is at the moment.

614
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,432
And I think in past times, yes.

615
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,435
You can take the 2000s in the US

616
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,522
where there were two big controversial drug approvals

617
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,941
that were later retracted,

618
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,444
the Vioxx situation with Merck

619
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,112
and then Avastin from GSK.

620
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,240
These were both drugs that were for different uses,

621
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,283
pain and diabetes,

622
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,995
but through a detection requirement that the agencies,

623
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,705
because now we have electronic records,

624
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,998
we can look at things,

625
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,418
picked up what they thought was a trace of risk for both,

626
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,003
cardiovascular risks,

627
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,631
and intervened with labeling and escalation

628
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,050
until finally both companies actually removed the products

629
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,176
from the market,

630
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,679
withstood billions of dollars in product liability suits,

631
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,682
only to find later under a different analysis

632
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,976
that there was nothing to be seen there.

633
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,811
Both of them.

634
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,689
And I think there's like an ascertainment bias problem

635
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,982
with these studies.

636
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,068
There's also who was looking at this data.

637
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,905
But that caused a 10-year chill in drug development.

638
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,116
And the Avandia one we know well,

639
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,200
we work in diabetes,

640
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,493
actually caused a policy change.

641
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,327
And the policy change

642
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,747
was you must rule out cardiovascular risk

643
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,124
prior to market entry.

644
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,876
And as you may know, some conditions like diabetes

645
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,796
have a more continuous variable you're measuring

646
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,091
and so studies can be short and cheaper, glucose levels.

647
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,260
Other studies like cardiovascular event studies

648
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,678
are not a continuous variable,

649
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,012
it's a binary variable,

650
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,391
and you have to wait for natural history to occur

651
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,475
to pile up enough variables

652
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,644
to have a statistical difference.

653
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,272
Those are four to five-year undertakings.

654
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,316
So there, you just bought four or five years of extra time

655
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,402
before you could get any new diabetes medication.

656
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,572
We got better at doing them, but that was expensive.

657
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,614
Now, has that...

658
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,782
That's the explicit.

659
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,201
The implicit is the regulatory problem.

660
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,536
There must be a name for this problem

661
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,704
some smart person's given it,

662
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,039
but regulatories are added but never taken away.

663
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,959
So the regulation is still there.

664
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,627
Now, by happy accident,

665
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,129
we are all now really pleased

666
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,882
with, like, incretins like our tirzepatide to run them

667
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,633
because they frequently demonstrate

668
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,844
massive benefit on cardiovascular

669
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,805
and, in some ways, it creates a barrier to entry

670
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,975
for the next low-cost Chinese program or whatever

671
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,643
'cause it's this big expensive thing you have to—

672
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,936
As with many regulatory—

673
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,605
Yeah, exactly. Right.

674
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,981
So is it right?

675
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,025
No, we're imperfect as people

676
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,652
and certainly as decision-makers at a collective level.

677
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:52,657
I would also say the technology for seeing early signals

678
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:57,162
has changed and improved, including computer technology,

679
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,831
and it's probably worth a reassessment.

680
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,333
Paying for prevention, you were going to ask.

681
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,667
Yeah, let's talk about that

682
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:07,547
because say with, you know, GLPs in the weight loss context,

683
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,011
they economically pay off over a very long time horizon,

684
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,888
but if you're looking at a short time horizon

685
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,307
of an insurer or an employer, they don't necessarily,

686
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,726
and so that's created this challenge for reimbursement

687
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,436
where, you know, not as many people

688
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,063
reimburse GLPs for weight loss

689
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,606
as you think would be rational.

690
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,440
Yep.

691
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,735
That just will always be the case with prevention.

692
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,112
And so how do you actually develop drugs

693
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:34,574
that are commercializable and reimbursable?

694
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,076
Yeah, well, in the obesity case,

695
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,328
I'll take a little bit issue with your first assertion

696
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,664
and then add two other problems.

697
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,041
The data actually is becoming more clear

698
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,918
that within actually a two-year timeframe,

699
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,628
and I hope at Stripe, you reimburse these medicines

700
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,880
for your patients, or for your employees.

701
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,714
Within two years,

702
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,175
you can break even basically on total medical costs.

703
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,635
So there's this group called ICER,

704
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,595
which is funded by someone who hates our industry

705
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,846
and the insurance companies,

706
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,682
and they analyze all new drugs

707
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,268
and usually seeking to prove that they're not worth it.

708
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,686
That's sort of their mission in life.

709
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,604
They just analyzed our medicine,

710
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,147
tirzepatide and semaglutide,

711
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,233
and they said, "Actually, they're both cost effective

712
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,651
at current pricing."

713
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,487
In fact, Zepbound, or tirzepatide, was,

714
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,321
the threshold they have

715
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,575
is to save a hundred thousand dollars per person per year

716
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,910
in downstream health costs,

717
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,954
and it was twice as effective as that

718
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,788
at the current pricing.

719
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,622
And the current pricing isn't going to stay,

720
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,957
let's be honest.

721
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,083
There'll be more competition.

722
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,043
The government wants to lower our prices.

723
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,879
So, you know, I think we're in a good place there.

724
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,423
Now, the two other problems

725
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,677
are there's sort of this incumbency problem in healthcare,

726
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,971
like many things, but particularly in healthcare,

727
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,308
where the last thing in is scrutinized the most

728
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:45,103
and the base stack of services and products we use

729
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,771
is never revisited.

730
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,773
It becomes standard of care.

731
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,693
But displacing that in most therapeutic spaces

732
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,861
and in the healthcare system in general

733
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,695
is extremely difficult.

734
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,405
I think we suffer from that here.

735
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:59,075
If the first medicine we had to treat metabolic conditions

736
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,995
was tirzepatide in 1972,

737
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,997
I have no doubt it would be reimbursed everywhere

738
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,041
and broadly used in the system.

739
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,626
But they get the ratcheting effects.

740
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,127
But then you're just stacking on top of it

741
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,546
and it's difficult to remove benefits,

742
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,506
it's easy to deny new ones,

743
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,342
and that's true in government-funded systems

744
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,802
but also, you know, big insurers.

745
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,180
I think the other thing that's going on with this one

746
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,849
and why we're spending so much energy

747
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,101
exploring, you know, real indications

748
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,729
for comorbid diseases that go with obesity,

749
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,648
which is so far pretty successful,

750
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,025
is that the idea of just treating someone

751
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:36,696
who's overweight or obese without any other illness,

752
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,491
to many people I think exposes a bias we have

753
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,242
about that particular condition.

754
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,411
That if it wasn't something you could see,

755
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,829
you might not have.

756
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,873
But I think we are conditioned

757
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,667
to think of someone who's overweight

758
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,502
as someone who's not disciplined.

759
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,629
The data does not show that actually.

760
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:56,257
Like our ancestors roaming the plains of whatever,

761
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,550
the tundra of Ireland,

762
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,221
walking across the ice bridge from Norway,

763
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,391
were in a background of starvation

764
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,726
and there are very few humans on earth

765
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,687
that have a genetic background

766
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,439
that has any limit on food consumption.

767
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,315
It's irrational.

768
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,942
It's a wasted piece of code.

769
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,485
It did no good.

770
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,695
Now, today, in today's environment,

771
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,697
we're in the flip, the complete flip,

772
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,074
especially here in the US,

773
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,243
where there's food everywhere we walk.

774
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,369
I came across your stat,

775
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,122
what would you guess the average caloric consumption

776
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,957
per day in America is?

777
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,583
3,600 calories.

778
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,418
Yeah.

779
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,502
Yeah. Isn't that incredible?

780
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,336
Yeah, that's a really incredible.

781
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,212
And here's an interesting stat.

782
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,172
When you're on our medicine,

783
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,384
how many fewer calories do you consume on average?

784
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,511
On one of the GLP-1s? Yeah.

785
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,179
You don't need to swing it that much

786
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,013
to cause meaningful—

787
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,014
800 calories a day.

788
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,849
Oh my God. 800?

789
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,142
Which is almost a meal.

790
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,351
Yeah. If you go pull up

791
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,477
to In-N-Out Burger—

792
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,895
That's second breakfast right there.

793
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,605
It's second breakfast. Exactly.

794
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,524
So that's why people lose weight so successfully.

795
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,900
No wonder all the food companies are so worried.

796
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,985
And the trick, yeah, yeah.

797
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,653
And the trick is people lose the weight

798
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,780
and they don't feel miserable, right?

799
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,283
So here's the thing about being obese is people,

800
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,160
when you start to gain a little bit of weight,

801
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,454
your set point sort of readjusts.

802
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,748
This is the missing code we have.

803
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,793
And there's only one direction, which is up is better.

804
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,961
And the more up you have

805
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,838
actually the more hunger it creates.

806
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,674
Hyperinsulinemia, which is a hunger-stimulating hormone.

807
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,384
And it sort of starts to overwhelm

808
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,719
the counterregulatory system,

809
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,805
which is incretins, GLP-1, GIP,

810
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,141
the ones we are making medicines around,

811
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,770
and you're out of balance and there's no going back.

812
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,898
And interestingly, even when people lose weight,

813
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,400
that balance still seems to be off,

814
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,320
which is why if you've ever gone on a crash diet,

815
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,822
you feel like shit constantly.

816
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,782
You want to hurt people.

817
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,158
You're angry.

818
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,744
And on these medicines, that doesn't happen.

819
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,703
Yes.

820
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,996
Which is the miracle.

821
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,247
People feel good and lose weight.

822
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,334
If you have a medicine that is recurring

823
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,669
and it, you know, presents some income stream

824
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,797
for Eli Lilly,

825
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,882
now, maybe nothing is truly recurring

826
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,635
in the sense that, you know, all patent protection ends,

827
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,430
but nonetheless, there's something on an ongoing basis

828
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,098
and I guess there are various ways to extend that,

829
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,850
then some genetic medicine comes along.

830
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,893
It's one time.

831
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,478
Yep, one and done. Exactly.

832
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:18,233
Is it in practice possible to charge enough upfront

833
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,528
such that as a company looking at its portfolio—

834
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,362
Pays back the R&D?

835
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,281
Yeah, you are in fact neutral as to which it is?

836
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,033
Because from first principles, for the patient,

837
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,493
it's way better to do that— I think you asked

838
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,995
about a value perception problem,

839
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,831
and I think we need to overcome that.

840
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,998
We're doing that by studying

841
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,958
and all these other conditions

842
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,751
people recognize as conditions

843
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,169
and then we'll insure.

844
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,213
And because obesity is sort of this master switch

845
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,047
to all these things,

846
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:41,881
that's an achievable thing.

847
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,966
It just costs a lot of R&D.

848
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm talking about perception.

849
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,843
I think he's talking about reality.

850
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,511
Yeah, you're talking about actually pricing,

851
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,222
which is, why is it that the industry's evolved

852
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,432
to have a unit pricing model?

853
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,727
It's back to like a shrinkwrap software world, right?

854
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,980
Where you're basically just shipping a box

855
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,481
and all your value has to be captured

856
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,649
upon that invoice.

857
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,483
Right. Yes.

858
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,568
That is how we price all medicines.

859
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,820
You're currently, you know, in the SaaS model

860
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,947
and, you know, tech people know that SaaS is way better

861
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,657
than the shrinkwrap software business model.

862
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,325
Yes. And genetic medicines

863
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,035
are shrinkwrapped software. Exactly.

864
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:11,870
Exactly. You know,

865
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,996
wouldn't you be crazy to go back

866
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,205
even though it's better for the patient?

867
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,374
Yeah, so I think,

868
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,126
so we have some genetic medicines coming

869
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,627
and we're thinking actively about this.

870
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,129
For instance, we have a medicine development

871
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,132
that will knock down your LDL if it's safe enough

872
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:28,678
in a one and done PCSK9 edit in your liver

873
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,430
and presumably that will last the rest of your life

874
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,641
and your LDLs will be between 20 and 40 forever.

875
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,559
It looks like an amazing drug.

876
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,852
Yeah.

877
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,896
Of course, there's problems with these delivery systems,

878
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,856
we have to rule out safety, but let's just say it works.

879
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,857
How would one price that?

880
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,318
Because you're displacing a medicine

881
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,695
that costs, I don't know, $8,000-$9,000 per year.

882
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,529
Right.

883
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,406
We need to innovate that pricing model.

884
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,240
Why haven't we?

885
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,701
It's mostly because the consumption side

886
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,621
has no capability to do this.

887
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,706
Particularly governments have built all,

888
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,500
back to the regulatory incumbency problem,

889
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,503
built all this stack of rules

890
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,381
around the idea that I buy one unit, I pay X.

891
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,216
Whereas here you buy one unit

892
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,344
and we want money over time.

893
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,386
What is that?

894
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,430
But it's conceivable that one could create

895
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,806
like a licensing concept,

896
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,183
stealing from the SaaS model,

897
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,685
where you say, "We'll do the procedure for free,

898
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,104
and as long as it's working for you,

899
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,524
you will deposit X amount in our bank account

900
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,151
and you're getting the value

901
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,736
and we're getting paid for our research.

902
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,029
If it doesn't work,"

903
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,823
you know, so that invokes a warranty as well.

904
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,991
That's an interesting idea

905
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,786
and one we're thinking about for these more common,

906
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,081
because so far gene therapy is mostly for uncommon things

907
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,750
where they've just charged it and someone's paid,

908
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,961
but for common gene therapy to really be unlocked,

909
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,045
this has to be solved.

910
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,048
It strikes me that we're describing,

911
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:51,052
you know, we're discussing how people's lives are affected

912
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,637
by all these treatments

913
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,139
and what pharma companies can produce,

914
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,557
which are themselves downstream

915
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,769
of what pharma companies can afford to invest in,

916
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,231
which there but for the grace of God go we,

917
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,818
you know, the patent time horizon is an arbitrary number,

918
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,195
that, you know, we have ended up with...

919
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,990
I sometimes think about, you know, off-label use

920
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,492
is, you know, very valuable in the US system.

921
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,495
You can imagine another universe where we hadn't ended up

922
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,289
with off-label use being permissible and things like this.

923
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,959
Do you think we need to spend more time

924
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:27,505
trying to discuss and meta edit

925
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,967
the R&D system and incentive system that we have

926
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,512
because it just has such a huge effect

927
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,763
on people's quality life?

928
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,682
Well, yeah, thanks for the question.

929
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,017
I love to talk about this.

930
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,351
So I think a lot about this

931
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,521
and I think if your point of view

932
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,857
is that we want more new medicines,

933
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,691
like, that would be

934
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,525
a better outcome— I'm from that world.

935
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,360
Yeah, yeah, and I am too.

936
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,904
Then I think there's definitely many flaws

937
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:52,864
with the current system.

938
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,117
Strangely, most of the discussions I have about this

939
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,661
are actually we have,

940
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,165
they don't say it out loud, but there's enough new medicine,

941
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,001
and where we really have a problem is affording it.

942
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,045
Now, interesting fact, in the US,

943
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,295
the most expensive healthcare system in the world,

944
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:10,922
we spend 10 cents on the dollar on medicine.

945
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,717
The other 90 cents go to everything else

946
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,385
that medicine's trying to prevent.

947
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,803
Yep.

948
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,888
Go back to 1965—

949
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,056
I think it's less than 10 cents.

950
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,599
Branded medicines are eight.

951
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,185
2% is generics, which is 90% of the volume.

952
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,101
That's an even better deal.

953
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:24,395
We have to get to generics. Yeah, yeah.

954
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,230
But go back to 1965,

955
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,440
Medicare and Medicaid were invented.

956
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,818
We've gained, I believe, eight life years

957
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,110
of life expectancy since then,

958
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,572
and most studies would say five or six of those

959
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,531
are due to medicine.

960
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,159
Yet think of the cumulative expenditures

961
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,869
by taxpayers since that time.

962
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,245
It's not even close.

963
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,623
We should be saying, "Who can we give money to

964
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,998
to do more research?

965
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:48,335
Because this is clearly a better way to get through life."

966
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,797
The direct way is the NIH.

967
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,422
We could talk about that if you want.

968
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:54,884
That has limitations because institutional government.

969
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,761
But the private market self funds,

970
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,472
either through capital markets or through our R&D line,

971
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,307
and there would be a lot more funding

972
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,726
if we had an idea of price stability

973
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,562
or a longer return period.

974
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,356
That is definitely true.

975
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:13,361
The patent system is what it is because of former rules.

976
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,322
Moving it out in time seems exceedingly difficult

977
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,532
in this climate,

978
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,491
but actually— Despite the fact,

979
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,784
of course, it's shrunk

980
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,828
because of the longer approval timelines.

981
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,371
It's de facto shrunk.

982
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,833
And then, actually, the Biden administration passed a rule

983
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,626
in the Inflation Reduction Act

984
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,462
to actually have government price intervention in the US

985
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,798
at five years plus two.

986
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,050
So basically around seven years,

987
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,469
you lose that ability to recoup investment

988
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,303
in the same way.

989
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,722
Government price intervention always works out well.

990
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,765
Yeah, right.

991
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,309
It doesn't produce surpluses, let's put it that way.

992
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,228
You don't get more medicines that way.

993
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,605
So it's actually, it is collapsing,

994
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,523
I think, in investors' mind.

995
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,608
And you can see that in the capital markets.

996
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,194
If you look at the large cap pharmas,

997
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,071
not Lilly, but the other ones,

998
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,699
the multiple is the most compressed it's been in 20 years.

999
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,076
If you look at biotech, the XBI,

1000
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,037
I think half of the XBI is trading below cash.

1001
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,038
Yeah.

1002
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,999
And then if you look at— Because of this.

1003
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,294
Venture, half of the rounds last year were down rounds.

1004
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,920
This is not a positive environment.

1005
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,339
Would extending the patent duration actually work?

1006
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,258
Because you referenced earlier this dynamic

1007
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,551
where, you know, there are,

1008
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,760
especially with biologics,

1009
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,388
there are now so many opportunities

1010
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,391
for copycat molecules and therapeutics and so forth.

1011
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,644
And so, like, does it matter less

1012
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,979
what happens with patent windows

1013
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,522
because what actually matters

1014
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,150
is the competitive ecosystem, the ability for fast follow?

1015
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,194
Yeah, I think we end up

1016
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,528
with two competitive ecosystems.

1017
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,614
You have the on-patent one,

1018
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,616
and here I think history would show

1019
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,034
actually within a 10-year period,

1020
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,410
which is typical recruitment time.

1021
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,329
We've solved clinical trials, you know, separately.

1022
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,663
So they're now— Okay, so it could be,

1023
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,539
that's a way to get there, right?

1024
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,333
Is we could simplify the regulatory framework

1025
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,168
and have longer return periods

1026
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,711
and increase returns to investors

1027
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,545
and get more investment.

1028
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,589
That's actually a real idea.

1029
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,966
But, typically, in classes

1030
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,511
by sort of the horse race and accidents along the way,

1031
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,347
it's pretty uncommon you end up with one medicine.

1032
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,057
Often you'll get many.

1033
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,391
We can talk about GLP-1s for a minute.

1034
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,809
We only have two right now,

1035
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,269
but there's probably 80

1036
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,396
in clinical pipelines right now globally.

1037
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,689
We have 11 others,

1038
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,860
but there's probably 70 others not coming from Lilly.

1039
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,779
So there will be tons of competition.

1040
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,239
But the history shows that,

1041
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,199
back to this medicine incumbency,

1042
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,786
once two or three sort of get in the works of things,

1043
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,788
unless you're kind of different,

1044
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,456
nobody really uses it

1045
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,334
and pricing strategies have not worked.

1046
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,710
Now, they don't work

1047
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,338
until there's actually a biosimilar or generic event

1048
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,674
because here, it's not a,

1049
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,343
"Hey, I'm a hundred dollars and you're 90."

1050
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,678
Typically, a generic event,

1051
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:48,099
you'll lose 97% of your pricing the day your patent expires.

1052
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,644
So this is a fantastic deal for society,

1053
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,397
but a terrible situation for an inventor.

1054
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,650
And if you came along late hoping to induce competition,

1055
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,027
you maybe even were half off the originator.

1056
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:05,032
Now you're half off is 90% lower.

1057
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,492
So there's no return on that at all.

1058
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,161
Okay, so in order to stimulate

1059
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,248
and to, you know, catalyze more R&D,

1060
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,082
you know, one thing we could do

1061
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,209
is we could extend the 20-year window.

1062
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,044
What else can we do?

1063
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,879
Either you can get it quicker to market

1064
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,839
or extend the market.

1065
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,467
I think pricing for value is a good idea to consider.

1066
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,053
So, today, particularly in the United States

1067
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,055
and in many ex-US markets,

1068
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,557
I would point out a few of the,

1069
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,183
you know, the Commonwealth markets are different.

1070
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,728
They've tried to implement at a price for value scheme.

1071
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,687
Beause they're single payer?

1072
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,480
Well, most are single payer outside the US,

1073
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,107
but because they chose that path

1074
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,568
instead of a negotiated outcome or something.

1075
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,070
But the US, we have a multi-payer model,

1076
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,780
but it's devolved to the situation

1077
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,075
where actually it's a very commercial kind of thing

1078
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,037
where there's a price point a manufacturer launches at,

1079
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,456
really nobody pays that price.

1080
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:57,043
There are then many, many price points below that.

1081
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,336
The lowest is defined by law.

1082
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,170
It's Medicaid.

1083
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,213
Actually the law is called Medicaid Best Price.

1084
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,340
So state Medicaid,

1085
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,216
they spend 5% of their dollar,

1086
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,386
five cents a nickel on medicine, not 10 cents,

1087
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,764
because they get lower pricing per unit.

1088
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,557
Big insurers like UnitedHealthcare, et cetera,

1089
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,477
get a very good deal as well, approximating the government.

1090
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,480
And then smaller insurers and smaller employers

1091
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,814
get a worse and worse deal.

1092
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,608
That's the way we do it.

1093
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,070
What it means is that manufacturers compete

1094
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,113
mostly not on value,

1095
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,699
but on the pricing offering,

1096
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,786
on sort of the difference between the spread

1097
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,246
between the list price and whatever that person got.

1098
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,247
Making it even worse,

1099
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:39,460
a number of intermediaries in that system that bulk buy

1100
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,173
take their returns on the percent off list.

1101
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,133
So the higher the list, the better they do.

1102
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,802
And I think that's a terrible incentive.

1103
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,969
These PBMs

1104
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,056
and there's some group purchasing organizations like this.

1105
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,432
That should go away.

1106
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,560
And I think health is different than other commodities.

1107
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,524
It's probably has a much more important social role

1108
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,319
and deciding that the little guy gets the worst deal

1109
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,029
and the big guy gets the best deal

1110
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,573
to me feels unethical.

1111
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,867
So I would be for a system

1112
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,871
that there is one price point.

1113
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,415
People can say yes or no to that.

1114
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,750
That's one way to have value.

1115
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,293
As an employer, you could say, "That's not worth it.

1116
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,420
We're not going to pay for that.

1117
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,379
And this one is worth it."

1118
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,424
That could be informed by really independent intermediaries

1119
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,675
who study these things,

1120
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,051
look at all the claims records,

1121
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,678
look at how people do on the medicine,

1122
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,846
weigh the risks and benefits,

1123
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,889
and produce pricing.

1124
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,475
That happens in lots of other markets.

1125
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,978
Bond pricing, like, lots of people do this for a living,

1126
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,812
just not in medicine.

1127
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,274
And I think that could be a useful tool in the US system

1128
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,860
so that if you produced a truly surprising

1129
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,445
and positive clinical trial result,

1130
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,572
you could actually charge more,

1131
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,823
and that would induce other people to say,

1132
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:55,578
"Oh, let me go for higher risk, more valuable indications

1133
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,038
instead of just do the base that gets you in the door,

1134
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,459
now negotiate with a commercial team to drive more return.

1135
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,835
Oh, the patent clock's running out.

1136
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,919
Let's go to the next medicine."

1137
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,714
I think that's not a great system right now.

1138
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,924
There's the much discussed,

1139
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,719
like, maybe the top discussed topic in pharma

1140
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,053
that people know about generally

1141
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,221
is pharma pricing

1142
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,599
and the disparity between the US and internationally

1143
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,101
where, you know, all the cost is in R&D,

1144
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:22,271
the cost of actually producing the drugs is fairly low.

1145
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:26,275
And so single-payer healthcare systems internationally

1146
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,318
pay very low prices

1147
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,737
and so the R&D cost is borne by the US.

1148
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,157
And the biggest problem is not only, like, at the margin,

1149
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,160
maybe you have fewer drugs developed

1150
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,120
because this phenomenon

1151
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,456
because, you know, you have fewer returns.

1152
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,666
I think honestly the biggest problem

1153
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:47,046
is the social issues it creates in the US

1154
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,924
where it turns people against pharma

1155
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,717
and, you know, the insulin price disparities

1156
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,345
between the US and Canada and things like that.

1157
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,679
Which no longer exist by the way

1158
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,805
because we fixed that, but yes.

1159
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,182
But that was like the hot topic for—

1160
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,016
Yeah, it was a hot topic.

1161
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,267
For such a long time. And it needed to be fixed.

1162
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,185
And that's a classic example

1163
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,395
of this commercial environment I spoke about.

1164
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,774
I mean, our actual net on insulin really hasn't changed.

1165
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,108
It's like $30 or $40,

1166
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,610
but the list price got up to $275.

1167
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,071
Why? We were competing on the spread.

1168
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,405
And so that just drove this huge,

1169
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,657
and so the individual— When you say the spread,

1170
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,075
what do you mean?

1171
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,035
Okay, so insulin,

1172
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,789
so the latest versions were launched in the '90s and 2000s,

1173
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,209
but they got quite along in their lifecycle because—

1174
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,919
As in close to the end of the—

1175
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,754
Well, they were past their patent window actually,

1176
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,130
but there were no competitors.

1177
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,008
Why? Beause net pricing was pretty low.

1178
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:33,968
How could it be so low?

1179
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,094
Well, the incumbent players,

1180
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,220
mostly Novo and Lilly,

1181
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,723
we can come back to that on GLPs as well, same players,

1182
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,600
had a lot of CapEx in the ground.

1183
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,479
And to start a new insulin company made no sense

1184
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,565
at the net prices we were achieving.

1185
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,857
Yet at the same time, the public viewed this

1186
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,609
as this outrageous price gouging

1187
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,152
because list prices,

1188
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,822
if we were getting about $40 a month of therapy,

1189
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,615
were like $270.

1190
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,783
And so we—

1191
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,868
So who's getting the 235?

1192
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,288
Yeah, so middle actors.

1193
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:06,375
And so big PBMs like UnitedHealthcare runs and CVS

1194
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:10,379
and Express Scripts were offering to employers and others,

1195
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,089
the government as well,

1196
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,841
"We will create an auction,

1197
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,926
and in this auction, we will get a take

1198
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,221
on the percent we save you off the list price

1199
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,558
and you'll get a lower price than you could on your own.

1200
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,892
And we will create an auction by..."

1201
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,187
and this is actually a highly interchangeable class.

1202
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,106
They're not exactly the same substance,

1203
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,608
but they are pretty close.

1204
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,610
And so they could do this more easily

1205
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,612
and they'll say, "We'll just pick one,

1206
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,033
and every January, manufacturer, mail us your best deal,"

1207
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,659
and the best deals that tended to win,

1208
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,493
we learned through time,

1209
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,786
were those that had the biggest spread

1210
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,706
between the high list price and a low net price.

1211
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,874
So we competed on this.

1212
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:47,708
What did we do?

1213
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,126
We kept raising the list price

1214
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,420
and modestly lowering our net price.

1215
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,630
That was how the market evolved.

1216
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,549
And after 10 years, you had this huge bubble,

1217
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,800
gross to net bubble,

1218
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,635
and who was paying?

1219
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,386
Okay, so you weren't— No real payers.

1220
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,097
But the person who walked in the pharmacy with no insurance,

1221
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,265
they had to pay that.

1222
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,183
That's outrageous.

1223
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,435
That's what I mean. That should not exist.

1224
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,396
We were able to disarm that through a number of actions.

1225
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,232
But the critical first one was we went to the government

1226
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,526
and we said, "We don't want this problem anymore.

1227
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,445
We're an innovative company" 'Cause it looks bad for you.

1228
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,279
It looks terrible.

1229
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,323
And it's also producing these unfair outcomes.

1230
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,157
We're going to,

1231
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,368
because no generic has applied

1232
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,411
for a copy of our medicine or biosimilar,

1233
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,913
we will create our own.

1234
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,415
So we launched our own biosimilar.

1235
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,458
It says Lilly on the bottle.

1236
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,169
It says Insulin Lispro, which is the generic name.

1237
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,796
And we priced it really cheap,

1238
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,382
like a third of the regular product.

1239
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,841
Similar net price actually,

1240
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,635
but quite a bit less.

1241
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,346
Interesting fact, that launched,

1242
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,473
all these insurance companies and middle people called me

1243
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,432
and said, "Why'd you do this?"

1244
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,351
I said, "Well, because we're trying

1245
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,686
to lower insulin prices."

1246
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,603
They said, "Don't.

1247
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,439
This is a threat to our model."

1248
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,273
It's like, "I don't care."

1249
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,275
Like, we have a higher calling.

1250
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,319
And in the first year,

1251
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,113
no formularies covered this.

1252
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,906
So it was really only for that cash payer.

1253
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,157
No insurance company picked it up

1254
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,451
even though it was dramatically cheaper.

1255
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,286
Now it's about half of the volume,

1256
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,163
but still half not,

1257
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:12,668
because that model of this margin spread model

1258
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,502
is still there.

1259
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,587
But we largely have defanged that problem

1260
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,716
by introducing a copy of our own medicine.

1261
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,300
You know, I think we can get into differences

1262
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,136
between the US healthcare system

1263
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,387
and the rest of the world

1264
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,850
where the US has a very vibrant private healthcare system,

1265
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,934
but it's kind of weirdly unpopular

1266
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,269
at least in certain parts

1267
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,645
of the, you know, political discussion.

1268
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,479
But there's a choice.

1269
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,189
Yeah, so but taking about R&D. No, it's amazing.

1270
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,817
Actually let me just answer that. So it is true.

1271
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:37,651
If you went out and said,

1272
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,653
"Hey, I want to back some biotechs,"

1273
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,447
and they sent you their business plan,

1274
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,825
80% to 100% of the revenue and return they'll pitch you on

1275
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,701
is the US.

1276
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,663
Meaning there is no return outside the US

1277
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,915
if you start at the point of origin of the idea.

1278
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,793
Now, once we get to the market with a product,

1279
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:59,006
it's not sensical to not market it in these countries

1280
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,257
at whatever price you can get

1281
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,926
because your R&D is paid for on the US launch.

1282
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,845
So here you're just margin gathering—

1283
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,804
But it's the free-rider problem.

1284
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,638
But it's the free-rider problem.

1285
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,473
But to John's point,

1286
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,850
this seems increasingly politically untenable.

1287
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,726
Americans are— I agree.

1288
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,102
Americans are waking up to this.

1289
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,021
We should get rid of it.

1290
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,398
It's actually not good for our industry either

1291
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,233
because you get a skewing

1292
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,735
in addition to the problem, the social problem.

1293
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,569
So what does everyone do?

1294
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,655
They tune the R&D model to the US healthcare problems

1295
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,950
when actually we're 5% of the world population.

1296
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,870
So shouldn't we tune it to the global health problems

1297
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,330
and reward the global health problems?

1298
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,832
Yeah, well, we're, you know, 25% of GDP,

1299
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,209
but nonetheless— Yeah, okay.

1300
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,753
Okay, 25% would be a much better improvement

1301
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,587
over 90. When you say

1302
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,838
we should get rid of it, we should solve it...

1303
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:40,839
Yeah. How?

1304
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,966
Yeah, so I pitched this idea

1305
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,593
to this administration actually,

1306
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,428
which I call the one fair price.

1307
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,930
So— Good branding.

1308
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,306
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1309
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,140
We're learning.

1310
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,059
I need a hat. One fair price.

1311
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,977
OFP. That's it, yeah.

1312
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,356
But the idea would be that manufacturers introduce

1313
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,565
at the price they want.

1314
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,944
They are restricted by only a couple things.

1315
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,655
One is that they will need to introduce it

1316
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,698
in other developed economies

1317
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,617
in a price band that's sensical

1318
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,410
to the GDP of those countries.

1319
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,037
GDP per capita.

1320
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,997
Because the ability to pay

1321
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,042
I think should largely be borne by more wealthy nations.

1322
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,460
Okay, so you're saying— That's where the surplus is.

1323
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,294
You introduce a drug

1324
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,046
that costs $100 in the US.

1325
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:21,922
You're saying it should cost,

1326
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,549
you know, on the order of, you know, $70 in—

1327
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,552
So, say, Britain, $70 in the UK or whatever.

1328
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,929
Yeah, it's 30% less GDP per capita,

1329
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,389
we would introduce it at 70.

1330
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,223
Okay.

1331
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,975
Those countries can say yes or no,

1332
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,476
but we would basically sign a compact

1333
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,395
that would say, "That's our deal.

1334
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,437
We think it's worth a hundred."

1335
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,606
We can not sell it there,

1336
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,859
but not because we're lowering it below 70.

1337
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,320
We have to charge them what we think it's worth.

1338
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,072
And you could do that today.

1339
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:47,906
We could.

1340
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,325
So, you know, why not just do it?

1341
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,785
Why do you need a compact? That's fix number one.

1342
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,496
Fix number two is that the reimbursement system in the US,

1343
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,290
starting with the US government itself,

1344
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,917
would need to get rid of all discounts and rebates

1345
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,920
so that the product moves through the channel physically

1346
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,338
at one price

1347
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,674
and is reimbursed at that same price.

1348
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,925
You have to select that price.

1349
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,177
And here you're not price discriminating anymore.

1350
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,471
You have to sort of look at all the equities around that

1351
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,641
and say, "This is the fair price that I select

1352
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,685
and I'm going to live with that,"

1353
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,479
just like other commodities and things we buy every day.

1354
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,733
And there's no skimming of that number.

1355
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,693
And with that then,

1356
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,737
I think you would have two good outcomes.

1357
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,073
You would have a fair decision

1358
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,825
about who pays for the R&D.

1359
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,036
Presumably companies would look at the global opportunity

1360
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,203
or at least the developed countries

1361
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,622
and set a price that might be a little lower

1362
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,956
in the US than normal

1363
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,000
because they want to sell to Europe

1364
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,501
because there's more volume available.

1365
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,046
And if they price too high, because it's indexed,

1366
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:44,880
they would not be able to do that.

1367
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,633
What you're describing is an instantiation

1368
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,676
of what I view as the general phenomenon.

1369
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,511
One of the biggest shortcomings

1370
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,264
of the US healthcare system in my view

1371
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,515
and one of the biggest critiques you can have

1372
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,726
is none of the numbers mean anything.

1373
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,646
Like, just a number that you see, they're all lies.

1374
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:04,483
And that kind of has to lead to market failure essentially.

1375
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,317
Yeah, could you imagine this?

1376
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,485
Like, we go to a restaurant tonight

1377
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,487
and someone gives us the wine list

1378
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,239
and a bottle of like a hundred dollar Napa Cabernet

1379
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,367
is like $14,000.

1380
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,160
But then the waiter says, "Don't worry,

1381
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,286
that's not your copay."

1382
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,120
Yeah.

1383
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,288
And so what's my copay?

1384
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,957
"I can't tell you."

1385
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,916
We enjoy the wine.

1386
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,167
We have a nice dinner.

1387
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,962
Four weeks later, you get a letter in the mail

1388
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,714
that starts at the top by saying, "This is not a bill,"

1389
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,467
but it says the $14,000

1390
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,469
and then there's a number of deductions.

1391
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,680
And it says, "This is not a bill. Don't pay this."

1392
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,057
And then later you get an actual bill.

1393
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,017
This is healthcare pricing. But it feels like you could

1394
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,686
pull on this thread quite a bit

1395
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,772
and, you know, the next admin should,

1396
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,607
of just the numbers should mean something.

1397
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,025
Like, the FTC does this a lot.

1398
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,194
You know, they say that for consumers,

1399
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,570
numbers should be trusted

1400
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,947
and yet we kind of let the healthcare system off the hook.

1401
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,449
Yeah, there's no pre posting of pricing.

1402
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,701
Now, with drugs, there is.

1403
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,203
So one of the things we get criticism, I push back,

1404
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,579
is, like, "Well, because you can know

1405
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,914
a list price of a drug."

1406
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,458
Actually most every, the other 90%,

1407
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,835
you mostly can't know the price.

1408
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,628
Well, we've introduced regulations

1409
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,921
in the last couple of years

1410
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,673
mandating some degree of transparency here

1411
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,507
for healthcare. Yes.

1412
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,967
Total failure. Have those worked?

1413
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,010
Yeah.

1414
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,595
Look up in your region who has actually complied.

1415
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,264
Compliance is terrible.

1416
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,307
Most major hospital systems have not complied.

1417
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,269
Or if they have, they put on a website somewhere

1418
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,814
a coded database that is impossible to interpret

1419
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,526
with ICD-10 codes and price points

1420
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,777
that consumers cannot digest.

1421
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:31,611
It's like "The Hitchhiker's Guide

1422
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,904
to the Galaxy." It's a non-searchable—

1423
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:33,989
Beware of the Leopard.

1424
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,533
You know, file, flat file,

1425
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,909
with everything they have.

1426
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,454
That doesn't work. It's malicious compliance.

1427
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,622
Yeah, or facial or whatever.

1428
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,916
And so that's not working and we need to have that.

1429
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,918
I've actually gone to like an imaging center

1430
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,296
and I asked, like, "What's this cost?"

1431
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,298
And the person gets irritated with me.

1432
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,424
Like, "Why are you asking that?"

1433
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,925
I'm like, "I don't know."

1434
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,135
Like...

1435
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,011
I generally ask that

1436
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,096
before I consume things. I want to know what it costs.

1437
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,473
I had a situation,

1438
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,059
my physician is like attached to a hospital.

1439
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,394
Here's another terrible thing about US healthcare

1440
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,856
is that the federal rules require payment differences

1441
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,775
based on site of care.

1442
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,234
So if you're an outpatient clinic,

1443
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,903
which is theoretically cheaper,

1444
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,863
the reimbursement is lower,

1445
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,114
not because it's less valuable,

1446
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,075
but because it's cheaper to deliver.

1447
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,159
We punish that.

1448
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,245
We reward where it's more expensive in a hospital complex.

1449
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,288
So my doctor's there,

1450
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,415
he's like, "Hey, you can get a blood draw downstairs.

1451
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,167
Why don't you go do that now and then come back up?"

1452
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,294
So I went down there, they drew my blood.

1453
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,462
Five minutes later, I went to his office,

1454
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,546
the result was there,

1455
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:34,049
and I'm like, "Oh, I should have asked what that costs."

1456
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,094
So on my way out, I asked. They're like, "That was $650."

1457
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,512
I'm like, "For a blood draw?

1458
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,971
Like, that's insane."

1459
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:42,390
And they ran it in their own lab there.

1460
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,308
No one asks.

1461
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:46,061
And I think that's a major, major pricing problem

1462
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,354
we have in healthcare.

1463
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,064
And then, you know, I think people are insulated

1464
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,107
from those costs,

1465
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,358
but in strange ways.

1466
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,443
Some things are deductible, some are not.

1467
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,570
And so it's really very difficult

1468
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:59,032
to make informed consumer economic decisions in health

1469
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,492
and we need to improve that.

1470
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,202
The other thing I observe about the US healthcare system,

1471
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,954
so Patrick and I both grew up in Ireland,

1472
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,956
moved here for college,

1473
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:10,919
and the US has a very vibrant private healthcare system,

1474
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,964
which is different from kind of many other countries

1475
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,967
which have, you know, public government-run

1476
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,301
and funded healthcare systems.

1477
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:23,265
And what I notice is people just have a weird reaction

1478
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,641
to private healthcare.

1479
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,518
Private hospitals people think are weird

1480
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,352
despite the fact

1481
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,729
that, you know, you have much shorter wait times in the US

1482
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,856
than you have in many other countries

1483
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,899
because we have more kind of hospitals

1484
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,568
and all these new private outpatient

1485
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,278
kind of specialty clinics.

1486
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,280
But the biggest one is when people come to the US,

1487
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,448
they're shocked by pharma advertising.

1488
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,659
And, you know, they put on a sports game

1489
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,911
and just, like, the break comes and it's all pharma ads.

1490
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,788
And my understanding is that there's, again, a significant

1491
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,165
pro-social defense of this,

1492
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,375
which is many of these drugs are shown

1493
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,960
through all the extensive trials

1494
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,920
that, you know, we make you guys do

1495
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,089
to have a significant health benefit,

1496
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,092
and then it leads to them being prescribed more by doctors

1497
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,510
because people actually ask their doctors,

1498
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,761
they do in fact do the thing,

1499
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,888
they ask their doctor about them,

1500
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,764
and it leads to more usage.

1501
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,475
But yet people just find the whole thing weird.

1502
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,394
You know, private, for-profit healthcare.

1503
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,188
And so do you have a view on where this goes?

1504
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,314
What we can do about it?

1505
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,356
Yeah.

1506
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:17,027
Well, not having grown up in a system like Ireland,

1507
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,445
but I lived in Canada for a while,

1508
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,362
for six years,

1509
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,198
so I was treated in that

1510
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,825
and I've seen it, yeah, I find it weird the other way.

1511
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,035
Totally. Because that's

1512
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,203
your conditioning.

1513
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,039
I think there's good and bad to both.

1514
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,833
I think actually, we were talking about prevention earlier,

1515
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,335
to some degree primary care,

1516
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,462
what I experienced in that country

1517
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:40,467
was pretty good quality of care, very standardized,

1518
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,595
which has a confidence boosting thing

1519
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,305
when it's the same for everybody.

1520
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,975
That also, in specialty care, is implemented

1521
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,478
but actually to kind of a negative result,

1522
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,690
because take, like, diagnostics.

1523
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,318
The US and China have something like 70%

1524
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,320
of all diagnostic capacity in the world.

1525
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,364
That's crazy. Yeah.

1526
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,367
But your chance of finding a tumor or something

1527
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,910
is much, much higher in those two countries

1528
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,788
than Ireland or certainly the UK.

1529
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:13,124
And that's not a good outcome. Why?

1530
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,459
Because I think they're focused

1531
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:17,879
on cost of delivery and evenness

1532
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,506
instead of exceptional care.

1533
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,758
So I think we've moved on that axis

1534
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,594
of, like, let's offer something that could be the best

1535
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,637
and charge for it,

1536
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,348
yet for common conditions,

1537
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,559
we've also moved on that axis unnecessarily.

1538
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,560
And so here you end up

1539
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,898
with hard, you know, oak-floored primary care offices

1540
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,150
and beautiful drapery and furniture.

1541
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,527
That's the basis of competition

1542
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,570
instead of actually, it's quite a simple thing,

1543
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,198
"You need your flu vaccine.

1544
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,658
Like, just get in and get out."

1545
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,368
And there's a third thing coming, which you touched on,

1546
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,620
which is prevention and self-care.

1547
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,372
And I actually think that if we think

1548
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,791
of the funding mechanism in our country,

1549
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,750
but also in Europe,

1550
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,503
and Europe's system has problems going forward,

1551
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,130
it was really built on an acute care model

1552
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,882
when most illness and death was accidents,

1553
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,093
you know, things we couldn't solve.

1554
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,137
It was basically treat them as best you can

1555
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,014
and people were going to expire.

1556
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,223
That's what a hospital did.

1557
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,933
We've, of course, now evolved well beyond that.

1558
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,560
I think that's 30% of US cost.

1559
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,562
Now 70% is primary care

1560
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,481
and sort of, you know, the chronic disease.

1561
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,734
And those institutions and those funding models

1562
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,737
are really poorly suited to that,

1563
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:28,742
and particularly so if behaviors have an input into that.

1564
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,161
Don't we want people before they get the disease

1565
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,787
to modify their behavior?

1566
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:33,955
Well, how do you charge for that?

1567
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,749
And so, you know, there's a little bit

1568
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,501
of a selection problem

1569
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,754
that, you know, the best healthcare systems

1570
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,881
get the worst behaved people

1571
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,466
because the coverage is better.

1572
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,344
So I think it is time for a rethink of the whole thing.

1573
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,471
And I would think of those three different things

1574
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,097
and try to solve for them differently.

1575
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,558
Right now, we pretty much have one answer,

1576
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,477
and the Europe answer has produced

1577
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:58,563
kind of an institutional rationing model

1578
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,939
that seems very fair

1579
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,734
but actually produces poor outcomes for acute conditions.

1580
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,362
And the US, which is very expensive,

1581
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,697
also is unfair

1582
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,908
but produces good outcomes for acute conditions.

1583
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,743
Probably just the same for everything else,

1584
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,078
but costs too much.

1585
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,163
That's I think needs to be addressed.

1586
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,206
In the future,

1587
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,708
and here, medicines plus information

1588
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,795
I think can play a really big role in disease prevention.

1589
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,797
In the past, we haven't been able to make...

1590
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,256
the age old problem in medicine

1591
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,842
is this thing we call therapeutic index.

1592
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:31,096
That's the difference between a dose which is harmful

1593
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,889
and one which is helpful.

1594
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,184
And a therapeutic index that's small is difficult.

1595
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,685
You have to very precisely dose

1596
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,312
and people have differences,

1597
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,773
so it requires a lot of attention.

1598
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,401
But over time, the techniques we make drugs with,

1599
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,737
that therapeutic index, the TI we call it, is expanding

1600
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,489
and expanding non-linearly.

1601
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,241
Because of that—

1602
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,450
Sorry, why is it expanding?

1603
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,786
Yeah, because of new drug technologies.

1604
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,995
Two main ones.

1605
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,665
One is, going to the root of disease,

1606
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,709
whether it be genetic or RNA blocking medicine.

1607
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,795
So a lot of diseases have excess protein.

1608
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,339
We can now really pristinely block

1609
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,425
RNA production of the protein

1610
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:12,095
and the disease, without a lot of side effects, goes away.

1611
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,180
And by the way, these medicines happily

1612
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,516
also have sort of this catalytic effect.

1613
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,102
So they last a really long time.

1614
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,687
I mentioned Lp earlier.

1615
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,022
So that's a kind of cholesterol that's untreatable today.

1616
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:23,940
We're developing a medicine

1617
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,735
that will be a once or twice a year treatment for this

1618
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,488
and the side effects look totally benign.

1619
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,283
That's a really wide therapeutic index, right?

1620
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,993
So now when you have that,

1621
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,954
you can think, "Well, my trials I can run faster

1622
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,956
because I don't have worries about treatment.

1623
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,374
They can be cheaper.

1624
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:45,044
I can charge less and get it to more people at scale.

1625
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:49,299
And I actually don't really need a healthcare system."

1626
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,384
And here, maybe back to the GLP-1s,

1627
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,553
that's giving us a little bit of glimpse of these.

1628
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,055
These are more invasive than what I just described,

1629
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,348
but pretty safe.

1630
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,392
People know how to treat themselves.

1631
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,269
You certainly know if you have overweight or obesity.

1632
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,896
You don't need a doctor to tell you that.

1633
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,733
And platforms like our direct platform have really taken off

1634
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,526
because it's self-paid,

1635
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,904
but people skip all this other morass

1636
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,864
and getting the, "This is not a bill," piece of paper.

1637
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,116
They're just like, "Here's my visa card number.

1638
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,493
Yeah, charge me 500 bucks,

1639
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,369
but my problem's getting solved."

1640
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,413
I think for prevention,

1641
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:23,583
that's an intriguing future, direct to consumer.

1642
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:27,337
We're here in the great city of South San Francisco,

1643
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,340
the home of Genentech

1644
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,844
and to some significant extent of the US biotech sector.

1645
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,430
And we're talking a whole bunch

1646
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,264
here in this conversation

1647
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,016
about fostering and inducing

1648
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:42,560
and creating adequate incentives for R&D.

1649
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,145
I think the,

1650
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:44,979
I mean, to some extent,

1651
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,732
you can bucket biotech and pharma separately.

1652
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:48,942
Obviously the lines blur,

1653
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,902
but, you know, there's kind of two poles.

1654
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,821
And I think it's very striking the extent to which,

1655
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,865
as far as I can see at least,

1656
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,660
the introduction of new medicines,

1657
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,870
you know, new molecular entities, whatever,

1658
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,081
is increasingly dominated by biotechs.

1659
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,415
And you would know the numbers better than me,

1660
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,751
but I think that around two thirds,

1661
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,627
both of the revenue

1662
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,088
and also of the, just by count,

1663
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,422
the introductions themselves,

1664
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:14,592
are attributable to biotechs rather than to pharma.

1665
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,678
And so I guess I'm just curious

1666
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,555
how you think about this landscape.

1667
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,600
I mean, maybe there's some view where the role of,

1668
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,937
in an extreme, one role of pharma

1669
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:30,400
would be to be a kind of private equity portfolio manager

1670
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,318
where you take stock of the landscape

1671
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,778
and you look at who's doing well,

1672
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,239
whose approach you believe in, et cetera,

1673
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,950
and you have the risky innovation be done

1674
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,910
by earlier stage entities,

1675
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,495
by venture capitalists, what have you,

1676
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,164
and then you bet on winners, you go and scale them,

1677
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,332
and you distribute them.

1678
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,166
One model.

1679
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,585
Traditional model is actually,

1680
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,713
no, you have all these internal R&D capabilities

1681
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,006
and you're vertically integrated

1682
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,215
and you have economies of scale

1683
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,592
and so on and so forth.

1684
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,135
Are we shifting there?

1685
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,722
You know, where between those poles ought we be?

1686
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:01,598
How is it changing?

1687
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,182
Just thoughts on that whole landscape?

1688
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,393
Yeah, well, I think there's three models

1689
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,394
that have emerged.

1690
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,229
One is the biotech that grows up.

1691
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:12,108
Another is the outsourced early model you're describing

1692
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,277
where we just say, "We're good at clinical trials.

1693
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,111
Everything before that,

1694
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,989
just gobble it up as companies mature."

1695
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,657
You know, because the capital market is so terrible

1696
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:20,491
as I described,

1697
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,327
it's a liquidity event for the investors.

1698
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,703
They go back and try something earlier.

1699
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:28,041
And then sort of the hybrid of fully integrated plus.

1700
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,584
I don't think anyone's really pursuing

1701
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,419
just fully integrated anymore.

1702
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,464
I think your head's in the sand if you're doing that.

1703
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,798
We're running the third one.

1704
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,342
The other two are reliable— That hybrid?

1705
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,719
Yeah. And why do we make that choice?

1706
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,763
I think we observe a few things.

1707
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,932
First of all, while it's true that the origin of,

1708
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,559
I think it's a little more than half of medicines

1709
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,395
approved in the last 10 years have come from biotech,

1710
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,398
hardly any of those traveled all the way through biotech

1711
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:55,151
because there are, as we talked about earlier,

1712
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,154
huge checks to write and risks to take

1713
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,656
and the biotech investor base

1714
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,907
is not interested in those risks,

1715
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,993
those very binary large checks.

1716
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:04,994
Whereas we can absorb them,

1717
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,330
we can run a portfolio across many of those.

1718
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,500
There's also scale economies in clinical trials.

1719
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,504
There is no doubt in my mind we are faster, more robust,

1720
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,715
probably cheaper than actually every biotech out there

1721
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,510
trying to do their own early phase clinical trials

1722
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,512
and manufacturing and distribution globally.

1723
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,681
So those things benefit scale.

1724
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,515
What doesn't?

1725
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,724
It is discovery.

1726
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:27,642
It's the early phase.

1727
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,478
I think that's a more diffuse undertaking.

1728
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,146
What we've done, starting with my predecessor

1729
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,648
maybe 15 years ago,

1730
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,775
is we started putting diverse,

1731
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,276
spreading out our labs.

1732
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,945
Scale's bad.

1733
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:43,449
And I think our idea was 300 or 400 people, about right,

1734
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,910
Allow for some deviation.

1735
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,578
As in you think the— Put some outposts out there.

1736
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,997
The act of invention has diseconomies of scale.

1737
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,208
Yeah, so we started in San Diego.

1738
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,002
We built a monoclonal antibody biotech hub there.

1739
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,338
It's produced like a third of the medicines we've made

1740
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,673
since we started.

1741
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,716
Hugely successful.

1742
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,925
There's 400 employees.

1743
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:04,429
So it's like a biotech, but it has some benefits.

1744
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,472
They don't have to spend any time with venture capitalists

1745
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:09,517
or raising money or fussing over CapEx

1746
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,311
and, you know, ups and downs in the markets.

1747
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,604
Why is it good to be small?

1748
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,773
Why is it good to have the 400-person center

1749
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:16,816
in San Diego— It's interesting, you know?

1750
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:17,608
And not the Indiana super center—

1751
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:18,443
I don't know.

1752
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,319
I think it's good to big on clinical trials

1753
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,821
because you're doing global reach.

1754
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,907
It's a scaled operation, manufacturing, distribution.

1755
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,743
Discovery, I don't know.

1756
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,120
Now, we have people look across,

1757
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:33,583
and I think there is a benefit in being in a tribe,

1758
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,961
but I think it's also good to have some independence.

1759
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:40,131
There's a long list of pretty compelling inventions

1760
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,382
that came out of Lilly

1761
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,301
that were not sanctioned projects.

1762
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,802
And so that tells you something,

1763
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,971
that curiosity and sort of the scientific endeavor—

1764
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,765
Weren't sanctioned in what way?

1765
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,266
Meaning it had a budget

1766
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,269
and had a number and a name and whatever and it was,

1767
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,105
or pointed at, like, "Oh, here's a target.

1768
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,149
Go put a team around that and come up with a medicine."

1769
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,358
That does work,

1770
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,068
but sometimes someone just says,

1771
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,070
"By the way, I didn't tell you,

1772
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,323
but I've been working on this thing over here

1773
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,532
and it seems pretty interesting."

1774
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:07,450
And then we fund it.

1775
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,368
Have you guys formalized that, like, Google 20% time

1776
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,913
where are some people are just doing curiosity or?

1777
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,122
It depends on the area,

1778
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:17,376
but we have this allowable variation idea where—

1779
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:19,754
Is that the phrase, allowable variation?

1780
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,464
No, that's my word.

1781
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,593
But basically you just turn away and see what happens.

1782
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,805
And we don't manage the budgets down to the nickel

1783
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,639
at these sites.

1784
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,848
And if you get good people,

1785
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,266
it's like, "Let them do their thing,

1786
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,351
let 'em cook,

1787
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,393
and let's see what happens."

1788
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:35,311
And that's certainly worked.

1789
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,021
We built a big site here— The let them cook school

1790
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:37,939
of pharma innovation.

1791
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:38,773
Yeah.

1792
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:39,607
Yeah, it's a thing.

1793
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:40,441
I can see this as a book.

1794
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,987
A lot of pharma innovation is iterative, right?

1795
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:48,658
So the other problem is people quit too soon.

1796
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,577
So back to GLP-1s, this story's been going,

1797
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:54,789
we launched the first GLP-1 twice a day injection in 2006.

1798
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,250
People say, "Oh, Dave, when did you know,

1799
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,668
like, Zepbound would be huge?"

1800
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,254
I'm like, "I don't know, 2016, 2017?"

1801
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,005
It was a long time ago.

1802
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,841
We've been on this story for a long time

1803
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,342
and it was protein engineering

1804
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,553
and making better molecules that could be dosed higher

1805
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:11,013
that led us to get to more weight loss effects

1806
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,682
and then harnessing two mechanisms.

1807
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,601
So that's just, that's not like light bulb,

1808
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,311
single scientist in a dark lab,

1809
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,021
like, "I've got it."

1810
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,941
It's teams just grinding on a theme.

1811
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,526
And if we had directed that,

1812
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,819
like, "Oh, make it dual acting.

1813
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,653
It'll be better,"

1814
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,530
we wouldn't have gotten the right answer.

1815
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,906
This is all, like, your internal innovation essentially.

1816
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,366
Yes, so that's running.

1817
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,284
Where do the biotechs appear?

1818
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,828
And why do we do this? One, it is productive for us

1819
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,788
and I do think we've built a capability

1820
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:40,793
to, frankly, make molecules with more drug-like properties.

1821
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,838
So by the time you get to that expensive escalation

1822
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:44,922
of clinical trials,

1823
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,841
the drug's behaving like a drug.

1824
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,801
Some of that we talked about earlier with AI

1825
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,261
and other tools we can equip.

1826
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,388
So these things tend to work, these things don't.

1827
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,556
It's pretty empirical still.

1828
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,057
We don't know all of biology.

1829
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:55,892
Some of it's just knowhow

1830
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,727
of the chemists and the scientists.

1831
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,062
But I think when we buy biotechs,

1832
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,523
often we love the target idea.

1833
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:04,901
We love the novelty of what they did.

1834
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,277
It's just rather imperfect.

1835
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,362
It's an 80/20 they've done.

1836
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:11,198
And we will often take that invention cycle back

1837
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:14,535
and do a whole other invention loop to refine it further

1838
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:15,369
so that it is what we call like a big pharma asset.

1839
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:16,162
So what you're buying

1840
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,082
is the proof that there's something here,

1841
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:20,917
but not necessarily

1842
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,168
the specific solution. Yeah, exactly.

1843
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,127
And if they haven't disclosed it

1844
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,212
and they've got a lead, that's very interesting.

1845
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,548
But we actively cultivate

1846
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:31,385
kind of a proximate satellite group of companies

1847
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:32,887
that are doing this independent of us

1848
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,722
but we have ownership stakes in.

1849
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,808
And then, of course, we have a watch list,

1850
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,977
ever-growing because of China,

1851
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:42,313
of entities we don't have an interest in

1852
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,147
but are doing interesting things

1853
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:44,231
and we want to,

1854
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,358
we have all their events mapped out

1855
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,276
and we're watching pretty much

1856
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,904
every clinical or preclinical readout,

1857
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,906
every patent posting in the industry,

1858
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,283
we have a way to monitor.

1859
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,580
For most of its 150-year history,

1860
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,123
Eli Lilly's relationship with patients

1861
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,709
has been through pharmacies and other intermediaries,

1862
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:04,961
but that's changing.

1863
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,712
As Dave mentions, with LillyDirect,

1864
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:09,048
patients can buy treatments, like Mounjaro and Zepbound,

1865
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,257
directly from the company

1866
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:12,927
and get them delivered right to their door.

1867
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,011
And they're not alone,

1868
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,930
at Stripe, we're seeing a new playbook emerge

1869
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,431
where established businesses who used

1870
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:20,351
to sell via complex distribution chains

1871
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,979
are now building direct digital relationships

1872
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,271
with their customers.

1873
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,566
And with Stripe, that's much more likely to succeed.

1874
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,068
It's happening across all industries,

1875
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,736
not just in healthcare.

1876
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,780
Media companies, like FOX Sports,

1877
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,864
they used to reach viewers

1878
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,574
only through traditional cable bundles,

1879
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:36,409
but now they've built

1880
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,245
a global direct-to-customer streaming platform on Stripe.

1881
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,913
Or Ford, they're selling cars

1882
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,206
and trucks online through Stripe,

1883
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:44,583
and not just through dealerships.

1884
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,420
Some companies, they're creating entirely new products

1885
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,629
to take directly to their customers.

1886
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:50,256
So Fender, the guitar company,

1887
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,925
they created a tuition marketplace that has enabled millions

1888
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,719
of guitar classes already.

1889
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,762
Large enterprises are creating better direct offerings

1890
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,556
than ever before with Stripe.

1891
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,933
Learn more at stripe.com/enterprise.

1892
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:05,563
So we just mentioned

1893
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,523
we're in South San Francisco in the Bay Area.

1894
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,441
The Bay Area, of course,

1895
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,569
used to have a vibrant electronics manufacturing industry

1896
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,653
and— Yep, it left.

1897
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,321
Yeah, companies like—

1898
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,489
There's still the APX sign.

1899
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:16,323
Yeah, exactly. And, you know,

1900
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,700
some of the old— Yes, but—

1901
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,285
Fairchild. Exactly.

1902
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,704
But you mention, you know, Cypress Semiconductor

1903
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,913
and, you know, people don't really know

1904
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,873
what you're talking about these days.

1905
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,333
The biotech sector started here in the '70s, I guess.

1906
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,710
Yeah, give or take. And is, exactly,

1907
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,713
and is still today reasonably vibrant.

1908
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:31,547
Although, to your point,

1909
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,257
it's had a tough maybe couple of years.

1910
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,635
The share of the global drug pipeline

1911
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,179
that was Chinese 10 years ago

1912
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,805
was I think in the small single digits.

1913
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,432
Approaching zero. Yeah, exactly. Right.

1914
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,601
And now I think it's high 20s,

1915
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:44,852
approaching a third. A third.

1916
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,353
It's 30%. Okay. It's amazing.

1917
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:47,730
Now is in fact 30%.

1918
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,065
Where does this go?

1919
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:54,070
And is there a US biotech sector in 20 years?

1920
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:56,405
Or like electronics manufacturing,

1921
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,365
does the whole thing just go to China?

1922
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,909
I wouldn't predict that outcome,

1923
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,162
but I think we should ring the alarm bell right now.

1924
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,039
Well, I mean, is it bad?

1925
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,126
It's not great, I would say,

1926
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:12,296
I think for two reasons. One— But if they can do it

1927
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,422
better and faster and cheaper

1928
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,256
and we get the drugs,

1929
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,466
isn't that awesome?

1930
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:18,803
That is good, especially if the last part's true.

1931
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:22,680
But I think the economy around biopharma

1932
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,058
I think has some unique properties

1933
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,768
that should make us want to own it.

1934
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:29,522
One is it is in the knowledge economy.

1935
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,273
To me is sort of the pinnacle—

1936
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,274
Paradigmatic knowledge economy.

1937
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:36,028
It's the premier league of knowledge economy.

1938
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:37,529
You guys fund and know people...

1939
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:42,326
I mean, the diversity of skill sets needed to do it well

1940
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,537
at the highest level of their game is extreme.

1941
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:46,705
I don't think it exists,

1942
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:49,166
maybe rocketry, maybe there's a few other things like this,

1943
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:52,252
but it requires a lot of talent.

1944
01:08:52,252 --> 01:08:55,673
So it tells you how you're doing I think in a way.

1945
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:58,050
Can you integrate these, can you train people,

1946
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,760
attract them from abroad, like you folks,

1947
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,345
or train them here

1948
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:03,973
and put them together in a way that produces new value?

1949
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,724
Okay, so there's a kind of shadow

1950
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,893
passing over the country if biotech—

1951
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:09,060
And it's rewarded.

1952
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,313
I mean, these are well-paying jobs.

1953
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,983
There's a big economic footprint that goes with that.

1954
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,527
And increasingly we're putting manufacturing near it,

1955
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,736
so it actually has a trickle down

1956
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,863
that's pretty significant as well.

1957
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:24,827
And then it invokes also security concerns.

1958
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:29,372
And you can imagine if we had the COVID pandemic,

1959
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:31,834
in that case, basically 80%

1960
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,044
of the medicines and vaccines that worked

1961
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:35,796
were produced in the United States.

1962
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,173
China produced some of those things.

1963
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,131
None of them really worked.

1964
01:09:38,131 --> 01:09:39,341
We didn't import them.

1965
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,468
But imagine if that was flipped.

1966
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:44,220
And we're in— I mean, the EU saw this

1967
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,764
with all the battles, yeah. An extorted position.

1968
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,850
Yeah, the EU had a huge controversy,

1969
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,852
and they're friendly and we had open trading,

1970
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,063
but they have had a reckoning as well.

1971
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:53,898
And there's some things

1972
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,816
you just want to have a national competency in.

1973
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:57,610
So, anyway, I have a theory about the industry.

1974
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,863
I think there are truly novel concepts

1975
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,865
that require a little more time and work

1976
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,452
and it is yet to be seen

1977
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,954
whether China has perfected that

1978
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,916
in a way where they can create their own local system.

1979
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,667
What they've certainly shown now, though,

1980
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:16,503
is the iterative derivative,

1981
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:19,173
which is a big part of the substrate of the industry,

1982
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,216
they are refining

1983
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,219
and becoming experts in very, very quickly.

1984
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,386
I think that's not all bad.

1985
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,305
There'll be more competition.

1986
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,307
You know, there's an effect in China

1987
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,643
where their own sort of price competition

1988
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,186
defeats their own industries,

1989
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,230
and you're kind of seeing that in biotech as well,

1990
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,941
the race to the bottom on pricing.

1991
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:39,068
But I think we want a national competency here.

1992
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,945
And I think this has been a hub.

1993
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,780
Boston is still a big hub.

1994
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,614
We want to keep those.

1995
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,492
But there's this new phenomenon where,

1996
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,035
my understanding, please correct me,

1997
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,704
is that, you know, traditionally you develop a molecule,

1998
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:51,956
you patent the molecule.

1999
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:54,583
Now there's the growth of these clones

2000
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,668
where you can have the molecule

2001
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,671
be trivially different enough for patent purposes,

2002
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,630
but still the same action

2003
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,715
and there's a huge amount of that

2004
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:03,300
coming out of the Chinese biotech sector.

2005
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,344
Doesn't that— But I think also

2006
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,137
some real, like, I mean

2007
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:08,639
that seems real and good

2008
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:09,765
and novel— Also real innovation.

2009
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:10,891
That's an interesting one, yeah.

2010
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:14,561
But don't the clones effectively erode the patent system

2011
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:15,688
and, you know, we would think shortening

2012
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:19,024
the patent life to 15 years would be bad, and/or 10 years.

2013
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,902
And this is shortening the patent life effectively.

2014
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,988
Yeah, I think that practice is what I'm talking about

2015
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,407
with this sort of refine and replicate

2016
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,909
and our own patent system forces this, right?

2017
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,996
So we have a, in 2011, the US changed the patent system

2018
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:34,623
to first to file versus first to invent.

2019
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,959
You used to be able to invent and sit on your patent

2020
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,294
and all you had to do is prove,

2021
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,421
it was messy court cases 'cause your lab notebook said,

2022
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,214
"Oh, it was October of 2017

2023
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,465
and mine says 2018.

2024
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,843
Well, which was what," right?

2025
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,636
But now you rush to file.

2026
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,930
And the government I think has 12 months

2027
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,807
that they sit on that inspection

2028
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,143
and then the patent, what is a patent?

2029
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,271
It's a degree to publish your finding, right?

2030
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:00,733
To make it a public good in return for that monopoly.

2031
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:05,738
But if the monopoly is debased by 30 Chinese biotechs

2032
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,741
who feed that patent into a computer,

2033
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,660
the computer then can imagine chemical structures

2034
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,203
that have one or two atom differences

2035
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:15,205
that don't fit within the patent,

2036
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:18,375
and then make that substance, test it, works just the same,

2037
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,919
you've created basically a shadow generic industry

2038
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:22,713
and undermined the patent system itself.

2039
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:24,465
I don't think that's a great thing.

2040
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,342
So was the shadow generic industry

2041
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,135
basically launched by first to file

2042
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,179
because we published the instruction manuals?

2043
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,096
Yeah. I hadn't realized that.

2044
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:33,932
And do you think, is it your view if you just switch back?

2045
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:36,226
No, what I would do is,

2046
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:39,605
if we want a sort of like an America-first patent system,

2047
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,440
or Europe first,

2048
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,900
we should do two things.

2049
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,361
We should create a belt and suspenders so that,

2050
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:48,989
some patents are tricky to write.

2051
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:51,784
So there might've been an IP space that's been mined

2052
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:52,868
and people are around the idea,

2053
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:57,790
but you had an insight that actually unlocked the truth

2054
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,793
and there's like a thin strip,

2055
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,920
but you have to carefully navigate this concept

2056
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,837
called prior art

2057
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:05,547
and get that patent to stick.

2058
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,132
People tend to constrain it more

2059
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:09,510
and you leave room at the edges.

2060
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:13,972
Should we make the basis a reward to investors,

2061
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:16,892
the patent filer, the patent writer?

2062
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,769
That's really the most valuable step in that case.

2063
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:19,978
I don't think so.

2064
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,522
So a belt and suspenders would be, say,

2065
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:22,648
independent of a patent,

2066
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,274
we'll give you 12 years

2067
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:26,944
if you produce primary data on this product

2068
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:29,071
all the way through phase III.

2069
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,948
That's a $3 billion ticket.

2070
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,574
These copycats aren't going to do it.

2071
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:36,036
They're certainly not going to do it in US data.

2072
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,247
And that'll be more or less constrained in markets

2073
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,290
that don't care about that issue

2074
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,001
and don't have this data exclusivity provision.

2075
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,545
This already exists in biologics by the way,

2076
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,338
so all we have to do is, in small molecules,

2077
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:47,172
and this problem we're talking about

2078
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,049
is mostly a small molecule problem.

2079
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:50,884
The other thing we should do is say,

2080
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:55,597
"If you are in a league of nations that really respect IP,

2081
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,811
those nations will extend this confidentiality period

2082
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:03,105
beyond the patent inspection period,

2083
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,233
that society will get the recipe well in time

2084
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,944
for a generic company to copy it later,

2085
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,280
but why does it have to be 12 months?"

2086
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,449
That's a super short time in drug development.

2087
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,117
How about six years?

2088
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,661
Then that product is well into the clinic,

2089
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:21,123
the copycat nation can spin up in China,

2090
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,791
but it's not going to make a difference.

2091
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,793
So I think that those two solutions together

2092
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,128
would be what I'd recommend.

2093
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:30,549
And the electronics manufacturing industry went to China

2094
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,301
for pretty straightforward reasons.

2095
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,135
You know, it's—

2096
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:33,969
Cost. Exactly.

2097
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,055
It's very labor intensive

2098
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,099
and I guess raw material intensive

2099
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:40,225
and, you know, just lots of reasons,

2100
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:41,560
it's cheaper in China.

2101
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,812
But the software production industry has not.

2102
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,189
That is still here.

2103
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,984
To your point, biotech is an extremely knowledge

2104
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:53,405
and tacit expertise intensive space.

2105
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,866
Why is that one going to China?

2106
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:58,702
Yeah, well, I'm not sure it's going,

2107
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,120
that's why I say I'm not sure it's,

2108
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:00,954
the story's over yet. Well, it's relevant.

2109
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:02,039
We're not eclipsed,

2110
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,625
but, you know, a significant share of it has gone to China.

2111
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,711
I mean, China has a robust software industry.

2112
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:11,215
We have a two internet world

2113
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,257
and they have their,

2114
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,926
I don't know how well Stripe does in China,

2115
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,928
but I would guess not very well.

2116
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,346
Well, not domestically.

2117
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,723
Yeah, okay, well, or Adobe.

2118
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:20,724
I'm on the board of that company

2119
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:23,936
and I can tell you they have di minimis sales in China.

2120
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,103
But a lot of usage.

2121
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:26,939
Well, and there are tools domestically

2122
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:28,440
that have been built around that

2123
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,858
that have their own economy.

2124
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,237
That could be a state that this is driving into

2125
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:36,865
where there's sort of medicines that grow up in the world

2126
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,575
where there's perhaps more transparency,

2127
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:42,204
where the regulatory systems are more confidence instilling,

2128
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:46,041
and we perhaps reform our patent system to protect that

2129
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,876
and China has their own version,

2130
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,503
and there's good reasons they would want to do that

2131
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,964
because if we own all the medicines

2132
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,048
and there is another crisis,

2133
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,883
I'm sure they would be deeply uncomfortable.

2134
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,635
In fact, they didn't even approve,

2135
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:01,223
they had rights to the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine

2136
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,392
for almost the entirety of their pandemic.

2137
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,810
They never approved it.

2138
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,727
Why?

2139
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,938
I think it was a national pride issue.

2140
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:08,939
Didn't want to be beholden.

2141
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,774
It was a German invention actually.

2142
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:14,820
But, yeah, so, again, it intertwines with,

2143
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,447
you know, health emergencies are social crises

2144
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:20,367
that politically are difficult to navigate, as we saw,

2145
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,703
and having that competency is important.

2146
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,956
So I totally respect their desire to build this.

2147
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,834
We have brilliant Chinese scientists in the world

2148
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,502
and many of them work at our company

2149
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:32,170
and were trained in the United States.

2150
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,005
That's all good.

2151
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,591
I just think we don't want it to move all offshore.

2152
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,093
I don't know when exactly the generics industry,

2153
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:42,264
like, really rose to be such a large share

2154
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,850
of consumed pharmaceuticals today,

2155
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,519
but I'm very curious about the quality control

2156
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:50,939
and the attendant regulatory apparatus around it

2157
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,816
where, I mean, as we've been discussing,

2158
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:55,861
there's such scrupulous and stringency

2159
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,447
around clinical trials for new molecules

2160
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,324
and introductions and so forth.

2161
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,492
My understanding is that for generics,

2162
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:06,330
a lot of the external validation certification happens

2163
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,165
at the manufacturing plant level,

2164
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,875
not at the individual drug level.

2165
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,543
And that for the individual drugs,

2166
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:15,255
it is substantially a case of self-certification

2167
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:17,674
and, you know, presentation of one's own data

2168
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:19,593
as opposed to external audits.

2169
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:21,970
And there have been many cases

2170
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,474
of documented fraud and malfeasance here.

2171
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:28,018
The largest generic manufacturer in India,

2172
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:29,311
I forget its name,

2173
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,563
paid a half a billion dollar fine in 2013 for—

2174
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:32,356
Yeah, Cipla.

2175
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,399
Yeah, for rampant fraud and falsification,

2176
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,278
abuse of the biosimilarity analysis and so forth,

2177
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,614
which obviously is bad,

2178
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:45,619
but, like, the apparatus and the FDA regime is such

2179
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:49,206
that there are very obvious incentives for that to happen.

2180
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:53,168
And then I'm very struck by how anecdotally and online,

2181
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,753
there are so many reports

2182
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:58,298
of people switching from brand name medication

2183
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,384
to generic medication,

2184
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,594
finding them to be very different,

2185
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:05,639
you know, subjectively and experientially,

2186
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,141
switching back to the branded pharmaceutical,

2187
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,145
and, you know, things going back to normal as it were.

2188
01:18:12,145 --> 01:18:14,231
And so there's some some kind of subjective version

2189
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,982
of, you know, the generic is, in fact,

2190
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:18,193
not, you know, directly substitutable.

2191
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:21,321
And so I guess, I mean, I know nothing about this domain.

2192
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,823
This is all just observed from afar.

2193
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,074
I guess I'm curious for your thoughts here.

2194
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:27,285
Like, does the generic industry actually work

2195
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,578
as well as we think it does?

2196
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:30,914
How much fraud is there in actuality?

2197
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:33,291
You know, when your kids or family or friends or whatever

2198
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,419
are taking a generic,

2199
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:38,046
you know, do you advise them to exercise some caution?

2200
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:39,589
Thoughts in this whole space?

2201
01:18:39,589 --> 01:18:40,924
I think on the whole,

2202
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:42,259
the generic environment in the US,

2203
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,302
which is the most developed

2204
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:47,180
in the sense of percent of medicines consumed

2205
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,517
and the cheapest in the OECD,

2206
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,353
has been largely a positive outcome

2207
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:56,565
because it's made effective medicines abundant

2208
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,733
at very, very low cost.

2209
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,443
When you say the generic industry in the US,

2210
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:00,527
do you mean those manufactured in the US

2211
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:01,695
or consumed in the US? There are no generics

2212
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,071
manufactured in the US really.

2213
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:06,616
So those that are licensed in the US and sold here.

2214
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:08,076
That said, and I say that

2215
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:12,873
because, you know, take an invention like statins

2216
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:16,918
or HIV drugs or we invented Prozac,

2217
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,379
still the standard of care in treating depression,

2218
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:21,673
it's like three cents a day.

2219
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:23,759
I don't know any product you can buy for three cents a day,

2220
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:28,305
but, you know, that's an incredible value for the system.

2221
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,474
And back to the return on investment thing,

2222
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:33,018
somehow we have not articulated this very well,

2223
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,811
but the fact that we spent money

2224
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:36,354
in the '80s researching Prozac

2225
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:37,272
and still today

2226
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,775
there's tens of millions of people benefiting,

2227
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,526
that's a public surplus

2228
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:43,403
that should make us want more of those inventions.

2229
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,530
But, anyway, digression.

2230
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,740
So in the '80s also,

2231
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,533
there was a change in the policy in the US

2232
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:52,370
which was a trade to basically make it easier

2233
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:55,665
for generics to enter the market after patent expiry

2234
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:58,460
in exchange for less patent litigation.

2235
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:01,379
So there was a structured path to litigation.

2236
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:02,798
It wasn't just a free for all.

2237
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,466
It used to be in the '70s, '60s,

2238
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:07,719
the day you launched, you'd be in court,

2239
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:11,056
and by nature, those cases are you have to defend all comers

2240
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,682
and if one gets through, you lose.

2241
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:16,561
So it's a very asymmetrical problem and it wasn't good.

2242
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:20,899
So we traded that for certainty in a time window

2243
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:23,193
and a structured path to patent litigation.

2244
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:27,781
But the day after the last valid patent expired,

2245
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:30,033
generic could enter freely

2246
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:35,038
and could get on the market with a clearer bar,

2247
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:37,082
a lower bar perhaps.

2248
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,292
There's two deviations that can occur.

2249
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:42,003
One is, it's the so-called 5% rule

2250
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:45,298
where plus or minus 5% of the active ingredient

2251
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:47,509
and some dosages in some people

2252
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,635
are more sensitive than that

2253
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:50,554
and I think some of those people have an effect.

2254
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:51,596
Also, there's this,

2255
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,599
particularly in a dry product, in a pill,

2256
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:57,269
there's excipients, which are the other ingredients.

2257
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,144
Most of what you're taking

2258
01:20:58,144 --> 01:21:00,146
is not actually the active ingredient.

2259
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:02,524
Some of them are buffering compounds,

2260
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,193
some of them affect absorption rate.

2261
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:08,697
So those two things combined do lead to different effects.

2262
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,615
And there is no requirement

2263
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:13,535
for small molecule chemical medicine

2264
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,580
to show proof of efficacy of any kind.

2265
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:20,250
So you can do pretty simple laboratory experiments

2266
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,836
and absorption experiments in a small number of people.

2267
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:23,670
This is due to like PK

2268
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,213
but not efficacy. Yeah, exactly.

2269
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,673
And that is what they all do.

2270
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,216
None of them do efficacy.

2271
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:29,593
So that makes them cheap

2272
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,095
and it makes them, plenty of them coming.

2273
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:34,514
But it has this side effect.

2274
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:36,182
I think it might be useful

2275
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:38,560
to have a way to flag medicines

2276
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,811
that before they go generic

2277
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:43,523
have this known dosing sensitivity.

2278
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:47,235
You know, again, back to the less binary regulatory,

2279
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:49,738
you know, a little more judgment where there's a dial.

2280
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,324
I think the manufacturing problems you mentioned are real.

2281
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:55,493
In the quest for low cost, it all moved offshore.

2282
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:57,245
These are basically chemical plants

2283
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:01,124
and in the prior iteration of that technology and our EPA,

2284
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:04,711
it became non-economic to make these medicines in the US

2285
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,671
or Ireland for that matter.

2286
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:08,840
There are some eastern European companies,

2287
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:11,676
there's a big Israeli company,

2288
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:13,178
there's several Indian companies,

2289
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,513
and many Chinese companies that are in this business.

2290
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:17,432
That's where these drugs come from.

2291
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:20,560
I think that is not so stable either.

2292
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,647
And we probably should pay a little bit more for generics.

2293
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,274
You sometimes read about injectable generics in particular

2294
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,150
that run short.

2295
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:30,320
That's a more complicated manufacturing process,

2296
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,156
so if you do it cheaply, you run into more problems.

2297
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:35,909
We probably should pay a little premium for resilience.

2298
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,746
Right now, that's not the situation.

2299
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:47,629
So GLPs obviously were initially researched,

2300
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:49,923
the initial R&D was done for diabetes.

2301
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:50,757
Yes.

2302
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:53,134
And then it was noticed during the clinical trials

2303
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:54,177
that people were losing weight.

2304
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:58,139
And so now I think the big societal discussion,

2305
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,224
like Patrick and I were talking about,

2306
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,851
"The Information" is a Silicon Valley tech publication

2307
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,770
and they ran a survey about GLP-1s

2308
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,731
and half of readers of "The Information" are on GLP-1s.

2309
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,692
In this part of the country. Exactly.

2310
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,318
As you can tell, it's not a normal region.

2311
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,945
Anyway, so there's the weight loss—

2312
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:13,071
But maybe in as much as Silicon Valley

2313
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,031
is some kind of harbinger of things to come.

2314
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:16,825
Could be, early adopters. Potentially.

2315
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:17,659
So there's this big— Tech forward.

2316
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:18,576
Weight loss discussion

2317
01:23:18,576 --> 01:23:19,411
and, you know, that's the,

2318
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:21,162
Ozempic is obviously, you know, a different brand name

2319
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:21,997
for a different drug,

2320
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,207
but people are very familiar with it.

2321
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:27,377
But now it seems like we are starting to figure out

2322
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:32,382
there are all these other potential benefits of GLPs

2323
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:36,761
that do not seem to be fully explained by the weight loss.

2324
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:38,722
And so there's the cardiovascular benefits,

2325
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,599
there's potential Alzheimer's links, there's fertility,

2326
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:42,434
there are all these things

2327
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,602
that aren't just, "You lost weight."

2328
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:46,396
What do you think is going on there?

2329
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:47,188
Explain.

2330
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:48,189
Yes. So first of all,

2331
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:51,317
it's different from what you just described as this accident

2332
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:52,569
because actually we knew

2333
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,237
and we were involved with the,

2334
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:55,864
we launched the first GLP-1 in the world.

2335
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:59,034
You're saying this is the triumph of rational design.

2336
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,410
It's not totally rational,

2337
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,704
but I can tell you that because the,

2338
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,622
so GLP-1, let's go all the way back,

2339
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:06,833
it's a super family of things we call incretins.

2340
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:10,253
These are hormones that signal our brain

2341
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:12,338
and other tissues from our gut.

2342
01:24:12,338 --> 01:24:14,591
We always think about our brain being in charge.

2343
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:15,759
That's not how we work.

2344
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,471
And it's back to this basic system of survival,

2345
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,139
which is nutrition— John's very aware

2346
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:21,973
of this.

2347
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:23,183
Nutrition. It's a joint oversight.

2348
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,518
When you eat a meal, which hopefully we'll do later,

2349
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,229
our gut actually communicates with the rest of the body,

2350
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,315
"Hey, food's on board.

2351
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:31,441
You don't have to eat as much."

2352
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,444
Maybe you get a satiation signal.

2353
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:37,572
Your fat cells are told to absorb free fatty acids.

2354
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:38,823
Your liver kicks into gear

2355
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:41,451
to release glycogen and other things.

2356
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:42,869
So all that process is,

2357
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:45,330
insulin is released to absorb the nutrients,

2358
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,790
is kicked off by incretins.

2359
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:50,376
This was discovered in 1971 basically,

2360
01:24:50,376 --> 01:24:51,628
called the incretin effect.

2361
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:53,213
It was a scientist who noticed

2362
01:24:53,213 --> 01:24:57,842
that if you feed someone an equivalent amount of pure sugar

2363
01:24:57,842 --> 01:25:01,554
versus stick it in their veins or arteries,

2364
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:05,016
that their insulin levels, their metabolic processes,

2365
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:07,227
rev up a lot faster.

2366
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,062
Interesting. It's called the incretin effect.

2367
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:13,274
So that the local process of ingestion through the gut

2368
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:14,692
created this other thing.

2369
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:17,987
That scientist and others then isolated GLP-1

2370
01:25:17,987 --> 01:25:20,657
and another one called GIP, actually isolated first.

2371
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,408
GIP and GLP make up tirzepatide,

2372
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:23,993
which is Zepbound and Mounjaro.

2373
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:26,913
GLP makes up semaglutide, which is Ozempic,

2374
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:29,040
and was also exenatide.

2375
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,127
The problem with these hormones is our own versions

2376
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,879
have a half-life of like five minutes.

2377
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:36,673
So they don't make very good drugs.

2378
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,842
If you take that protein and sequence it,

2379
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:40,135
people did this,

2380
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,595
you'd have to walk around with an infusion all day.

2381
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:45,306
So the longer-lasting action was the invention.

2382
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:46,224
Was the invention.

2383
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,517
And the first one that was,

2384
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:48,393
before we really knew

2385
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,311
how to do protein engineering systematically,

2386
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,230
which we can do now,

2387
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,482
it was found in nature actually,

2388
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:58,194
famously, in the saliva of a Gila monster.

2389
01:25:58,194 --> 01:26:00,780
So randomly some zoologist was testing

2390
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,992
the interesting properties of Gila monsters and noticed,

2391
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,160
and profiled all these proteins,

2392
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,912
and one of them was a mimetic of human GLP-1.

2393
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:10,498
And, you know, did a literature search and found that.

2394
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,167
Another scientist found that paper

2395
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,418
and said, "That's interesting.

2396
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,586
Let's test that compound,"

2397
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,171
a few different amino acids,

2398
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:19,883
and sure enough, it lasted about four hours half-life.

2399
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:22,302
So we can make it a twice a day injection.

2400
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:25,013
We made that into a medicine for diabetes.

2401
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:27,140
And on the cover of our annual report in 2006,

2402
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,642
there's a woman who was one of the first patients

2403
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:31,853
with a quote, says, "My diabetes is under control

2404
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,939
and my friends say I'm losing a little weight."

2405
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:36,482
That was 2006.

2406
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:37,901
So this overnight phenomenon

2407
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,820
of Ozempic and everything else, old story.

2408
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:41,654
Why didn't we do it then?

2409
01:26:41,654 --> 01:26:44,657
Well, we needed to get the dosages higher.

2410
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:46,910
And it turns out that this mechanism,

2411
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,828
which is common for a lot of hormones,

2412
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:52,040
has a threshold effect for efficacy.

2413
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,209
You have to get above a certain level in your blood,

2414
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,544
and certainly to lose weight and really suppress appetite,

2415
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:58,254
have to get that number up,

2416
01:26:58,254 --> 01:27:01,382
but a peak-to-trough effect on side effects.

2417
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:04,886
So the up-down part causes the nausea,

2418
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,639
but the absolute level causes the effect.

2419
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:08,848
So how do you separate those things?

2420
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,475
You need a flat long-acting.

2421
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,143
It wasn't just convenience.

2422
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:15,271
So we made a once a week GLP-1 called dulaglutide.

2423
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:17,857
We stuck the protein, the native sequence,

2424
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:20,944
to the backbone of basically a monoclonal antibody

2425
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,445
to extend its life.

2426
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:23,821
Novo Nordisk did a similar thing.

2427
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:25,740
That became semaglutide and Ozempic.

2428
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,493
And then we put the original two hormones together,

2429
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,828
GIP/GLP, in tirzepatide,

2430
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:33,289
which is better than those in terms of weight loss

2431
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:35,124
and A1C control and everything else.

2432
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:38,670
And so with those tools, we're now exploring this terrain

2433
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,673
of what is linked to this pathway.

2434
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,883
I would say most of what we know and have proven

2435
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:46,886
is actually right on the obesity target.

2436
01:27:46,886 --> 01:27:50,348
So if you think overweight has these untoward,

2437
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,392
chronic overweight, untoward effects,

2438
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:53,977
our ancestors weren't chronically overweight.

2439
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:55,353
They were chronically starving.

2440
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:58,022
So we didn't worry about this, but now we worry about it.

2441
01:27:58,022 --> 01:28:00,775
Which are diabetes, type II diabetes,

2442
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:02,568
not the type I form of children,

2443
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:05,530
cardiovascular health, atherosclerosis,

2444
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:09,951
stroke, MI, peripheral artery disease,

2445
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:13,079
kidney and liver diseases, fatty liver diseases.

2446
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:15,540
These are all sort of right on that target.

2447
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,667
Adjacent to that are other conditions

2448
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:19,544
we think of more unrelated

2449
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:20,962
but actually have a big,

2450
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,089
not a perfect Venn diagram, but close enough.

2451
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,674
One is like sleep apnea.

2452
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:27,051
So like 70% of people with sleep apnea

2453
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:30,138
actually have overweight or obesity.

2454
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:32,682
Polycystic ovarian disease is a,

2455
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,559
young women get this and they don't ovulate,

2456
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:35,768
they can't have babies.

2457
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:37,729
So that's a fertility problem.

2458
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:40,106
So the circle widens.

2459
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:41,524
I think the two,

2460
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:43,443
and there are more of those

2461
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:44,694
which are being studied and looked at.

2462
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,404
The two interesting things

2463
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:48,948
which are more incidental to the mechanism

2464
01:28:48,948 --> 01:28:50,783
but are definitely on the mechanism

2465
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:53,786
are the brain things and the inflammation things.

2466
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:56,789
So if you look at people's blood values

2467
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:58,916
for cholesterol or glucose,

2468
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:01,586
over the course of three to six, eight months,

2469
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:02,545
on the medicine,

2470
01:29:02,545 --> 01:29:05,548
they fall pretty straight line with weight.

2471
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:09,302
But inflammation markers drop precipitously early.

2472
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:12,430
There's a marker called CRP, C-reactive protein,

2473
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,640
which is a marker for heart attack risk.

2474
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:19,228
In weeks, that starts to drop, really like 60%-70%.

2475
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:20,313
Why is that happening?

2476
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:22,273
It's dislocated from the drug effect.

2477
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:27,278
But probably the stress of effectively overeating,

2478
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,738
not by our modern definition

2479
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:30,907
but by our ancestral definition,

2480
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,867
is causing inflammation

2481
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:36,788
and reducing that by having more fasting basically,

2482
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:39,040
lower calorie levels,

2483
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,291
reduces inflammation.

2484
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:41,876
We have a study reading out toward the end of this year

2485
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,795
in chronic knee pain.

2486
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,421
It's going to work.

2487
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:47,131
And that's a weird thing is,

2488
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:48,674
"Well, wait a minute, GLP-1, chronic,"

2489
01:29:48,674 --> 01:29:50,760
but if you follow that logic train,

2490
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,845
it actually makes good sense.

2491
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:54,722
Also inflammation causing the chronic knee pain.

2492
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:55,765
Inflammation plus,

2493
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,934
and we'll measure the inflammation in the joint,

2494
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:00,812
plus there's a mechanical loading with being overweight.

2495
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,398
If you carry around a backpack of 40 pounds extra every day,

2496
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,315
your knees will hurt more.

2497
01:30:04,315 --> 01:30:05,566
So, sorry— But then the brain ones,

2498
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:06,609
sorry, yeah, go ahead. Well, I was just going to,

2499
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:07,443
so you're just saying

2500
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:11,948
that being over-sated causes inflammation,

2501
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:12,824
which then causes

2502
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:17,078
all these ostensibly unrelated downstream issues.

2503
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:19,705
Yeah, and you see this in chronic inflammatory diseases.

2504
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:22,750
So think of, well, the signature one is a skin disease

2505
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,336
called hidradenitis suppurativa.

2506
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:26,170
A terrible name.

2507
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:29,006
But people get basically boils,

2508
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:31,634
and it's almost completely correlated

2509
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:33,719
with excess body weight.

2510
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:36,806
And we have very expensive inflammatory drugs

2511
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:37,974
that have fancy targets

2512
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,017
and are monoclonal antibodies you inject

2513
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:42,019
and they cost $4,000 a month

2514
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:43,563
or you can just lose weight.

2515
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:46,357
And so people are using Zepbound our drug in this

2516
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:48,734
and they don't have this condition anymore.

2517
01:30:48,734 --> 01:30:50,528
Another one which has high correlation

2518
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,447
is psoriasis actually.

2519
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,281
So we're doing a study

2520
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,616
with our psoriasis drug Taltz and Zepbound.

2521
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,243
That will read out this fall

2522
01:30:57,243 --> 01:31:00,413
and I'm certain will show a boost in efficacy

2523
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:01,831
with the weight loss.

2524
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:04,083
And that is not because of the weight loss per se.

2525
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,918
It's the inflammatory effects.

2526
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:07,253
So it's pretty interesting.

2527
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:08,713
And there's a lot of these adult diseases

2528
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:11,048
that are inflammatory in their root.

2529
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,259
Of course, we'll study RI.

2530
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:15,678
We have studies going in Crohn's and colitis as well.

2531
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:17,847
So the brain stuff.

2532
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:20,433
So clearly these drugs go to the brain

2533
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:21,934
and they signal the brain.

2534
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:25,188
I think the scientists say the major mechanism of that

2535
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:26,564
is actually not in the brain,

2536
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,191
but there's a part of your brain stem

2537
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:31,319
exposed to the blood system, like your ganglion root,

2538
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:35,531
and it is detecting these hormones on purpose,

2539
01:31:35,531 --> 01:31:36,574
which are satiety,

2540
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:39,410
but the signal being communicated to your nerve cells

2541
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:42,747
isn't as pristine as, like, "Stop eating pure sugar,"

2542
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:44,624
which is what GLP-1 should be saying,

2543
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:47,335
or GIP, which is more of a lipid mechanism.

2544
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,587
It's just saying, "You are satiated."

2545
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:54,175
That signal gets translated into downregulating dopamine

2546
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,093
and the desire for dopamine.

2547
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:58,221
And so like cigarette smoking drops

2548
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,597
precipitously. effects.

2549
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:00,806
Yeah, right.

2550
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:02,808
And opioid use disorder will test,

2551
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:04,894
alcohol drops precipitously. Shopping, everything.

2552
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:06,562
Yeah, your cheeky pint.

2553
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:10,233
It'd have to be a zero alcohol pint.

2554
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:11,317
Shopping, gambling.

2555
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:13,319
These things have been observed anecdotally.

2556
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:15,571
These studies are being spun up and worked on.

2557
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:17,365
The category of brain,

2558
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,158
which may be related to this axis

2559
01:32:19,158 --> 01:32:21,869
or there's another theory of, which is sort of,

2560
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,247
I know people out here like to do podcasts about,

2561
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:27,166
"Hey, I take microdoses of Zepbound

2562
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:30,253
and I feel like I can code longer," or whatever, right?

2563
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:35,383
Back to your pieces of experimental hacking your body.

2564
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,217
There is a—

2565
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:37,468
I'm sure there are people in Silicon Valley

2566
01:32:37,468 --> 01:32:38,636
experimenting abundantly with this.

2567
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,137
There is a theory of this

2568
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:42,932
that, actually, the glucose lowering mechanism,

2569
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:44,684
and your brain only eats glucose,

2570
01:32:44,684 --> 01:32:46,644
it doesn't eat any other substance,

2571
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:48,646
it's unique tissue that way,

2572
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:53,651
of having ketonic, kind of low glucose chronically

2573
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:57,238
actually improves brain acuity.

2574
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,282
And so people are probably experiencing this.

2575
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:00,408
They might be lean already

2576
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,827
and taking a GLP-1 and getting leaner,

2577
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:04,620
but they're actually,

2578
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:07,290
they feel their brain functioning in a sharper way.

2579
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,667
There's an interesting study that Novo Nordisk is doing

2580
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,752
with their oral form of semaglutide

2581
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:13,421
that'll read out pretty soon

2582
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,631
in patients who have early dementia.

2583
01:33:16,507 --> 01:33:19,760
That may work and it may work for the same reason.

2584
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,929
It may also work because you reduce strokes,

2585
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:24,557
which is back to the cardiovascular axis.

2586
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:27,268
But, yeah, I think we've stumbled upon here

2587
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:31,772
kind of a broad footprint, a broad impact zone,

2588
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:34,108
of what these types of medicines can do.

2589
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:35,276
And there's many more coming.

2590
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:38,112
So neurodegenerative disease, Crohn's disease,

2591
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:40,197
psoriasis, cardiovascular disease.

2592
01:33:40,197 --> 01:33:41,824
Joint disease. Joint disease, exactly.

2593
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:43,284
All the diseases.

2594
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:46,162
What fraction of the population,

2595
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:48,456
let's say the population over 35,

2596
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:52,376
will be on a GLP-1 in 15 years?

2597
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:54,754
Well, today in the US,

2598
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:57,506
we probably have 10 million people, maybe 12,

2599
01:33:57,506 --> 01:34:00,134
if we include the compounded market,

2600
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:03,262
the non-approved drugs. I was going to ask about that.

2601
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:06,599
That's the official company line.

2602
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:08,476
Exactly. Well, yeah.

2603
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,853
But it's really a fraction of the adult population,

2604
01:34:10,853 --> 01:34:12,772
and even if you just take obesity,

2605
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:14,398
it should be a hundred million.

2606
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:15,775
We have a long, long way to go.

2607
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:16,609
And I think we talked

2608
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:17,943
at the beginning of the conversation about coverage.

2609
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:21,405
That's, of course, both a real cost burden on people

2610
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:24,492
but also kind of an endorsement thing.

2611
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:25,660
And physicians are busy

2612
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,119
and don't have time to write all the forms

2613
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:28,287
to get it covered.

2614
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:31,082
So, I mean, the popularity of the direct channel

2615
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:32,291
where people with some means,

2616
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:34,043
I mean, $500 a month is a big ask.

2617
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:35,211
It's a car payment.

2618
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:37,838
But a fair swath of the US can afford that.

2619
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,093
Actually, the number one prescribed form

2620
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,387
of these medications is Zepbound self-buy.

2621
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,807
We sell more than that than our insured business.

2622
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:49,350
Wow. New patient starts,

2623
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,559
and more than all of Wegovy.

2624
01:34:50,559 --> 01:34:52,228
That's very interesting. Yeah.

2625
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:53,771
So that's why I was,

2626
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:55,898
the concept of like, "Okay, for preventative,

2627
01:34:55,898 --> 01:34:57,650
maybe it should be on us.

2628
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:01,112
And how do we just make that cost effective and easier?"

2629
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:03,614
And certainly there's a cost of your time

2630
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:06,367
and shopping online and having a telehealth appointment

2631
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,827
is much more convenient.

2632
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:10,246
So the number has to go way up.

2633
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:12,456
The oral project I mentioned is a key part of that

2634
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:16,377
because we've literally already made billions of doses

2635
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,796
and we are capacity constrained in some sense

2636
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:20,339
on the injectable systems.

2637
01:35:20,339 --> 01:35:24,343
Unfortunately, there's not a good learning curve left.

2638
01:35:24,343 --> 01:35:26,345
We've sort of built the scaled plants.

2639
01:35:26,345 --> 01:35:28,347
We just have to build more of them.

2640
01:35:28,347 --> 01:35:30,725
We've built six or seven of these mega plants

2641
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:35,688
that produce hundreds of millions of these injection systems

2642
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:38,524
and we're only treating 10 or 12 million Americans,

2643
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:40,484
maybe 20, 30 globally.

2644
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:43,028
So to get to half a billion people globally,

2645
01:35:43,028 --> 01:35:44,613
that's not the path. The orals have to work.

2646
01:35:44,613 --> 01:35:46,157
We can't keep stamping out these.

2647
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:46,991
It'll take too long.

2648
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:49,201
The orals have to work, they have to be approved.

2649
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:50,286
They're not going to be as good

2650
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:53,080
as these multi-acting injectable hormones,

2651
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,623
but we can probably stratify people.

2652
01:35:54,623 --> 01:35:56,500
If you need to lose a lot of weight, okay, start there.

2653
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,545
And maintenance with the oral is going to be a key segment.

2654
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:02,923
I would guess by the time we go generic,

2655
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:05,843
it will be a large proportion of adults.

2656
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:08,095
Statins got to 40 million people branded.

2657
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:09,472
It's a little more than that now.

2658
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,723
Has to be north of that.

2659
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:12,725
It's interesting that all the growth in statins happened

2660
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:14,059
even while it was branded.

2661
01:36:14,059 --> 01:36:16,437
You know, you'd expect a big bump after it went generic.

2662
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:18,314
Well, you asked about consumer advertising

2663
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:20,191
and I think actually,

2664
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:22,318
people hate the commercial part of our business.

2665
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,904
I have to admit, like, sometimes I dislike it.

2666
01:36:25,738 --> 01:36:27,948
I never watch TV except when I'm traveling

2667
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:30,326
and I'll flip on CNBC in the morning while I'm getting ready

2668
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,243
or especially on the West Coast

2669
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:33,829
'cause I'm up at like 6 or 5:30

2670
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:34,914
and I'm like, "Are you kidding me?

2671
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:38,042
Like, how many ads are we running, and everyone else?"

2672
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:41,295
And often it's the same drug class like this.

2673
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:43,047
This cannot be productive.

2674
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:47,051
I have to say, 70% of our spend now is not on linear TV.

2675
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:49,887
So mostly advertising is more served up

2676
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:51,972
and in your search sequence

2677
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:53,641
and increasingly we're interested

2678
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:57,269
in, like, generative AI optimization.

2679
01:36:57,269 --> 01:37:00,606
But still you do it. Why do you do it?

2680
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:01,524
Because it works.

2681
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:03,150
Like, it's still a productive spend.

2682
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:05,444
But also promotion to physicians,

2683
01:37:05,444 --> 01:37:06,570
which consumers don't see,

2684
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,197
is a big part of what we do.

2685
01:37:08,197 --> 01:37:10,449
And we do studies and we disseminate them

2686
01:37:10,449 --> 01:37:12,785
and we run education programs.

2687
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:14,453
Mostly if left to their own,

2688
01:37:14,453 --> 01:37:15,538
and there's been studies on this

2689
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:17,998
of medical inventions that are not promoted.

2690
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:19,208
Yeah, they won't actually be adopted.

2691
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:22,670
It's about a 16-year path to full adoption.

2692
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,172
With the medicine promoted, it's half that.

2693
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:27,007
We have an internal goal to halve that again,

2694
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:31,053
to get to four years to full, whatever it is, get to it

2695
01:37:31,053 --> 01:37:32,221
on a global scale.

2696
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:33,889
I think it's ambitious but serves a purpose.

2697
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:35,641
LLMs presumably help here.

2698
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:36,684
Could be, yeah.

2699
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:37,601
If we can get in the,

2700
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:40,020
if we can get through the problem

2701
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,105
of convoluting the facts.

2702
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,774
Yeah, you need to have education seminars

2703
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:44,650
for the LLMs. For the LLMs, yeah.

2704
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:46,861
If they weren't so trained on Reddit,

2705
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,153
it might be a little better.

2706
01:37:48,153 --> 01:37:49,196
Let's train them on the New England Journal of Medicine.

2707
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:51,907
Well, okay, you've mentioned Reddit.

2708
01:37:51,907 --> 01:37:55,703
And you just mentioned the microdosing of tirzepatide

2709
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:57,121
in Silicon Valley.

2710
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:58,080
Yeah.

2711
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,874
Not recommending, not indicated.

2712
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:00,875
Understood. To be clear.

2713
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:01,792
This is not a promotional setting.

2714
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:03,294
Do not ask your physician.

2715
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:04,378
Exactly.

2716
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:06,130
But my understanding

2717
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,966
is the avant-garde Silicon Valley denizens,

2718
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:12,177
you know, the frontier is really in Chinese peptides.

2719
01:38:13,053 --> 01:38:13,888
Yeah, frightening.

2720
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,389
So here we're getting into the compounding.

2721
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:18,684
So, of course, there's probably always been

2722
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:19,727
a segment of society

2723
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:24,106
that was comfortable using unapproved things.

2724
01:38:24,106 --> 01:38:26,567
We have a large supplement industry in this country

2725
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:31,113
that has some proximity to this MAHA thing, by the way.

2726
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,657
Most supplements have no evidence

2727
01:38:33,657 --> 01:38:35,868
that they're going to help you.

2728
01:38:35,868 --> 01:38:37,620
I take a multivitamin,

2729
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,664
but I really don't believe in anything else.

2730
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:43,334
And I think if you're eating correctly,

2731
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,045
you should be getting better nutrition through your food

2732
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:47,212
than through supplements anyway.

2733
01:38:47,212 --> 01:38:50,007
And it's embedded in the price at least.

2734
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:52,468
I mean, you may have to buy more expensive food.

2735
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:56,305
But that same tranche or the edge of that is gone to this.

2736
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:57,348
What is a Chinese peptide?

2737
01:38:57,348 --> 01:39:01,018
It's an unapproved medicine that's never been tested in man

2738
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:02,436
and is made in a Chinese lab.

2739
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:03,812
It might be what you say.

2740
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:06,357
This is basically the same source

2741
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:10,694
for the tirzepatide compounded that people get.

2742
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:12,363
People buy that from things

2743
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:14,156
that look like legitimate companies,

2744
01:39:14,156 --> 01:39:16,200
some are publicly traded even,

2745
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,036
that formulate them and are violating our patent.

2746
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:23,248
And maybe under FDA supervision or not these plants,

2747
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:24,333
most not.

2748
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:26,502
I know of one that's been inspected.

2749
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:28,921
It had a nasty, what we call 483

2750
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:31,048
with lots of inspection findings.

2751
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:32,049
I certainly wouldn't do that,

2752
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:35,761
but, of course, I run a company that does this legitimately.

2753
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:39,264
My problem with those companies is less about trying to,

2754
01:39:39,264 --> 01:39:41,433
I like the fact that people could shortcut

2755
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:45,062
the pain in the butt of the healthcare system and go direct

2756
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:46,021
and we see the phenomena

2757
01:39:46,021 --> 01:39:47,856
of what the internet's done to commerce

2758
01:39:47,856 --> 01:39:49,024
could apply to health.

2759
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:50,359
I think that's net a good thing.

2760
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:52,945
What I don't like is they're stealing my IP.

2761
01:39:52,945 --> 01:39:55,239
Partly people got in this business,

2762
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,241
the rule that guides this,

2763
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,536
actually they technically should not be doing, some do.

2764
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:01,537
The big ones don't.

2765
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:02,788
They say, "Oh, we're not following that rule.

2766
01:40:02,788 --> 01:40:05,624
We're following a different rule, which is customization."

2767
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:07,584
All these patients who need tirzepatide,

2768
01:40:07,584 --> 01:40:11,046
even though you can buy six different dosage forms,

2769
01:40:11,046 --> 01:40:13,590
they need a dose in between these six,

2770
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:18,512
or, oh, the efficacy is boosted by vitamin XYZ.

2771
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:20,472
By the way, we recently sent to the FDA

2772
01:40:20,472 --> 01:40:22,433
studies of these vitamin combinations

2773
01:40:22,433 --> 01:40:24,643
that show they actually augment the peptide.

2774
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:28,188
So they're making a new drug never approved.

2775
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:29,398
Not a good idea.

2776
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:31,942
And then you have the folks you're talking about

2777
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:34,486
who are served by an industry

2778
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:37,865
started when I think steroids became a big deal

2779
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:39,033
and the bodybuilding craze.

2780
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:42,703
They're all based in like Long Beach these places.

2781
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:45,998
And it's like Peptides USA,

2782
01:40:45,998 --> 01:40:47,499
which is the opposite of what it is, right?

2783
01:40:47,499 --> 01:40:49,043
It's Chinese peptides.

2784
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:50,127
And they'll sell things to you

2785
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:51,378
that say, "Not for human use."

2786
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:54,256
Literally, that's how they protect themselves legally.

2787
01:40:54,256 --> 01:40:55,132
And you're injecting,

2788
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:56,133
you're putting saline in

2789
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:58,177
and you're putting this white powder in your body

2790
01:40:58,177 --> 01:40:59,845
that says, "Not for human use."

2791
01:40:59,845 --> 01:41:01,472
Really a terrible idea.

2792
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:02,931
I know some people find success with it.

2793
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:04,683
At some point through that process,

2794
01:41:04,683 --> 01:41:06,018
you would suggest there are several clues

2795
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:07,269
as to how ill-advised it is.

2796
01:41:07,269 --> 01:41:09,021
Yeah, and it's not going to end well.

2797
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:11,732
And there are people who've had chronic kidney failure

2798
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:13,984
and permanent liver damage.

2799
01:41:13,984 --> 01:41:15,319
And I wouldn't do it.

2800
01:41:16,695 --> 01:41:17,654
The difference between that

2801
01:41:17,654 --> 01:41:19,865
and today buying a real thing for $500

2802
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:22,201
seems like a relatively large risk

2803
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:23,994
for the cost savings we're achieving.

2804
01:41:23,994 --> 01:41:24,828
And I'm telling you today,

2805
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:27,039
we're going to bring these prices down,

2806
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:28,165
either through your insurance coverage,

2807
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:29,583
which is expanding every day,

2808
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:31,460
or just through competition, for sure.

2809
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:32,419
And your direct stuff.

2810
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:33,962
I mean, we've talked about it once or twice.

2811
01:41:33,962 --> 01:41:35,380
You're here in South San Francisco,

2812
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:37,049
the headquarters of not only,

2813
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:39,301
or, you know, the place of Genentech,

2814
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:40,594
but also payments innovation.

2815
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:42,012
And so you— Yes, here we are.

2816
01:41:42,012 --> 01:41:45,015
We're working together on the Eli Direct stuff.

2817
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:46,266
Maybe you can talk a bit about that.

2818
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:49,478
Yeah, I mean, talk about accidental experiments.

2819
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:51,688
So this came out, back to the insulin story,

2820
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:54,483
the person who was running our US business,

2821
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,777
commercial business directly, retired.

2822
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:58,195
And I didn't have a suitable candidate internally.

2823
01:41:58,195 --> 01:41:59,279
So I thought it'd be a good idea

2824
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:00,697
to go back to that job I used to do

2825
01:42:00,697 --> 01:42:02,324
and be the CEO at the same time.

2826
01:42:02,324 --> 01:42:03,158
The team— Oh, this is very inspiring.

2827
01:42:03,158 --> 01:42:03,992
The team in the US

2828
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:08,622
didn't find this inspiring or a good idea,

2829
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:11,792
but I was, you know, kind of the business was changing

2830
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:15,295
and the rise of the consumer,

2831
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:17,005
communication on digital channels.

2832
01:42:17,005 --> 01:42:18,674
We were pretty old school at that time

2833
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:20,551
and I wanted to modernize it.

2834
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:22,678
And so I dug in and one of the ideas that came out of that

2835
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:25,305
was, "Hey, why don't we stand up our own pharmacy

2836
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:27,182
and sell directly to patients?"

2837
01:42:27,182 --> 01:42:28,225
And then people were like,

2838
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:30,185
"Well, first of all, the existing pharmacies,

2839
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:31,687
and there's only like three of them,

2840
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,105
will hate us.

2841
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:35,023
And so that seems like a bad idea.

2842
01:42:35,023 --> 01:42:37,484
And secondly, we know nothing about running a pharmacy

2843
01:42:37,484 --> 01:42:40,654
so we're going to make mistakes and hurt people."

2844
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:42,489
So we kind of parked it.

2845
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:46,285
A few months later, though, we were in this process

2846
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:47,995
I described in long form earlier,

2847
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:52,291
but in short form of, like, deescalating this insulin bubble

2848
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:54,835
and getting to sort of true pricing in the market.

2849
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:56,670
And one of the fights we were having

2850
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:59,339
was with a large PBM company

2851
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:01,884
that also owns a pharmacy chain.

2852
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:04,428
And we were worried that they actually,

2853
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:05,846
a different pharmacy chain actually threatened

2854
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:07,389
not to carry our low-price insulin

2855
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:09,516
'cause they couldn't make enough money on it.

2856
01:43:09,516 --> 01:43:11,185
So I just looked at him

2857
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:12,477
and said, "This is what this was for,

2858
01:43:12,477 --> 01:43:14,104
this idea that's been on the shelf.

2859
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:15,564
We cannot be beholden to this.

2860
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:18,442
We have to have a route to market ourselves,"

2861
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:19,526
which we had not had

2862
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:22,988
since the company was founded as a pharmacy,

2863
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:25,824
actually a freestanding pharmacy before any regulation.

2864
01:43:25,824 --> 01:43:26,700
So it was scary,

2865
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,702
but we cobbled it together with partners

2866
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:30,370
and now we do more of it ourselves.

2867
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,247
And the first idea was, like, make sure people

2868
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:33,373
who need insulin to survive

2869
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:35,667
can get it at the lowest price.

2870
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:37,502
We sold a little bit, but not much.

2871
01:43:37,502 --> 01:43:39,046
Then we launched our migraine medicine,

2872
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:40,589
which was having trouble getting insurance coverage,

2873
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:41,965
sold a little bit more.

2874
01:43:41,965 --> 01:43:43,091
Then we launched Zepbound

2875
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:45,177
and we said, "Ah, this feels like the killer app

2876
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:47,012
for a direct-to-patient experience

2877
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:49,765
because the diagnosis step is dead easy."

2878
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:50,641
Everybody knows,

2879
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:53,018
everyone knows the biomarker tool in their bathroom.

2880
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:54,269
It's called the scale.

2881
01:43:54,269 --> 01:43:56,146
They can know if the drug's working,

2882
01:43:56,146 --> 01:43:59,191
and we can offer telehealth post-pandemic at scale,

2883
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:01,693
it was out there, a third party,

2884
01:44:01,693 --> 01:44:03,445
to advise patients if that was the right choice

2885
01:44:03,445 --> 01:44:06,073
or if the Novo product was the right choice or nothing.

2886
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:07,282
And so we put that together

2887
01:44:07,282 --> 01:44:10,827
and, boom, this thing really grew pretty quickly.

2888
01:44:10,827 --> 01:44:13,247
Today, we'll annualize,

2889
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:15,624
you know, in the billions of dollars.

2890
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:20,420
I think it's the largest prescription platform online

2891
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:21,296
in terms of revenue.

2892
01:44:21,296 --> 01:44:22,673
We run it on Stripe I think.

2893
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:24,341
And going north from here.

2894
01:44:24,341 --> 01:44:25,634
And it's an interesting example

2895
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:28,053
of how across so many different sectors

2896
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:31,848
and, you know, across every company scale and stage,

2897
01:44:31,848 --> 01:44:36,061
there is this interesting way

2898
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:38,480
in which all these ostensibly different models

2899
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,440
and different businesses are discovering—

2900
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,192
They leap, right? They leap across.

2901
01:44:42,192 --> 01:44:43,151
Well, they're discovering the value

2902
01:44:43,151 --> 01:44:46,321
of having a direct relationship with the end customer.

2903
01:44:46,321 --> 01:44:47,781
And, of course, I'm on the board of Adobe,

2904
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:48,699
a software company,

2905
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:52,327
which is, this is now in the final stage of evolution

2906
01:44:52,327 --> 01:44:53,704
in the software industry,

2907
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:55,789
but I found it fascinating when I first arrived

2908
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:59,668
that 90% of the revenue was off a website that they ran.

2909
01:44:59,668 --> 01:45:01,336
I thought that was, "What?

2910
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:02,713
This is a great business."

2911
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:04,256
A very low-cost business.

2912
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,091
Very low-cost route to market, global.

2913
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:08,010
We're very in favor of selling stuff on websites.

2914
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:09,219
Yeah, exactly. I'm sure you are.

2915
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:11,513
You had this insight even before for me.

2916
01:45:11,513 --> 01:45:14,433
And so, yeah, you know, that leap is happening.

2917
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:17,477
Now, healthcare has been a hard problem for tech, I think,

2918
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:18,687
which is interesting,

2919
01:45:18,687 --> 01:45:21,106
because you have all this bricks and mortar mess.

2920
01:45:21,106 --> 01:45:23,442
You have a lot of state level insurance regulation.

2921
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:26,486
You'd think FinTech would've gone after this a lot sooner

2922
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:28,905
'cause it's 20% of the financial economy in the country.

2923
01:45:28,905 --> 01:45:30,324
Well, I think this podcast makes clear

2924
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:32,659
that there are nuances to the sector.

2925
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:33,577
Exactly.

2926
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:34,703
I guess so, yeah.

2927
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:37,164
But, you know, I think people with longer money

2928
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:39,416
are starting to do it.

2929
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:42,377
We actually ourselves just moved our PBM

2930
01:45:42,377 --> 01:45:43,378
from a traditional one

2931
01:45:43,378 --> 01:45:47,049
to this sort of new tech, fintech-y PBM

2932
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:48,550
and we're switching all our lives

2933
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:51,511
and we want more transparency, better data reporting,

2934
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:54,431
and the interoperability problem that is why PBMs rose,

2935
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:56,183
which was that you had a card,

2936
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:57,017
like a physical card

2937
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:59,770
that had your insurance number on it in 1992

2938
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,688
and you went into a pharmacy in Phoenix

2939
01:46:01,688 --> 01:46:02,522
versus one in LA

2940
01:46:02,522 --> 01:46:04,316
and you couldn't get your prescription filled,

2941
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:07,027
they solved that problem with old tech.

2942
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:08,153
That's a pretty easy problem

2943
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:10,447
to solve these days with technology.

2944
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:12,449
But what they built on the back of that

2945
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:17,454
was a system of negotiating and capture, rent taking,

2946
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:19,831
that's not so popular anymore

2947
01:46:19,831 --> 01:46:22,584
and we can disintermediate them easily.

2948
01:46:22,584 --> 01:46:25,128
We've been having this conversation for quite some time

2949
01:46:25,128 --> 01:46:26,713
and we haven't asked you—

2950
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:27,756
With one beer.

2951
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:30,634
Well, we can rectify that,

2952
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:34,262
but we haven't asked you maybe one of the first questions

2953
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:35,972
that we ought to have asked you,

2954
01:46:35,972 --> 01:46:38,517
which is Eli Lilly is the largest pharma company

2955
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:40,143
in the world.

2956
01:46:40,143 --> 01:46:41,603
Why?

2957
01:46:41,603 --> 01:46:42,813
Well, in simple terms,

2958
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:46,483
we are kind of a rare situation right now

2959
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:50,195
in that our growth rate is high

2960
01:46:50,195 --> 01:46:52,823
and our profitability is expanding

2961
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:56,618
and we are in an early cycle of this invention.

2962
01:46:56,618 --> 01:46:57,953
I think Wall Street believes—

2963
01:46:57,953 --> 01:46:59,663
This being? GLP-1s,

2964
01:46:59,663 --> 01:47:00,747
which is driving probably 80%

2965
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:02,707
of the economic value of the company.

2966
01:47:02,707 --> 01:47:04,751
Our market cap is about— You think Eli Lilly

2967
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:06,711
is a GLP-1 company

2968
01:47:06,711 --> 01:47:09,339
with a sidecar— Sidecar.

2969
01:47:09,339 --> 01:47:11,216
Of some other of some other stuff?

2970
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:12,843
Yeah, that's probably trading like other,

2971
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,469
okay, so in our sector today,

2972
01:47:14,469 --> 01:47:17,973
let's pick a company like Bristol Myers or Pfizer.

2973
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:18,932
These are big companies

2974
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:21,226
with revenues not so different from ours

2975
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:23,520
and we compete with them in these other spaces.

2976
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,773
Their market cap's between $100-$200 billion.

2977
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:28,358
We're trading about $800 billion,

2978
01:47:28,358 --> 01:47:31,862
and that difference is the GLP-1 phenomena.

2979
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:33,989
I think Wall Street also believes

2980
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:37,534
that our R&D productivity has been higher.

2981
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:40,412
So every dollar we put through the income statement for R&D

2982
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:41,788
or through an acquisition,

2983
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:45,000
we get a little bit of a premium, a management premium on.

2984
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,378
I think most of the sector is treated the opposite way,

2985
01:47:48,378 --> 01:47:49,880
which is that that's actually probably going

2986
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,798
to destroy value in some way.

2987
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:57,137
And I think the other thing that's out there

2988
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:59,473
is this belief that perhaps,

2989
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,266
for those that are really long our stock,

2990
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:05,979
our belief that perhaps this cycle could be different,

2991
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:07,981
this cycle starting with GLP-1s,

2992
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:09,357
but that you could create,

2993
01:48:09,357 --> 01:48:11,610
back to the route to market and the consumer,

2994
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:15,363
much more of a self-pay branded business

2995
01:48:15,363 --> 01:48:18,200
that has staying power beyond—

2996
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,534
Franchise value. The patent cycle.

2997
01:48:19,534 --> 01:48:21,453
Franchise value. Thank you.

2998
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,331
And I think so far, the evidence is pointing that way.

2999
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:27,334
Have we fully evolved to a mature version of that? No.

3000
01:48:27,334 --> 01:48:30,003
Have we created like an ecosystem around ourselves

3001
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:31,004
like Apple has done?

3002
01:48:31,004 --> 01:48:31,838
No, no.

3003
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:33,465
Those are all opportunities for us,

3004
01:48:33,465 --> 01:48:35,091
but you can kind of see them.

3005
01:48:35,091 --> 01:48:37,302
And self-care is an innate desire,

3006
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:39,304
and I don't think the payment system's

3007
01:48:39,304 --> 01:48:41,056
going to fully cover all this,

3008
01:48:41,056 --> 01:48:42,599
but a lot of people are willing to pay

3009
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:43,558
and it's not just the US.

3010
01:48:43,558 --> 01:48:45,435
It's a global phenomenon.

3011
01:48:45,435 --> 01:48:47,103
You said GLPs are one of the biggest drivers

3012
01:48:47,103 --> 01:48:48,772
of the business.

3013
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:52,108
Eli Lilly's growing at about 30% right now revenues?

3014
01:48:52,108 --> 01:48:53,443
40% year-to-date. Oh, wow.

3015
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:54,945
We'll have earnings on,

3016
01:48:54,945 --> 01:48:56,905
yeah, actually here's a fun fact.

3017
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:59,699
There's three scaled large cap companies

3018
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,117
that have a rule of 80.

3019
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:03,787
Can you name them?

3020
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:06,915
Stripe's doing pretty well, but—

3021
01:49:06,915 --> 01:49:08,041
NVIDIA must be—

3022
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:09,626
NVIDIA is the highest.

3023
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:11,211
I think they're over 90.

3024
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:13,213
Margin plus growth.

3025
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:14,965
CoreWeave?

3026
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:15,799
I think that's,

3027
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:18,343
considering you're talking the CEO of Eli Lilly, please.

3028
01:49:18,343 --> 01:49:20,345
So top hundred market small caps out there.

3029
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:22,931
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3030
01:49:22,931 --> 01:49:25,850
So it's based quite close to where we're sitting.

3031
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:27,602
Genentech? Broadcom.

3032
01:49:27,602 --> 01:49:29,396
Of course. Yeah, of course.

3033
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:31,439
So the hardware guys and AI are killing it.

3034
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:32,983
But I think what's interesting to me,

3035
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:35,193
they're trading at multiples above ours,

3036
01:49:35,193 --> 01:49:36,319
there's a belief that their cycle

3037
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:37,779
is somehow longer than ours.

3038
01:49:38,613 --> 01:49:42,158
And I think tirzepatide's US patent is late '30s,

3039
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:44,536
orforglipron, the oral, beyond that.

3040
01:49:44,536 --> 01:49:47,747
So, yeah, that's my pitch to investors.

3041
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:50,083
But we're in that club as well.

3042
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:50,917
Will we stay there forever?

3043
01:49:50,917 --> 01:49:51,751
Obviously no,

3044
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:54,004
but, you know, I think that's one of the reasons

3045
01:49:54,004 --> 01:49:55,463
we're worth more. Well, I was going to ask

3046
01:49:55,463 --> 01:49:56,298
some questions about that.

3047
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:58,925
So first off, Novo is growing in the teens.

3048
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:01,261
For two companies with GLP offerings that are working,

3049
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:03,597
why are those growth rates so different?

3050
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:06,349
We're taking most of the growth in the market.

3051
01:50:06,349 --> 01:50:07,183
Okay, so just

3052
01:50:07,183 --> 01:50:08,226
your product's working better. It's a share.

3053
01:50:08,226 --> 01:50:12,022
Right now in the US, across all forms of GLP-1,

3054
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:13,440
on new patient capture,

3055
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:17,527
we're basically 70%-75% right now.

3056
01:50:17,527 --> 01:50:19,696
So almost three to one.

3057
01:50:20,655 --> 01:50:23,033
And then if you, it's a high carryover business.

3058
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:26,953
I think we're 60/40 on the total.

3059
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:29,372
And so we're just getting most of the growth.

3060
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:31,541
What would you guess Eli Lilly's P/E is?

3061
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,502
Forward P/E?

3062
01:50:34,502 --> 01:50:36,671
I was using trailing, but. Most of the time, yeah.

3063
01:50:37,505 --> 01:50:38,340
15?

3064
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:41,009
50. 5-0. Oh my god.

3065
01:50:41,009 --> 01:50:44,095
So what I was going to ask is,

3066
01:50:44,095 --> 01:50:45,263
you know, we're talking here about—

3067
01:50:45,263 --> 01:50:46,264
The sector's like 12.

3068
01:50:46,264 --> 01:50:47,974
So, yeah. No, exactly.

3069
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:48,808
Yeah, you're correct.

3070
01:50:48,808 --> 01:50:50,185
Like very close.

3071
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:51,936
It was a very good guess.

3072
01:50:51,936 --> 01:50:53,313
I was thinking high end of the sector.

3073
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:54,898
Your priors were good

3074
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:55,857
because that is correct for the rest.

3075
01:50:55,857 --> 01:50:56,941
But where I was going with this

3076
01:50:56,941 --> 01:50:59,444
is if you were to listen to this podcast,

3077
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:00,528
I think you maybe come away thinking,

3078
01:51:00,528 --> 01:51:02,489
"Wow, pharma is hard.

3079
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:04,157
Like, good god." You know, there's so many things

3080
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:05,617
and, you know, things roll off patent

3081
01:51:05,617 --> 01:51:07,994
and we have the Chinese competitors and things like that.

3082
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:11,456
So what is it that investors have confidence in?

3083
01:51:11,456 --> 01:51:13,958
Well, I think the track record of success.

3084
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:16,711
We've been on a growth curve for 12 years or so.

3085
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:19,547
It's certainly gone a little more hyperbolic lately.

3086
01:51:19,547 --> 01:51:22,676
But I think that builds confidence.

3087
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:25,553
I would hope some management piece.

3088
01:51:25,553 --> 01:51:27,222
But also, you know, the ability

3089
01:51:27,222 --> 01:51:32,102
to predict where to move.

3090
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:34,813
And I think if you say, "Okay, what's your recipe?"

3091
01:51:34,813 --> 01:51:35,980
It's an R&D business.

3092
01:51:37,065 --> 01:51:38,400
Everything else is around the edges.

3093
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:41,403
So you have to create something better for people

3094
01:51:41,403 --> 01:51:42,654
that improves their health.

3095
01:51:42,654 --> 01:51:44,114
If you can do that, you're going to win.

3096
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:46,741
Policy, this and that, the commercial strategies,

3097
01:51:46,741 --> 01:51:47,575
that's the 20.

3098
01:51:47,575 --> 01:51:48,952
The 80 is this.

3099
01:51:48,952 --> 01:51:51,246
And I think we do three things better than others.

3100
01:51:51,246 --> 01:51:53,623
One we talked about already, which is cycle time.

3101
01:51:53,623 --> 01:51:54,708
It's a basic concept,

3102
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:57,669
but if you can make software faster than someone else,

3103
01:51:57,669 --> 01:51:58,712
you're going to win.

3104
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:00,672
And the same in the drug business.

3105
01:52:00,672 --> 01:52:05,385
The second is prediction of where to tack the investment

3106
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:08,513
and allocating a meaningful part

3107
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:11,558
to ideas that may not be obvious today,

3108
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:15,228
but actually are big problems without markets.

3109
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:17,272
And we're drawn to those.

3110
01:52:17,272 --> 01:52:18,690
That is the third box—

3111
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:20,400
As in without preexisting markets.

3112
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,152
Yeah, I mean, there's illnesses,

3113
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:24,362
but they're not medicines.

3114
01:52:24,362 --> 01:52:27,031
And I think a lot of companies don't work that way.

3115
01:52:27,031 --> 01:52:28,742
They look at, "Okay, where's our payment?

3116
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:30,660
Where can I recoup my investment?"

3117
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:33,621
Versus where is there a problem?

3118
01:52:33,621 --> 01:52:34,914
And maybe our situation

3119
01:52:34,914 --> 01:52:35,749
allows us to— Jensen Huang at NVIDIA

3120
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:38,877
talks about how he loves $0 markets

3121
01:52:38,877 --> 01:52:39,794
and you're describing some

3122
01:52:39,794 --> 01:52:40,920
of the same things. Exactly.

3123
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,505
Blue ocean things that are,

3124
01:52:42,505 --> 01:52:43,965
you know, there's no limit to human disease.

3125
01:52:43,965 --> 01:52:45,759
And actually the longer we help people live,

3126
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:47,510
the more diseased they'll be.

3127
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:49,763
So in a way, it's alike AI in that way

3128
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:52,182
where it's like AI begets more AI.

3129
01:52:52,182 --> 01:52:54,893
It's just this growing machine.

3130
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:57,812
And then I think discipline of the allocation

3131
01:52:57,812 --> 01:53:02,484
between the types of R&D that are extending the franchise,

3132
01:53:02,484 --> 01:53:03,985
these moonshots we just talked about

3133
01:53:03,985 --> 01:53:08,239
that could really actually create a new GLP-1-like category.

3134
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:09,365
You know, we're doing this study now

3135
01:53:09,365 --> 01:53:10,450
that I think will be quite interesting

3136
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:12,494
that is going to potentially show

3137
01:53:12,494 --> 01:53:14,913
you can slow Alzheimer's before it starts.

3138
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:18,333
That's the kind of thing that could be a mega market.

3139
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:20,168
And those have to not just help a lot of people,

3140
01:53:20,168 --> 01:53:23,129
but they have to save a lot of money for healthcare systems

3141
01:53:23,129 --> 01:53:26,090
in order to generate, I think, shared value.

3142
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:28,176
And then you have to do the discipline

3143
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:31,471
around the edges of, you know, the next clinical trial

3144
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:33,807
for a cancer drug that's already working.

3145
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:36,059
I think being multimodal in that

3146
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:38,394
and really kind of balancing your bets

3147
01:53:38,394 --> 01:53:40,104
has been a key for our success.

3148
01:53:40,104 --> 01:53:42,023
Capital allocation I guess in a sense.

3149
01:53:42,023 --> 01:53:46,194
When people are debating drug pricing,

3150
01:53:46,194 --> 01:53:48,446
and they debate it a lot,

3151
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:51,282
obviously the argument made

3152
01:53:51,282 --> 01:53:53,701
by people in the pharma industry,

3153
01:53:53,701 --> 01:53:56,329
which to be clear, I think both of us believe

3154
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:57,413
has a lot of legitimacy,

3155
01:53:57,413 --> 01:54:00,166
is, "Well, if the returns aren't favorable,

3156
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:02,502
we're not going to pursue the investments."

3157
01:54:02,502 --> 01:54:04,587
You'll never know if it was too expensive.

3158
01:54:04,587 --> 01:54:05,839
Exactly. Yeah.

3159
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:07,799
Since society wants more drugs and not fewer drugs

3160
01:54:07,799 --> 01:54:10,176
and there are many diseases that have not been cured,

3161
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:11,219
et cetera, et cetera.

3162
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:13,263
And we've, of course, discussed these dynamics

3163
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:15,306
extensively here just now.

3164
01:54:15,306 --> 01:54:17,934
In as much as GLP-1s represent

3165
01:54:17,934 --> 01:54:21,771
this enormous advancement and improvement

3166
01:54:21,771 --> 01:54:24,691
in Eli Lilly's just fundamental financials,

3167
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:27,193
I mean, it's economically equivalent

3168
01:54:27,193 --> 01:54:30,780
to a 2x, 3x, 4x increase

3169
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:32,866
in the realized drug price

3170
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:34,868
of every drug across the board,

3171
01:54:36,327 --> 01:54:39,247
does that mean that people should now expect Eli Lilly

3172
01:54:39,247 --> 01:54:43,376
to be far more able to fund broad-based drug R&D

3173
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:44,586
than it was in the past,

3174
01:54:44,586 --> 01:54:45,837
such that their estimate

3175
01:54:45,837 --> 01:54:48,423
for the prospective drug development

3176
01:54:48,423 --> 01:54:50,967
and, you know, bounties of drug discovery

3177
01:54:50,967 --> 01:54:54,929
over the next 10, 20, 30 years should be much larger

3178
01:54:54,929 --> 01:54:57,891
than the pre GLP-1 world?

3179
01:54:57,891 --> 01:54:58,725
I think so.

3180
01:54:58,725 --> 01:55:00,727
Although, we have to prove we can.

3181
01:55:00,727 --> 01:55:02,270
So we're going to try.

3182
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:05,815
I have a belief that if you're not generating,

3183
01:55:05,815 --> 01:55:07,692
to generate double digit growth in the sector,

3184
01:55:07,692 --> 01:55:10,904
you need to invest at 20%-25% of sales in R&D.

3185
01:55:10,904 --> 01:55:14,908
That's sort of a positive return R&D stack.

3186
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:16,618
And we're doing that. And you plan to hold

3187
01:55:16,618 --> 01:55:18,953
that ratio as revenue. Yeah, and this year,

3188
01:55:18,953 --> 01:55:21,831
we'll sell 60-some-odd billion.

3189
01:55:21,831 --> 01:55:23,875
So that's how you get to the 14 billion,

3190
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:26,419
and next year, that'll grow by double digits,

3191
01:55:26,419 --> 01:55:28,588
and so we should try. But do you think,

3192
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:30,757
if revenue goes to 120, you know—

3193
01:55:30,757 --> 01:55:32,550
I would try to spend 20% of that,

3194
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:35,094
which which would then approximate the NIH.

3195
01:55:35,094 --> 01:55:37,639
And I think that's a frightening thing

3196
01:55:37,639 --> 01:55:40,266
because, well, how many ideas are out there?

3197
01:55:40,266 --> 01:55:42,685
So I think, of course, we should do more

3198
01:55:42,685 --> 01:55:43,937
of what we're good at.

3199
01:55:43,937 --> 01:55:47,398
We should be bounded by our own capabilities,

3200
01:55:47,398 --> 01:55:49,651
and we don't know everything about every disease,

3201
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:51,235
we don't know everything about every modality,

3202
01:55:51,235 --> 01:55:52,862
but for the diseases we know the modalities,

3203
01:55:52,862 --> 01:55:54,739
we can fund more

3204
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:58,159
and pursue a healthy portion of these bigger bets

3205
01:55:58,159 --> 01:56:01,412
on zero-value markets.

3206
01:56:01,412 --> 01:56:02,872
We can expand the franchise.

3207
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:05,458
We can do the incremental things we have to do at scale,

3208
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:06,793
and do them earlier actually.

3209
01:56:06,793 --> 01:56:09,087
I think that's quite an important thing.

3210
01:56:09,087 --> 01:56:11,714
Often we do serial clinical trials,

3211
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:13,174
and by the end of the product lifestyle,

3212
01:56:13,174 --> 01:56:14,634
you get the final indication.

3213
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:16,886
We're trying to stack them all into the beginning.

3214
01:56:16,886 --> 01:56:18,888
So that's expensive, but we're in a position to do that.

3215
01:56:18,888 --> 01:56:20,223
It's not risky actually.

3216
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:21,724
So you're saying anyone who's on this,

3217
01:56:21,724 --> 01:56:24,435
you know, who's teetering on the brink

3218
01:56:24,435 --> 01:56:26,145
of purchasing a GLP-1,

3219
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:28,731
especially in a self-pay mode or something like that,

3220
01:56:28,731 --> 01:56:31,317
and they worry maybe it's self-indulgent to do so,

3221
01:56:31,317 --> 01:56:32,777
you know, they should just go to the gym

3222
01:56:32,777 --> 01:56:34,028
or, you know, exercise willpower

3223
01:56:34,028 --> 01:56:35,154
and so forth. They're paying for medicine

3224
01:56:35,154 --> 01:56:35,989
that's going to help someone else.

3225
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:38,116
You're saying that the purchase of this GLP-1

3226
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:39,617
is also a kind of subsidy— Yeah, I mean,

3227
01:56:39,617 --> 01:56:41,035
back to the pricing. For cancer R&D.

3228
01:56:41,035 --> 01:56:42,537
And just to add on the R&D,

3229
01:56:42,537 --> 01:56:43,913
the other thing we're doing at some scale

3230
01:56:43,913 --> 01:56:46,916
is actually trying to create a ecosystem

3231
01:56:46,916 --> 01:56:49,085
around us of invention

3232
01:56:49,085 --> 01:56:50,795
that we can aid in a real way,

3233
01:56:50,795 --> 01:56:52,005
not just own part of it.

3234
01:56:52,005 --> 01:56:54,382
We have lots of deployed corporate venture.

3235
01:56:54,382 --> 01:56:58,052
But we've built these things called Catalyze360

3236
01:56:58,052 --> 01:57:01,139
or the Gateway Labs here in South San Francisco actually

3237
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:03,850
where we host scale-ups, not startups.

3238
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:06,602
And by host, I mean we offer our services.

3239
01:57:06,602 --> 01:57:09,063
So rather than hire some consultant

3240
01:57:09,063 --> 01:57:10,231
who retired five years ago

3241
01:57:10,231 --> 01:57:12,025
to help you with a particular problem,

3242
01:57:12,025 --> 01:57:14,318
we'll give you someone working on it right now.

3243
01:57:14,318 --> 01:57:17,905
And so it's sort of a loosely coupled model

3244
01:57:17,905 --> 01:57:19,949
without buying them.

3245
01:57:19,949 --> 01:57:21,576
Often the entrepreneurs leave,

3246
01:57:21,576 --> 01:57:24,162
we cultivate them and then maybe buy them if they're good.

3247
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:25,371
You have to apply to get in.

3248
01:57:25,371 --> 01:57:27,206
So it's a competitive process.

3249
01:57:27,206 --> 01:57:29,083
We have I think seven or eight of these now

3250
01:57:29,083 --> 01:57:29,917
around the country

3251
01:57:29,917 --> 01:57:33,004
and even two in China and building one in London.

3252
01:57:33,963 --> 01:57:35,339
And we'll create a virtual version of this.

3253
01:57:35,339 --> 01:57:38,134
And that TuneLab tool, that AI tool I talked about earlier

3254
01:57:38,134 --> 01:57:39,677
is embedded in that as well.

3255
01:57:39,677 --> 01:57:41,846
So that's another way we can spend money in R&D

3256
01:57:41,846 --> 01:57:43,389
with other people

3257
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:47,560
and kind of use other brains to develop what we're doing.

3258
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:49,228
But I have to caveat,

3259
01:57:49,228 --> 01:57:51,564
this may not work actually, right?

3260
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:55,318
There could be a frontier in what's possible

3261
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:56,694
and we found it

3262
01:57:56,694 --> 01:57:59,197
and beyond that it's just waste.

3263
01:57:59,197 --> 01:58:00,114
I don't rule that out,

3264
01:58:00,114 --> 01:58:02,158
and I think it's an important caveat.

3265
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:04,619
We'll know those signals in the next couple years

3266
01:58:04,619 --> 01:58:06,287
'cause our scale is getting to be bigger

3267
01:58:06,287 --> 01:58:07,789
than anyone's ever done.

3268
01:58:07,789 --> 01:58:10,625
Most of those experiments that have been run ended badly.

3269
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:14,754
People mostly bought other companies at too high a price

3270
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:16,255
and then the drug didn't work out.

3271
01:58:16,255 --> 01:58:17,423
We're not doing that.

3272
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:20,093
But, you know, it'll be interesting to see.

3273
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:22,386
And then, you know, if we quit,

3274
01:58:22,386 --> 01:58:24,263
we'll turn into like an Apple.

3275
01:58:24,263 --> 01:58:26,349
We'll just start buying back massive amounts of shares

3276
01:58:26,349 --> 01:58:28,976
and return cash to shareholders who invested

3277
01:58:28,976 --> 01:58:30,812
to create this surplus.

3278
01:58:30,812 --> 01:58:33,272
But it's important what you're saying about people buying

3279
01:58:33,272 --> 01:58:36,567
is that a quarter of every dollar you spend

3280
01:58:36,567 --> 01:58:40,113
is going to a research lab or a clinical trial

3281
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:41,697
for a medicine you might not need

3282
01:58:41,697 --> 01:58:43,616
or for someone you don't know.

3283
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:46,619
But that's the system by which we create new medicines,

3284
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:48,704
and we'll try to use that wisely.

3285
01:58:48,704 --> 01:58:50,123
I don't take that responsibility lightly.

3286
01:58:50,123 --> 01:58:51,415
That's someone's money.

3287
01:58:51,415 --> 01:58:54,210
But maybe they'll have Alzheimer's someday

3288
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:55,169
and we'll have a solution for that,

3289
01:58:55,169 --> 01:58:56,170
or maybe someone they know.

3290
01:58:56,170 --> 01:59:00,007
But that's the virtuous circle we try to drive.

3291
01:59:00,007 --> 01:59:02,218
Is it meaningful to talk about what fraction of R&D

3292
01:59:02,218 --> 01:59:04,804
is towards specific treatments?

3293
01:59:04,804 --> 01:59:07,765
Is, like, focused vertical R&D

3294
01:59:07,765 --> 01:59:09,725
versus I presume you do a lot of horizontal R&D.

3295
01:59:09,725 --> 01:59:10,560
Yeah, platforms.

3296
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,853
Yeah, exactly, platforms.

3297
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:13,020
Because presumably it's even harder

3298
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:14,897
to reason out the platforms and the payoffs there.

3299
01:59:14,897 --> 01:59:16,816
Well, there you need some scale.

3300
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:18,067
There's a lot of platform companies

3301
01:59:18,067 --> 01:59:19,861
that get funded that are biotech.

3302
01:59:19,861 --> 01:59:20,820
Yeah, we have them in San Francisco.

3303
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:24,574
And they are usually exploring a new platform

3304
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:25,491
that's quite helpful.

3305
01:59:25,491 --> 01:59:26,659
That's important work they do.

3306
01:59:26,659 --> 01:59:28,703
And often we'll partner with them early

3307
01:59:28,703 --> 01:59:32,665
and try to develop that capability ourselves.

3308
01:59:32,665 --> 01:59:34,208
Basically, in our business,

3309
01:59:34,208 --> 01:59:37,295
there's two kinds of questions on early phase R&D.

3310
01:59:37,295 --> 01:59:39,422
One of them is this, is there a new platform

3311
01:59:39,422 --> 01:59:41,799
that can unlock targets we already know about

3312
01:59:41,799 --> 01:59:43,467
in new ways or in better ways

3313
01:59:43,467 --> 01:59:45,720
that create a whole field of drugs?

3314
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,305
If you think of Genentech,

3315
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:49,015
like, that was a company that exploded

3316
01:59:49,015 --> 01:59:50,683
based on monoclonal antibody technology

3317
01:59:50,683 --> 01:59:53,436
by tricking cells to make a human antibody

3318
01:59:53,436 --> 01:59:55,188
that solved disease.

3319
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:58,232
30-year run of spectacular new medicines.

3320
01:59:58,232 --> 02:00:00,193
Or Gilead Sciences nearby,

3321
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:02,403
which really started on this idea of virology

3322
02:00:02,403 --> 02:00:05,698
and new virology chemistry and small molecules.

3323
02:00:05,698 --> 02:00:08,492
So we want to be there at the early stages

3324
02:00:08,492 --> 02:00:11,162
because it is like a catching a wave thing.

3325
02:00:11,162 --> 02:00:13,331
If you're late, you miss it all.

3326
02:00:13,331 --> 02:00:14,999
And so that's a kind of investing we do

3327
02:00:14,999 --> 02:00:17,418
and that's a more scaled project.

3328
02:00:17,418 --> 02:00:20,963
And then the other kind is, like, picking targets

3329
02:00:20,963 --> 02:00:24,175
and looking in the broad space of biologic discovery

3330
02:00:24,175 --> 02:00:27,470
and say, "Okay, of the thousand things uncovered this year,

3331
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:31,140
these 15 we think could be highly relevant

3332
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:33,643
and we're going to put a team around those."

3333
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:37,647
This isn't the Skunk Works kind of allowable deviation

3334
02:00:37,647 --> 02:00:38,981
or whatever I said earlier.

3335
02:00:38,981 --> 02:00:42,360
But it's a purposeful thing to say, "Let's drug hunt here.

3336
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:45,780
Let's use the tools we have and assault those targets

3337
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:47,073
with multiple ones of those tools

3338
02:00:47,073 --> 02:00:48,199
and see if we can get a drug out of it."

3339
02:00:48,199 --> 02:00:49,700
And sometimes we've actually come out

3340
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:53,037
with like a small molecule and an antibody

3341
02:00:53,037 --> 02:00:53,871
and an siRNA.

3342
02:00:53,871 --> 02:00:55,998
Like we talked about Lp earlier.

3343
02:00:55,998 --> 02:00:57,291
That was the case there.

3344
02:00:57,291 --> 02:00:58,459
We discarded the antibody,

3345
02:00:58,459 --> 02:01:00,127
there is one that's been developed,

3346
02:01:00,127 --> 02:01:02,880
and we went after the small molecule and the siRNA.

3347
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,257
They're both in phase III.

3348
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:07,385
And so that was a case of very purposeful find a target,

3349
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:10,930
attack the target, get a medicine to market.

3350
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,056
So it's both.

3351
02:01:12,056 --> 02:01:14,350
And we need to hedge it that way I think.

3352
02:01:15,184 --> 02:01:16,894
And then, of course, we watch the outside

3353
02:01:16,894 --> 02:01:19,063
and sometimes we miss those two signals

3354
02:01:19,063 --> 02:01:21,774
and we end up buying companies later in their cycle

3355
02:01:21,774 --> 02:01:23,901
and saying, "Hey, we can add value through clinical trials

3356
02:01:23,901 --> 02:01:26,279
or manufacturing scale or something else."

3357
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:27,113
Last question.

3358
02:01:28,406 --> 02:01:31,242
Eli Lilly is more than a hundred years old and—

3359
02:01:31,242 --> 02:01:32,868
150 in May. Oh, wow.

3360
02:01:32,868 --> 02:01:35,663
Okay, so coming up on your 150th birthday.

3361
02:01:35,663 --> 02:01:39,834
And I noticed that often

3362
02:01:39,834 --> 02:01:42,628
very tenured, successful companies

3363
02:01:42,628 --> 02:01:45,715
are quite serious about, and good at,

3364
02:01:45,715 --> 02:01:47,008
internal succession planning.

3365
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,426
I think about, you know, Royal Dutch Shell

3366
02:01:48,426 --> 02:01:50,136
or, you know, companies like that,

3367
02:01:50,136 --> 02:01:51,762
and Eli Lilly.

3368
02:01:51,762 --> 02:01:53,556
You joined in what year?

3369
02:01:53,556 --> 02:01:54,598
1996.

3370
02:01:54,598 --> 02:01:55,933
Right, you joined in 1996.

3371
02:01:55,933 --> 02:01:57,476
Not as a hired CEO.

3372
02:01:57,476 --> 02:01:59,770
No, I was a BD, M&A.

3373
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:00,896
Exactly. New hire.

3374
02:02:00,896 --> 02:02:03,149
And you were rotated across, you know, the business.

3375
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:04,525
You ran China, you ran the US business.

3376
02:02:04,525 --> 02:02:06,027
Development. Exactly.

3377
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:07,111
All these kind of roles.

3378
02:02:07,111 --> 02:02:10,531
What do you think Stripe, Silicon Valley companies,

3379
02:02:10,531 --> 02:02:12,867
should learn from Eli Lilly

3380
02:02:12,867 --> 02:02:14,452
and, you know, companies like Eli Lilly,

3381
02:02:14,452 --> 02:02:16,287
but that's where you have experience,

3382
02:02:16,287 --> 02:02:18,205
about talent planning and talent development?

3383
02:02:18,205 --> 02:02:19,290
Yeah, fabulous question.

3384
02:02:19,290 --> 02:02:21,417
I do notice differences,

3385
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:24,462
at least on the board I'm on and observing other companies.

3386
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:27,757
Some of that might be just the clock speed of the industry

3387
02:02:27,757 --> 02:02:29,258
and the technology

3388
02:02:29,258 --> 02:02:31,761
and some of it might be the newness of companies,

3389
02:02:31,761 --> 02:02:35,181
because if you haven't really seen the cycles play out,

3390
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:37,683
hard to kind of see the value.

3391
02:02:37,683 --> 02:02:39,018
You got a problem, solve it,

3392
02:02:39,018 --> 02:02:40,978
you know, work on the next thing.

3393
02:02:40,978 --> 02:02:42,271
But probably even in your company,

3394
02:02:42,271 --> 02:02:43,689
which has been around long enough now,

3395
02:02:43,689 --> 02:02:44,523
I'm sure you have people

3396
02:02:44,523 --> 02:02:47,068
who are, you know, single-digit hires,

3397
02:02:47,068 --> 02:02:48,736
you know, first few people,

3398
02:02:48,736 --> 02:02:50,821
who've really been excellent

3399
02:02:50,821 --> 02:02:51,655
and what they're doing now

3400
02:02:51,655 --> 02:02:53,115
is nothing like what they started doing

3401
02:02:53,115 --> 02:02:56,535
and you should examine, like, what are those, why?

3402
02:02:56,535 --> 02:02:57,953
Was it the experience path they took?

3403
02:02:57,953 --> 02:02:59,705
Was it innate traits they have?

3404
02:02:59,705 --> 02:03:01,791
Combination of those things?

3405
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:04,043
You know, we've had 150 years of that

3406
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:06,462
and I'm the 11th CEO of the company.

3407
02:03:08,339 --> 02:03:10,841
That's one less than popes in that period of time.

3408
02:03:12,385 --> 02:03:15,346
So it is a special honor actually,

3409
02:03:15,346 --> 02:03:17,973
and it's not a lifetime appointment.

3410
02:03:17,973 --> 02:03:19,767
I can be fired any day.

3411
02:03:19,767 --> 02:03:21,560
But the first four were family members

3412
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:24,480
and then we've had a lot of long-running successful

3413
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:26,399
and only one external.

3414
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:27,608
Really? Yeah.

3415
02:03:27,608 --> 02:03:32,071
And I think that's part of the success of the company

3416
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,864
is that in scaled companies,

3417
02:03:33,864 --> 02:03:35,366
and we've scaled for a while,

3418
02:03:35,366 --> 02:03:38,994
you know, not one person cannot possibly

3419
02:03:38,994 --> 02:03:40,913
really lead the whole thing.

3420
02:03:40,913 --> 02:03:42,581
You have to know the role you have to play

3421
02:03:42,581 --> 02:03:45,084
and you have to have others around you that can do it.

3422
02:03:45,084 --> 02:03:46,752
By creating that environment,

3423
02:03:46,752 --> 02:03:48,129
giving up some of that,

3424
02:03:48,129 --> 02:03:50,214
you actually grow people

3425
02:03:50,214 --> 02:03:53,050
and you grow people in a special way.

3426
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:55,094
A way that they know how to operate

3427
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:58,055
in the unspoken operating system called culture.

3428
02:03:58,889 --> 02:04:01,976
And so they're more effective more quickly in new roles.

3429
02:04:01,976 --> 02:04:03,602
And they just know the domain, right?

3430
02:04:03,602 --> 02:04:04,437
'Cause there's so much to know.

3431
02:04:04,437 --> 02:04:05,604
They know the domain.

3432
02:04:05,604 --> 02:04:07,273
They also know the human domain

3433
02:04:07,273 --> 02:04:10,401
of how to solve problems without committees.

3434
02:04:10,401 --> 02:04:13,320
And, like, one of my things now as we grow so fast

3435
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:15,823
is, like, keep headcount flat.

3436
02:04:15,823 --> 02:04:19,243
And that's makes me very unpopular

3437
02:04:19,243 --> 02:04:20,619
'cause people are like, "What?

3438
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:22,371
Like, how do I get this work done?"

3439
02:04:22,371 --> 02:04:23,914
We are growing headcount in manufacturing.

3440
02:04:23,914 --> 02:04:25,332
That's a unit operation business.

3441
02:04:25,332 --> 02:04:27,626
Are you growing in R&D as you grow the spend?

3442
02:04:27,626 --> 02:04:28,919
Slightly but,

3443
02:04:28,919 --> 02:04:32,506
so we're growing R&D high teens, low 20s.

3444
02:04:32,506 --> 02:04:34,884
We're growing headcount in R&D single digits.

3445
02:04:34,884 --> 02:04:36,302
So where does the money go?

3446
02:04:36,302 --> 02:04:38,679
So the money goes to projects.

3447
02:04:38,679 --> 02:04:40,222
Yeah, and salary.

3448
02:04:40,222 --> 02:04:41,056
Trials and tribulations?

3449
02:04:41,056 --> 02:04:41,891
I believe in paying people well.

3450
02:04:41,891 --> 02:04:43,809
Yeah, so there's salary growth,

3451
02:04:43,809 --> 02:04:47,354
but clinical trials, new equipment, new laboratories.

3452
02:04:47,354 --> 02:04:50,441
Supercomputers from NVIDIA, that's expensive.

3453
02:04:50,441 --> 02:04:53,986
So we're really trying to keep that goodness

3454
02:04:53,986 --> 02:04:57,781
that can come from having most of the succession internal.

3455
02:04:57,781 --> 02:05:00,075
What I noticed when I took over, though,

3456
02:05:00,075 --> 02:05:02,244
was maybe that took over too much.

3457
02:05:02,244 --> 02:05:03,746
There is a balance.

3458
02:05:03,746 --> 02:05:06,040
I have tried to bring in at the leadership level

3459
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:09,293
and other ranks, compete jobs externally,

3460
02:05:09,293 --> 02:05:13,130
and bring in outside voices that are the minority voice

3461
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:16,592
and have to have those innate traits

3462
02:05:16,592 --> 02:05:19,094
and kind of a culture fit that can work,

3463
02:05:19,094 --> 02:05:21,764
but it stimulates you in ways that sometimes you're like,

3464
02:05:21,764 --> 02:05:24,225
"Yeah, that felt a little uncomfortable

3465
02:05:24,225 --> 02:05:25,476
'cause they came at it in a different way

3466
02:05:25,476 --> 02:05:28,229
or said it in a way that doesn't connect

3467
02:05:28,229 --> 02:05:29,063
with how we normally,

3468
02:05:29,063 --> 02:05:31,524
but actually they're making a good point."

3469
02:05:31,524 --> 02:05:34,652
So that's the blend we've tried to find.

3470
02:05:34,652 --> 02:05:36,195
And I look at my career

3471
02:05:36,195 --> 02:05:38,906
and probably four or five times I was put in a job

3472
02:05:38,906 --> 02:05:40,616
I had no business being in,

3473
02:05:40,616 --> 02:05:42,868
but somebody thought I could learn it

3474
02:05:42,868 --> 02:05:43,953
and that the output of that

3475
02:05:43,953 --> 02:05:46,413
would be good performance at the end, not at the beginning,

3476
02:05:46,413 --> 02:05:49,375
and then a better long-term thing for the company.

3477
02:05:49,375 --> 02:05:50,459
I'm so grateful for that

3478
02:05:50,459 --> 02:05:53,212
because that's like ultimate risk taking on people

3479
02:05:53,212 --> 02:05:56,340
and I would not be here without those successive jobs

3480
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:57,716
where I was like, I never would've gotten them

3481
02:05:57,716 --> 02:05:59,468
if I applied externally,

3482
02:05:59,468 --> 02:06:00,719
but the company gave them to me.

3483
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:03,597
And as a CEO, you have to do a lot of things

3484
02:06:03,597 --> 02:06:05,516
that are very horizontal

3485
02:06:05,516 --> 02:06:08,394
and I touch things that I had no experience in,

3486
02:06:08,394 --> 02:06:11,188
but I learned by graciously reading

3487
02:06:11,188 --> 02:06:13,107
and doing and solving real problems

3488
02:06:13,107 --> 02:06:16,026
that has made me more successful in this job.

3489
02:06:16,026 --> 02:06:17,945
A lot of companies say they're long-term oriented,

3490
02:06:17,945 --> 02:06:19,738
but I feel like this is a particular example

3491
02:06:19,738 --> 02:06:21,490
of revealed preference.

3492
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:22,324
Yeah.

3493
02:06:22,324 --> 02:06:23,742
David, thank you. Awesome conversation.

3494
02:06:23,742 --> 02:06:24,952
Thanks for the beer. Yeah, great.

3495
02:06:24,952 --> 02:06:26,036
Thank you very much. Yeah.
