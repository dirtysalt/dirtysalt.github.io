1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,400
Companies are a reflection of their founders.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,200
In ways ways you probably don't even realize.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,640
I think— We are in a pub after all.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,130
Within the first few weeks of us working together,

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,090
he came back to me at one point and said,

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,470
"I'm pretty sure we're losing money

7
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,517
every time someone buys Bitcoin."

8
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:13,710
He walked me through on the whiteboard and he was right.

9
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,557
There's the top five or 10 fiat currencies—

10
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:19,620
but the long tail—the other 150 or so

11
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,090
government currencies,

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,680
I think they probably should get replaced.

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,050
If the US is going to lose the reserve currency status,

14
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,969
I'd rather people went to Bitcoin than to the Chinese Yuan.

15
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:30,150
I don't think we can serve these sad pints, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,920
It's not meeting the Stripe quality bar.

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,650
Isn't there some ethos at Stripe about the details

18
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,760
really matter?

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,593
They do.

20
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,170
You deserve a delicious creamy pint.

21
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,610
Not this monstrosity.

22
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,650
I actually was a bartender in grad school.

23
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,910
I should know how to do this.

24
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,200
Brian Armstrong is the co-founder

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,033
and CEO of Coinbase,

26
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,200
one of the world's largest crypto exchanges.

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,390
Founded in 2012, earlier this year,

28
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,580
they became the first crypto company

29
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,062
to be added to the S&P 500.

30
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:56,612
Cheers.

31
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,143
It feels like a good time to

32
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,317
do this and take stock. Stripe—

33
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:04,290
we launched in 2011.

34
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,180
Coinbase was founded in 2012,

35
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,710
and grew up at the same time.

36
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,390
Coinbase just got added to the S&P 500,

37
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,190
The GENIUS Act just passed.

38
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,400
A good moment to step back and take stock.

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,233
Yeah.

40
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:17,550
As you look back on it, when I think about crypto

41
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,030
in say the 2014—2015 era,

42
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,140
it was such a red ocean,

43
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,320
there were so many different competitors

44
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,980
and you guys beat so many people to get here.

45
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,803
As you look back on it, how did Coinbase win?

46
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,070
It has been a long journey

47
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,070
and I remember seeing you guys go through YC

48
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,630
and everything was very inspiring for me.

49
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,090
"Okay, maybe a fintech company

50
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,830
could be built in this area."

51
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,220
So I had a lot of aspiration to go through YC in part

52
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,870
by seeing what Stripe did.

53
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,180
And you're right, in those early days, it was the wild west.

54
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,710
I'd go to the early Bitcoin meetups

55
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,860
and there were brilliant cryptography PhDs

56
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,527
and also anarchists.

57
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,810
One of the first meetups I went to

58
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,730
in San Francisco for Bitcoin,

59
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,040
a guy there told me he was starting his own religion.

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,390
I thought it was a little off-topic,

61
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,550
but somehow it all worked together in his mind.

62
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,850
So, we've come together from these early days,

63
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,440
which remind me of the Chaos Computer Club

64
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,030
equivalent.

65
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,730
And I think Coinbase made a couple decisions there

66
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,310
that helped us ride through.

67
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,490
One was that we decided to follow a regulated approach,

68
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,410
which meant working with the United States government

69
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,060
and getting money transmitter licenses.

70
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,673
Which I remember the anarchist crowd at that time—

71
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:31,500
This was considered kinda selling out?

72
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,333
It was a little bit.

73
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,500
One guy—I remember—I had just gone

74
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,150
to meet with some banks or something like that.

75
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,620
So I was wearing like a suit

76
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,640
and I came to the Bitcoin meetup

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,780
and the guy was like— You were using the suit.

78
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,430
Yeah, he was like, "You look like a banker."

79
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,740
And I said no, no, I'm a software guy, trust me.

80
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,710
I think the other thing that we did was

81
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,400
we tried to stack up as many credibility indicators

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,233
as we could.

83
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:54,090
One of them was getting accepted to Y Combinator.

84
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,790
That led to us getting a bank relationship in the US

85
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,380
at the time when that was very difficult to do

86
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,450
with Silicon Valley Bank of all places—

87
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,890
getting the money transmitter licenses.

88
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,110
There was a period there in the US

89
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,690
where we were the only US company

90
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,800
that had a bank partnership

91
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,740
so it was easy to connect your bank account to buy Bitcoin.

92
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,750
That really allowed us to get started in a way

93
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,910
that nobody else could catch up.

94
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,710
You were more credentialed versus—

95
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,790
and who were the competitors at the time?

96
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,440
Was it Mt. Gox?

97
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,340
Who were you competing against

98
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,346
for consumer share?

99
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:22,179
It's been so long.

100
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:25,140
So the Mt. Gox was in Japan, which of course blew up.

101
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,430
There was a company called Tradehill in San Francisco,

102
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,620
which probably could have been a big exchange,

103
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,510
but it didn't hit some of those milestones.

104
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,710
There were so many of them along the way.

105
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,240
I couldn't even name all of them.

106
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,340
There was a Bitcoin conference

107
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,173
in San Jose, California in 2012,

108
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,006
that was kind of iconic in hindsight.

109
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,730
The Winklevoss brother showed up

110
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,220
and I met Vitalik Buterin there for the first time.

111
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,470
He had not invented Ethereum yet.

112
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,390
I remember people looking around the room

113
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,570
and it felt so small-time.

114
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,980
Some of the talks only had

115
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,090
five people show up to it.

116
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,280
We had this little booth with T-shirts

117
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,320
What was Vitalik working on before Ethereum?

118
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,210
He was a writer at Bitcoin Magazine.

119
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,320
He was actually a very good writer.

120
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,153
You see it in his—

121
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:06,180
Blog posts.

122
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,830
—how he leads the Ethereum movement.

123
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,540
Exactly. From the philosopher king.

124
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,310
Yeah. I don't know if there's a lesson

125
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,050
to draw from this, but

126
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,079
I think being early on some of these tech trends—

127
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,760
you don't want to jump in and be

128
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,709
the 42nd AI company or something.

129
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,930
You want to jump into something when you think it's cool,

130
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,760
nobody else thinks it's cool.

131
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,370
And it's, I guess Paul Graham has that thing,

132
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,740
You'd rather have 1,000 people

133
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,700
who really love your product

134
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,380
than a bunch people don't care.

135
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,640
That's where we were.

136
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,830
Nobody took seriously what we were doing,

137
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,863
us at Coinbase or the entire industry at that time.

138
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:41,863
Can you describe being the more buttoned-up player?

139
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,500
Having the money transmitter license,

140
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,020
having bank partnerships. Did that help you win

141
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,910
because you were able to build products

142
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,520
that other people weren't able to follow you with?

143
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,570
Or did it help you win

144
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,070
because for consumers it gave you

145
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:58,873
a brand and a trust that led them to choose you?

146
00:04:58,873 --> 00:04:59,706
I think it was both.

147
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:01,650
It allowed us to launch products

148
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,970
that others couldn't.

149
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,710
It allowed us to not get shut down.

150
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,730
Did other people get shut down?

151
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,280
Yeah, they either just—they got cease and desist letters.

152
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,500
They couldn't afford the legal bills.

153
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,304
They got shut down by getting hacked basically.

154
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,170
We had a couple close calls in the early days

155
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,970
where we were not the mature company we are today

156
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,310
and we had people trying to break into our systems.

157
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,560
I can tell you about some of those closed calls if you want.

158
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,320
We were able to get just enough good talent in the door

159
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,140
due to the credibility indicators.

160
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,850
By the way, some of the other companies

161
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,620
at that time were totally anonymous.

162
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,453
These people were telling me,

163
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:33,286
"I don't want to put my name on this website

164
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,687
because it's against the ethos of crypto."

165
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:39,930
In my view, if we're going to raise money,

166
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,763
be regulated,

167
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:42,330
how are you going to be anonymous forever.

168
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,230
If this gets big enough,

169
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,270
someone's going to come knocking on your door.

170
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,890
I wasn't afraid to put my name on it

171
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,510
and say "I'm a US citizen.

172
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,343
I live in the United States.

173
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm doing this for the right reason.

174
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm here for the long-term."

175
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Companies are a reflection of their founders, right?

176
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,330
Stripe's very much a reflection of you and Patrick

177
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,163
in bits and pieces of you in many ways you probably

178
00:05:58,163 --> 00:06:00,270
don't even realize.

179
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,740
We are in a pub after all.

180
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,850
An Irish pub.

181
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,320
This is one small example.

182
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,990
The same thing was true of Coinbase

183
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,000
with Fred Ehrsam and I.

184
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,820
It was really a derivation of our DNA—

185
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,650
which was many things—

186
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,740
but one of them was, we were legitimate

187
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,120
and trustworthy

188
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,380
and we were doing it for the right reasons

189
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,790
for the long-term.

190
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,920
That counted for a lot.

191
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Fred had worked in the financial world before.

192
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,260
Had you, no, you were at Airbnb before.

193
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,587
Had you worked in finance at all before?

194
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:32,160
No. I had studied computer science and economics.

195
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,750
I'd worked at pretty much as a software engineer.

196
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,750
I tried doing another startup that was more of a base hit—

197
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,100
didn't work.

198
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,860
Fred got a computer science degree in economics too at Duke

199
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,810
but he went into FX trading at Goldman's.

200
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,870
When I first met him, I thought,

201
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,570
"Okay, the guy knows how to write code, has a CS degree,

202
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,710
but he knows something about finance."

203
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,690
And of course within the first few weeks of us

204
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,770
working together,

205
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,150
he came back to me at one point and said

206
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,560
"I'm pretty sure we're losing money

207
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,450
every time someone buys Bitcoin."

208
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,680
I was like, how could that possibly be?

209
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,513
And he walked me through it on the whiteboard and

210
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:00,596
he was right.

211
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,450
Complimentary skillset.

212
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,130
V1 of the business model is not going to work.

213
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,963
You need some optimizations.

214
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:07,200
Yeah.

215
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,130
That's wild.

216
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,120
You're saying some of the close calls,

217
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,553
I think that one thing people don't realize is

218
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:12,386
they think when a startup isn't working that it's bad

219
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:13,219
and stressful because no one's buying your product

220
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:14,052
and that is true.

221
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,180
But when a startup really is working,

222
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,740
it is also bad and stressful in a way

223
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,190
because you're being pulled along by forces

224
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,107
and it's not obvious that you can keep up.

225
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:30,630
What were some of the close calls?

226
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,250
I'll give you a couple examples.

227
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,260
On the first version of the app,

228
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,240
I had created this simple hot wallet

229
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,340
that was live on the servers.

230
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,340
I remember telling people, this app is an alpha,

231
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,550
don't store any money here you're not willing to lose.

232
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,740
The company had raised about $150,000 or so

233
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,840
at that point from Y Combinator.

234
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,330
As early users came on site,

235
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,470
they kept depositing more money,

236
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,390
even though despite these warnings all over the app

237
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,817
and it was getting closer and closer to being $150,000.

238
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:59,550
I felt like if we lost all the money

239
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,750
I would want to be able to pay it back

240
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,310
or else we'd be insolvent.

241
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,860
You were tracking corp cash—

242
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,890
how much money the company had—versus user deposits

243
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,930
and you didn't want user deposits to outstrip

244
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,400
how much money Coinbase had.

245
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,540
Exactly.

246
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,720
I calculated at one point the growth of the deposits

247
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,590
and how much money we had.

248
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,060
I said, "hey, we have about eight weeks

249
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,070
to put this onto some new system."

250
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,990
I had the vague sense we needed to move the money

251
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,600
off the internet, to cold storage.

252
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,040
I didn't know how to architect one.

253
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,120
I'd studied computer science,

254
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,170
I took a security class,

255
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,510
I had basic understandings of cryptography,

256
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,690
but I never built a really key storage solution

257
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,523
or anything like that.

258
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:35,909
So I called up two friends of mine.

259
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,179
I said, "I need a crash course—how to do this."

260
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,013
I remember asking one of them ,

261
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:40,846
"how long do you think it will take to build this?"

262
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,310
He said, "A team of 10 people would take

263
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,630
a couple years to really

264
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,590
validate it and everything."

265
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,750
I said, "we have eight weeks."

266
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,570
And he said, "Oh, well you're in trouble."

267
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,910
I tagged one of the other engineers

268
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,880
on our team and we basically got to work

269
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,800
coding up the next gen, the first generation

270
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,570
of the cold storage architecture.

271
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,830
We were sleep-deprived

272
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,150
and we made some trade-offs

273
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,490
that we thought were reasonable to get it there in time.

274
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,190
But it worked and it was one of the most

275
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,830
do-or-die moments where if we had waited longer

276
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,090
and the company had gotten hacked,

277
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,950
we wouldn't exist here today.

278
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,050
There was another example like that where,

279
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,690
we were sitting there at lunch one day

280
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,190
in San Francisco

281
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,510
and someone on their computer noticed,

282
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,520
there were a lot of refunds going out.

283
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,470
We quickly realized someone had hacked into

284
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,910
one of our customer support accounts

285
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,320
and was issuing themselves refunds

286
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,940
as fast as they could.

287
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,940
I remember we shut down the whole website

288
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,520
and we figured out how they access that account,

289
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,620
managed to block it, came back online

290
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,990
maybe 12 or 24 hours later.

291
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,810
We patched it, we went back to work

292
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,970
and I realized if we had been asleep

293
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,560
when that hacker started doing it,

294
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,180
we would've been insolvent by morning.

295
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,700
We only lost $50,000 or something in that incident.

296
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,960
But it was pure luck

297
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,630
that we were in Pacific time—San Francisco—

298
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,180
they started doing it in a place where we noticed it.

299
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,250
There were moments like that in hindsight, very scary.

300
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,180
There were a coin flip.

301
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,950
There were three or four coin flips

302
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,050
not all of them were cyber-related.

303
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,430
You're right.

304
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,690
Once it started to really work,

305
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,060
there were other challenges about keeping up.

306
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,890
One was just the level

307
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,360
of customer support tickets coming in

308
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,860
and we didn't have a customer support team.

309
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,500
So nights and weekends we would,

310
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,450
9:00 PM to midnight we'd answer all the support tickets

311
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,920
after doing the other work.

312
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
At some point there were 10,000,

313
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,030
20,000, 30,000 unread support tickets

314
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,500
and people were starting to get really angry

315
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,340
and frustrated with us.

316
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,380
We realized, "Okay, we have to hyper-scale here.

317
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,630
How do we build a customer support team

318
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,780
in the next seven days or something?"

319
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,540
Somebody on our team made

320
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,800
a 10-question quiz, because

321
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,530
we couldn't interview all these people that fast.

322
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,570
We had people apply online, take this quiz,

323
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,830
it was a really hard quiz about

324
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,870
knowledge of crypto and other things.

325
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,060
We hired, did five-minute interviews

326
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,620
with a bunch of them and hired them in

327
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,730
and we started to get up to speed.

328
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,140
There were a lot of problems like that

329
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,790
that we were figuring out along the way

330
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,110
by the seat of our pants.

331
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,140
What does the general tech public not appreciate

332
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,853
about the cyber crime landscape?

333
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,190
One is that there are a lot of North Korean agents

334
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,650
trying to work at these companies.

335
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,940
In the US or remotely from North Korea?

336
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,190
For the most part remotely as far as we can tell.

337
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,360
The remote work revolution.

338
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,060
Yeah. It does bring another vector.

339
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,780
DPRK is very interested in stealing crypto.

340
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,600
You'd think that, we can collaborate

341
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,440
with law enforcement—

342
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,810
and we get these dossiers of, "Okay,

343
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,310
this is a known actor,"

344
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,530
we share sometimes with other companies.

345
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,680
But it feels like there are 500 new people

346
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,800
graduating every quarter from some school,

347
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,210
and that's their whole job.

348
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,560
Many of these cases,

349
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,090
it's not the individual person's fault,

350
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,400
their families is being, will be coerced

351
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,580
or detained if they don't cooperate.

352
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,860
They're the victim as well in many cases,

353
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,560
but they're interviewing for these roles.

354
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,570
We've had to do a number of things along the way.

355
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,960
First, these people are being coached

356
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,580
offline as they're on the camera.

357
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,413
So we force them to turn on the camera and

358
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:58,246
prove they're not AI.

359
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,273
We also started requiring everybody to

360
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,106
come to the US for orientation

361
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,510
to access any sensitive system.

362
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,770
Fingerprinting them,

363
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,990
making sure anybody with sensitive access

364
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,190
has US citizenship and family in-country

365
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,710
because you don't want someone to feel like they can flee

366
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,470
and then have no fear of extradition

367
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,670
or these kind of things.

368
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,160
We've had to kind of adapt all of this

369
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,780
on the DPRK side.

370
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,340
The other thing that was surprising to me

371
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,010
is the willingness of these threat actors

372
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,670
to try to bribe our customer support agents.

373
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,600
Our customer support agents work in facilities

374
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,610
that are pretty locked down, they have a Chromebook

375
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,110
that is pretty locked down.

376
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,910
In some cases they've been offered

377
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,080
hundreds of thousands of dollars

378
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,360
to smuggle in a personal phone

379
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,340
and take photos of a screen or something.

380
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,930
You'd think, "Wow, okay."

381
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,750
We've really had to lock down the kind of access

382
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,220
that these agents have.

383
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,740
We've started to move more of it to the US and Europe.

384
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,960
We just opened a new customer support support facility

385
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,790
in Charlotte, North Carolina

386
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,340
and really started to make a deterrent

387
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,370
in the sense of when we catch people doing this—

388
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,470
and we red team it consistently—

389
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,530
we don't walk them out the door—they go to jail.

390
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,363
We try to make it very clear that

391
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:15,196
you're destroying the rest of your life

392
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,650
by taking this, even if you think,

393
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,910
it's some life changing amount of money,

394
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,290
it's not worth going to jail.

395
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,720
These are the kind of things we've had to deal with now

396
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,610
and I'm sure the stakes will just keep getting higher.

397
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,890
So more proof of physical presence,

398
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,300
more compartmentalization,

399
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,150
and more deterrent effect through aggressive prosecution.

400
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,350
Good summary.

401
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,820
It feels like the proof of physical presence

402
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,320
is going to become a bigger deal

403
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,410
in a world of AI, deepfakes—

404
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,780
just higher stakes for all this kinda cyber crime—

405
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,800
where in a weird way, maybe you see

406
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,710
certain areas where remote work goes backwards.

407
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,270
People are saying "Oh no,

408
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,640
we want to do our customer service in the United States,"

409
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,490
or other examples like that.

410
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,440
But it feels like the physical presence

411
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,820
is becoming more relevant and not less.

412
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,653
Yeah.

413
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:02,130
By the way,

414
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:02,970
people may have seen this too,

415
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,250
but we turn the tables and we're actually going after

416
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,083
threat actors too.

417
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,730
We put out a $20 million bounty for information

418
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,150
leading to the arrest or conviction of folks

419
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,210
who recently convicted an attack on our customers—

420
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,230
who we made whole by the way.

421
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,197
We've gotten a lot of inbound tips from that

422
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:21,780
and we're having a fun time working with law enforcement

423
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,710
on tracking folks down.

424
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,290
That's the ultimate deterrent

425
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,960
is not going after insiders,

426
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,580
but after the threat actors themselves.

427
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,250
We need to be a hard target.

428
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,073
Who after the DPRK are the biggest troublemakers?

429
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,760
There's actually some groups that are in the US

430
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,200
and they're usually younger people in their twenties

431
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,860
that are caught up in hacker groups.

432
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,960
Some of them are more mobile, they're in Eastern Europe.

433
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,550
Sometimes it's about getting them

434
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,230
into a US extradition country

435
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,720
or sometimes they're already here.

436
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,340
I would say a bit of an inventory

437
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,480
of everything that's happening in crypto

438
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,220
and that'll probably be helpful for the discussion.

439
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,440
As I look at what's working,

440
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,620
store value is for sure working in a big way.

441
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,620
24/7 trading of assets—

442
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,400
I would include meme coins,

443
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,460
there's some success in payments so far.

444
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,540
But I think both our companies

445
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,680
are seeing that really ramp up.

446
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,150
We're very optimistic

447
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,940
on the just payments volumes in crypto,

448
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,240
especially stablecoins over the next five years.

449
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,220
Global access to the dollar is a big thing.

450
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,110
What else would you include in that list?

451
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,180
I think you hit the big ones.

452
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,500
Prediction markets did,

453
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,210
I'd say in their mainstream consciousness

454
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,050
during the last election.

455
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,883
For sure, that's a good one.

456
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:37,020
The volumes have continued

457
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,310
and there's some more things on the horizon

458
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,143
we could talk about.

459
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:40,590
But I think you nailed the big ones.

460
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,020
Crypto is, I guess, load-bearing for prediction markets.

461
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,050
We just didn't have them pre-crypto.

462
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,880
Yes and no.

463
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,340
There were prediction markets before crypto

464
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,740
and there's an open question currently

465
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,480
legally in the US about: if you build them

466
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,640
entirely on chain with self-custodial wallets,

467
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,840
are they not financial services?

468
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,790
In which case they're much more permissionless

469
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,140
about how they can be created—

470
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,800
which is true in self-custodial wallets and other areas.

471
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,500
That's another great one.

472
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,420
A cool thing about the trading use case too, by the way

473
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,100
is that every asset class

474
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,000
is now coming on-chain.

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,950
It's not people just trading crypto,

476
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,470
they're going to be trading stocks soon.

477
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,900
Private companies are doing capital formation

478
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,090
and commodities and FX markets,

479
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,980
debt instruments, Treasuries.

480
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,860
Every asset class is coming on-chain

481
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,510
and we're really trying to lean into that as well

482
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,280
with what we...we kind of coined this term,

483
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,240
"the everything exchange."

484
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,790
We're trying to be a liquid market

485
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,197
that's global for every asset class.

486
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:35,030
That'll be exciting in a variety of ways.

487
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,863
Both more international reach,

488
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,173
there's a lot of people in countries where they have

489
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:42,180
high demand for US assets.

490
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,340
They want to invest in NVIDIA and these things,

491
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,510
but unless you're a wealthy person—

492
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,160
usually in some of these markets—you can't get a

493
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,140
US brokerage account opened.

494
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,170
Then there's 24/7, the fractional shares

495
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,780
and you can start to do things with perpetual futures

496
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,920
and other interesting things.

497
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,230
So you think for, say, stocks,

498
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,290
there's these ADRs—American Depository Receipts—

499
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,800
where if you want to, if you're an American

500
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,099
and you want to buy a German stock or a Canadian stock,

501
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,960
it's weirdly tricky to do so.

502
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,160
So you end up buying a derivative.

503
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,040
You think on-chain is just a better derivative of that.

504
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,619
Yeah. I think a lot of those will get tokenized.

505
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,390
They are already in some ways.

506
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,369
Then private-company capital formation—

507
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,540
or even people doing anything,

508
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,849
they want to raise money for real estate development

509
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,950
or to make a film.

510
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,782
I think people will eventually be able to do

511
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:27,616
novel things around governance too

512
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,740
where let's say you really want to only have

513
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,900
long-term holders of your stock be voters.

514
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,730
You can put that in the smart contract

515
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,780
and say you had to have held this

516
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,580
for at least a year to be able to vote, right?

517
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,510
Or there's interesting things

518
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,770
you could do around that as well.

519
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,110
Is tokenization of assets that I was going to ask you...

520
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,000
what the next big use case that starts working is?

521
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,833
Would that be your vote?

522
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,193
Or are there other next big use cases

523
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:51,240
that you would point to?

524
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,350
Tokenization? Yeah.

525
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,683
The big ones right now are, trading and payments.

526
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,520
I think Bitcoin has a store of value

527
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,750
that's inflation-resistant.

528
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,950
It's not to be underestimated.

529
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,950
That's also a $20 trillion opportunity

530
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,070
with gold as a comparable—but better than gold, I think.

531
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,810
Gold is a $20 trillion market cap.

532
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,704
Yeah.

533
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:11,967
And Bitcoin is one and a half?

534
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,370
It's two or three or something, yeah.

535
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,730
Oh okay. I'm out of date.

536
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,040
And I think it'll eventually be bigger than gold.

537
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,450
Yes.

538
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,460
If that's all crypto ever was, that's already enormous.

539
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,350
But we're starting to see

540
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,910
borrowing and lending,

541
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,203
capital formation.

542
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,080
People doing decentralized

543
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,670
social media too is pretty interesting.

544
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,730
We just launched a prototype of this or a beta of—

545
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,760
I watched the Base event.

546
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,950
Yeah

547
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,783
That was cool.

548
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,770
Now people are posting content

549
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,340
and every post on social is its own coin

550
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,173
and you, the creator, have your own coin whose

551
00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:43,006
value flows up.

552
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,520
People can buy it. If they like the post,

553
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,010
they can reshare it and earn a share of the economics.

554
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,030
They can remix it.

555
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,650
You see sometimes on the internet,

556
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,170
people have like a meme template and there are a thousand—

557
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,700
—and all the value can flow

558
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,160
back to the content creators.

559
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,680
That's an interesting primordial soup

560
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,480
where some cool ideas are happening.

561
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,530
I don't know exactly how it'll play out

562
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,790
but the Base app's been fun.

563
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,710
There's a bunch of people on the wait list.

564
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,360
Those are some good new use cases.

565
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,610
I think both of us would say,

566
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,580
payments actually qualifies for a major new use case

567
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,740
because over the last 10 years

568
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,090
it's been pretty much just

569
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,920
kind of the crypto-enthusiast use case.

570
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,210
Whereas now at least we are seeing

571
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,980
a bunch of mainstream use.

572
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,813
Yeah.

573
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:26,220
I was excited to see you guys

574
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,053
come into the space because

575
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:28,860
it was super-legitimizing, frankly.

576
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,970
The tech was slowly getting there

577
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,190
and there was a scalability issue.

578
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,750
There was a usability issue

579
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,150
with, are you sending some random string of characters

580
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,760
or they sending human readable name.

581
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,110
The wallets need to get better.

582
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,630
Crypto should be the easiest way to pay.

583
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,910
What's your current thinking on

584
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,600
what's the next blocker to stablecoin adoption?

585
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,820
I think training consumer familiarity

586
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:58,800
is going to be the big one.

587
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,670
Right now one of the places

588
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,340
where still Bitcoin usage is most interesting

589
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,620
is in a cross-border money movement

590
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,820
where it solves a real world problem.

591
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,240
If you want to send $2 from the US to Turkey,

592
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,650
it's not really a thing you can do.

593
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,620
There is no product that historically fills that space.

594
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,270
Crypto makes that easy.

595
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,120
In a lot of creator economy use cases

596
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
we're seeing a lot of pull.

597
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,870
What's interesting is you get this cycle

598
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,970
of the apps getting better

599
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,660
and consumer behavior coming along with it.

600
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,480
An example of that might be if you look at QR codes.

601
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,960
The QR code as a technology has existed for decades.

602
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,140
It's a super-old technology but it required two things.

603
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,140
It required Apple to natively include QR code scanning

604
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,660
in the camera app on the iPhone.

605
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,640
If you just point the camera app on the iPhone

606
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,370
towards a QR code, it kind of did the right thing.

607
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,380
That happened in the late 2010s.

608
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,870
Then with COVID, there was lots more focus on

609
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,413
touchless experiences and things like that.

610
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:06,180
I feel like in the US people really got familiar

611
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,620
with QR codes during COVID.

612
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,660
So again, that technology had existed for a long time

613
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,960
but it required the consumer apps to get good

614
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,590
in the form of the iPhone supporting it

615
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,550
and consumers to be kind of wired to inspect it and use it.

616
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,130
I feel like we still don't have

617
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,370
both of those for the stablecoin use case.

618
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,980
Because we wanted to encourage stablecoin adoption,

619
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,680
we have our coffee station downstairs on the first floor

620
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,613
you can pay with crypto.

621
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:30,446
It's a super janky experience,

622
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:31,279
because you always run into a bug or something like that.

623
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,850
That will get good.

624
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,130
As consumers get familiar

625
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,930
and as the all the app experiences get really smooth

626
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,990
then that feels to us like it's going to

627
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,940
drive a sharp rise in usage.

628
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,810
Does that scan?

629
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,643
Totally.

630
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,610
I think you're right.

631
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,980
It'll be interesting to see if QR is what is needed here

632
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,540
or if it's a tap-to-pay NFC thing.

633
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,160
I'm using QR as a metaphor

634
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,510
for this wave of— Sure.

635
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,620
But I agree.

636
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,913
Tap-to-pay NFC feels like

637
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:01,950
it'd be a very plausible ingredient—

638
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,300
some better OS supports.

639
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,017
I guess now with the new iOS rules around NFC,

640
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:11,640
maybe you can use the NFC APIs in the Coinbase app?

641
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,473
Question mark?

642
00:22:12,473 --> 00:22:15,060
We've seen some good demos of tap-to-pay.

643
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,890
I think that part is opening up.

644
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,300
The Secure Enclave on the device

645
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,720
is another story. You still can't get it.

646
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,163
We'll keep working on that one.

647
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:23,640
I think you're right.

648
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,760
We debated mailing these stickers

649
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,593
to just flood the zone of a city to test it out—

650
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:28,426
seeing which merchants want to accept it.

651
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,470
A lot of the use case is happening across borders

652
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,930
happening in more internet-native applications

653
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,220
where crypto is the only way to pay.

654
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,540
Because it's a global group of people

655
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,370
coming together into some community.

656
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,260
It'd be a little weird to use one country's currency.

657
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,093
Yes.

658
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:44,926
Brick-and-mortar, will probably be

659
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:45,759
a later adopter is my guess.

660
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,240
They don't want to pay 2%—3% on

661
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,073
the fees they can save money and

662
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:52,906
give some of it back to the customer too.

663
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,620
Yeah, I agree.

664
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,330
It feels like the digital use case

665
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,740
is where it'll roll out first

666
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,880
and we're starting to roll out

667
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,210
more and more of the Stripe Checkout experiences—

668
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,740
pay with crypto as an option.

669
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,480
There are a lot of brick-and-mortar retailers

670
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,313
that accept Alipay or accept JCB.

671
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:09,480
Obviously that's a pretty niche use case—accepting JCB,

672
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,590
the Japanese card brand, in the United States.

673
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,200
It's a large enough constituency to be worth it.

674
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,940
It feels analogous here

675
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,450
once you get above some minimum penetration,

676
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,280
not everyone's paying with it,

677
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,650
but it's just not worth not accepting it.

678
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,520
Yeah.

679
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,540
What do you make of all the banks

680
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,373
starting to embrace crypto?

681
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:34,087
Jamie Dimon said previously,

682
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:36,150
"Bitcoin is a fraud, it's worse than tulip bulbs.

683
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,250
If I was the government, I'd close it down now."

684
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,320
And now of course they're launching JPMD,

685
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,457
their tokenized dollar.

686
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:43,590
It's just been an interesting reversal.

687
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,230
I'm curious what you make all that across banks generally.

688
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,100
Ultimately they're responding to customer demand.

689
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,553
If their clients want it,

690
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,600
they're going to support it.

691
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,740
I feel like the banks have had this

692
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,020
back and forth with crypto where they'll say,

693
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,730
"We're not so sure about Bitcoin

694
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,470
but we like blockchain technology."

695
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,190
Maybe we could make a closed network

696
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,780
for interbank settlement.

697
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,540
Or maybe they don't like paying SWIFT fees.

698
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,330
They are excited about it in the abstract

699
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,370
and they've run a lot of pilots

700
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,800
but I haven't seen them full on embrace it, right?

701
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,790
It's a little bit of that

702
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,800
Innovator's Dilemma type thing—Clay Christensen—

703
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,590
where culturally it's so hard

704
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,200
to get an organization where they're making

705
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,390
tons of money off the traditional system.

706
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,230
Anything they do in crypto

707
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,490
would just be this fraction of a share.

708
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,620
But it comes with all this risk and complexity.

709
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,640
They don't get a lot of people

710
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,590
who come in with that mindset.

711
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,450
They don't have a lot of DNA inside the company

712
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,280
that wants to build a crypto.

713
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,800
Now, I think just The New York Times

714
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,940
when the internet came out or something,

715
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,670
some of these local newspapers are not going to adapt

716
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,410
to the new system and they're going to fade away.

717
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,530
But a lot of the best ones will adapt to it, right?

718
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,050
In the same way that there are websites now

719
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,640
for these media companies.

720
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,350
The banks are going to embrace crypto.

721
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,150
The payment companies Visa and MasterCard—

722
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,250
are running good pilots on stablecoins.

723
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,290
Obviously I think Stripe's jumped in

724
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,060
with both feet, which is really smart

725
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,230
and you've caused a lot of other people

726
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,760
to wake up and do the same thing.

727
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,250
I think the smartest ones will adapt.

728
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,150
That's good.

729
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,980
From a Coinbase point of view,

730
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,290
we increasingly want to be

731
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,940
people's primary financial account, right?

732
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,490
As crypto eats financial services.

733
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,780
For some of our customers

734
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,100
we can be a bank replacement, right?

735
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,400
And they can manage their trading,

736
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,260
their payments, their direct deposit.

737
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,240
They have a credit card, they have a loan

738
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,560
and a lot of them, actually, by the way,

739
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,030
they won't even really care that it's crypto.

740
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,590
They just want the best financial services.

741
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,630
If it's the cheapest way to send money

742
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,940
to their family overseas or they can get the best rewards

743
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,650
on this card or whatever it is,

744
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,698
that's what we ultimately want to provide to them.

745
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:42,120
The banks will have to compete

746
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,953
in that new environment.

747
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:45,270
Are they going to be an infrastructure layer

748
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,460
powering some of these new fintech apps

749
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,560
that the next generation of kids

750
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,210
thinks of as their primary financial account?

751
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,550
Or are they going to adapt to the new world

752
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,010
and build their own apps or embrace crypto?

753
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,930
Like I said, the smartest banks will do it

754
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,700
and many will get left behind and that's good.

755
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,050
That's free-market competition.

756
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:01,980
Totally.

757
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,950
Companies don't disrupt consumers

758
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,760
cause disruption by voting with their feet

759
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,020
to use something else.

760
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,060
Has anyone impressed you on the banking side of things?

761
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,060
Just in terms of being forward thinking?

762
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,100
Yeah, a number of them.

763
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,813
I think Jamie Dimon

764
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,190
is a great leader—very smart

765
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,030
even though his comments on Bitcoin—

766
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,710
He's the GOAT, yeah. —I don't really agree with

767
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,117
but he's a great guy and we work with them a lot.

768
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:28,950
Santander has been really great.

769
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,100
There are some banks that have really embraced crypto

770
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,720
like Citizens Bank. Cross River and

771
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
Silicon Valley Bank had a love-hate relationship.

772
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,820
They had their own risk to manage.

773
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,653
There's a bunch.

774
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,670
What does Coinbase becoming

775
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,710
people's primary financial account look like?

776
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,100
It means that we just have a bigger responsibility

777
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,660
and share of people's financial lives.

778
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,000
It's not just going to be coming in to trade crypto,

779
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,130
"Okay, maybe I started with that

780
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,600
but I have a lot of crypto here.

781
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,150
I can get the best rate on a loan

782
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,070
to do a mortgage or whatever

783
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,140
because I have a lot of assets here as collateral."

784
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,500
Or it could mean that I can use a Bitcoin credit card

785
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,480
and get 4% back in Bitcoin as rewards when I spend, right?

786
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,240
Or it could mean that it's very easy

787
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,183
to send money overseas instantly for less than a cent.

788
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,440
So we need to do a good job of leveraging the benefits

789
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,210
of crypto to update the financial system

790
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,310
and not make it just crypto for crypto's sake.

791
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,303
The early users of Coinbase

792
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:33,330
were just crypto diehards and that's great.

793
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,130
We've gotten to maybe 6% or 7% of the world

794
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,360
has used crypto now—

795
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,090
like the early two thousands for the internet.

796
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,400
And we now need to get to about one billion

797
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,260
or half the world eventually using it

798
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,110
to really increase economic freedom globally.

799
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,770
It has to be about something more than the technology.

800
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,603
It's has to be about that

801
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:51,436
it's faster, it's cheaper, it's better.

802
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,020
It helps me get done what I want to get done.

803
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,400
The reason I ask is because

804
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,187
I observe the growth of neobanks outside the US.

805
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:02,730
Nubank has obviously taken over in Brazil.

806
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,950
Revolut is the fastest growing bank in Europe.

807
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,660
In the United States,

808
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,770
the largest consumer banks are basically the same.

809
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,070
A very similar recognizable set of characters

810
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,690
from the 1970s.

811
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,290
Maybe that'll still be true in 10 years time

812
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,297
or again, maybe things will really have shaken up.

813
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:24,570
I'm very curious what the neobank revolution

814
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,280
in the United States looks like.

815
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,900
That's a great way to phrase—

816
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,370
I probably should have phrased it that way actually

817
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,720
when I was describing it.

818
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,587
Some people are calling them

819
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,420
stablecoin neobanks or super apps, right?

820
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,620
There are a lot of terms you could come up for this,

821
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,860
I think that's our opportunity.

822
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,000
By the way, as a technicality,

823
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't think we're going to go get a banking license

824
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,280
because I don't know how deep people want to go

825
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,960
on the details here.

826
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,940
The core thing a banking license

827
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,250
allows you to do is not have all the money there.

828
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,137
It's called fractional reserve.

829
00:28:57,137 --> 00:28:58,260
Right.

830
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,390
Which is an interesting business model,

831
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,810
but it also comes with such heavyweight regulation

832
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,070
that it makes it much harder

833
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,130
to really innovate on products and ship quickly.

834
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,860
We don't want to be a bank.

835
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,850
You want to be fully backed

836
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,412
as opposed to be doing fractional reserve money.

837
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:15,810
I want to be 100% reserve, not fractional reserve,

838
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,370
which is actually safer for the customer—

839
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,450
because you can't have

840
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,100
a bank run.

841
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,631
You can even store the assets

842
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:25,200
the stablecoins especially backed in US Treasuries

843
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
and things that are bankruptcy remote, et cetera.

844
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,890
There's really strong protections you can put in there.

845
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,900
That will allow us to continue

846
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,990
to innovate and provide the best customer experience.

847
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,880
I think it could be

848
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,080
a bank replacement for many people...

849
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,967
or let's call it, I like your term—

850
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:41,610
the US needs a neobank since rest of the world

851
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,540
seem to keep having them.

852
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,373
Yeah.

853
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:48,270
What is your prediction for the 10-year rate of growth,

854
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,363
average annual growth in the Bitcoin pricing?

855
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,020
The rough idea I have in my head is,

856
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,207
we'll see a million dollar Bitcoin by 2030

857
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:02,040
and there's high error bars around these things.

858
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,690
To give you

859
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,890
a couple of data points.

860
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,250
We're starting to see regulatory clarity emerge

861
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,300
in the United States,

862
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,727
which I think is a bellwether for the rest of the G20.

863
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,010
You have The GENIUS Act passed for stablecoins,

864
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,090
but this market structure bill

865
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,830
is being debated in the Senate.

866
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,090
Fingers crossed something could happen

867
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,290
by the end of this year.

868
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,120
That would be a huge milestone.

869
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,200
The United States government now

870
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,700
has a strategic bitcoin reserve.

871
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,860
If you asked me five years ago,

872
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,630
that would've been vision board,

873
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,620
someone would've said, "You're crazy

874
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,390
the United States government's not going to

875
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,070
officially hold Bitcoin."

876
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,540
If they do that,

877
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,550
which there's now an executive order to do,

878
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,340
a bunch of other countries are going to do that.

879
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,970
We've seen a lot of interest from sovereigns, right?

880
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,330
Coinbase provides crypto services

881
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,080
to about 140 government entities federal, state,

882
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,180
local, and internationally.

883
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,740
Governments are now

884
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,090
getting more and more engaged in this.

885
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,320
You can imagine the big pools

886
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,050
of capital around the world.

887
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,380
I don't see the regulatory thing going away.

888
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,213
That was one of the big risks is,

889
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:03,046
"is the government going to shut this down?"

890
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,960
I think that risk has been severely diminished

891
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,210
and then is there going to be some flaw

892
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,170
found in the Bitcoin protocol?

893
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,810
I think that's been severely combed over at this point.

894
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,830
We need to make sure we upgrade it

895
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,447
to a post-quantum cryptography but—

896
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:19,050
Aren't Elliptic Curves already post-quantum or no?

897
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,800
They are theoretically I believe.

898
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:23,306
Really good to nail that down.

899
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:24,139
It's a little untested but yeah.

900
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:24,972
I believe there is a path

901
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,470
where the Bitcoin core team and Ethereum

902
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,303
and Solana, everyone,

903
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,740
they're looking at proposals now to upgrade to—

904
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,930
—Definitely post-quantum. Yes, yes.

905
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,590
I think the list of risks is getting diminished

906
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,330
and at the same time, the amount of demand,

907
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,980
the amount of institutional money

908
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,420
just sitting on the sidelines

909
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,860
waiting for this next bill to land.

910
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,720
The big institutions I talk to,

911
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,180
they're holding 1% of the portfolio in Bitcoin

912
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,160
and I'm like, "What would it be to 5%—10%?

913
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,500
They say regulatory clarity, that's it.

914
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,990
I think we'll continue to see huge inflows of capital.

915
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,280
The ETFs have been huge.

916
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,310
When people talk about the institutions on the sidelines,

917
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,740
I think the gold comparison is a very apt one

918
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,190
in that it's a non-productive store of wealth,

919
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,090
which I mean that is a compliment, not an insult.

920
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:15,060
But depending on what you mean by institutions,

921
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,940
I don't think the major sovereign wealth funds

922
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,210
or mutual funds or whatever

923
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,610
hold a lot of gold today.

924
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,443
I don't know.

925
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,970
Doesn't it seem like

926
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,280
you're substituting the gold buying,

927
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,450
but it would be kind of unusual for those large institutions

928
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,580
to buy a non-cash flowing asset?

929
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,170
It depends on their strategy,

930
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,490
but there is a theory that in a diversified portfolio

931
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,750
you should have some percentage of it,

932
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,233
5%—10% in commodities or whatever.

933
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,383
I think there's a good bet to be—

934
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,430
BlackRock has actually published some reports

935
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,263
and research on this—

936
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,096
about how they believe crypto should be a part

937
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,710
of every healthy diversified portfolio at this point.

938
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,500
Because it has interesting

939
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,320
inversely correlated aspects with other assets

940
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,510
and it's changing over time, by the way, as it evolves.

941
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,700
I think that we'll be sitting here in five or 10 years

942
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:13,500
and most wealth managers or maybe sovereigns

943
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,200
who hold a traditional diversified portfolio

944
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,060
will include 1%-10% crypto.

945
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,070
If you didn't want to put a fraction

946
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,020
of your portfolio into crypto,

947
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,820
should you dollar cost average into Bitcoin

948
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,070
and maybe the other major coins,

949
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,410
but not the meme coins in a market cap weighted way?

950
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,970
What's the right investment strategy

951
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,830
if you want to put some money into crypto?

952
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,200
With the caveat

953
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,790
that I'm not giving investment advice and all that,

954
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:42,180
it's reasonable for people

955
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,650
if they're just learning about any new thing,

956
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,180
whether it's crypto—

957
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,130
If you like it, put 1% of your net worth in,

958
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,900
something you're willing to lose and learn about it.

959
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,370
But within crypto, how should they put it into?

960
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,810
Bitcoin is a great place to start.

961
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,970
We have something called the COIN50 index,

962
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,010
which is the top 50 coins by market cap.

963
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,090
Market cap weighted, I presume.

964
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,170
Yeah, market cap-weighted.

965
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,150
I'm not going to go down

966
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,440
and list specific coins,

967
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,680
but I think what you should do is you should hold Bitcoin.

968
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,650
You can hold the index if you want as sort of a—

969
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,840
what you should do is go try and use crypto.

970
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,690
Spend it at a Stripe merchant.

971
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,380
Use your Coinbase credit card.

972
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,210
Post some content onto the Base app

973
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,130
and start to earn money in crypto.

974
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:27,659
Start to shop at a store that accepts it, whatever.

975
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,650
People should go use crypto.

976
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,270
There's a part of it that's an investment.

977
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,730
Eventually, by the way, as these stocks get tokenized

978
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,520
and people want to get a loan,

979
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,480
they're going to be using crypto

980
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,040
without even really knowing it underneath.

981
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,500
It's like they may not know how electricity works,

982
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,120
but they can turn on a light switch.

983
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,989
That makes sense.

984
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,550
So we have The GENIUS Act now.

985
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,139
Yeah.

986
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,518
What does it mean in particular?

987
00:34:50,518 --> 00:34:52,620
Stablecoins were legal before,

988
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,320
they're more enshrined now,

989
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,390
but just what can we do now that we have The GENIUS Act

990
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,230
that we couldn't before?

991
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,395
I'll start with stablecoins

992
00:34:59,395 --> 00:35:00,228
and then The GENIUS Act.

993
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:03,150
So stablecoins are basically fast, cheap global payments.

994
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,740
We can now do it under one second,

995
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,420
1 cent anywhere in the world.

996
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,253
That's unique.

997
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:08,520
There's no other payment rail

998
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,183
that gets all three of those fast, cheap, global.

999
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:11,016
This is not a GENIUS Act thing,

1000
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:11,849
you're just saying this is a thing

1001
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:12,682
you can now do with stablecoin.

1002
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:15,450
Yes, which I'm getting to your question too.

1003
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,460
There's no other payment rail

1004
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,960
that gets all three of those boxes checked.

1005
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,793
There's some that are fast and cheap

1006
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,000
and not global et cetera.

1007
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,620
That's a huge deal.

1008
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,930
Now, what The GENIUS Act did was it said,

1009
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,940
if you want to call yourself a stablecoin

1010
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,680
and operate in the United States,

1011
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,060
there are certain requirements you have to meet

1012
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,740
that make it more safe and trusted, right?

1013
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,810
One of them is 100% of the reserves

1014
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,200
have to be backed in US dollars or short-term US Treasuries.

1015
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,330
You can't hold it in other risky things

1016
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,860
and you have to pass an audit once in a while

1017
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,693
and prove you're doing it.

1018
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:43,680
It's basic hygiene.

1019
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,150
These are the tactical things,

1020
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,340
but the bigger picture thing that it did

1021
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,130
was it put a federal law in the books

1022
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,900
and a stamp of approval and it said,

1023
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,410
"This is going to be trusted, legal, allowed,

1024
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,180
and built in the United States."

1025
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,970
That created a huge demand

1026
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,400
from every company that deals with payments,

1027
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,003
which is 100% of them.

1028
00:36:04,003 --> 00:36:06,660
It said, we need to have a stablecoin strategy,

1029
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,670
we need to figure out what we're going to do here

1030
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,770
because it's now going to be a thing.

1031
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,270
The US government blessed it and can't be—

1032
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,400
I've noticed so much more interest in the past

1033
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,170
two or three months.It's incredible, you've probably noticed

1034
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,790
something similar. It's like gold rush.

1035
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,500
Everyone's kinda coming in trying to figure out

1036
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,700
what is going on with this

1037
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,400
and how it can save their company money.

1038
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,990
There are a lot of companies,

1039
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,400
that try to pay out developers

1040
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,020
in these markets all over the world.

1041
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,120
In the US and Europe and a few other countries,

1042
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,050
it works pretty well.

1043
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,700
Then there's a whole long tail tailed countries

1044
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,650
where people just don't have access

1045
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,570
to good financial services.

1046
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,130
It's kind of a black box,

1047
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,450
how much money shows up on the other side

1048
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,450
of this payment rail with huge fees taken out.

1049
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,880
If you have a global payment rail

1050
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,713
that's fast and cheap, it just,

1051
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:46,546
it democratizes access to financial services

1052
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,070
where anybody with a smartphone

1053
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,020
is on a more level playing field,

1054
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,210
their wealth can't be taken away from them,

1055
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,100
eroded away via inflation.

1056
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,870
It's an incredible tool for progress

1057
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,430
and just property rights

1058
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,800
and sound money, economic freedom.

1059
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,470
That's what that opened up with stablecoins.

1060
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,030
Now we need to get the market structure bill done,

1061
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,580
which is all the non stablecoin crypto assets.

1062
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,413
Got it.

1063
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:10,320
This what's security,

1064
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,280
what's not, all that kinda stuff.

1065
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,113
Yep.

1066
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:13,770
You must have some funny stories

1067
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,110
from the passage of The GENIUS Act

1068
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,062
because it was such a winding—

1069
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:20,910
Rollercoaster ride.

1070
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,743
Yeah.

1071
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:24,060
One thing I realized was

1072
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,150
for a long time, we were trying to make progress in DC

1073
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,670
and try to advocate for legislation

1074
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,620
and nothing was ever happening.

1075
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,640
I realized that,

1076
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,440
people educated me about this a little bit.

1077
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,350
It's kind of rare for Congress to act.

1078
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,760
In fact, somebody told me,

1079
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,440
"Congress is really good at doing two things,

1080
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,860
nothing and overreacting in some crisis moment."

1081
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,230
We realized that a certain point

1082
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,890
we had to generate a political will to do this

1083
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,560
and we had 50 million people in the US

1084
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,180
who had used crypto.

1085
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,950
We said, "Let's try to get them organized."

1086
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,830
We funded this 501c4 I believe

1087
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,240
called standwithcrypto.org.

1088
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,010
We got 2 million of these folks in the US

1089
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,240
to raise their hand and say they wanted to elect

1090
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,770
pro-crypto candidates.

1091
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,660
I remember I was talking to our policy team

1092
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,180
and I said, "let's put a scorecard A to F

1093
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,070
of every politician in this upcoming election

1094
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,450
in last November."

1095
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,340
Our policy team's

1096
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,470
whole job is to build relationships with politicians.

1097
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,640
So they're said, "Why don't we put a list

1098
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,750
of our crypto champions?"

1099
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,400
And I said, "No, I want to put a list

1100
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,740
of the crypto enemies too with an F.

1101
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,640
Who has an F?"

1102
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,340
I could see them nervously perspiring.

1103
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,400
Let's put the scorecards—

1104
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,080
someone needs to win an election,

1105
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,580
someone needs to lose an election

1106
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,840
because of the crypto vote.

1107
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,800
Crypto famously, in terms of how it shows up in DC,

1108
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,390
is much more pugnacious than,

1109
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,562
say tech was historically.

1110
00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:46,395
Where we have our friends and we have our enemies

1111
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:47,228
and things like that.

1112
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:50,310
So did that and the stand with crypto

1113
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,880
and Fairshake—I guess Fairshake was a more relevant one

1114
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,270
in some of the recent battles.

1115
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,370
Did that come from you essentially

1116
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,250
that we're not going to be pussyfooting around here,

1117
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,800
we're going to make clear how we feel?

1118
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,300
There were a lot of people involved,

1119
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,470
so I can't claim full credit,

1120
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,720
but what I saw shift in the crypto industry

1121
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,840
was a lot of the traditional policy advice

1122
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,153
that we got from people who worked in tech,

1123
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,050
they all said, "You need to go in there

1124
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,780
and build relationships, so be the good cop.

1125
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,750
Then what you should do is form a trade organization

1126
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,480
who can be bad cop and they can go fight the battles

1127
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,780
and write the nasty op-eds and whatever."

1128
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,920
For whatever reason,

1129
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,050
the people we kept getting into these trade groups

1130
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,030
wanted to also be good cop.

1131
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,215
I kept thinking, okay— When does the bad cop arrive?

1132
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:36,060
Yeah, yeah.

1133
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,470
Who's going to get into the political blood sport on X

1134
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,450
and be tearing down these people

1135
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,040
that are doing bad things.

1136
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,110
They just wanted to have polite meetings

1137
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,130
behind closed doors.

1138
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,680
So, I realized at a certain point

1139
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,513
as the election was coming up,

1140
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,346
if they don't do it, maybe no one's going to do it.

1141
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,773
So maybe we should do it, right?

1142
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:57,300
I don't think we did anything too crazy

1143
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,970
but what we did do is we, for DC standards,

1144
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,470
this was crazy.

1145
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:06,300
We came out and we said, we're unequivocally pro-crypto.

1146
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,880
We don't care if you're on the left or the right.

1147
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,250
We want to elect pro-crypto candidates.

1148
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,580
By the way, we want to get anti-crypto candidates

1149
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,110
out of office.

1150
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,690
This really blew people's minds in DC

1151
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,730
because everything there is kinda partisan.

1152
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,130
There was a feeding frenzy

1153
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,180
coming up to the election

1154
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,520
where I was getting angry phone calls from both sides.

1155
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,183
Like, "How could you have given money to this person?"

1156
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:30,720
And we said, "Well, they're pro-crypto."

1157
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,197
And then I get a call from the other side,

1158
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,420
"How could you have given to that person?"

1159
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,650
I'd say, "Well, they're pro-crypto."

1160
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,360
Really a single issue voter.

1161
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,670
So on the one hand I thought,

1162
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,980
maybe we're pissing off both sides

1163
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,200
and we'll have no friends after the election.

1164
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,330
But on the other hand, if you're taking flack,

1165
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,247
you're over the target.

1166
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,193
We're explicitly an apolitical company.

1167
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:50,026
But we are unapologetically pro-crypto.

1168
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,270
To me it was very consistent.

1169
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,280
By the way, I had to remind many of them.

1170
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,250
Apolitical does not mean 50/50.

1171
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,230
It means we will elect a pro-crypto candidate

1172
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,760
regardless of what party they

1173
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,040
or help donate to them or whatever

1174
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,420
regardless of which party they're in.

1175
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,707
It's not necessarily going to be 50/50,

1176
00:41:07,707 --> 00:41:10,050
it might be 60/40 one way and 60/40 the other way

1177
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,480
the next election.

1178
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,180
That was a big mental shift

1179
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,250
and it was kind of a contrarian thing,

1180
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,670
and it helped elect the most pro-crypto Congress.

1181
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,503
The work that we did along with a bunch of other people—

1182
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:22,336
I don't want to take credit for it,

1183
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,520
a bunch of other companies worked on this—

1184
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,680
that set up the most pro-crypto Congress,

1185
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,230
which is now getting this legislation passed.

1186
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,680
We made it clear to people in DC that if you're anti-crypto,

1187
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,930
there's no constituency for that.

1188
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,340
The American people want crypto,

1189
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,760
and if you are pro-crypto it can help you get elected.

1190
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,070
It's just good politics.

1191
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,110
That was a novel idea.

1192
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,090
Do you have issues now once you get through

1193
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,000
the market structure bill, The GENIUS Act's happened,

1194
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,815
do you have issues left?

1195
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:55,440
Are you done going to DC?

1196
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,930
The upside to all of this,

1197
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,310
there was a lot of downside.

1198
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,080
I mean, literally in the last-

1199
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,913
You stuck your neck out.

1200
00:42:01,913 --> 00:42:04,260
Yeah. In the last administration,

1201
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,810
they were trying to kill the whole industry.

1202
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,640
Now that we've gotten to

1203
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,310
build a little bit of knowledge around policy,

1204
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,143
which can be dangerous to think you know too much,

1205
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:12,976
these things can go either way—

1206
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,010
hopefully we'll get market structure done.

1207
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,720
It does kinda start to make me wonder

1208
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,770
what else can we do to update,

1209
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,850
help update the financial system.

1210
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,590
Our mission is around increasing economic freedom.

1211
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,480
An example would be,

1212
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,860
I think the accredited investor laws

1213
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,597
are kind of unfair.

1214
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:30,600
Only rich people can invest money to get richer.

1215
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,460
That seems regressive, right?

1216
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,620
There could be a financial literacy test, for instance,

1217
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,720
instead of having a certain net worth or income

1218
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,470
to become an accredited investor.

1219
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,490
I'm very excited about this idea

1220
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,350
of special economic zones.

1221
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,470
They've worked very well in China with Shenzhen

1222
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,750
and in the UAE in these places.

1223
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,610
We have so much regulation,

1224
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,040
why not have a sandbox for one area to test out new ideas

1225
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,860
where you could have one around crypto or biotech

1226
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,040
or drones or supersonic aircraft.

1227
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,950
It'd be great to see if we could get,

1228
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,860
10 pieces of federal land in the United States

1229
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,020
set up as different special economic zones.

1230
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,910
There's a company called PROSPERO

1231
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,650
which we actually invested in,

1232
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,495
which has a prototype set up in South America,

1233
00:43:12,495 --> 00:43:14,910
but they're trying to do this now in the United States.

1234
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,530
There's a lot of different areas.

1235
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,213
Do you have any favorite pet policy issues

1236
00:43:18,213 --> 00:43:21,450
that you would push for in DC?

1237
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,710
Probably something with aviation.

1238
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,749
I'm just going to say, this one happened.

1239
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,590
I'm super excited about

1240
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,273
these new mosaic rules that happened—

1241
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:31,800
What is that?

1242
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,570
In general, there's been a lot of discussion

1243
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,750
around the deregulatory agenda of the current admin

1244
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,583
and you're like, "Okay, getting rid of outdated regulations

1245
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:38,416
seems great,

1246
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,390
but you need to actually go do it

1247
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,640
and pass the new rules."

1248
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,440
They just did that in the aviation sector

1249
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,330
where you can't just build a plane

1250
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:49,320
and sell it to the general public.

1251
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,480
You have to go through a whole bunch of FAA approvals

1252
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,700
that were both a very cumbersome process,

1253
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,840
took multiple years,

1254
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,673
and also a very prescriptive process.

1255
00:43:55,673 --> 00:43:56,506
Where you can only have these kinds of engines

1256
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,173
or something like that.

1257
00:44:00,173 --> 00:44:02,580
So, famously electric aircraft couldn't be certified

1258
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,413
because they said, "An aircraft engine

1259
00:44:03,413 --> 00:44:04,246
burns gasoline, does this and that."

1260
00:44:07,243 --> 00:44:10,560
They just came along with the,

1261
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,930
Sean Duffy announced last month,

1262
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,420
this new regime for certifying aircraft

1263
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,250
that is radically simpler,

1264
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,020
I think will allow for much more

1265
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,240
kind of bottoms up innovation in that sector.

1266
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,600
That would've been on my list, but it happened.

1267
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,180
I think we'll see much more innovation

1268
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,710
in the light aviation sector,

1269
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,300
which obviously the US used to be a leader in

1270
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,780
and stagnated over the past decades.

1271
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,613
Yeah.

1272
00:44:34,613 --> 00:44:36,600
I think you might have seen by the way the,

1273
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,460
there was an exec order instructing the FAA

1274
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,460
to allow supersonic aircraft that over land in the US

1275
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,160
that did not create an audible boom by some decibel thing.

1276
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,330
Yes, yes.

1277
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,163
That was really exciting.

1278
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:48,810
I'd love to fly places much faster.

1279
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:52,804
Another one I think would be great is

1280
00:44:52,804 --> 00:44:53,637
it takes 10 years and $2 billion apparently

1281
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,460
to get a drug to market through the FDA.

1282
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,650
They have these three phases of trials

1283
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,813
around safety and efficacy.

1284
00:44:59,813 --> 00:45:01,710
It'd be amazing

1285
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,320
if you pass one phase one for safety,

1286
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,180
why not let a doctor prescribe it,

1287
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,700
especially to somebody who is end of life patient

1288
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,930
who has no other options.

1289
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,910
You know it's safe,

1290
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,470
you just don't know if it's effective,

1291
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,610
let a doctor make that call.

1292
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,830
This would give you data much sooner

1293
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,066
on getting these drugs to market.

1294
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:20,220
Every year that goes by, there's people dying.

1295
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,440
There's so many things like that

1296
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,160
that could be improved by

1297
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,210
making sensible deregulatory movements.

1298
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,240
I think everyone agrees that the accredited investor rules

1299
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,280
are a bit silly.

1300
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,920
They are both exclusionary—

1301
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,560
if you don't meet the kind of minimum net worth test—

1302
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,580
and as we have seen, wealthy people are not that

1303
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,730
necessarily savvy when it comes to making investors.

1304
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,440
The list of Theranos investors

1305
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,280
was a who's who of various wealthy and accredited people.

1306
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,930
At the same time, when it's just a free for all,

1307
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,850
you get a bunch of scams and frauds

1308
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:01,470
and the US has some of the best

1309
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,600
capital markets in the world.

1310
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,730
As I look at what's happened in the crypto world

1311
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,920
where various pockets are more liberal,

1312
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,680
I think the whole phenomena of rugging

1313
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,280
and people looking to engage

1314
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,980
in zero-sum behaviors are some of the worst things

1315
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,930
that we should not allow to perpetuate.

1316
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,280
I'm curious, as you think about

1317
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,130
replacing the accredited investor rules,

1318
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,130
what would your framework be for liberalizing investment

1319
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,020
and yet keeping the best things we have today?

1320
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,980
Which is I think, really high standards of propriety

1321
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,750
and really strict rules for honesty and fair dealing?

1322
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,130
That's a great question.

1323
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,620
Fraud you'd want to prosecute

1324
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,700
to the full extent of the law.

1325
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,650
One thing you could do is have requirements

1326
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,330
in there about disclosures.

1327
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,930
And say, if you want to raise money for this thing,

1328
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,940
you do have to provide the following information.

1329
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,770
If you materially you mistake something,

1330
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,290
especially intentionally,

1331
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,670
and you defraud investors,

1332
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,710
you should go to jail for that.

1333
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,350
It doesn't mean only wealthy people,

1334
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,760
wealthy people should be allowed to do it.

1335
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,000
That's a nice way to divide up those issues.

1336
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,310
There's also

1337
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:14,130
we don't want to create this false idea

1338
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,800
that the government stamp of approval

1339
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,420
means it's a good investment.

1340
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,170
Because there's many stocks that have been—

1341
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,790
publicly traded companies, in theory,

1342
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,050
blessed by the SEC or whatever,

1343
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,950
that went down 85%—90% in the last few years.

1344
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,620
Some of the biotechs, I won't name companies,

1345
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,870
but you can lose your shirt

1346
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,240
in the public markets with these officially—

1347
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,460
We need to teach a sense

1348
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,140
of personal responsibility in this too,

1349
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,040
which is there is no return without some amount of risk.

1350
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,490
The government is not here to tell you

1351
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,780
what is a good investment or not.

1352
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,250
You still have to make that judgment yourself.

1353
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,100
But they can help by saying,

1354
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,990
"The information this person's giving you is true."

1355
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,230
And if they're lying to you, there's tort law for that

1356
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,630
where you can go have damages.

1357
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,430
I probably lean a little more free-market on this

1358
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,643
than most people.

1359
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,630
The best consumer protection sometimes

1360
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,070
is competition.

1361
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:14,940
If you have a car company and it's a bad car

1362
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,010
and it keeps breaking down and it's expensive.

1363
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:21,090
In some ways the best solution is to have

1364
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,740
another company come and try to compete with them

1365
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,130
and provide a better alternative.

1366
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,380
A lot of people are very street smart,

1367
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,600
even if they're not financially literate,

1368
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,140
but they know what a scam is.

1369
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,620
They know that their three friends told them

1370
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,120
that that thing is not good.

1371
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:36,960
Do you guys try to do anything

1372
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,463
on the Coinbase product side of things

1373
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:41,820
with some of the coin hype scams that happen?

1374
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,130
Or do you say people are grownups

1375
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,050
and they should evaluate their own investments?

1376
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:47,460
We've had a lot of debate about this

1377
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,220
because it's a little bit like the app stores

1378
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,440
or maybe even Amazon.

1379
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,520
Let's say someone's trying to sell

1380
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,470
a fraudulent product on Amazon.

1381
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,450
They probably want to get rid of that.

1382
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:59,610
But let's say that it's like a two or a three star product

1383
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:03,270
and some people like it and a lot of people don't.

1384
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,826
But it's not a fraud. You actually—

1385
00:49:05,826 --> 00:49:07,410
You want to allow people to make their own choices

1386
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:08,670
and see it got two stars,

1387
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,650
but you can buy this if you want.

1388
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,763
Maybe the provider of it can clean it up too.

1389
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:16,650
We've tried to take a similar philosophy

1390
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:20,400
where we want to list everything that is legal,

1391
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,073
and frauds would be illegal,

1392
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,860
and provide information to the customer

1393
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,150
to help them make better decisions.

1394
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,590
We've tried variations of this,

1395
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,580
we haven't quite nailed it yet.

1396
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,930
I think about an on-chain review system

1397
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,410
or reputation score.

1398
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,690
We released an API that allows

1399
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,490
anybody to look up a crypto address,

1400
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,470
which could be for an asset or a person

1401
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,420
and have an on-chain reputation score.

1402
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,400
So it's an early prototype of this.

1403
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,960
Eventually you'll get

1404
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,150
a FICO score equivalent.

1405
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,243
You'll get an Amazon or Yelp rating equivalent.

1406
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,230
You want to make sure if I'm trying to send

1407
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:59,610
a few USD coin to John Collison for the pint,

1408
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,770
I need to make sure it's the real John Collison.

1409
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,363
Not an imposter squatting on your name

1410
00:50:05,363 --> 00:50:07,680
Those are some of the tools

1411
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,740
in the private market build that would help this.

1412
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,560
And let the government go after the fraudsters.

1413
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,393
That makes sense.

1414
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:16,260
You mentioned crypto's product market fit

1415
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,370
in emerging markets

1416
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,220
and there is a very strong product-market fit there

1417
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,270
that's not new.

1418
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,910
People in markets where there's historically been

1419
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:26,910
a very high rate of inflation have traditionally sought

1420
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:29,220
to get money out of that currency.

1421
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,680
People talk about buying hard assets

1422
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,930
as one approach trying to get money in dollars.

1423
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,960
It's already a behavior to try and get money

1424
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,023
out of that currency and into something

1425
00:50:40,023 --> 00:50:41,910
that they think will hold its value better.

1426
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,350
This is not invented by crypto.

1427
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,850
This existed for many decades.

1428
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,370
Maybe countries where there is a black market exchange rate

1429
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,770
that's a good indicator

1430
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:51,570
for there will be this demand there.

1431
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,400
The governments of many of these countries

1432
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,100
will not always approve of this

1433
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,600
where they would prefer

1434
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,000
that all money is kept in the country's currency.

1435
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,560
There's kind of a gap between what the government wants

1436
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,450
and what the people want.

1437
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,190
Where does this go? Who wins?

1438
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,930
You're right.

1439
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,610
We are often walking in this balance

1440
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,810
when we go into a new country

1441
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,540
where we really want to work within the existing system.

1442
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:15,570
We often will go get a license, set up a local entity

1443
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,820
for our regulated financial service products.

1444
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,210
I'll come back to our self-custodial wallet in a moment.

1445
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,280
There are usually portions of the government

1446
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,410
which are hesitant around crypto.

1447
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,110
Sometimes it's the central bank.

1448
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,460
There's other parts of the government

1449
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,570
that are actually very pro—

1450
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,160
they want to digitize the country

1451
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,140
and create economic opportunity.

1452
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,400
We're sort of talking—

1453
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,020
you talk to different hands of the government,

1454
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,430
you'll hear different things.

1455
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:41,340
But the people unequivocally want it.

1456
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,980
In many parts of the world,

1457
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,180
we're able to work within that system

1458
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,440
and offer what people want.

1459
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,690
Other parts of the world,

1460
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,150
it would be difficult to impossible

1461
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,110
for us to go in and create

1462
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,040
a regulated financial service business.

1463
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,520
Because that country doesn't have

1464
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,630
a clear regulatory framework.

1465
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,700
They only give out bank licenses

1466
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,770
to their cousins and friends who bribed them

1467
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,630
which would be illegal for a US company to do.

1468
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,640
You just can't do business very well effectively

1469
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,990
in many of these places.

1470
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,060
So we also have a self-custodial wallet

1471
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,757
that is not regulated as a financial service business

1472
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:13,320
because we never take possession of customer funds.

1473
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,030
It's regulated more like a software product

1474
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,120
like a messaging app, you can just launch it.

1475
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,910
As if you kept your keys in 1Password.

1476
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,290
Ultimately it's a software product.

1477
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:20,490
Yeah.

1478
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,170
That's allowing us to go

1479
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,460
into some of these other markets.

1480
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,830
You asked where this will go.

1481
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,360
In some of these markets,

1482
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,110
I'd say there's the top five or 10 fiat currencies,

1483
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,240
government currencies, the majors.

1484
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,190
Those will probably stay around.

1485
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,840
I don't think they're going anywhere.

1486
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,040
But the— —US dollar, Swiss Franc,

1487
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,210
everything like that. Yeah.

1488
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,170
But the long tail,

1489
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,590
the other 150 or so government currencies,

1490
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:44,970
I think they probably should get replaced.

1491
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:47,040
They're not doing a good job.

1492
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,150
They're often abused.

1493
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,100
They're eroding the rights of the people.

1494
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,190
I think that there is a good case to be made

1495
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,270
that those should get replaced

1496
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,280
by Bitcoin and USDC, et cetera.

1497
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,113
It was Ecuador, something like that,

1498
00:52:57,113 --> 00:52:57,946
they pegged their currency of the dollar too.

1499
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,340
So it's a way of doing that in all these countries

1500
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,440
almost as an act of civil disobedience, frankly.

1501
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,750
In some of these places like Venezuela,

1502
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,330
you may be technically breaking the law or something

1503
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,250
by introducing a self-custodial wallet

1504
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,020
that brings dollars to the people.

1505
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,040
I think I'd be okay with that.

1506
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,570
That's an act of civil—

1507
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,490
because people are really in terrible conditions.

1508
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,500
There due to the government stealing their wealth

1509
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,730
via inflation.

1510
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,980
That is a good thing.

1511
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,290
Even in—

1512
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:26,700
obviously digital dollar is very

1513
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,960
unequivocally good for the United States

1514
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,490
and keeping the reserve currency status

1515
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,780
and demand for treasuries.

1516
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,760
It's also a good thing for Bitcoin

1517
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,930
to be used in the United States

1518
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:36,300
because the democracies around the world

1519
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,400
are having a problem right now with deficit spending.

1520
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,610
It's this kind of issue that

1521
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,440
to get elected you can promise more free stuff

1522
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,630
and that drives up the cost.

1523
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:48,150
How are we going to have the discipline to balance budgets?

1524
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,010
Bitcoin is part of the answer to that.

1525
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,930
It's a check-and-balance on deficit spending

1526
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,310
where if it gets too out of control,

1527
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,740
people will flee to Bitcoin in times of uncertainty.

1528
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,140
If deficit spending is kept under control,

1529
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,650
people will continue to use that fiat currency.

1530
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,120
I don't want to be hyperbolic about this,

1531
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,280
but I think Bitcoin is in some ways

1532
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,230
extending Western civilization

1533
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,580
or in the American experiment.

1534
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,830
If the US is going to lose

1535
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,660
the reserve currency status, which I hope it doesn't,

1536
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,830
because I'm an American,

1537
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,320
I believe America is a good thing for the world.

1538
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,210
But if we lose all discipline

1539
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,520
and we're going to lose the reserve currency status,

1540
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,190
I'd rather people went to Bitcoin than to the Chinese Yuan.

1541
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,590
Thank goodness we have Bitcoin

1542
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:29,070
as a check-and-balance in this new economy.

1543
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:33,480
The deficit warriors look at the deficit maths

1544
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,250
and say, "Interest payments

1545
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,050
are inaugurated in defense spending."

1546
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:41,467
How does the US avoid losing reserve currency status?

1547
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:44,490
Don't inflate away the dollar.

1548
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,323
The debt to GDP ratios

1549
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,156
are the thing to watch usually.

1550
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,200
I think I forget where we're at now,

1551
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,700
150 or 170 or something.

1552
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,070
If you look at historically

1553
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,340
maybe when it was the British lost it or the Dutch,

1554
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,680
they were in the 200—250 range.

1555
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,513
We're within sight of

1556
00:54:59,513 --> 00:55:00,346
a pretty dangerous threshold historically.

1557
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,220
It's hard to see where the political will

1558
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,870
is going to come from to do that.

1559
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,140
I hope that Bitcoin could be a part of that solution.

1560
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,973
We'll see.

1561
00:55:10,973 --> 00:55:13,649
Why haven't non-dollar stablecoins worked?

1562
00:55:13,649 --> 00:55:17,003
The share of global stablecoins

1563
00:55:17,003 --> 00:55:19,920
that is US dollars is 95% plus.

1564
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,540
It's much higher than the

1565
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,460
US dollar share of currency.

1566
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,900
Why is that and will it persist?

1567
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,880
If you're going to have

1568
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,400
permissionless access to anything,

1569
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,350
you're going to use the most trusted one,

1570
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:32,400
the reserve currency.

1571
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,500
That could be why.

1572
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,360
Europe to their credit, they did put—

1573
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,430
sometimes Europe's the leader on regulation,

1574
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,600
which is not necessarily what you want to lead on.

1575
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,610
They did get out a regulatory framework

1576
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,080
before the US to their credit.

1577
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,127
There is a Euro coin, you're right.

1578
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,060
But it's very small.

1579
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:45,990
It's very small.

1580
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,430
Doesn't have a lot of traction.

1581
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,710
I don't know, I think the dollar is solving

1582
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:51,510
the need that people have.

1583
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,040
One other thing that's even smaller,

1584
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,440
which I think has interesting potential

1585
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,183
is called a flatcoin.

1586
00:55:58,074 --> 00:55:59,250
I don't know if you've seen these,

1587
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:02,190
instead of tracking a one-to-one backed by a dollar,

1588
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,170
which of course, has some level of inflation

1589
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,073
between whatever, two to 5% a year,

1590
00:56:06,073 --> 00:56:08,880
a flatcoin tries to track CPI,

1591
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,740
which is the Consumer Pricing Index

1592
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,540
to maintain its purchasing power.

1593
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,250
So if a Big Mac costs— Like tips.

1594
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,300
Inflation-protected.

1595
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,500
Securities.

1596
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,150
If you could buy a Big Mac

1597
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,760
for a dollar or whatever today,

1598
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,350
a stablecoin ideally 10 years from now,

1599
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,460
you'd also be able to buy it for a dollar.

1600
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,770
There's one that's built by this company

1601
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,210
called Ampleforth, it's called SPOT

1602
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:31,800
and it's been tracking a 2019 dollar since 2019

1603
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,489
and it's now worth about $1.26.

1604
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:35,910
It went through crazy ups and downs.

1605
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:37,320
It's actually been pretty flat.

1606
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,153
Economists will often debate

1607
00:56:38,153 --> 00:56:38,986
do you want to have 2%—3% inflation a year

1608
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,160
to incentivize people to spend their money?

1609
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:45,960
It's kind of nice to have one that also maintains

1610
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,720
its purchasing power for putting contracts together

1611
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,300
and pricing things that you want to be

1612
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,500
the same price in the future.

1613
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,400
Yes.

1614
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:55,853
Whoa. Wow.

1615
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:56,686
Wow, okay.

1616
00:56:56,686 --> 00:56:57,519
What was that?

1617
00:56:57,519 --> 00:56:58,800
How much is the center center?

1618
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,202
So the bullseye is 50, so 78.

1619
00:57:01,202 --> 00:57:02,360
78? Okay.

1620
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,193
Whew.

1621
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:05,508
Well.

1622
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:08,350
18, 23 and four is 27.

1623
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:10,470
Okay. We did it.

1624
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,673
TradFi wins again.

1625
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,883
What have you learned from Balaji?

1626
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:17,880
For anyone who doesn't know Balaji,

1627
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,713
but you can probably— hey probably know

1628
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:20,280
who Balaji is.

1629
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,240
He's Balaji.

1630
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,010
He is one word. It's like Madonna.

1631
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,690
Exactly, just— Yeah, one name.

1632
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:25,530
Balaji's a brilliant guy.

1633
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:26,363
I mean he's probably,

1634
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:27,196
top couple of the smartest people I've ever met in my life.

1635
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,010
He's very out there.

1636
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,260
He's truly an original thinker.

1637
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:37,200
He was briefly the chief technology officer of Coinbase.

1638
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,870
He came in through an acquisition, did some amazing work

1639
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,500
and he taught me how to manage

1640
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,600
a totally different type of person

1641
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,170
Balaji, he is kind of unmanageable.

1642
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,300
He's what some people might call a free radical

1643
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,720
within an organization. He really bounces around

1644
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,690
and he's just kind of absorbing vast amounts of information.

1645
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,360
Even things that aren't his responsibility,

1646
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,104
maybe he's not even supposed to be doing.

1647
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:04,941
—Was explicitly told not to do them.

1648
00:58:04,941 --> 00:58:07,680
Yeah, was explicitly told not to do them, does it anyway.

1649
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,840
Occasionally he would come back to me

1650
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,330
with these incredible insights.

1651
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:16,020
I'll give you one funny Balaji story,

1652
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,880
at one point he came back to me

1653
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,840
and he said, "These are all the salespeople

1654
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,350
that are making more revenue than their salary

1655
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:26,580
and these are all people that are not."

1656
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,010
First thought I had was,

1657
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,700
you're not supposed to have access to anybody's salary.

1658
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,890
How did you get that?

1659
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,000
He said, "Don't worry about it.

1660
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,470
I found it in some database

1661
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,170
somewhere I wasn't supposed to have access to."

1662
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,003
The other thing I asked him was,

1663
00:58:38,003 --> 00:58:39,720
"Well, how did you connect all that up?

1664
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,553
Because last week I was asking the data team.

1665
00:58:40,553 --> 00:58:41,386
Can you connect up Salesforce

1666
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,230
to all of our salary data

1667
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,520
and let's start to run some reports

1668
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,290
and have some more accountability."

1669
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:52,230
And he was said, "Oh, well, I couldn't sleep this weekend

1670
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,470
and something felt off

1671
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:59,070
and so I had to code it up and put it all together."

1672
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,410
And I said, "Okay, give me a little bit of time

1673
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:02,400
to go verify this."

1674
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,660
He came in on Monday,

1675
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,500
he looked like he hadn't slept the whole weekend.

1676
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,830
He is kind of this mad genius.

1677
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,210
By the way, I went and ran it down

1678
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,230
with the actual data team

1679
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,940
and it took them three weeks to replicate

1680
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,990
what he had done over the weekend.

1681
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,330
But it came back and he's 100% right.

1682
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:18,180
He continually was doing things like that.

1683
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,430
He's incredibly high disagreeableness,

1684
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,540
which I learned from him as well,

1685
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,497
where he would go into a team and say,

1686
00:59:23,497 --> 00:59:25,500
"Why is this not functioning well?"

1687
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,290
He would suffer no fools.

1688
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:29,970
He would not be afraid to go in there

1689
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:33,090
and turn half the people on a team,

1690
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,380
whether he had the permission to fire them or not.

1691
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,240
Sometimes he would just torture them

1692
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,310
to greatness or whatever.

1693
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,810
He has a very contrarian figure.

1694
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,120
I'd say about once a week someone would come into my office

1695
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,213
as CEO and say, "I can't work with Balaji.

1696
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,530
He's causing so much collateral damage."

1697
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,630
I'd say, "Yeah, but he's also generating

1698
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,340
an enormous amount of value.

1699
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,370
I need you to learn how to work with him.

1700
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,050
I realize it's difficult,

1701
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,690
but it's creating a very positive outcome

1702
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:01,523
across all these areas."

1703
01:00:01,523 --> 01:00:03,720
Now, I knew that it wasn't going to last forever

1704
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,910
because it was incredibly disruptive.

1705
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:06,743
I learned from him how to come and be like

1706
01:00:06,743 --> 01:00:07,576
a turnaround CEO when needed. If I can call it that.

1707
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,850
In the past I was opting a little more toward

1708
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:18,360
trying to be liked instead of to be clear

1709
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,010
about what we're doing and where we're going

1710
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,300
and what the bar is.

1711
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,550
He helped me be better CEO

1712
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,470
and have a little more disagreeableness.

1713
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:28,350
He encouraged you to let Brian be Brian,

1714
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:29,850
listen to yourself more.

1715
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:32,220
I liked the tweet a while back, what was it?

1716
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,960
The three scariest words in the English language

1717
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,354
are Balaji was right. Yeah.

1718
01:00:35,354 --> 01:00:36,690
I think it was about some COVID prediction

1719
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:37,800
or something like that. Yeah.

1720
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,970
He was frequently very early on his predictions.

1721
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,197
And I think that—

1722
01:00:43,197 --> 01:00:44,520
Are there predictions he had

1723
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,840
that you thought were crazy at the time

1724
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,600
that now you've or worldviews he had that,

1725
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,160
you thought were crazy initially

1726
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,210
and now you've come around?

1727
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:55,290
Yeah. He was early

1728
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:57,420
warning me about the activist

1729
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,500
contingent within the company.

1730
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,053
And I said, this is not a big deal.

1731
01:01:01,053 --> 01:01:01,886
Just the apolitical company stuff.

1732
01:01:01,886 --> 01:01:03,090
Yeah.

1733
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,620
Which led to the mission first post.

1734
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,990
He was telling me about that years before

1735
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:09,420
and I thought this can't be a big deal.

1736
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,330
So on that, in 2020 you released this blog post

1737
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,190
saying that Coinbase is a mission-oriented company

1738
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,130
and take all your other issues you might have

1739
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,510
and don't come to them with us

1740
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,860
and work somewhere else if you don't like it.

1741
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,970
You had a buyout offer

1742
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,350
if people didn't want to work at such a company.

1743
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:26,010
and a few percent of the company took the buyout.

1744
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,560
This was a big deal at the time

1745
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,090
and everyone was talking about it.

1746
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,580
I think part of what's interesting is

1747
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:36,840
how much the industry has moved. Coinbase was,

1748
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,950
I don't want to say a pariah,

1749
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:40,200
but definitely notable at the time

1750
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,410
for being so stringent on this point.

1751
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:46,590
Recently Google was

1752
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,300
putting out a blog post saying,

1753
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,530
leave your politics at home.

1754
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:52,230
We're just focused on organizing the world's information

1755
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,063
and we don't want to hear from you about all

1756
01:01:53,063 --> 01:01:54,480
your other stuff.

1757
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,070
It feels like Silicon Valley

1758
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:57,420
has really shifted on this.

1759
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,070
One question I had is

1760
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,530
you talk about being an apolitical company.

1761
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:04,050
I feel like apolitical is a convenient way to frame it,

1762
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,940
but it's maybe more something like,

1763
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,480
there's actually a very narrow set of views

1764
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,760
that you have to agree with to work at Coinbase.

1765
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,320
You have to believe in financial freedom

1766
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,343
or you have to believe that crypto

1767
01:02:14,343 --> 01:02:15,630
is a good thing for the world.

1768
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,910
Everything else,

1769
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,410
we're just not going to engage with

1770
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,550
and we'd rather you don't bring up.

1771
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,883
Maybe that's a technicality, maybe that's

1772
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:25,557
a kind of nuance, but- No, you're 100% right.

1773
01:02:25,557 --> 01:02:27,030
As I was writing that blog post,

1774
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,080
originally, I was thinking of calling it

1775
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:28,950
an apolitical company,

1776
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:32,070
but I changed it to be mission first.

1777
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,903
Because you're absolutely right,

1778
01:02:32,903 --> 01:02:35,640
we are unapologetically pro-crypto,

1779
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,290
we're about economic freedom.

1780
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,150
You could argue okay, that does have

1781
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,590
a policy angle to it, right? Yes.

1782
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,840
In fact, we are trying to get massive change happening

1783
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,520
in DC with legislation passed.

1784
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,380
We're very unapologetic about it

1785
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:49,110
engaging in politics on our mission,

1786
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:50,970
but everything outside of that,

1787
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,380
which sometimes there's edge cases—

1788
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,400
you have to go figure out—

1789
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,020
but everything outside of that,

1790
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,160
we try not to bring it to work.

1791
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,900
It's a mission first policy

1792
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,750
as opposed to being explicitly apolitical across everything.

1793
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,910
That was an evolution

1794
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,490
and we did take a lot of arrows for doing that,

1795
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,170
but I think it was a good move.

1796
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,137
I presume now looking back on it,

1797
01:03:09,137 --> 01:03:10,710
you're very glad that you did it.

1798
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:11,573
Very glad.

1799
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:14,430
I was failing as a leader before that

1800
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:17,040
because I was not creating clarity in the organization.

1801
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,740
We were having, some people thought our mission included

1802
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:23,130
social justice activism on police brutality.

1803
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,667
I clarified it and I said,

1804
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,640
"No, we're all going this way

1805
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,280
and I'm sorry I failed to create clarity beforehand,

1806
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,440
but if you don't want to work here at that company

1807
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,690
more now that I'm making it clear, here's the exit package."

1808
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:36,300
I remember we had all these debates internally.

1809
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,940
The people were terrified that I was about to do this,

1810
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,830
had some people try to convince me not to do it.

1811
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:43,560
Some people said 50% of the company

1812
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,430
will quit and all this.

1813
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,630
It turned out to be 5%.

1814
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:49,440
Sometimes your fear gives you bad advice.

1815
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,930
I got more confidence to do it

1816
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:52,950
by basically going and talking

1817
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,080
to some of our employee groups.

1818
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,700
Hearing from them directly

1819
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,680
and also watching some videos

1820
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,530
of people like Lee Kuan Yew and Ronald Reagan

1821
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,510
in similar situations,

1822
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,640
leadership inspiration moments.

1823
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,570
I'm curious, where does Stripe land on this topic

1824
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:10,920
if you could talk about it?

1825
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,720
I think the norms have,

1826
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,890
or the expectations have very much shifted where,

1827
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:23,350
in a productive way I think, where people get that

1828
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:28,620
companies have a thing they're trying to do in the world

1829
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,060
and it's hard enough to do that thing.

1830
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,860
It's hard enough to get The GENIUS Act passed.

1831
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:36,510
It's hard enough to make some impact in the world.

1832
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:40,950
The US is a pretty big place

1833
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:45,480
and there's a broad variety of views

1834
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,130
on a whole bunch of social views.

1835
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,360
The classic,

1836
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,480
if you're going to a dinner party in the 1950s

1837
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,740
the advice would've been

1838
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:56,250
that you leave politics and religion aside

1839
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:00,960
as good work dinner party conversation topics.

1840
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,480
This rediscovering of old wisdom,

1841
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,750
that it's hard enough to do one thing.

1842
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,870
It's not that these aren't very worthwhile endeavors.

1843
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:12,360
Both of us have kind of pursuits that we're doing

1844
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,300
outside of work in various regards.

1845
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,390
It's really hard to get an entire company

1846
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:20,520
aligned around some cause.

1847
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,750
So you want to spend that capital very carefully.

1848
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,840
Yours came at an interesting moment in time

1849
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,000
where there was a lot of expectations of companies

1850
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,610
to be kind of broadly getting involved

1851
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:33,810
in a whole bunch of issues.

1852
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,460
It was so notable again

1853
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,470
because that was such a popular idea at the time.

1854
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:39,240
It's become almost

1855
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,740
received wisdom at this point.

1856
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,573
Yeah.

1857
01:05:41,573 --> 01:05:43,590
I think we never went super far

1858
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:44,940
into the broad set of issues,

1859
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,010
but I think I broadly agree with you on companies

1860
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,567
mostly sticking to the knitting.

1861
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,380
It strikes me that Coinbase, from a product point of view,

1862
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,320
when you're in the early days of an industry,

1863
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,640
you kind of have to do everything.

1864
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,350
Microsoft in the '90s

1865
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,880
they were doing operating systems

1866
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,140
and they were doing applications,

1867
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:07,973
and I mean they made some hardware.

1868
01:06:07,973 --> 01:06:08,806
Remember like the Microsoft natural keyboards

1869
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,850
and fight simulators? Clippy.

1870
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,800
Exactly Encarta, everything.

1871
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,930
If you look at OpenAI in AI,

1872
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,178
they're doing consumer, they're doing B2B,

1873
01:06:17,178 --> 01:06:19,650
they're doing Sora, the video model.

1874
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:23,280
Again, because AI is so fast-changing and rapidly emerging.

1875
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,450
Similarly in crypto,

1876
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,340
you guys have the institutional product.

1877
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:29,130
You have the stablecoin with USDC.

1878
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:30,870
You have the brokerage.

1879
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:32,970
You have your L2 with Base,

1880
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,380
you're playing everywhere.

1881
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,880
That feels correct to me

1882
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,350
in a very fast moving space.

1883
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:39,180
It also seems like it would challenge focus

1884
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,100
where everything is a good idea

1885
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,167
because it could work in this fast-moving industry.

1886
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:45,914
How do you focus, how do you resource things?

1887
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:47,340
How do you decide what to cut?

1888
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,173
It's easy with Stripe

1889
01:06:48,173 --> 01:06:49,620
because we're just trying to stick to the knitting.

1890
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:53,040
We're trying to make the payment infrastructure good.

1891
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,040
But your world is a more open-ended map.

1892
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,060
Yeah.

1893
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:57,960
Well, it all depends how you count it.

1894
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,370
You guys have a lot of products

1895
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:00,600
in the payments space.

1896
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,127
I was simplifying, for the purpose of the question.

1897
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,870
A lot of this comes down

1898
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:08,600
to the founders, right?

1899
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,830
Sometimes I can't help myself.

1900
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,500
I have so many ideas and in fact, the company

1901
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,450
usually is pushing back a little bit.

1902
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:16,283
We need more focus.

1903
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:17,940
I'm like, "Okay, you're right, we should focus."

1904
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,830
There is virtue in focus.

1905
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:22,710
There's also virtue in having multiple revenue streams.

1906
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:25,440
When one thing's up, another thing is down.

1907
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,530
There's virtue in having some small teams

1908
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:29,370
working on a variety of things.

1909
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,910
USDC and Base started off

1910
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,400
as three to five person teams

1911
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,530
and USDC will probably add

1912
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:38,850
800 million of revenue to our bottom line.

1913
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:41,250
I would've never have guessed that—

1914
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:43,290
in the past year.

1915
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,400
—Would you actually not have

1916
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,233
have guessed that?

1917
01:07:45,233 --> 01:07:46,230
Was it not obvious—

1918
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,190
It was not, no.

1919
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:51,210
So we have this system internally

1920
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,280
where twice a year employees can come

1921
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,370
pitch venture bets that they want to do internally.

1922
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:59,310
We've tried to construct it to be,

1923
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:00,570
where you don't need a unanimous yes.

1924
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:03,210
In most companies, you need your boss,

1925
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:04,800
your boss' boss, your budget all the way up to the CEO

1926
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,910
to say yes to green light something,

1927
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:07,440
which means you get one no, you're out.

1928
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,273
Yeah.

1929
01:08:08,273 --> 01:08:09,210
We try to create it a little bit more like

1930
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,680
internal venture capital.

1931
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,740
So you can go to any of the product group leads,

1932
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,920
and there's a handful of smart handpicked engineers

1933
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,990
and then myself and a few other people.

1934
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,490
If you get any one of us to say yes

1935
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:22,770
out of their budget to fund it, you're green lit.

1936
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,819
It's like pitching a bunch

1937
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:25,319
of internal venture capitalists.

1938
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:26,609
What that means is we get more

1939
01:08:26,609 --> 01:08:27,960
of this risk-taking culture.

1940
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,520
We try a lot of ideas

1941
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,500
and some of them don't work and we have to shut them down.

1942
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,319
That's hard, how do you have the guts to cut—

1943
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,850
because in a startup you'd run out of money

1944
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,439
and you can't raise the next round.

1945
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,920
So we have to have sort of mimic these rounds of investment.

1946
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,870
Once in a while they completely defy odds.

1947
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,160
I'll tell you a secret,

1948
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,550
which is I actually voted no on the USDC project

1949
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,710
because I read it and I said, "Ah,

1950
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:52,170
it's just not decentralized as much as I would want."

1951
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,399
I had some reason in my head

1952
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:55,410
and thank goodness somebody else on the team

1953
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:56,819
voted yes to fund it out of their budget

1954
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:57,810
and I was totally wrong.

1955
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:58,643
I use that as an example a lot where

1956
01:08:58,643 --> 01:08:59,475
the best ideas don't have to come from me,

1957
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,210
they have to come from everybody in the company.

1958
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,910
We have to try more ambitious ideas.

1959
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:06,760
How about Base?

1960
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,050
Base is another example that was a venture bet.

1961
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:12,750
It started as a small thing where Jesse came to me

1962
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:15,540
and said he wanted to spin up a Layer 2.

1963
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,370
I didn't have any specific idea

1964
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:18,810
about how to do it or anything.

1965
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:20,010
The only thing that we did was

1966
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:23,127
we funded it and we shielded it.

1967
01:09:23,127 --> 01:09:23,960
New ideas are fragile sometimes within big companies.

1968
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,890
I think one time you told me a great phrase,

1969
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:28,571
you don't want to give it the big company bear hug of death.

1970
01:09:28,571 --> 01:09:30,510
The only thing I did to my credit

1971
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:31,710
was I may have protected it,

1972
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:32,880
but I didn't have any idea

1973
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,130
really what Jesse was working on for most of that.

1974
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,170
He iterated through three or four ideas

1975
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:39,027
and Base was the fourth thing that he came up with

1976
01:09:39,027 --> 01:09:40,649
and it finally started to work

1977
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:43,020
and became the number one Layer 2 solution on Ethereum.

1978
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,000
Now it's the Base app that just came out.

1979
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,819
As CEO it's not so much my job

1980
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:48,689
to come up with the next great idea.

1981
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:50,609
It's to create the right environment

1982
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:53,520
where good ideas can happen and be nurtured

1983
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,070
and the bad ideas eventually do get shut down.

1984
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:57,720
We have some discipline around that.

1985
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,050
The hardest time to work on new venture bets

1986
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:06,050
is when the core is under threat or it's a downturn.

1987
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,130
The core is always under threat, right?

1988
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:10,710
And so, this is where- That's why it's the core.

1989
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,960
It's a successful business that other people want.

1990
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,280
Right.

1991
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,900
We have this great—

1992
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,720
this makes our decision making very healthy,

1993
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,210
but it's a healthy tension in the org where

1994
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:24,150
usually people are saying the core is underfunded,

1995
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:24,983
it's under threat.

1996
01:10:24,983 --> 01:10:26,010
How can we allocate more?

1997
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:27,180
I want to take resources from that thing,

1998
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,830
that's not generating revenue yet.

1999
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:31,260
Not always, but sometimes I'm on the other side

2000
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,550
saying I want to fund the core.

2001
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,740
We also should have some percent,

2002
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,770
10% of our resources going to these venture bets.

2003
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:39,270
Because five, 10 years from now

2004
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:43,950
we need to have the next chapter coming out.

2005
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:47,490
Sometimes there's founders versus operators

2006
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:50,100
and if you have too much founder energy,

2007
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,390
they sometimes blow the place up.

2008
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,223
Yeah.

2009
01:10:52,223 --> 01:10:54,030
If you have too much operator energy,

2010
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:55,320
they're just boring and they never do

2011
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,460
anything innovative ever again.

2012
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,766
But they're very efficiently run.

2013
01:10:58,766 --> 01:10:59,700
And so I think— It's like a series

2014
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,560
of layered S-curves. Yeah.

2015
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,240
I'm in a lucky spot at Coinbase

2016
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,560
with Emilie Choi as the president

2017
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,106
and she and I make a great team.

2018
01:11:06,106 --> 01:11:08,250
I think we can both do it either way,

2019
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,123
but the natural-

2020
01:11:09,123 --> 01:11:10,140
It's a natural happy place.

2021
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,090
I try to be a little more founder—

2022
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:15,750
provide the risk tolerance, the venture bets.

2023
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,940
She really makes it a well-run company,

2024
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,507
pushes back when she's like,

2025
01:11:19,507 --> 01:11:22,380
"Brian, if we just focused on the core in Europe,

2026
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,120
it might generate another billion of revenue."

2027
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,970
So, it's a great combo.

2028
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,860
Do you use prediction markets anywhere internally

2029
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,300
in how you run the business?

2030
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,500
Not yet.

2031
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,333
Shouldn't you

2032
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:33,600
if you're crypto pilled? Yeah.

2033
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,060
We are integrating, working on prediction markets.

2034
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,880
We haven't gotten full clarity,

2035
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,430
this new CFTC chair hasn't been confirmed yet.

2036
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:44,880
The US ones, US citizens are not allowed to use it yet,

2037
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,050
the on-chain ones. Yeah.

2038
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:48,570
The ones that are approved to work in the US

2039
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,403
you have to get them—

2040
01:11:49,403 --> 01:11:50,236
each market has to be approved by the CFTC.

2041
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,143
Oh wow.

2042
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,590
So if you had some fun internal pet project,

2043
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,030
we don't have the resources

2044
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,863
to go get everything.

2045
01:11:57,863 --> 01:11:59,190
But hopefully it becomes

2046
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,360
lower friction at some point.

2047
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,973
Then once they are approved,

2048
01:12:01,973 --> 01:12:03,540
would I see a prediction market

2049
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,910
on projects or something like that?

2050
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:06,333
We can use them. Yeah, that's a great idea.

2051
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:09,690
What are other ways in which Coinbase

2052
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:12,690
is crypto-pilled, AI-pilled,

2053
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:14,980
works differently from a company founded

2054
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,740
10 or 20 years prior?

2055
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,730
Like a lot of companies, we're leaning

2056
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:22,050
as hard as we can into AI.

2057
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,220
I don't know how much-

2058
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,540
What does that mean concretely?

2059
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,820
We're doing a lot of the best practices.

2060
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,070
We made a big push to get every engineer

2061
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,810
on Cursor and Copilot.

2062
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,250
Then another question was,

2063
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,230
well, are they actually going to use it?

2064
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:36,214
A lot of them onboarded when I-

2065
01:12:36,214 --> 01:12:38,340
Was it you or Toby who mandated it?

2066
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,372
I mandated it.

2067
01:12:39,372 --> 01:12:41,020
You required people to have a call with you who—

2068
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,990
That's true. I did do that.

2069
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:45,270
You required people to justify to you, the CEO,

2070
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,950
if they weren't using AI code.

2071
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,120
That's true.

2072
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:48,953
Sorry, maybe I'm not

2073
01:12:48,953 --> 01:12:49,786
meant to tell the story.

2074
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:51,000
No. I don't mind.

2075
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,833
It's a good story.

2076
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,670
Originally they were coming back and saying,

2077
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:57,090
"All right, over the next quarter...

2078
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:58,740
we're going to get to 50% adoption."

2079
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,690
I said, "You're telling me—

2080
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:01,710
why can't every engineer

2081
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,000
just onboard by the end of the week?

2082
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,010
So I went rogue.

2083
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:05,843
Yeah.

2084
01:13:05,843 --> 01:13:07,007
I posted in the all in Slack channel.

2085
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:08,850
—Just a light dusting of founder mode.

2086
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,400
I said, "AI's important.

2087
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,140
We need you to all learn it and at least onboard.

2088
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,520
You don't have to use it every day yet

2089
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,353
until we do some training,

2090
01:13:15,353 --> 01:13:16,500
but at least onboard by the end of the week.

2091
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,120
And if not, I'm hosting a meeting on Saturday

2092
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:18,990
with everybody who hasn't done it

2093
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:21,240
and I'd like to meet with you to understand why."

2094
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,620
Now a few people were on vacation.

2095
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:25,140
There was a list of—

2096
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,260
Anyway, I jumped on this call on Saturday

2097
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:30,990
and there was a couple people that had not done it.

2098
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,980
Some of them had a good reason,

2099
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:35,940
because they were just getting back

2100
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,200
from some trip or something,

2101
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,970
and some of them didn't and they got fired.

2102
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:39,803
Wow.

2103
01:13:39,803 --> 01:13:41,370
Some people really didn't like it, by the way,

2104
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,840
that heavy-handed approach

2105
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,480
but I think it did set some clarity at least that

2106
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,760
we need to lean into this and learn about it.

2107
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,010
What's your experience of AI coding been so far?

2108
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:54,270
It's clear that it is very helpful

2109
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,890
to have AI helping you write code.

2110
01:13:55,890 --> 01:14:00,840
It's not clear how you run an AI-coded code base

2111
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,670
and what the best way to do it is.

2112
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,503
I agree.

2113
01:14:03,503 --> 01:14:04,350
I think we're still figuring that out too.

2114
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:07,380
One thing we started doing is every month we host,

2115
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,905
we call it an AI Speed Run where

2116
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,060
one of the engineers volunteers that month to run

2117
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,377
a training for how they're using it.

2118
01:14:13,377 --> 01:14:14,880
We try to cherry pick the people,

2119
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,800
the teams that are doing it the best.

2120
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,120
We're doing about,

2121
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,090
33% of code written by AI now.

2122
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,980
We have a goal to get to 50% by the end of the quarter.

2123
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,090
Let's see if we get there.

2124
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:25,620
You probably can go too far with it.

2125
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:26,970
You don't want people vibe coding

2126
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:28,740
these systems moving money.

2127
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:30,900
We've really encouraged people to really,

2128
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:31,980
you have to code review it

2129
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,290
and have the appropriate checks in place on that

2130
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:35,940
from with humans in the loop.

2131
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,530
But some of the front-end pieces, et cetera,

2132
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:39,723
you can iterate faster.

2133
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,060
We want to make sure it's used not just

2134
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,280
in the engineering teams.

2135
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,820
It really should be any team,

2136
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,800
design is using it heavily.

2137
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,633
Product managers,

2138
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:49,920
I think FP&A could even be using this

2139
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,290
as generate, ingest all the data

2140
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:54,630
and tell me what you forecast the revenue to be.

2141
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,760
We're getting to a world where,

2142
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,620
even as CEO by the way, I use it a lot.

2143
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,240
We use a decision making

2144
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,630
process called RAPIDS and everyone writes their input.

2145
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:07,290
We have a row now for AI that writes its input in

2146
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:09,150
as one of the people that help make decisions.

2147
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:09,983
We're testing the limits of it,

2148
01:15:09,983 --> 01:15:10,816
when can it actually start to be the decision maker

2149
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,800
on some things and do better than humans.

2150
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,720
Last question.

2151
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,890
What advice do you have for us

2152
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,500
as we start to navigate the crypto world more

2153
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,010
and as crypto becomes so much more relevant for payments?

2154
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,810
I feel like I should be asking you

2155
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:28,643
the same question.

2156
01:15:28,643 --> 01:15:30,030
We're starting to figure out-

2157
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:30,863
Payments, yeah.

2158
01:15:30,863 --> 01:15:32,430
We're doing repayments, you guys are up in crypto.

2159
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:35,165
Hopefully we get to work more together.

2160
01:15:35,165 --> 01:15:37,620
In crypto, it's never as good as it seems,

2161
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:38,880
never as bad as it seems.

2162
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,550
You gotta be in it for the long haul through ups and downs.

2163
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:42,960
It's very cyclical. Yeah.

2164
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,380
I would say that crypto is about

2165
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,300
decentralized protocols fundamentally.

2166
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,340
Those are the ones

2167
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:51,750
that have done the best.

2168
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:55,860
There are temptations at times.

2169
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,600
I won't name some of the prior projects,

2170
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,130
but they've come together with small,

2171
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:01,110
consortiums of companies.

2172
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:03,270
We really want to make more open standards

2173
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,680
and there's a trade off

2174
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,110
because if you truly have a decentralized protocol,

2175
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:09,270
it's slower, right?

2176
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,250
Base for instance, we started it,

2177
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,800
but it's going through progressive decentralization

2178
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,270
and we went from stage one

2179
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,980
or stage zero to stage one decentralization.

2180
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,690
We're getting stage two soon.

2181
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:21,270
Everybody should really, on that network,

2182
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:24,487
be able to exist on a level playing field with Coinbase.

2183
01:16:24,487 --> 01:16:25,860
That's where we're getting to.

2184
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:29,133
I think in that ethos,

2185
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,650
it's a permissionless system everybody can build on.

2186
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:34,830
That's what's going to actually disrupt traditional finance.

2187
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:37,080
It's not going to be another proprietary system.

2188
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,600
There's a spectrum between those two things.

2189
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,940
It's not a binary.

2190
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:42,773
I don't know.

2191
01:16:42,773 --> 01:16:43,973
I guess that's how to get really red pilled on—

2192
01:16:43,973 --> 01:16:45,960
Embrace what makes crypto actually work.

2193
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,793
Yep. Yeah.

2194
01:16:46,793 --> 01:16:48,575
All right, well with that, thank you.

2195
01:16:48,575 --> 01:16:49,459
Thank you.
