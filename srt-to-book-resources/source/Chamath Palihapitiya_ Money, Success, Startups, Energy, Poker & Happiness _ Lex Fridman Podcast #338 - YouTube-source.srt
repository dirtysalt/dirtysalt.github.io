1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
in terms of your mistakes society

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,100
 tells you don't make them because

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,980
 we will judge you and we will look down on you

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,000
 and i think the really successful people realize that actually no

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,960
 it's the cycle time of mistakes that gets you to success

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,000
 because your error rate will diminish the more mistakes that you make you

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,080
 observe them you

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,240
 figure out where it's coming from is it a psychological

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,680
 thing is it a you

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,220
 know cognitive

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,939
 thing and

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,660
 then you fix it

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,840
 following is a conversation with your mouth a

14

 support it please check out our sponsors in the description and

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,120
 now dear friends here's

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,580
 chamath balajapatia

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,760
 you grew up in a dysfunctional household on welfare you've talked about this before what

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,500
 war for you personally psychologically some difficult moments in your childhood

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,280
 i'll answer that question in a slightly different way which is that

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,560
 i think when you grow up

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,759
 in a household that's defined by physical abuse and psychological abuse

31
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,479
 you're

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,280
 hyper vigilant all the time

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,900
 and so it's actually easier for me to point to moments where

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,400
 i was happy

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,119
 or i felt compassion or i felt safe

36
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,659
 otherwise every moment i'll give you a couple of examples like

37
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,200
 you know i was thinking about this a while ago

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,840
 there was a tree outside of my apartment where we lived when i was growing up

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,600
 and my father would sometimes would make me go outside to take the tree branch

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,479
 that he would hit me with

41
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,500
 um and so you can imagine if

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,020
 you're a 10 11 year old kid and you have to deal with that what

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,038
 do you do well

44
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,560
 a hyper vigilant child learns

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,000
 how to basically estimate the strength of these branches

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,300
 right how far

47
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,940
 can he go before it breaks

48
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,780
 you have to estimate his anger and estimate the effective

49
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,099
 strength of you

50
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:26,640
 know branches

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,680
 and bring back something because you know i

52
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,220
 remember these

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,599
 moments where if it was

54
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,080
 he

55
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,060
 would look at it and then he would make me go out again and

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,720
 get it right

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,700
 get a different one

58
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,020
 um or

59
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,220
 you know there was a certain belt that he wore that had this kind of

60
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,000
 um belt buckle that stuck out

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 and

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,160
 you just wanted to make sure if that if

63
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,220
 that was the thing that you were going to get hit by

64
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,239
 that it wasn't the buckle facing out because that really hurt

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,879
 and so you became hyper aware of

66
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,500
 which part of the buckle was facing out versus facing in in those moments

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,620
 and there are like hundreds of these little examples

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,220
 which

69
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,080
 essentially i would i would say the through line is that you're just so on edge

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,459
 right and you walk into this

71
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:12,720
 house and you're just basically

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,080
 trying

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,560
 to get to the point where you leave the house

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,120
 um and so in that microcosm of growing up

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,760
 any moment that's not like that is

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,440
 seared in my memory in a way that i just can't

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,860
 describe to a person i'll give you an example

78
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,860
 i

79
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,700
 volunteered

80
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,000
 when i was in grade five or six i can't remember which it was

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,260
 in the kindergarten

82
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,700
 of my school

83
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,700
 and i would just go and the teacher would you know ask

84
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,260
 you to clean things up

85
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,799
 and at the end of that great five year

86
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,000
 she took me and two other kids to dairy queen

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,220
 and i'd never been i've never i'd never gone to a restaurant literally because

88
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,260
 we just we didn't have the money

89
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,879
 and i remember the first time i tasted

90
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,620
 this you know this dairy queen meal

91
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,060
 it was like a hamburger

92
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,860
 fries a coconut

93
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,159
 a blizzard and i was like what is this and i felt

94
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,159
 so

95
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,280
 special you know because you're getting something that most

96
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,320
 people would take for granted oh it's a sunday or

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,820
 it's a you know or i'm really busy

98
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,440
 let me go take my kid to

99
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,160
 to fast

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,238
 food i

101
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,020
 think that you know until i left high school

102
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,360
 i think and this is not just specific

103
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,060
 to me but a lot of other people it's

104
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,000
 you're in this hyper vigilant loop

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,639
 punctuated with these incredibly visceral moments of compassion by other people you know a different example

106
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,699
 um we had such a strict budget

107
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,860
 and we didn't have a car

108
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,360
 and so you know i was responsible with my mom to always go shopping

109
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
 and so i learned very early on how to you

110
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,040
 know look for coupons how

111
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,860
 to buy things that were on sale or special

112
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,840
 and we had a very basic diet because you have to budget this thing really precisely

113
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,560
 but the end of every year

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:15,000
 where i lived there was a large grocery chain called loblaws and loblaws would discount

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,400
 a cheesecake from 7.99 to 4.99

116
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,199
 and my

117
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,900
 parents would buy that once a year and we probably did that six or seven times

118
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,479
 and you can't imagine how special we felt myself my two sisters we

119
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,060
 would sit there we would watch the you know the new

120
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,900
 year's eve celebration

121
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,460
 on tv we would cut

122
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,340
 this cheesecake into you know five pieces

123
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,860
 it felt like everything

124
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,000
 um so that's sort of how you know my

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,180
 my existence when i was at that age is

126
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,240
 for better or for worse that's how i remember it

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,620
 the hyper vigilance loop is that still with you today what

128
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,280
 are the echoes of that that's told you today the good and the bad if

129
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,759
 you put yourself

130
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,400
 in the mind of a young child

131
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,259
 the thing that that does to you

132
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,580
 is at a very core basic level it says you're worthless

133
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,780
 right because if

134
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,620
 you can

135
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,120
 step outside of that and you think about any child in the world

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
 they

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,419
 don't deserve to go through that

138
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,120
 and at some point by the way i should tell you like i don't blame

139
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,319
 my parents anymore it

140
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,060
 was a process to get there but

141
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,660
 i

142
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,300
 feel like they did the best they could

143
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,699
 and they suffered their own issues and enormous pressures and stresses

144
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,979
 and so you know i've

145
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,259
 really for the most part forgiven them

146
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,100
 how did you start to interrupt let go of that blame

147
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,580
 that was a really long process where

148
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,120
 i would say the first 35 years of my life

149
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,220
 i compartmentalized and i avoided all of those memories

150
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,479
 and i saw external validation

151
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,340
 right going back to this self-worth

152
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,620
 idea if you're taught as a child that you're worthless

153
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,199
 because why would somebody do these things to you

154
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,800
 it's not because you're worth something you think to yourself very

155
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,560
 viscerally you're worth nothing

156
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,599
 and so then you go out and you seek external

157
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:25,080
 validation

158
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,560
 maybe

159
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
 you try to go and get into a

160
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,759
 great college you try to get a good job you

161
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,560
 try to make a lot of money you

162
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,720
 try to you know demonstrate

163
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,979
 in superficial ways with the car you drive or the clothes you wear

164
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,160
 that you deserve people to care about you

165
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,039
 to try to make up for that really deep hole

166
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,500
 but at some point you it doesn't get filled in and so you have a choice

167
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,039
 and

168
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,860
 so for me what happened was in in the course of a six-month

169
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,599
 period i lost my best friend and

170
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,919
 i lost my father

171
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,120
 and

172
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,979
 it was really like the dam broke loose because i the compartmentalization

173
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,160
 stopped working because the reminder

174
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,759
 of why i was compartmentalizing was gone

175
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:15,599
 and so i had to go through this period of disharmony to really understand

176
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,500
 and steel man his perspective

177
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,780
 and can you imagine trying

178
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,020
 to do that to go through all of the things where

179
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,680
 you

180
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,740
 have to now look at it from his perspective and

181
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,780
 find compassion and empathy

182
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,419
 for what he went through

183
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,500
 and then i shift you know the focus to my mom and i said well

184
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,880
 you were not

185
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,360
 the victim actually you were somewhat complicit as well because you

186
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,080
 were of sound mind and body and you were in the room when it happened

187
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,540
 so then i had to go through that process with her and steal man her perspective

188
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,080
 and

189
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,200
 at the end of it i never justified what they did but

190
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
 i've been able to forgive what they did

191
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,779
 um i think they did the best they could and

192
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,820
 at the end of the day they

193
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,500
 did the most important thing which is they gave me and my sisters a shot by

194
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,880
 emigrating by

195
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,680
 giving up everything by

196
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,420
 staying in canada and

197
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,959
 doing whatever it took between the two of them

198
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,339
 to sort of claw and scrape together enough money to live so that my

199
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,080
 sisters and i could have a shot and

200
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,680
 i'm very thankful for them could they have done better obviously

201
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,480
 but i'm okay with what

202
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,820
 has taken place but it's it's been a long process

203
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,660
 of of

204
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,680
 that steel manning

205
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,300
 so that you can develop some empathy

206
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,899
 and compassion

207
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:34,620
 and

208
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,700
 forgive

209
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,380
 do you think if you talk to your dad

210
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,320
 shortly

211
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,880
 after he died and you went to that process or today you'll be able to have

212
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,459
 the same strength

213
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,360
 to forgive him

214
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,800
 i think it would be a very complicated journey

215
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,860
 i think i've learned to be incredibly open about what has happened

216
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,540
 and all of the mistakes i've made

217
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:14,339
 i think it's it would require him to be pretty radically honest about confirming

218
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,680
 what i think he went through

219
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,019
 because otherwise it just wouldn't work otherwise

220
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,220
 i would say let's keep things where they are which is i did the work

221
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,080
 you know with with people that have helped me obviously but you know it's

222
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,380
 better for him to just you know kind of hopefully he's looking from

223
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,420
 some place and he's thinking

224
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,080
 it

225
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,260
 was worth it i think he deserves to think that all of this because

226
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,220
 you know i

227
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,660
 think the immigrant

228
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,120
 challenge we're not even the immigrant challenge the

229
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,320
 lower middle class challenge anybody who really wants better for their kids and

230
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,500
 doesn't have a good toolkit to give it to them

231
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,120
 some of them

232
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
 just they choke up on the bat they just get so

233
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,440
 agitated

234
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,920
 about this idea that all this sacrifice will not be worth it

235
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,459
 that it spills out in really unproductive ways

236
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,860
 and i would put him in that category

237
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,820
 and

238
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,100
 their self

239
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,100
 evaluation

240
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,000
 introspection

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,820
 they have tunnel vision so they're not

242
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,540
 able

243
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,740
 to often see the damage they did i mean i've i know like

244
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,760
 yourself

245
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,440
 a few successful people that had very difficult relationships

246
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,060
 with their dad and you take the perspective of the dad

247
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,279
 they're completely in denial about any of it so if you actually have a conversation there

248
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,980
 would not be a deep honesty there

249
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,240
 and that i think that's maybe in part the way of life

250
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,760
 yeah and you know i remember pretty

251
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,760
 distinctly after i left and in this you know in my middle 30s where

252
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,860
 you know by all measure i had roughly become reasonably successful

253
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,360
 and my dad didn't particularly care about that which was so odd

254
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,120
 because i had to confront the fact that you know

255
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,019
 whether it was a title or money or press clippings he

256
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,459
 never really cared he

257
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,300
 moved on to a different set of goals which was more about my

258
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,040
 character and you know being a good person to my family and really preparing

259
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,240
 me to lead our family when he wasn't there

260
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,980
 and that bothered me

261
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,459
 because

262
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,560
 i thought i thought i got to the finish line and

263
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,360
 i thought there was going to be a

264
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,959
 metal

265
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,440
 you

266
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,300
 know meaning like i can tell you lex you

267
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,640
 know he never told me that he loved me

268
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,980
 i'm not sure if that's normal or not it

269
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,420
 was my normality and i thought there's going to be something some gold star which

270
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,640
 never appeared

271
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,040
 and so that's like a hard thing to

272
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,380
 kind of confront because you're like well now what is this what is this all about

273
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,200
 um was this all just kind of a a ruse

274
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,160
 but then i realized well hold on a second there were these moments

275
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,899
 where in his way again putting yourself in his shoes

276
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,100
 i think he was trying to say he was sorry he would hold my hand

277
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,420
 you know and he would interlock

278
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,660
 the fingers which i felt is that's a really intimate way of holding somebody's

279
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,339
 hand i think

280
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,680
 um so i remember those things so

281
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,040
 you

282
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,180
 know these are the things that are just etched in at least in my mind and

283
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,240
 at the end of it you know i think

284
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,839
 i've

285
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,459
 done a decent job in repairing

286
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,260
 my relationship with him even

287
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,160
 though you

288
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,480
 know it was posthumous

289
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,079
 it does make me wonder in which way you

290
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,800
 and i or we might be broken and not see it it

291
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,420
 might be hurting others and not see it well i think that when you grow

292
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,980
 up in those kinds of environments and they're all different kinds of this kind of dysfunction

293
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,480
 but if

294
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,200
 what you get from that is that you're not worthwhile you're

295
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,519
 not you're less than many many other people

296
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,940
 when you enter adulthood or you know semi-adulthood

297
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,399
 in your early 20s

298
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,399
 you

299
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,519
 will be in a cycle where you are hurting other people

300
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,500
 you may not know it

301
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,220
 hopefully

302
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,680
 you find somebody who holds you accountable and tells you and loves you enough through that

303
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,639
 but

304
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,040
 you are going to take all of that disharmony

305
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,560
 in your childhood and you're going to inject that disharmony

306
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,639
 into

307
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,639
 whether it's your professional relationships or your personal relationships or both until

308
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,000
 you get to some form of rock bottom and you start to repair

309
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,440
 and i think there's a lot of people that resonate with that because they

310
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,440
 have each suffered their own things that

311
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,399
 at some point in their lives have told them that they're less than

312
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,420
 and

313
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,139
 um and then they go and cope and when you cope

314
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:40,980
 eventually

315
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,079
 those coping mechanisms escalate

316
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:43,860
 and

317
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,279
 at some point it'll be unhealthy either for you but

318
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,680
 oftentimes it's for the people around you

319
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,740
 well from those humble beginnings you are now a billionaire

320
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:03,480
 how has money changed your life or maybe the landscape of experience in your life

321
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,820
 does it buy happiness it

322
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,040
 doesn't buy happiness but

323
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,680
 it buys you a level of comfort for

324
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,399
 you to really amplify what happiness is

325
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,220
 i kind of think about it in the following way let's

326
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,519
 just say that there's a a hundred things on a table

327
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,420
 and the table says find happiness here

328
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,560
 and there are different prices

329
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,360
 the way that the world works

330
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,639
 is that many of these experiences are cordoned off a little bit behind the velvet rope

331
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,800
 where

332
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,839
 you think that there's more happiness as the prices of things escalate right

333
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,500
 if you live in an apartment you admire the person with the house

334
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,279
 if you live in a house you admire the person with the bigger house

335
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,760
 that person admires the person with you know

336
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,519
 um an island right

337
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,240
 um

338
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,339
 some person drives their car admires

339
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,959
 the person who flies who admires

340
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,940
 a person who flies business class who admires

341
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,440
 a person who flies first

342
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,660
 you know to private there's all of these escalations on this table

343
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,079
 and most people get to the first five or six

344
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:19,199
 and so they just naturally assume that items you know seven through a hundred is

345
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,360
 really where happiness is found

346
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,019
 and

347
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,300
 the just to you know tell

348
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,920
 you the the finish line i've

349
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,980
 tried a hundred and back and then i've tried to 400

350
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,660
 to it

351
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,240
 and happiness isn't there

352
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,100
 um but it does give you a level of comfort i read a study

353
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,220
 and i don't know if it's true or not but it said that

354
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:47,699
 um the absolute sort of like maximal link between money and happiness

355
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:51,300
 is around 50 million dollars

356
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,019
 and

357
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,880
 there was a it was just like a social studies

358
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,779
 kind of thing that

359
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,940
 i think one of the ivy leagues put out and

360
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,560
 underneath it the way that they explained

361
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,320
 it was because you could have a home you could have all

362
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,280
 kinds of the creature comforts you could take care of your family

363
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,799
 um and then you were left to ponder

364
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,900
 what it is that you really want

365
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,439
 i think the challenge for most people is to realize that

366
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,380
 this escalating arms race of you know more things will solve your problems

367
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,619
 is not true

368
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:30,540
 more and better is not the solution it's it's this idea that you

369
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,120
 are on a very precise journey that's unique to yourself you are playing a game

370
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,760
 of which only you are the player

371
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,820
 everybody else is an interloper

372
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,840
 and you have a responsibility to design the gameplay

373
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,380
 and

374
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,940
 i think a lot of people don't realize

375
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,539
 that because

376
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,220
 if they did i think they would make a

377
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,820
 lot of different

378
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,539
 decisions

379
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,580
 about how they live their life

380
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,960
 and i still do the same thing i mean revert

381
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,020
 to basically running around asking other people what

382
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,760
 will make you like me more

383
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,419
 you

384
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,919
 know what will make me

385
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,799
 more popular in your eyes and i try to do it and

386
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,799
 it never works

387
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,539
 um it is just a complete dead end is there negative aspects to money like

388
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,760
 for example it

389
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,640
 becoming harder to find people you can trust

390
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,240
 i think the most negative aspect is that it amplifies

391
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,080
 a 360 degree view of your personality

392
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,700
 because there are a lot of people and society tells you that

393
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,260
 more money is

394
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,080
 actually better you are a better person somehow

395
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,760
 and you're factually more worthwhile than some other people that have less money

396
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,799
 that's also a lie but

397
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,679
 when you're given that kind of attention it's

398
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,760
 very easy for you to become a caricature of yourself

399
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,000
 um that's probably the single worst thing that happens to you but

400
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,940
 i say it in the opposite way i think all i've ever seen in

401
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,360
 silicon

402
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
 valley as an example

403
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,539
 um is

404
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,679
 that when

405
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,900
 somebody gets a hold of a lot of money it

406
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,140
 tends to cause them to become exactly who they were meant to be

407
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,280
 they're either a kind person they're either a curious person they're

408
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,280
 either a jerk you know they're either cheap and

409
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,080
 they can use all kinds of masks

410
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
 but now that there's no expectations

411
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,539
 and society

412
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,820
 gives you a get out of jail free card you

413
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,620
 start to behave the way that's most comfortable to you so you see somebody's innate personality

414
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,340
 and

415
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,780
 that's a really interesting thing to observe because then you can very quickly bucket sort where

416
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,760
 do you want to spend time and who is really you know additive to your gameplay

417
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,419
 and who is really a negative detractor to your gameplay you're

418
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,799
 an investor but you're also kind of a philosopher

419
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,900
 um you analyze the world in

420
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,220
 all these different

421
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,960
 perspectives on all in podcasts on twitter everywhere

422
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,679
 do you worry that money makes puts you out of touch from

423
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,280
 being able to truly empathize with the experience of the general population

424
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
 which

425
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,940
 in

426
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,660
 part first

427
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,679
 of all on a human level that could be limiting but also as an analyst of

428
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,559
 human civilization that could be limiting

429
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,419
 i think it definitely can for

430
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,500
 a lot of people because

431
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,120
 it's just a it's an abstraction

432
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,200
 for you to stop caring

433
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,580
 right

434
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,520
 um i also think the other thing is that you can very quickly

435
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,860
 um especially in today's world become

436
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,700
 the scapegoat

437
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,200
 just to use a girardian

438
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,720
 like rene gerard if you look if you think about like memetic

439
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,280
 theory in a nutshell

440
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,640
 you know we're all competing

441
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,720
 for these very scarce resources that we are told is worthwhile and

442
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,860
 if you view the world through that gerardian lens

443
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,179
 what are we really doing we are all fighting for scarce resources whether

444
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,720
 that's twitter followers money

445
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:00,299
 acclaim notoriety and we all compete with each other and in that competition

446
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,500
 you know gerard writes like the only way you escape that loop is

447
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,799
 by scapegoating something or somebody

448
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,320
 and i think we are in that loop right now where

449
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,179
 just the fact of being successful

450
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:12,960
 is

451
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,760
 a thing that one should scapegoat

452
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,539
 to

453
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,880
 end all of this you know tension

454
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,440
 that we have in the world

455
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,039
 i

456
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,539
 i think that it's a little misguided

457
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,580
 because i don't think it solves the fundamental

458
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,200
 problem

459
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,860
 um and we can talk about the solution to some of these problems are but

460
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,280
 um that's i think the loop that we're all living and

461
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,440
 so if you become a character caricature

462
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,360
 and you feed yourself into it

463
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,260
 i mean you're not doing anything to to really advance things

464
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,440
 your nickname is the dictator how did you get the nickname since

465
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,380
 we're talking about the corrupting nature of money that

466
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,880
 came from poker in

467
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,760
 a poker game you know when you sit down it's chaos especially

468
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,400
 like in in our home game there's

469
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,260
 a ton of big egos there's people always watching you know rail birding the game all

470
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,240
 kinds of interesting folks

471
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,059
 and in that somebody needs to establish hygiene and rules and

472
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,580
 i really care about the integrity of the game and

473
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,940
 it would just require somebody to just say okay enough

474
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,240
 and so and then people were just like okay stop dictating and

475
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,280
 that's where that's where that nickname so

476
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,580
 who to you speaking of which is the greatest poker of

477
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,580
 player of all time and why is it phil hellmuth

478
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,240
 exactly

479
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,299
 you know mute probably knew this question was coming yeah

480
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,700
 here's what i'll say i think helmuth is

481
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,600
 the

482
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,100
 antidote to computers more than any other player playing today

483
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,200
 and when you see him

484
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,100
 in a heads up situation so i think like he's played nine

485
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,960
 or ten heads up tournaments

486
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,220
 in a row

487
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,179
 and he's played like basically call it 10 of the top 20 people so far

488
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,679
 and he's beaten all but one of them

489
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,539
 when you're playing heads up you know 1v1 that is the most

490
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,740
 um gto

491
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,740
 understandable

492
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,799
 spot meaning game theory optimal position that's

493
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,919
 where computers can give you an enormous edge the

494
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,320
 minute you add even a third player the

495
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,340
 value of computers and the value of their recommendations

496
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,280
 basically falls off a cliff okay so

497
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,299
 one way to think about it is helm youth is forced to play against people that

498
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,640
 are essentially trained like ais

499
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,860
 and so to be able to beat you

500
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,820
 know eight out of nine of them means that you are playing so orthogonally

501
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,720
 to

502
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,299
 what is considered game theory optimal and your overlaying human reasoning

503
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:36,720
 the

504
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,919
 judgment to say well in

505
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,559
 this spot i should do x but i'm going to do y it's

506
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,280
 not dissimilar

507
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,580
 in chess like what makes you know magnus carlson so good you

508
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,179
 know sometimes he takes these weird lines he'll sacrifice positions

509
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,559
 you know he'll overplay certain positions for certain you know bishops

510
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,880
 versus knights and all these spots that are very confusing

511
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
 and

512
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,780
 what it does is it throws

513
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,679
 people off their game i

514
00:23:58,679 --> 00:23:59,580
 think he just won a recent

515
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,179
 online tournament

516
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:01,440
 and it's like by move

517
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,700
 six

518
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,520
 there is no gto

519
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,299
 move

520
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:09,480
 for his opponent to make because it's like out of the rule book maybe

521
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,799
 he read some game you

522
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,440
 know i read the quote it was like he probably read some game in

523
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,299
 some bar in russia in 1954

524
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,260
 memorized

525
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,980
 it and

526
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,960
 all of a sudden by six moves in the

527
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
 computer ai is worthless so

528
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,400
 that's what makes helmuth great

529
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,940
 the there is one person that i think is superior

530
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,860
 um and i think it's what daniel also

531
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,020
 said and i would echo that because i played phil as

532
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,900
 well but phil ivey is

533
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,400
 um the most well-rounded

534
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:45,840
 cold-blooded bloodthirsty animal

535
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,980
 he is he's

536
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,700
 just and

537
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,659
 he he sees

538
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,000
 into your solex in a way where you're just like oh

539
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,140
 my god stop

540
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,580
 looking at me

541
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,480
 have you ever played him yeah yeah we played we've played and you know he crushes

542
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,860
 the games crushes

543
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,260
 the games so what what is feeling crushed

544
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,860
 mean

545
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,980
 and feel like in poker is it like that

546
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,159
 you just can't read at all you being constantly pressured

547
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:08,700
 you

548
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,260
 feel off balance you

549
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,760
 try to bluff and the

550
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,700
 person reads you perfectly that kind of stuff it's

551
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,500
 it's a this is a really really excellent

552
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,299
 question because i think this has parallels

553
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,280
 to a bunch of other things

554
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,620
 okay let's just use poker as a microcosm

555
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,360
 to explain a bunch of other systems

556
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,799
 or games

557
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,120
 maybe it's

558
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,159
 um running a company

559
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:29,820
 or

560
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,559
 investing okay so let's use those three examples but we use poker to explain it what

561
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,900
 does success look like well success looks like you have positive expected value

562
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,200
 right in poker the simple way to summarize that is

563
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,760
 your opponent

564
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,679
 let's just say you and i are playing

565
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,140
 are going to make a bunch of mistakes there's

566
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,720
 a bunch of it that's going to be absolutely perfect

567
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,779
 and then there's a few spots where you make mistakes

568
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:59,400
 and then there's a bunch of places in the poker game where i play perfectly

569
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,539
 and i make a few mistakes

570
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:08,700
 basically your mistakes minus my mistakes is the edge right

571
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,580
 that's that's pure that's how poker works if

572
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,600
 i make fewer

573
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,140
 mistakes

574
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,500
 than

575
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,279
 you make i

576
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,720
 will make money and i will win that

577
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,380
 is the objective

578
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,460
 of the game

579
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,679
 translate that into business

580
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,539
 you're running a company

581
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,080
 you

582
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,400
 have a team of employees you have a pool of human capital that's capable of being

583
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,700
 productive in the world and creating something

584
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,400
 but you are going to make mistakes

585
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,200
 in making that

586
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,460
 maybe it doesn't completely fit the market maybe it's mispriced maybe

587
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,440
 it actually doesn't require all of the people that you need so the margins are wrong

588
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,460
 and then there's the competitive set of all the other alternatives that

589
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,440
 customer has

590
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,740
 their mistakes minus your mistakes is the expected value of google facebook apple

591
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,220
 etc okay now take investing

592
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:05,340
 every time you buy something somebody else on the other side is selling it to you

593
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:12,000
 is that their mistake we don't know yet but their mistakes minus your mistakes

594
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,140
 is how you make a lot of money over long periods of time as an investor

595
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,880
 somebody sold you google at forty dollars a share you bought it and you kept it

596
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,200
 huge mistake on their part minimal mistakes on your part

597
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,840
 the difference of that is the money that you made

598
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,460
 so life can be summarized in many ways in that way so the question is

599
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,240
 what can you do about other people's mistakes and the answer is nothing

600
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,580
 that is somebody else's game you can try to influence them you could try to subvert

601
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,320
 them maybe you plant a spy inside of that other person's company to sabotage

602
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,980
 them i guess there are things at the edges that you can do

603
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,679
 but my firm belief is that life success really boils down to how do you control

604
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,779
 your mistakes

605
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,880
 now this is a bit counterintuitive

606
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,779
 the way you control your mistakes is by making a lot of mistakes

607
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,880
 so taking risks you

608
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,100
 have to is somehow you

609
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,299
 have to you to

610
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,779
 minimize the number of mistakes let's just say you want to find love yeah

611
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:17,159
 you know you want to find something go on deeply connected with yeah

612
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,679
 are you do you do that by not going out on dates and yes

613
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,539
 sorry sorry the

614
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,220
 only person that thinks that's yesterday no

615
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,820
 i'm joking

616
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,620
 i'm joking no but you know what i mean like

617
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,580
 you have to date people you have to open yourself up you have to be authentic

618
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,900
 and like you

619
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,779
 put you you give yourself a chance to get hurt yes

620
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:37,080
 but

621
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,100
 you're a good person so

622
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,659
 you know what happens when you get hurt that

623
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,400
 is actually their mistake

624
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,840
 okay and if you are inauthentic that's your mistake

625
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,380
 that's

626
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,440
 a controllable thing in you you can tell them the truth who

627
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,460
 you are and

628
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,179
 say here's

629
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,320
 my pluses

630
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,220
 and minuses my point is there are very few things in life

631
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,960
 that you can't break down i think into that very simple idea

632
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,919
 and

633
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,620
 in terms of your mistakes society

634
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,900
 tells you don't make them because

635
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,840
 we will judge you and we will look down on you

636
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,860
 and i think the really successful people realize that actually no

637
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,820
 it's the cycle time of mistakes that gets you to success

638
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,860
 because your error rate will diminish the more mistakes that you make you

639
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,940
 observe them you

640
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,100
 figure out where it's coming from is it a psychological

641
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,539
 thing is it a you

642
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,080
 know cognitive

643
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,799
 thing and

644
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,480
 then you fix it so

645
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,799
 the implied thing there is that there's a

646
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,720
 in in business and investing in poker and dating in life is

647
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,760
 that there's this platonic gto

648
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,679
 game theory optimal thing out there and so when you say mistakes you're

649
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,700
 always comparing to that optimal path you could have taken i think

650
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,559
 slightly different i would say mistake

651
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,059
 is maybe a bad proxy but it's the best proxy i have for learning

652
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,779
 but i'm using the language of what society tells you sure

653
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,159
 got it society

654
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,539
 tells you that when you try something and it doesn't work it's a mistake

655
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:07,380
 so

656
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,720
 i just use that word because it's the word that resonates

657
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,340
 most with most people got

658
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,880
 it

659
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,419
 the

660
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,919
 real thing that it is is learning

661
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:14,399
 yeah

662
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,779
 it's like in neural networks it's lost the neural network is lost exactly

663
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,419
 yeah all right so you're using the mistake that is most

664
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,279
 the the word that is the most understandable

665
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,240
 especially

666
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,140
 by the way people experience it i guess most of life is

667
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,000
 a sequence of mistakes the

668
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,120
 problem is when you use the word mistake and you think about mistakes

669
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,960
 it

670
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,419
 actually has the

671
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:41,700
 counterproductive effect of you becoming conservative in just being risk-averse

672
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,299
 so

673
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:42,960
 that if

674
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,440
 you folk if you re if you flip it and say try to maximize

675
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,600
 the number of successes

676
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 somehow

677
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,260
 that leads you to take more risk

678
00:30:52,260 --> 00:31:01,260
 um mistake scares people i think mistakes scare people because society likes

679
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,000
 these very simplified boundaries of who is winning and who is losing

680
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,760
 and they want to reward

681
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,299
 people who make traditional choices

682
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:18,740
 and succeed but the thing is what's so

683
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,360
 corrosive about that

684
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,440
 is that they're actually not even being put in a position to

685
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,159
 actually make a quote-unquote mistake and fail so i'll give you if

686
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,399
 you look at like getting into an elite school

687
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,000
 right society rewards you for being in the ivy leagues

688
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,240
 in a way that you know in my opinion incorrectly doesn't

689
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,240
 reward you for being in a non-ivy league school

690
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,760
 there's a certain level of status and

691
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,320
 presumption of intellect and capability that comes with being there

692
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,720
 um but that system doesn't

693
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,220
 really have a counterfactual because it's not as if you both go to mit and

694
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,960
 ohio state

695
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,179
 and then we can see two versions of lex friedman

696
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,679
 so that we can figure out that the jig is up and there was no difference

697
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,679
 right

698
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,600
 and so instead it reinforces

699
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,200
 this idea that there is no truth-seeking

700
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,799
 function there is no way to actually make this thing whole

701
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,520
 and

702
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,020
 so it tells you you

703
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,340
 have to get in here and

704
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,840
 if you don't your life is over you've

705
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,460
 made a huge mistake you

706
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,980
 know or you've failed completely

707
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,380
 and so you have to find different unique ways of dismantling this this is why you

708
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,480
 know part of what i realized

709
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,760
 where i got very lucky is

710
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,000
 i had no friends in high school i had a few cohort of acquaintances

711
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,120
 but part of being so hyper vigilant when i grew up was

712
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,860
 i was so ashamed

713
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,220
 of that world that i had to live in i

714
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,320
 didn't want to bring anyone into it i

715
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,220
 could not see myself that anybody would accept me

716
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,080
 but the thing with that is that i had no definition of

717
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,480
 what expectations should be so

718
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,000
 they were not guided by the people around me

719
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,059
 and so i would escape to define my expectations it's interesting but you didn't feel

720
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:14,519
 um like your dad didn't put you in a prison of expectation

721
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:14,940
 or

722
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,380
 we because like that's if

723
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,399
 you know a friend like

724
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,100
 that so the flip side of that you don't have any other signals

725
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,760
 it's

726
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,580
 very easy to believe like when you're in a cult that

727
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,299
 well

728
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:25,500
 he you know

729
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,840
 he was angry he

730
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,279
 pushed me

731
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,080
 he used me as a mechanism to alleviate his own frustration and

732
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,640
 this may sound very crazy but he also believed in me

733
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,720
 and so that's what created this weird duality where you were just i was always confused

734
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,740
 that you

735
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,360
 could be somebody great he

736
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,559
 believed that you could be he did him

737
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:55,860
 because i couldn't reconcile then the other half of the day you know those behaviors

738
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,460
 but what it allowed me to do was i escaped

739
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,799
 in my mind and i found these archetypes around me

740
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,620
 that were saviors to me

741
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,099
 so you know i grew up in ottawa ontario canada i

742
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,179
 grew up right

743
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,020
 at the point where the telecom boom was happening companies like nortel

744
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,599
 and newbridge networks and mitel bell

745
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,280
 northern research these

746
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,119
 were all built in in the suburbs of ottawa

747
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,639
 and so there were these larger than life figures entrepreneurs terry matthews michael copeland

748
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,879
 and so i thought i'm going to be like them i

749
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,280
 would read forbes magazine i would read fortune

750
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,639
 magazine

751
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,659
 i would look at the rich people

752
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:36,899
 on

753
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,940
 that list and say i would be like them

754
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,619
 not knowing

755
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,339
 that maybe that's not who you wanted it to be

756
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:49,139
 but it was a lifeline and it kept my mind relatively whole

757
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,699
 because i could direct my ambition in a direction

758
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:57,540
 and so why that's so important just circling back to this is i

759
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,080
 didn't have a group of friends who were like i'm going to go to community college

760
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,619
 you

761
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,420
 know i didn't have a group of friends that said well you

762
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,859
 know the goal is just to go

763
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:05,640
 to university get

764
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,320
 a simple job and like you know join

765
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,880
 the public service have

766
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,020
 a good life

767
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,300
 and so because i had no expectations

768
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,540
 and i was so afraid to venture out of my own house i

769
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,240
 never saw what middle class life was like and

770
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,140
 so i never aspired

771
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,079
 to it now if i was close to it i probably would have aspired

772
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,400
 to it because i

773
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,560
 my parents in their best year made 32 000 canadian together

774
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,099
 and

775
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,160
 if you're trying to raise a family of five people on thirty two thousand dollars it's

776
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,880
 a complicated

777
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,660
 job

778
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,200
 and

779
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,480
 most of the time they were probably making 20 something thousand

780
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,339
 and i was working since i was 14.

781
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,540
 so i

782
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,380
 knew that our station in life was not the destination we

783
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,119
 had to get out

784
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:45,540
 um

785
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:45,900
 but

786
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,720
 because i didn't have an obvious place it's not like i had a best friend whose

787
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,980
 house i was going to and

788
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,460
 i

789
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,540
 saw some normal functional

790
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,280
 home

791
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,720
 if i had had that in this weird way i would have aspired to that

792
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,560
 what

793
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,720
 was the worst job you had to do the

794
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,280
 best job

795
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,020
 but the worst job was

796
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,060
 i worked at burger king when

797
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,780
 i was 14 years old and i would do the closing shift and

798
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,400
 that was from like 6 p.m till about two in the morning and

799
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,980
 in ontario where i lived

800
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,700
 ottawa borders quebec in ontario the drinking age is 19 you

801
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,020
 can see where i'm going with this

802
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,839
 the drinking age in quebec is 18 and

803
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,200
 that year made all the difference to all these kids and

804
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,680
 so they would go get completely drunk they would come back they

805
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,420
 would come to the burger king you

806
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,599
 know you

807
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:33,720
 would

808
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:33,839
 see

809
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:33,960
 all

810
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,140
 these

811
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,260
 kids

812
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,380
 you

813
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,500
 went

814
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:34,619
 to

815
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:34,740
 high

816
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:34,859
 school

817
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:34,980
 with

818
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,160
 can

819
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,280
 you

820
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,400
 imagine

821
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:35,700
 how

822
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,300
 mortifying

823
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,060
 it is you know you're working there in this get up

824
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:47,460
 and they would light that place on fire vomit everywhere puking pooing peeing

825
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,060
 and

826
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,579
 when the thing shuts down at one o'clock you know

827
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:51,119
 you

828
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,920
 got to clean that all up

829
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,780
 all of it changing

830
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,980
 the garbage taking it out it was

831
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,880
 um a grind

832
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,260
 and it really teaches you okay i do not want this job

833
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
 i

834
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,440
 don't want to but it's funny that that didn't push you towards the stability

835
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,020
 and the security of the middle class

836
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,619
 like

837
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:14,160
 i

838
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,900
 didn't have any good examples of that

839
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,140
 i didn't have those around me i was so ashamed

840
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,160
 i could have never built a relationship where i could have seen those interactions

841
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,240
 to want that

842
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,780
 and

843
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,680
 so my desires

844
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,220
 were framed

845
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:26,700
 by these

846
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,240
 two random

847
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,020
 rich people that

848
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,940
 lived in my town who i'd never met

849
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,180
 and what i read in magazines about people like bill gates and warren buffett

850
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,839
 you were an early senior executive at facebook

851
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,640
 during a period of a lot of scaling

852
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,900
 in the company history i

853
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,500
 mean it's

854
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,440
 actually a fascinating period of human history in terms of technology

855
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,000
 well

856
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,140
 in terms of human civilization honestly

857
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,540
 what did you learn from that

858
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,380
 time

859
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,400
 about what it takes to build and scale a successful tech company a

860
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,420
 company that

861
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,400
 has

862
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
 almost

863
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,960
 immeasurable impact on the world

864
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,680
 that was an incredible moment in time because everything was so new

865
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,820
 to your point like even how the standards of web 2.0 at that time were

866
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,460
 being defined we were defining them you know i

867
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,020
 mean i think if you if you look in sort

868
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,500
 of the if

869
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,960
 you search in the patents

870
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,619
 um

871
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:23,280
 patent

872
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,060
 library there's a bunch of these patents that like me and zuck have for like random

873
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,099
 things like cookies you

874
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,599
 know or like cross-site javascript like all these crazy things that are just like these duh

875
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,540
 kind of ideas in 2023

876
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,260
 we

877
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,180
 had to invent our way around how

878
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,339
 do websites communicate with each other you

879
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:41,880
 know how

880
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,640
 do we build in the cloud versus in a data center how do we actually have

881
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,300
 high performance

882
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,720
 systems

883
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,440
 you

884
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,240
 mentioned data science the

885
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,980
 term and yeah we

886
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,180
 invented this i invented

887
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,140
 this thing called data

888
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,619
 scientist because we had a phd from google that refused to join unless

889
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:56,160
 because

890
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,760
 he got a job offer that says data analyst yeah

891
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,900
 um and so we said column

892
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,260
 of scientist

893
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,920
 because he was a phd

894
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,339
 in particle

895
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:02,579
 physics

896
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:02,940
 so he

897
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,180
 really

898
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:03,480
 you

899
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:03,839
 know he

900
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:04,440
 was a scientist

901
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,400
 and i said great you're a

902
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,640
 scientist

903
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:05,880
 here

904
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,119
 and

905
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:06,420
 that

906
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:06,780
 launched

907
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,440
 a discipline

908
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,160
 that

909
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,020
 launched it just made a term you

910
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,680
 know what's

911
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,220
 a

912
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,619
 rose by any other name but yeah like you

913
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:14,160
 know sometimes

914
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,579
 words

915
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,859
 like this can launch entire

916
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:17,760
 fields

917
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,540
 and

918
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,520
 it did in that case and you didn't i

919
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,619
 mean i guess at that time you didn't anticipate

920
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:23,460
 the

921
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,680
 impact of machine learning on the entirety

922
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,800
 of this whole process because you need machine learning to

923
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,859
 have both ads and recommender

924
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:31,859
 systems

925
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,380
 to have the feed for the social network exactly

926
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:39,420
 right the first real scaled version of machine learning not ai but machine learning was

927
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,640
 this thing that facebook introduced called pymk

928
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,859
 which is people you may know and

929
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:48,780
 the simple idea was that can we initiate a viral mechanic inside the application

930
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:54,720
 where you log in we grab your credentials we go to your email inbox

931
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,240
 we harvest your address book

932
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,040
 we do a compare we

933
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,820
 make some guesses

934
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,240
 and

935
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,400
 we start to present other people that you may actually know

936
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,680
 that may not be in your address book really

937
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,980
 simple you know a couple joins of some tables whatever

938
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,400
 and

939
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,280
 it started to just go crazy and the number of people that

940
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,760
 you

941
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,140
 were you were creating this density

942
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,460
 and entropy

943
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,220
 inside this social graph with what was some really simple basic math

944
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,680
 and that was eye-opening for us and

945
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,740
 what it what it led us down this path of is really understanding

946
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,140
 the power of like all this machine learning and

947
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,780
 so that infused itself into news feed you

948
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,800
 know and how the

949
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,480
 content that you saw could be tailored

950
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,480
 to who you were and the type of person that you were so

951
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,579
 there was a moment in time that

952
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:41,099
 all of this stuff was so new

953
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,200
 um how did you translate the app to multiple

954
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
 languages how do you launch the company in all of these countries

955
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,599
 how much of it is

956
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,700
 just kind of stumbling into things using your best like first principles gut thinking

957
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,359
 and how much is it like 5 10 15 20 year vision like

958
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,480
 how much was thinking about the future

959
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,880
 of the internet and

960
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,320
 the metaverse and

961
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,160
 the humanity and all that kind of stuff like because the news feed sounds

962
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,300
 trivial i'll say something but that's like changes everything well

963
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,280
 you have to remember like you know news feed

964
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,740
 was named and we had this thing where we would just name things what they were

965
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,960
 and at the time all

966
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,980
 of these other companies

967
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,579
 and if you go back into the wayback machine you can see this people

968
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:32,339
 would vent would invent you know an

969
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:36,720
 i you know an mp3 player and they would come up with some crazy name or

970
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,140
 they would invent a software product and come up with a crazy name right

971
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,380
 and it sounded like the pharma industry you

972
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,240
 know

973
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
 blockazimab

974
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,020
 you

975
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,579
 know tag your best friends yeah

976
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:50,880
 and you think what is this this makes no sense and

977
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,020
 you know this was zuck's

978
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,920
 thing he was like well

979
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,980
 this is a feat of news so we're going to call it news feed

980
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,400
 this is where you tag your photos so we're going to call that photo tagging

981
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,119
 i

982
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,480
 mean literally you know pretty obvious stuff

983
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,640
 um so

984
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,760
 the thing the way that those things came about though was very experimentally

985
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,460
 and this is where i think it's really important for people

986
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,720
 to understand i think bezos explains this the best

987
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,200
 there is a tendency after things work

988
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,119
 to create a narrative fallacy because it feeds your ego and

989
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,320
 you want to have been the person that saw it coming

990
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:37,140
 and i think it's much more honest to say we were very good probabilistic thinkers

991
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,920
 that

992
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,500
 tried to learn as quickly as possible meaning to make as many mistakes as possible you

993
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,660
 know i mean if you look at this very famous placard

994
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,839
 that facebook had from back in the day what did it say it said move

995
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:50,300
 fast and break things

996
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,300
 in

997
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,099
 societal language that's

998
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:56,040
 saying make mistakes as quickly as you can

999
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,460
 because

1000
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,660
 the minute you break something that's

1001
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,920
 you don't do that by design it's

1002
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,119
 not a feature theoretically

1003
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,319
 it's a bug

1004
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:06,060
 but he understood that and we embraced that idea

1005
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,740
 um i used to run this meeting once

1006
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,940
 a week where the whole goal

1007
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,339
 was i want to see that there was a thousand experiments

1008
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,720
 that were run and

1009
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,980
 show me them all from the dumbest to the most impactful

1010
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,339
 and

1011
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:18,420
 we would go through that loop

1012
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,920
 and what did it train people not

1013
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,060
 that you got celebrated

1014
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,780
 for

1015
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,220
 the right answer

1016
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,859
 but you got celebrated for trying

1017
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:27,839
 i ran 12 experiments

1018
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,720
 12 failed and we'd be like you're the best

1019
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,440
 can

1020
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,880
 i just take a small tangent on that is to move fast and break things

1021
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,780
 has

1022
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,920
 become as like a catchphrase

1023
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,859
 of the thing that embodies the toxic culture of silicon valley in today's

1024
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,240
 discourse which

1025
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,619
 confuses me of

1026
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,839
 course words and phrases get sort

1027
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:52,319
 of captured

1028
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,400
 and so on becomes

1029
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,940
 very reductive

1030
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,319
 you know that's a very loaded

1031
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,260
 set of words that together can be

1032
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,040
 many

1033
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,240
 years later people can view very reductive can you still man each side of that so

1034
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:03,920
 yeah

1035
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
 pro

1036
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,359
 move fast and break things yeah and against yeah

1037
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,680
 um so i think the pro have moved fast and break things is saying the following

1038
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,680
 there's a space of things we know and a massive space of things we don't know

1039
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,819
 and there's a rate of growth of the things we know

1040
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:24,300
 but

1041
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,200
 the rate of growth

1042
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,119
 of the things we don't know is actually we

1043
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:27,780
 have to assume

1044
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,380
 growing

1045
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,000
 faster

1046
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,319
 so the most important

1047
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:32,160
 thing is

1048
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,579
 to move into the space of the things we don't know as

1049
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,380
 quickly as possible

1050
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,400
 and so in order to acquire knowledge we're going to assume

1051
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,200
 that the failure mode is the nominal state

1052
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,200
 and

1053
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,079
 so we just need to move as quickly as we can break

1054
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,339
 as many things as possible which means like things are breaking in code

1055
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:53,940
 do

1056
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,800
 the you know root cause analysis

1057
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,359
 figure out how to make things better and then rapidly move into the space and

1058
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:04,560
 he or she who moves fastest into that space will win it

1059
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,940
 doesn't imply carelessness

1060
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,599
 right it doesn't imply

1061
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,160
 moving fast without also

1062
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
 aggressively

1063
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,640
 picking up the lessons from the mistakes you make well again let's

1064
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,240
 let's steel

1065
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,079
 manning the pro which is it's a thoughtful

1066
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:32,660
 um movement around velocity and acquisition of knowledge now let's deal man the con case

1067
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:36,000
 when these systems become big enough

1068
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,400
 there is no more room

1069
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,819
 to experiment in an open-ended way because

1070
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:45,060
 the implications have broad societal impacts that

1071
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,060
 are not clear up front

1072
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:54,480
 so let's take a different less controversial example if we said you know lipitor

1073
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,380
 um worked well for all people except south asians

1074
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,460
 and there's a specific immuno response that we can iterate to

1075
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,160
 and if we move quickly enough we can run 10

1076
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,819
 000 experiments

1077
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:09,060
 and we think the answer is in that space

1078
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,099
 well the problem is that those 10 000 experiments may kill 10 million people

1079
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:19,560
 so you have to move methodically when that drug was experimental

1080
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,880
 and it wasn't being given to 500 million people in the world

1081
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,480
 moving

1082
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,540
 fast made sense because you could have a pig model a mouse model a

1083
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,440
 monkey model you

1084
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,819
 could figure out toxicity

1085
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,520
 but we picked all that low hanging fruit

1086
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,640
 and so now these small iterations

1087
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,440
 have huge impacts that need to be measured and implemented

1088
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,500
 different example is like you know if you work at boeing

1089
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,400
 and you have an implementation that gives you a two percent efficiency by

1090
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,160
 reshaping the wing or adding winglets

1091
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:56,220
 there needs to be a methodical move slow be right process

1092
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:02,940
 because mistakes when they compound when it's already implemented and at scale have huge externalities that

1093
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,440
 are impossible to measure until after the fact and you see this in the 737 max

1094
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,720
 so that's how one would steel man the

1095
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,800
 the con case which is that when an industry becomes critical you

1096
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,720
 got to slow down

1097
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,079
 this makes me sad because

1098
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,800
 some industries like twitter and facebook are a good example

1099
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,780
 they achieve scale very quickly before really exploring the big area

1100
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,780
 of

1101
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,020
 things to learn so you basically pick

1102
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,720
 one low-hanging fruit and

1103
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,400
 that became your huge success and now you're sitting there with that stupid fruit well

1104
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,319
 so you're you're i think so as an example like you know if you had to

1105
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,800
 you know if if i was running facebook for a day

1106
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,660
 you know the big opportunity in my opinion was really not the metaverse

1107
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:01,319
 but it was actually getting the closest that anybody could get to agi

1108
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:02,160
 and

1109
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,920
 if i had to steal man that product case here's

1110
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,900
 what how i would have pitched it to the board into zuck

1111
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,700
 i would have said listen there

1112
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,780
 are three and a half billion

1113
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,400
 people monthly using

1114
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,540
 this thing if

1115
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,720
 we think about human intelligence very reductively

1116
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,680
 we would say that there's a large portion of it which is cognitive

1117
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,339
 and then there's a large portion of it which is emotional

1118
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:26,940
 we have the best ability to build a multimodal model

1119
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,780
 that basically takes all of these massive inputs together to

1120
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,760
 try to intuit how a system would react to all kinds of stimuli

1121
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,660
 that

1122
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,000
 to me would have been a profound leap

1123
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,660
 forward for humanity can you dig into that a little bit more so in

1124
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,760
 terms of

1125
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,720
 now this is a board meeting how would that make facebook money

1126
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,839
 i think that you have all of these

1127
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,119
 systems over time that

1128
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,680
 that we don't know could benefit from

1129
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,420
 um some layer of reasoning to make it better

1130
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,800
 um what does spotify look like when

1131
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,500
 instead of just a very simple recommendation

1132
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,000
 engine it

1133
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,020
 actually understands sort of your emotional context and your mood and

1134
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,020
 can move you to a body of music that you would like what

1135
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:23,099
 does it look like if you know your television instead

1136
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:26,099
 of having to go and channel surf you know 50

1137
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:29,339
 000 shows on a horrible ui you know instead

1138
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:33,420
 just has a sense of what you're into and shows it to you

1139
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,440
 um what does it mean when you get in your car and

1140
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:37,980
 it

1141
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,700
 actually drives

1142
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,839
 you to a place because you should actually eat there even though you don't know it

1143
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,619
 these are all random things that make no sense a priority

1144
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:52,380
 but it starts to make the person or the provider of that service

1145
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,260
 the critical reasoning layer for

1146
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:59,520
 all these everyday products that today would look very flat without that reasoning

1147
00:49:59,520 --> 00:49:59,880
 and

1148
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,480
 i think you license

1149
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:00,780
 that

1150
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,400
 and you make a lot of money so in many ways

1151
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,819
 instead

1152
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:03,380
 of becoming

1153
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,380
 more

1154
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,599
 of the pixels that you see you've

1155
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,880
 become more of the bare metal that

1156
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,900
 actually creates that experience and if you and if you look at the companies

1157
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,859
 that are multi-decade legacy kinds of businesses

1158
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:20,579
 the thing that they have done is quietly and surreptitiously

1159
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,500
 move down the stack you

1160
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,660
 never move up the stack to survive you

1161
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:29,099
 need to move down the stack so if you take that osi reference stack right these

1162
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:31,079
 layers of how you build an app from the physical layer

1163
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:33,960
 to the transport layer all the way up to the app layer

1164
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,700
 you can map from

1165
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,359
 the 1980s all the big companies that have been created right

1166
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:45,300
 all the way from fairchild semiconductor and nat semi to intel to cisco to three com

1167
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,480
 you know oracle

1168
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,480
 netscape

1169
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,900
 at one point all the way up to the googles and facebooks of the world

1170
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,559
 but if you look at where all the locking happened

1171
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:55,980
 it's

1172
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,480
 by companies like apple who

1173
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,680
 used to make software saying

1174
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,099
 i'm

1175
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,740
 going to get one close i'm going to make the bare metal and

1176
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,599
 i'm going to become the platform or

1177
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,440
 google same

1178
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,339
 thing i'm going to create this dominant platform and i'm going to create a substrate

1179
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:09,359
 that organizes

1180
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,559
 all this information that's

1181
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:11,700
 just omnipresent

1182
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,839
 and everywhere

1183
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:17,880
 so the key is if you are lucky enough to be one of these apps

1184
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,280
 that are in front of people

1185
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,099
 you better start digging quickly and

1186
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,359
 moving your way down and get out of the way and disappear but

1187
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,300
 by disappearing you will become much much bigger

1188
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:37,500
 and it's impossible to usurp you yeah i 100 agree with you

1189
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:42,480
 um that's why you're so smart this is the depersonalization and

1190
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,579
 the algorithms that enable deep personalization almost like a operating system layer

1191
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:52,800
 so pushing away from the interface and the actual system that does the personalization i

1192
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,059
 think the challenge is there there's obviously technical challenges

1193
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:01,339
 but there's also societal challenges that

1194
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:02,339
 it's

1195
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:04,140
 like in a relationship if

1196
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,579
 you have an intimate algorithmic connection with individual humans you

1197
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:14,339
 can do both good and bad and so there's risks that you're taking you can so

1198
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,640
 if you're making a lot of money now is twitter and facebook with

1199
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,800
 ads surface layer ads

1200
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,980
 what is the incentive to take the risk

1201
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,619
 of guiding people more

1202
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:30,660
 because you can hurt people you can piss off people you can

1203
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:36,000
 um i mean there's a cost to forming a more intimate relationship with the users

1204
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,040
 in the short term i think you said a really really key thing which is

1205
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,020
 um which was a really great

1206
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:43,980
 emotional

1207
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,579
 instinctive

1208
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:45,900
 reaction which is when

1209
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,800
 i said the agi

1210
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,500
 thing you said well how would you ever make money from that

1211
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,160
 that

1212
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,180
 is the key the

1213
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,660
 presumption

1214
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,440
 is that this thing would not be an important thing at the beginning and

1215
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,720
 i think what that allows you to do if you were twitter

1216
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,940
 or google or apple or facebook anybody

1217
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,800
 microsoft

1218
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
 embarking

1219
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:07,800
 on building something like this is that you can actually have it off the critical path

1220
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,599
 and you can experiment with this for years if that's what it takes to

1221
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:17,819
 find a version one that is special enough where it's worth showcasing

1222
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:18,359
 and

1223
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,700
 so in many ways you get the free option you're

1224
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,480
 going to be spending

1225
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,500
 any of these companies

1226
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,220
 will

1227
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,859
 be spending tens of billions of dollars in opex

1228
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:26,460
 and capex

1229
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,040
 every year and all kinds of stuff

1230
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,280
 it is not a thing that money

1231
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,700
 um actually makes more likely to succeed in fact

1232
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,760
 you actually don't need to give these kinds of things a

1233
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,260
 lot of money at all because

1234
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,040
 starting

1235
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,740
 in 2023 or right now

1236
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,859
 you know you have the two most important tectonic

1237
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:50,280
 shifts that have ever happened in our lifetime in technology they're

1238
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,520
 not talked about but these things allow agi

1239
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,480
 i think to emerge

1240
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,819
 over the next 10 or 15 years where it wasn't possible

1241
00:53:56,819 --> 00:53:57,960
 for the

1242
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,200
 first thing is that the marginal cost of energy is zero

1243
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,359
 not gonna pay for anything anymore

1244
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:03,660
 right

1245
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,680
 and we can double click into

1246
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:04,980
 why

1247
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,339
 that why

1248
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:05,579
 that

1249
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:06,359
 is and the second is

1250
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:06,780
 the marginal

1251
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,140
 cost of

1252
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:07,500
 compute

1253
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,220
 to zero

1254
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,339
 and so when you when you take the

1255
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:11,339
 multiplication

1256
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:13,920
 or you know if you want to get really fancy mathematically

1257
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,980
 the convolution of these two things together it's

1258
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,280
 going to change everything

1259
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,280
 so

1260
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,599
 think about

1261
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,640
 what a billion dollars gets today when we can use open ai as an example

1262
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,079
 a billion dollars gets open ai a handful of functional models and

1263
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,300
 a pretty fast iterative loop

1264
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,800
 right

1265
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,720
 but imagine what

1266
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,119
 um openai had to overcome

1267
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,460
 that to overcome a compute challenge they

1268
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,859
 had to strip together a whole bunch of gpus that

1269
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:45,540
 to build all kinds of scaffolding

1270
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,559
 software they

1271
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,720
 had to find data center support that

1272
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,140
 consumes

1273
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,579
 all kinds of money so that billion

1274
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,260
 dollars didn't go that far so

1275
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,780
 it's a testament to how clever

1276
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,700
 that openai team is

1277
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,599
 but in four years from now when energy costs zero and basically gpus

1278
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:02,880
 like you know they're falling off a truck and

1279
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,540
 and you can use them for effectively for free

1280
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,260
 now all of a sudden a billion dollars gives you some amount of teraflops

1281
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,960
 of compute that is probably

1282
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,720
 the total number of teraflops available today in the world like that's how gargantuan

1283
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,720
 this

1284
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,079
 move is when you take these two variables to zero there's

1285
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,640
 like a million things to ask i almost don't want to get distracted by the

1286
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,000
 marginal

1287
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,900
 cost of energy going

1288
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,920
 to zero because i

1289
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,280
 have

1290
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,079
 no idea what you're talking about that is fascinating

1291
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:33,540
 can i give you the 30 seconds sure okay yes okay

1292
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,020
 so

1293
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,119
 if you look inside of the two most progressive

1294
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:36,720
 states the

1295
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,380
 three most progressive

1296
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:37,980
 states new

1297
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,700
 york california

1298
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,619
 and massachusetts a

1299
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:44,880
 lot of left-leaning folks a lot of people who believe in climate science and climate change

1300
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,420
 the

1301
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,319
 energy costs in those three states are the worst they are in the entire country and

1302
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:51,180
 energy is compounding at

1303
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:55,859
 three to four percent per annum so every decade to 15 years energy

1304
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:58,559
 costs in these states double in

1305
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,079
 some cases and in some months our energy costs are increasing by 11 a month

1306
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,760
 but the

1307
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,579
 ability to actually generate

1308
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:10,020
 energy is

1309
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,940
 now effectively zero the

1310
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,720
 cost per kilowatt

1311
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,319
 hour to

1312
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:14,160
 put a solar

1313
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,460
 panel on your roof and a battery wall inside your garage it's

1314
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,740
 the cheapest it's ever been these

1315
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,380
 things are the most efficient they they've ever been and

1316
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,839
 so to acquire energy from the sun and

1317
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,540
 store it for your use later on literally

1318
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,040
 is a zero cost proposition

1319
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,940
 so what's how do you explain the gap between the cost going great question

1320
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,480
 so

1321
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,339
 this is the other side of regulatory

1322
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:38,700
 capture right you know we all fight to build monopolies

1323
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,119
 while there are monopolies hiding in plain sight the

1324
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:44,460
 utilities are a perfect example there

1325
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,980
 are a hundred million homes in america there

1326
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,300
 are about 1700

1327
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,079
 utilities in america so they have captive markets

1328
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,980
 but in return for that captive market the law says need

1329
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,440
 to invest a certain amount per year in

1330
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,300
 upgrading that power line in

1331
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,200
 changing out that turbine in making sure you transition from coal

1332
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,420
 to wind or whatever

1333
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,339
 just as an example

1334
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:09,240
 upgrading

1335
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,980
 power lines in the united states over the next decade is a two trillion dollar proposition

1336
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,760
 these 1700 organizations have to spend i

1337
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,780
 think it's a quarter of a trillion dollars a year

1338
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,300
 just to change the power lines that

1339
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,900
 is why even though it costs nothing to make energy you

1340
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,260
 are paying double every five every seven or eight years

1341
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,500
 it's capex and opex of a very brittle old infrastructure

1342
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,520
 it's like you

1343
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,059
 trying

1344
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:37,559
 to build an app and

1345
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:38,099
 being forced

1346
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:39,059
 to build your own data

1347
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:41,339
 center and you say but wait i just want to write to aws

1348
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:42,059
 i

1349
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,640
 just want to use gcp i just want to move on

1350
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,300
 all

1351
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,700
 that complexity solved for me and

1352
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,400
 some law says no you can't you got to use it so that's

1353
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,119
 what consumers

1354
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,040
 are dealing with but it's also what industrial

1355
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,000
 and manufacturing

1356
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,660
 organizations

1357
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,380
 it's

1358
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:00,540
 what we all deal with so how do we get rid ourselves off this old infrastructure

1359
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,859
 that we're paying so

1360
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:05,160
 the thing that's happening today which i think is

1361
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,900
 this is why i think it's the most important trend right now in the world is

1362
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,900
 that a hundred million homeowners

1363
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:19,819
 are each going to become their own little power plant and compete with these 1700 utilities

1364
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,900
 just

1365
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,480
 just deal with the united states for a second because i think it's easier

1366
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,500
 to see here

1367
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,599
 100 million homes solar

1368
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,520
 panel on the roof and by the way just

1369
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,640
 to make it clear the sun doesn't need to shine right these these

1370
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,240
 panels now work where you have these uv bands that can actually extrapolate

1371
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,380
 beyond the visible spectrum so they're usable in all weather conditions

1372
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,099
 and a simple system can support you

1373
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:49,020
 collecting enough power to not just run your functional day-to-day life

1374
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,859
 but then to contribute what's left over back into the grid

1375
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:58,319
 for google's data center or facebook's data center where you get a small check

1376
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:03,839
 the cost is going to zero how obvious is this to people you're making yourself okay

1377
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:04,559
 so

1378
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:10,500
 because this is a pretty profound prediction if the cost is indeed go to zero

1379
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,819
 that i mean the compute the cost of compute going to zero i can so

1380
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:17,400
 the cost to compute going to zero is can kind of understand but

1381
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,119
 the energy seems

1382
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:19,079
 like a radical prediction

1383
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:19,680
 of

1384
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,880
 yours well

1385
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,859
 it's just it's just naturally what's happening

1386
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:23,280
 right

1387
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,319
 now now let me let me give you a different

1388
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:26,040
 way of explaining

1389
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,940
 this

1390
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,040
 if you look at

1391
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,000
 any system there's a really important thing that happens it's what clay

1392
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,540
 christensen

1393
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,020
 calls

1394
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,700
 crossing the chasm if you explained

1395
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,299
 it numerically

1396
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:38,460
 here's how i would explain it to you lex if

1397
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,460
 you introduce a disruptive product typically

1398
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:47,460
 what happens is the first three to five percent of people are these zealous believers

1399
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,680
 and they ignore

1400
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,460
 all the logical reasons why this product doesn't make any sense

1401
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:57,119
 because they believe in the proposition of the future and they buy it

1402
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,780
 the problem is at five percent if you want a product to

1403
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,339
 get to mass market you

1404
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:07,740
 have one of two choices which is you either bring the cost down low enough or

1405
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,359
 the feature set becomes so compelling that even at a high price point an

1406
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,059
 example of the latter is the iphone

1407
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:15,660
 the

1408
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,460
 iphone today the 14 iphone cost

1409
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,619
 more than the original iphone it's probably doubled

1410
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,380
 in price over the last 14 or 15 years but

1411
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:27,299
 we view it as an essential element of what we need in our daily lives

1412
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:32,339
 it turns out that battery evs and solar panels are an example of the former

1413
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:36,299
 because people like president biden with all of these subsidies

1414
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:41,460
 have now introduced so much money for people to

1415
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:47,280
 just do this where it is a money making proposition for a hundred million homes

1416
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,940
 and what you're seeing as a result are all of these companies

1417
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,420
 who want to get in front of that trend why

1418
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,880
 because they want to own the relationship with 100 million

1419
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,420
 homeowners

1420
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,220
 they want to manage the power infrastructure

1421
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,599
 amazon home

1422
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:01,680
 depot lowe's

1423
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,520
 you

1424
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,040
 know you just name the company

1425
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,940
 so if you do that and you control that relationship

1426
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,420
 they're

1427
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,760
 going to show you they're going you know for example amazon will

1428
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,720
 probably say if

1429
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,520
 you're a member of prime

1430
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,400
 we'll stick the panels on your house for free

1431
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,280
 we'll do all the work for you for free

1432
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,400
 and it's just a feature of being a member of prime and

1433
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,359
 we'll manage all that energy for you it makes so much sense and it is mathematically

1434
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:28,319
 accretive

1435
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:32,520
 for amazon to do that it's not a creative

1436
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,299
 for the existing energy industry because they get blown up

1437
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:39,839
 it's extremely accretive for peace and prosperity

1438
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,200
 if you think the number of wars we fight over natural resources

1439
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,619
 take them all off the table if we don't need energy from abroad

1440
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:51,960
 there's no reason to fight you know this you'd have to find a reason to fight

1441
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,960
 um meaning sorry there'd be a moral reason to fight but

1442
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,780
 the last number of wars that we fought

1443
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,599
 were not as much rooted in morality as they were rooted in yeah

1444
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:03,420
 it feels like they're very much rooted in

1445
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,339
 conflicts

1446
01:02:04,339 --> 01:02:05,339
 over

1447
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:06,059
 resources

1448
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,200
 energy specifically

1449
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,780
 and then sorry just the last thing i want to say i keep interviewing apologies

1450
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,799
 but the

1451
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,000
 chips

1452
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,660
 all

1453
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,040
 what what people want

1454
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,339
 to say is that you know now that we're at two and three nanometer

1455
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:18,420
 scale for

1456
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,700
 typical kind of like transistor fab

1457
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,319
 we're done and

1458
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:23,640
 you know forget about transistor

1459
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,819
 density forget about moore's lots over and i would just say no look

1460
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:27,660
 at teraflops

1461
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,220
 and really teraflops

1462
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,240
 is the

1463
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,920
 combination of cpus but

1464
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,599
 much much less important and

1465
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,760
 really is the combination of asics so application

1466
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,839
 specific ics

1467
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:37,500
 and

1468
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,880
 gpus

1469
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,160
 and so you put the two together i

1470
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,640
 mean if i gave you a billion dollars five years from now

1471
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,359
 the amount of damage you could do damaged in good way in

1472
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:51,420
 terms of you know building racks and racks of gpus the

1473
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,339
 kind of models that you could build the training

1474
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:54,900
 sets and the data that you could consume

1475
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,059
 to solve a problem

1476
01:02:57,059 --> 01:02:57,900
 it's

1477
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,099
 it's enough to to do something really powerful whereas today it's not yet quite enough

1478
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:06,000
 so there's this really interesting idea that you talk about in terms

1479
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,920
 of facebook and twitter that's

1480
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,700
 connected to this that if you were running sort of twitter

1481
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:16,079
 or facebook that you would move them all to like aws

1482
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,119
 so you would

1483
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:21,839
 have somebody else to come the compute the infrastructure it

1484
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,920
 probably if you could explain that reasoning

1485
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,920
 means

1486
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,339
 that

1487
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:29,940
 you believe in this idea of energy going to zero compute going to zero so let

1488
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,380
 people that are optimizing

1489
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,460
 that

1490
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,619
 do the best job and

1491
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:36,900
 i think that's a you know the

1492
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:41,640
 initially in the early 2000s and the beginning of the 2010s

1493
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,640
 if you were a big enough scale

1494
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:49,280
 oh sorry everybody was building their own stuff then between 2010 through 2020

1495
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:56,579
 really the idea was everybody should be on aws except the biggest of the biggest folks

1496
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:59,400
 i think in the 2020s

1497
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,900
 and 30s i think the answer is actually everybody should be in these public clouds and

1498
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,000
 the reason is the engineering velocity of the guts

1499
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
 so

1500
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,440
 you know take a simple example

1501
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,299
 which is you know we have not seen a massive iteration in database design until

1502
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:15,900
 snowflake

1503
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,280
 right i think maybe postgres was like the last big turn of the dial

1504
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,760
 why is that i don't exactly know except

1505
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:29,099
 that everybody that's on aws and everybody that's on gcp in azure gets

1506
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,500
 to now benefit from

1507
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:37,200
 a hundred plus billion dollars of aggregate market cap rapidly iterating

1508
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,940
 making mistakes

1509
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:46,160
 fixing solving learning and that is a best-in-class industry now right

1510
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,160
 then

1511
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,579
 there's going to be all these ai layers around analytics so

1512
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:53,760
 that app companies can make better decisions

1513
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,859
 all of these things will allow you to build more nimble organizations because

1514
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:01,619
 you'll have this federated model of development

1515
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:06,660
 i'll take these things off the shelf maybe i'll roll my own stitching over here

1516
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:09,599
 because the thing that where you make money is

1517
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,980
 still for most people and how the apps provision and experience to

1518
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,299
 a user and

1519
01:05:15,299 --> 01:05:18,119
 everybody else can make a lot of money just servicing that so

1520
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:19,859
 they work in a really

1521
01:05:19,859 --> 01:05:25,020
 um they play well together in the sandbox so in the future everybody

1522
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:29,819
 just should be there it doesn't make sense for anybody i don't think because you

1523
01:05:29,819 --> 01:05:30,180
 know if

1524
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:30,780
 you were to rule

1525
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:31,319
 your own data

1526
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:31,559
 centers

1527
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:31,859
 you

1528
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:32,280
 know for example

1529
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:32,700
 like google

1530
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:32,940
 for

1531
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:33,960
 a long time had

1532
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,700
 these massive leaps where they had gfs

1533
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,079
 and bigtable

1534
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:40,980
 those are really good in the 2000s and 2010s

1535
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,740
 and this is not just throw shade at google it's

1536
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,540
 very hard for whatever exists

1537
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,680
 that is a that

1538
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,520
 is the progeny

1539
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,540
 of gfs and bigtable

1540
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,540
 to be anywhere near as good as a hundred billion dollar industries

1541
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,500
 attempt

1542
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,299
 to build that stack

1543
01:05:54,299 --> 01:05:58,859
 and you're putting your organization under enormous pressure to be that good

1544
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:03,540
 i guess the implied risk taken there is that you could become the next aws

1545
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:04,740
 like

1546
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:09,000
 um tesla doing some of the compute in-house

1547
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,260
 i guess the bet there is that you can become the next the

1548
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,599
 next aws for the

1549
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,079
 new wave of computation if that level if

1550
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:23,339
 that kind of computation is different so if it's machine learning

1551
01:06:23,339 --> 01:06:30,119
 i don't know if anyone's won that battle yet which is machine learning centric well software

1552
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,579
 has a very powerful property in

1553
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:36,000
 that there's a lot of things that can happen asynchronous asynchronously

1554
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,240
 so that real-time inference can be actually really lightweight code deployment and

1555
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,900
 that's why i think you can have a very federated ecosystem inside

1556
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,720
 of inside of all of these places tesla

1557
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,760
 is very different because in

1558
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,859
 order to build the best car it's

1559
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:55,500
 kind of like trying to build the best iphone which

1560
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,819
 is that you need to control it

1561
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:57,780
 all the way down to the bare

1562
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,140
 metal in

1563
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:58,920
 order to do it well

1564
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,880
 and

1565
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,400
 that's just not possible if

1566
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,420
 you're trying to be a systems integrator which is what everybody other

1567
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:09,059
 than this modern generation of car companies

1568
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:12,299
 have been and they've done a very good job of that

1569
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:12,839
 but

1570
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:17,819
 it won't be the experience that allows you to win in in the next 20 years

1571
01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:21,720
 so let's linger on the social media thing so

1572
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,619
 if you you said if you ran facebook for a day let's let's let's extend

1573
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:26,880
 that if

1574
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,319
 you were to build a new social network today

1575
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:33,299
 how would you fix

1576
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:36,000
 twitter how would you fix social media

1577
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,220
 if you want to answer a different question is if you were elon

1578
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:41,640
 musk

1579
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,059
 somebody

1580
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:44,280
 you know and you were taking over twitter what

1581
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,180
 would you fix i

1582
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,859
 thought about this a little bit

1583
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:48,839
 um

1584
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:49,500
 first

1585
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,819
 of all let me give you a backdrop

1586
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:52,559
 i wouldn't actually build a social media

1587
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:53,160
 company at

1588
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:53,880
 all

1589
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,280
 and the answer is the reasoning

1590
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,440
 is the following

1591
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,460
 um i

1592
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:04,799
 really tend to believe as you've probably gotten a sense of sort of patterns and probabilities

1593
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,559
 and if you said to meth

1594
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:07,559
 probabilistically

1595
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:10,680
 answer where where are we going in

1596
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:14,520
 apps and social experiences what i would say is lex

1597
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:19,859
 we spent the first decade building platforms and getting them to scale

1598
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:24,238
 and if you want to think about it again back to sort of this poker analogy

1599
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:27,600
 others mistakes minus your mistakes is the value

1600
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:34,198
 well the value that was captured was trillions of dollars essentially to apple and to google

1601
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:37,198
 and they did that by basically

1602
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:42,679
 um attracting billions of monthly active users to their platform

1603
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:45,960
 then this next way were the apps

1604
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:53,880
 facebook qq10 tick tock twitter snapchat that whole panoply of apps

1605
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:59,939
 and interestingly they were in many ways an atomized version of the platforms

1606
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:04,560
 right they sat on top of them they were an ecosystem participant

1607
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,620
 but the value they created was the same trillions of dollars of enterprise value

1608
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:14,399
 billions of monthly active users

1609
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:18,779
 well there's an interesting phenomenon that's kind of hiding in plain sight

1610
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,460
 which is that the

1611
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,920
 next most obvious atomic unit

1612
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:29,880
 are content creators now let me give you two examples lex friedman this random crazy guy

1613
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,020
 mr beast you know jimmy donaldson just the two of you alone added

1614
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,880
 add it up okay and

1615
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,880
 you guys are going to approach in the next five years a

1616
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,080
 billion people the

1617
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,460
 only thing that you guys haven't figured

1618
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:42,899
 out yet is how to capture trillions

1619
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:43,920
 of dollars of value now

1620
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,939
 maybe you don't want to and

1621
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:45,299
 maybe that's

1622
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:46,198
 not your state admission

1623
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:46,500
 right

1624
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,040
 right but

1625
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,339
 let's just look at mr beast alone because he is trying to do exactly

1626
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:51,238
 that probably yeah

1627
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:52,799
 and i think jimmy is going to build an

1628
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:53,939
 enormous business but

1629
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,000
 if you take jimmy and all of the other content creators right

1630
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,820
 you guys are atomizing

1631
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,040
 what the apps have done

1632
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:08,160
 you're providing your own curated news feeds you're providing your own curated communities you're

1633
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:08,580
 allowed

1634
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,840
 you let people move

1635
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,940
 in and out of these things in a very lightweight

1636
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:12,960
 way and

1637
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,179
 value is accruing to you so the

1638
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:18,060
 honest answer to your question is i would focus on the content creator

1639
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,600
 side of things because i believe that's where the puck is going that's

1640
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,719
 a much more important

1641
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,719
 shift

1642
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,360
 in how we all consume information content

1643
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,260
 and are entertained

1644
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:28,860
 it's

1645
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,480
 through brands like you individual

1646
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,940
 people that we can humanize and understand are

1647
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,320
 the filter

1648
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,280
 but

1649
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,380
 aren't you just arguing

1650
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,699
 against the point you made earlier

1651
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:39,060
 which

1652
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,020
 is what you would recommend

1653
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,580
 is the invest in the agi

1654
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,659
 the

1655
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:44,040
 the depersonalization

1656
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,960
 because because they they could

1657
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,860
 still be a participant in that in that end state if that happens you

1658
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,800
 have the option value of being an enabler of that

1659
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,640
 right you

1660
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,840
 can help improve what they do again you can be this bare metal service provider

1661
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,300
 where you can be a tax

1662
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,480
 yeah right you can participate in every thing

1663
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:07,920
 that you do every question that's asked every comment that's curated if

1664
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,179
 you could have more intelligence

1665
01:11:09,179 --> 01:11:12,659
 as you provide a service to your fans in your audience you

1666
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:15,420
 would probably pay a small percentage of that revenue i

1667
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:20,640
 suspect all content creators would and so it's that stack of services that

1668
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,400
 is like a smart human being it's like you know how do you help produce

1669
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,420
 this information you

1670
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:27,480
 would pay a producer for that i mean maybe you would but so

1671
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,460
 back to your question so what would i do

1672
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:32,340
 i think that you have to move into that world

1673
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,380
 pretty aggressively

1674
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:37,920
 um i think that right now you first have to solve what

1675
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,560
 is broken inside of these social networks

1676
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,020
 and i don't think it's a technical problem

1677
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,260
 so just to put it out there i don't think it's a

1678
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:54,120
 you know it's one where there are these nefarious organizations that happens brigading xyz that happens

1679
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:01,739
 but the real problem is a psychological one that we're dealing with which is people

1680
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:05,760
 through a whole set of situations

1681
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:11,360
 have lost belief in themselves

1682
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,780
 and i think that that

1683
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,199
 comes

1684
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,940
 up as this very virulent

1685
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:21,000
 form of rejection that they tried to put into these social networks

1686
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,980
 so if you look inside of comments on

1687
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:23,460
 anything like

1688
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,480
 you could have a con like

1689
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,640
 you could have a person that says on twitter

1690
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,540
 i saved this dog from a fiery building

1691
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,900
 and there would be negative commenters

1692
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,520
 and you're like well again

1693
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,440
 put yourself in their shoes what

1694
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,320
 do you how do i steal man their case i do this all the time you

1695
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,400
 know i get people

1696
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,460
 throw shade at me i'm like okay let me steal man their point of view

1697
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:44,940
 and

1698
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,980
 the best that i can come up with is you know i'm

1699
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:47,580
 working really

1700
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,960
 hard over here i'm

1701
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,100
 trying i

1702
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,320
 played by all the rules that were told to me

1703
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,199
 i've played well i played fairly and

1704
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:59,580
 i am not being rewarded in a system of value that you recognize

1705
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:02,820
 and that is making me mad and

1706
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:05,340
 now i need to cope and i need to vent

1707
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:06,060
 so

1708
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,040
 back in the day my dad used to drink he

1709
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,679
 would make me go get things to hit me with

1710
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:11,159
 today

1711
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:11,580
 you

1712
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:12,480
 go to twitter you

1713
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,100
 spot off you try to deal with

1714
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:14,580
 the

1715
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,560
 latent anger that you feel so

1716
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,620
 a social network has to be designed in my opinion

1717
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:25,260
 to solve that psychological corner case because it is what makes a network unusable

1718
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,540
 to get real density you

1719
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,460
 have to find a way of

1720
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,300
 moving away from that toxicity because it ruins a product experience

1721
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:38,520
 you could have the best pixels in the world but if people are virulently spitting

1722
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,380
 into their keyboards

1723
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:40,920
 other

1724
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,380
 people are just going to say you know what i'm done with this it

1725
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,360
 doesn't make me feel good

1726
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,080
 so

1727
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:46,860
 the

1728
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,800
 social network has to have a social cost you

1729
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,360
 can do it in a couple ways one

1730
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,860
 is where you have real world identity so then there's a cost to being virulent

1731
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:58,679
 and there's a cost to being caustic

1732
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:03,659
 a second way is to actually just overlay an economic framework

1733
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:07,739
 so that there's a more pertinent economic value that you assign to

1734
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:09,239
 basically spouting off

1735
01:14:09,239 --> 01:14:12,600
 and the more you want to spend the more you can say

1736
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,020
 and

1737
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,040
 i think both have

1738
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:14,400
 a

1739
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,140
 lot of value i don't know what the right answer

1740
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:17,520
 is i tend to like the

1741
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,300
 latter

1742
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,580
 i think real world identity shuts

1743
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,440
 down a lot of debate because

1744
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,780
 there's still too much

1745
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:29,280
 um you know there's a sensation that there that there'll be some retribution

1746
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:33,780
 um so i think there's more free speech over here but it cannot be costless

1747
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:37,980
 because in that there's a level of toxicity that just makes these products unusable

1748
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:38,580
 what

1749
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:40,260
 about a third option and

1750
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:43,920
 by the way all of these can work together

1751
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,460
 if

1752
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,159
 we look at this what you call the corner case was just hilarious

1753
01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:51,920
 what i would call the human condition

1754
01:14:51,920 --> 01:15:01,080
 which is you know that anger is rooted with the challenges of life and

1755
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,659
 what about having a

1756
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:08,580
 um an algorithm that shows you what you see

1757
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:15,659
 that's personalized to you and helps you maximize your personal growth in the long term such

1758
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:17,400
 that you're

1759
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,360
 challenging

1760
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:24,600
 yourself you're improving you're learning there's just enough of criticism

1761
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,440
 to

1762
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,300
 keep you on your toes but

1763
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:31,199
 just enough of like the dopamine rush to keep you entertained

1764
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,960
 and finding that balance for each individual person you

1765
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,840
 just described an agi of a very empathetic

1766
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,640
 well-rounded friend yes

1767
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,780
 exactly and

1768
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:45,719
 and then you can throw that person even anonymous into a pool of discord and

1769
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:48,360
 they would be better i think you're absolutely right that's

1770
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,739
 a very very very elegant

1771
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:52,679
 way of stating it you're absolutely but like you said the agi

1772
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:53,219
 might

1773
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:55,020
 be a few years away so

1774
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:58,320
 that's a huge investment like my concern my

1775
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,560
 gut feeling is this age thing we're calling agi

1776
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,760
 is actually not that difficult to build technically but

1777
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,320
 it requires a certain culture and it requires a certain certain

1778
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:16,080
 risks to be taken i think you could reductively boil down the human intellect

1779
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,580
 into

1780
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,940
 cognition and emotion

1781
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,679
 and you know depending

1782
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:27,659
 on who you are and depending on the moment they're weighted very differently obviously

1783
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:31,199
 um cognition is so easily done by computers

1784
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:34,560
 that we should assume that that's a solved problem

1785
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,940
 so our differentiation

1786
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,800
 is the reasoning part it's the emotional

1787
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,280
 overlay

1788
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,880
 it's that it's the empathy it's the ability to steal man the opposite person's

1789
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:42,840
 case and and

1790
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,760
 feel why that person

1791
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:49,500
 you know you can forgive them without excusing what they did as an example

1792
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:54,900
 um that is a very difficult thing i think to capture in software but

1793
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:59,120
 i think it's a matter of when not if

1794
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,620
 if done crudely it

1795
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,260
 takes a form of censorship just

1796
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,219
 banning

1797
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:07,260
 people off the platform let

1798
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,219
 me ask you some tricky questions

1799
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:15,659
 do you think trump should have been removed from twitter no what's the what's

1800
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:21,600
 the pro case can you i'm having fun here you still man each side yeah

1801
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:30,600
 um let's deal man to get him off the platform here we have a guy who

1802
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:37,159
 um is virulent in all ways he promotes confrontation

1803
01:17:37,159 --> 01:17:41,060
 he lacks decorum he

1804
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:45,239
 incites the fervent believers of his cause

1805
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:51,739
 to act up and push the boundaries bordering on and potentially even including breaking the law

1806
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:52,739
 he

1807
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:53,940
 does not observe

1808
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:55,980
 the social norms of

1809
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,500
 a society that keep us while functioning including

1810
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,480
 an orderly transition of power

1811
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,679
 if he is left in a moment where he feels trapped and cornered

1812
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:07,260
 he could behave in ways that

1813
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,900
 will confuse the people that believe in him

1814
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:15,179
 to act in ways that they so regret that

1815
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:18,360
 um it could bring our democracy to an end or

1816
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,199
 create so much damage or create a wound that's so deep it

1817
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:25,860
 will take years of conflict and years of confrontation

1818
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,840
 to heal it

1819
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,940
 we need to remove him and

1820
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:31,020
 we need to do it now it's

1821
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:31,800
 been too long we've

1822
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,659
 let it go on too long

1823
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:39,960
 the other side of the argument would be he was a duly elected person whose

1824
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,060
 views have been run over for

1825
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,620
 way too long

1826
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:51,179
 and he uses the ability to say extreme things in order to showcase

1827
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:55,199
 how corrupt these systems have become

1828
01:18:55,199 --> 01:19:00,120
 and how insular these organizations are in protecting their own class

1829
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,820
 and so if you really want to prevent class warfare

1830
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:06,719
 and if you really want to keep the american dream alive for everybody we

1831
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:12,179
 need to show that the first amendment the constitution the second amendment all

1832
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:14,219
 of this infrastructure is

1833
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:19,739
 actually bigger than any partisan view no matter how bad it is and that people

1834
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:22,800
 will make their own decisions

1835
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,500
 and there are a lot of people that can see past the words he uses

1836
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,880
 and focus on the substance of what he's trying to get across and

1837
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,440
 more generally agree than disagree and so when you silence that voice

1838
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,280
 what you're effectively saying is this is a rigged game and

1839
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:45,900
 all of those things that we've told we were told were not true are actually true

1840
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,920
 if you were to look at the crude algorithms of twitter of

1841
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,560
 course i don't have any insider knowledge but

1842
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,640
 i could imagine that they saw

1843
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,640
 the

1844
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,600
 let's

1845
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,300
 say there's a metric that measures how

1846
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:05,580
 negative the experience is of the platform and they probably saw

1847
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,780
 in several

1848
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,280
 ways you could look at this but

1849
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,640
 the presence of donald trump on the platform was

1850
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,900
 consistently increasing how shitty people are feeling

1851
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:19,739
 short-term and long term because they're probably yelling at each other having

1852
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:20,159
 worse

1853
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,920
 and worse and worse experience if you even do a survey of how

1854
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,840
 do you feel about using this platform over

1855
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,340
 the last week they

1856
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,780
 would say horrible

1857
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:31,199
 relative to maybe a year ago when

1858
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,460
 donald trump was not actively

1859
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,659
 tweeting or so on so

1860
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:35,280
 here you're sitting at twitter and

1861
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,300
 saying

1862
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,739
 okay i

1863
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:40,140
 i and i know everyone's talking about speech

1864
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:42,480
 and all that kind of stuff but i kind of want to build a platform

1865
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,320
 where the users

1866
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,580
 are happy

1867
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:49,980
 and they're becoming more and more unhappy how do i solve this happiness problem well

1868
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:50,880
 let's

1869
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,159
 ban

1870
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,179
 let's let's

1871
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:59,400
 yeah let's ban the sources of the unhappiness now we can't just say you're

1872
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:04,380
 a source of unhappiness so we'll ban you let's wait until that source says something that

1873
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,900
 we can claim

1874
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:12,659
 breaks our rules like insights violence or so on that would work if you could measure

1875
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:13,260
 your

1876
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:17,820
 construct of happiness properly the problem is i think what twitter looked at were active commenters

1877
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:20,159
 and got it confused for overall system happiness

1878
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,120
 because

1879
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,000
 for every piece of content that's created on the internet of

1880
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,739
 the hundred people that consume it maybe one or two people comment on it and

1881
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:30,480
 so by over amplifying

1882
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,739
 that signal and

1883
01:21:31,739 --> 01:21:34,860
 assuming that it was the plurality of people that's

1884
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,380
 where they actually made a huge blunder because

1885
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:42,000
 there was no scientific method i think to get to the answer of de-platforming

1886
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,140
 him and

1887
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,699
 it did expose

1888
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:47,699
 this idea that it's a bit of a rigged game and

1889
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:50,600
 that there are these deep biases

1890
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,600
 that

1891
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,060
 some of these organizations have to

1892
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:59,239
 opinions that are counter to theirs and to their orthodox view of the world

1893
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,960
 so in general you lean towards keeping

1894
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,420
 um first of all presidents on the platform but also

1895
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:09,420
 controversial

1896
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:10,860
 voices all

1897
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,000
 the time i

1898
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,159
 think it's really important to keep them there let

1899
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,300
 me ask you a trick tricky

1900
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:16,800
 one in the recent news that's

1901
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:17,820
 become especially

1902
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,320
 relevant

1903
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,580
 for me what

1904
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:24,900
 do you think about if you've been paying attention to yay kanye west

1905
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,080
 a recent controversial outburst on social media

1906
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,880
 about

1907
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,360
 and jews

1908
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,820
 black people

1909
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,980
 racism in general

1910
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,219
 slavery holocaust all these topics that

1911
01:22:41,219 --> 01:22:46,440
 he touched on in different ways on different platforms but including

1912
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,760
 twitter what

1913
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,380
 do you do with that and

1914
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,460
 like what do you do what do you do with that from a platform perspective what

1915
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:54,900
 do you do from a humanity

1916
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:55,440
 perspective

1917
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,400
 of

1918
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,000
 how to add love to the world

1919
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,300
 let's

1920
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:05,340
 um should we take both sides of them sure option one is he is

1921
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:10,940
 completely out of line and option two is he's not just the same sure right so

1922
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:11,940
 the

1923
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:14,340
 path one

1924
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,320
 is

1925
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,940
 he is an incredibly

1926
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:24,060
 important taste maker in the world that defines the belief system for a lot of people

1927
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,840
 and there just is no room

1928
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,840
 for

1929
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,640
 any form of racism

1930
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,280
 or bias or anti-semitism in

1931
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,159
 today's day and age particularly by people

1932
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:36,000
 whose

1933
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,360
 words and comments will be amplified around the world

1934
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:43,920
 we've already paid a large price for that and then the expectation

1935
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:51,239
 of success is some amount of societal decorum that keeps moving the ball forward

1936
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:53,699
 the other side would say

1937
01:23:53,699 --> 01:24:00,480
 life i think goes from harmony to disharmony to repair

1938
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:05,400
 and anybody who has gone through a very complicated divorce

1939
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:11,159
 will tell you that in that moment your life is extremely disharmonious

1940
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:17,940
 and you are struggling to cope and because he is famous

1941
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:20,100
 we are seeing

1942
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,460
 a person really struggling in a moment

1943
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,500
 that may need help

1944
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:31,320
 and we owe it to him not for what he said because that stuff isn't excusable

1945
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:37,560
 but we owe it to him to help him in a way and particularly his friends

1946
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,020
 and if he has real friends

1947
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:44,480
 hopefully what they see is that what i see on the outside looking in

1948
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:48,960
 is a person that is clearly struggling

1949
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:54,360
 can i ask you like a human question and i know it's outside looking in but

1950
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,000
 there's several questions i want to ask

1951
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,780
 so

1952
01:24:57,780 --> 01:25:00,060
 one is about the pain of going through a

1953
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:03,360
 divorce and having kids and all that kind of stuff and

1954
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,179
 two when you're rich and powerful and

1955
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:13,020
 famous i don't know maybe you can enlighten me into which is the most corruptive

1956
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:18,719
 um but how do you know who are the friends to trust

1957
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:19,679
 so

1958
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,620
 a lot of the world is calling kanye insane

1959
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:26,940
 and if orlick has mental illness all that kind of stuff and

1960
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:29,820
 so how do you have friends close to you let's

1961
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:30,659
 say

1962
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:35,400
 let's say something like that message but from a place of

1963
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,719
 love and

1964
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:42,120
 where they actually care for you as opposed to trying to get you to shut up

1965
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,820
 the reason i ask all those questions i think

1966
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:48,540
 if you care about the guy how do you help him right

1967
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:52,219
 i've been through a divorce it's gut wrenching

1968
01:25:52,219 --> 01:25:57,360
 the most horrible part is having to tell your kids

1969
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,600
 i can't even describe it to you

1970
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:05,460
 um how proud i am and how resilient these three beautiful little creatures were when my

1971
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:09,719
 ex-wife and i had to sit them down and talk through it

1972
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:16,440
 um and for that thing i'll be just so protective of them and so proud

1973
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,360
 of them and

1974
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:23,219
 um it's hard now i don't know that that's what he went through

1975
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:24,600
 um but it doesn't matter in

1976
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,020
 that moment there's no fame there's no money there's nothing there's just the raw intimacy

1977
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:28,739
 of a nuclear

1978
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:29,880
 family

1979
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:34,980
 breaking up in that there is a death and it's the death of that idea

1980
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:38,280
 and that is extremely extremely

1981
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:43,380
 profound in its impact especially in your children

1982
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:45,780
 um it is really hard really

1983
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:50,520
 hard could you have seen yourself in the way you see the world being

1984
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,100
 clouded during

1985
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,100
 especially

1986
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:56,520
 at first to where you would make poor decisions outside

1987
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:01,860
 of your outside of that nuclear family so like business poor business decisions poor

1988
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:02,580
 tweeting

1989
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,080
 decisions poor

1990
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:07,560
 i think that writing decision if i had to boil down

1991
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,300
 a lot of those what

1992
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,980
 i would say is that there

1993
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,460
 are moments in my life flex where i have felt

1994
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:14,460
 meaningfully

1995
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:16,320
 less than

1996
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,940
 and in those moments

1997
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:18,480
 the

1998
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,159
 loop that i would fall into is

1999
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:23,340
 i would look to cope and be seen by other people so

2000
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,260
 i would throw away

2001
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:29,400
 all of the work i was doing around my own internal validation

2002
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,179
 and

2003
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:30,659
 i

2004
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:34,980
 would try to say something or do something that would get the attention of others and

2005
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:38,340
 oftentimes you know when that loop was

2006
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:42,300
 um was unproductive it's because those things had really crappy

2007
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,679
 consequences so

2008
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:48,000
 you know that was that was yeah so yeah i i went through that as

2009
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,400
 well so i had to go through you

2010
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,540
 know this disharmonious

2011
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:55,860
 phase in my life and then to repair it you know i had the benefit of

2012
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,780
 meeting someone and

2013
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:00,960
 building a relationship

2014
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:06,840
 um block by block where there is just enormous accountability

2015
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:14,820
 where my partner not had has just incredible empathy

2016
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:16,739
 um but accountability

2017
01:28:16,739 --> 01:28:19,980
 and so she can put herself in my shoes sometimes

2018
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:22,739
 when i'm a really tough person to be around

2019
01:28:22,739 --> 01:28:25,139
 but then she doesn't let me off the hook she

2020
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:26,040
 can forgive me but

2021
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:29,100
 it doesn't make you know what i may have said or whatever you

2022
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,139
 know excusable

2023
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:36,300
 and that's been really healthy for me and it's helped me repair my relationships

2024
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,020
 be

2025
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,400
 a better parent you

2026
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,900
 know be a better friend

2027
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:42,239
 to my ex-wife who's a beautiful woman who

2028
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:45,300
 you know i love deeply and will always love her and

2029
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,520
 it took me a few years to see that that

2030
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,639
 it was just a chapter that had come to an end but she's

2031
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,100
 an incredible mother and an incredible businesswoman

2032
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,179
 and i'm so thankful that i've had two incredible women in my life

2033
01:28:57,179 --> 01:28:59,280
 that's like a blessing but

2034
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,659
 it's hard so

2035
01:29:00,659 --> 01:29:03,239
 with that it's hard to find a person that

2036
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:04,139
 has that i

2037
01:29:04,139 --> 01:29:06,239
 mean a lot of stuff you said is pretty profound but

2038
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,860
 having that person who has empathy

2039
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:09,000
 and accountability

2040
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,679
 so basically that's ultimately what great friendship

2041
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:14,699
 is

2042
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:15,360
 which

2043
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,159
 is people that love you have empathy

2044
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:20,400
 for you but can also call you out on your bullshit she's a lebron james-like

2045
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,860
 figure and the reason i say that is

2046
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:28,020
 i've seen and met so many people i've seen the distribution on

2047
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:30,659
 the scale of friendship and empathy

2048
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:31,380
 she's the

2049
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:31,800
 lebron

2050
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,840
 james of friendship she's a goat well

2051
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,820
 what's so funny is like you know we

2052
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,920
 have a dinner around poker

2053
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,159
 and it's taken on a life of its own mostly

2054
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:49,560
 because of her because these guys look to her and i'm like whoa whoa [laughter]

2055
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:53,699
 her registers are already full she's thinking of all kinds of crap with me

2056
01:29:53,699 --> 01:29:54,960
 um but

2057
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:55,800
 um

2058
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,860
 but it's a it's a it's a very innate skill and

2059
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:03,480
 it's paired with you know it's but it's not just an emotional thing meaning

2060
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:07,020
 she's the person that i make all my decisions with

2061
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,900
 these decisions we're making together as a team i've

2062
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:13,620
 never understood that you know there's that african pop proverb like go

2063
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:16,500
 fast go alone go far go together

2064
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,000
 and

2065
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,940
 lex since since i was born i was by myself

2066
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:21,360
 and

2067
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,260
 i had to cope and

2068
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,820
 i didn't have a good tool kit to

2069
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,560
 use into the world

2070
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:25,980
 and

2071
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,719
 in these last five or six years she's

2072
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:30,780
 helped me and at first my toolkit was literally like

2073
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:33,060
 sticks you know and

2074
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,620
 then i found a way to you

2075
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:35,580
 know she helped me sharpen

2076
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:39,239
 a little rock and that became a little knife but even that was crap and

2077
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:42,840
 then she showed me fire and then i forged a knife and that and

2078
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:47,460
 that's what it feels like where now this toolkit is like most average people

2079
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:54,840
 and i feel humble to be average because i was here down here on the ground

2080
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:59,880
 so it's made all these things more reasonable so i see

2081
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:04,320
 what comes from having deep profound friendships and love to

2082
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,880
 help you through these critical moments i have another friend who

2083
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:14,400
 um who i would say just completely unabashedly loves me this guy rob goldberg he

2084
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:14,940
 doesn't

2085
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:15,719
 hold me accountable

2086
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:18,480
 that much which i love like i could say i killed a homeless person he's

2087
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,560
 like ah they probably deserved

2088
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,520
 it you

2089
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:25,020
 know whereas that would be like that was not good what you just did so

2090
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:26,880
 but i have both

2091
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:27,239
 i

2092
01:31:27,239 --> 01:31:27,900
 mean i have nat

2093
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,780
 every day you know rob i don't talk to that often but to

2094
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:33,120
 have two people

2095
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:37,199
 i had zero i think most people unfortunately have zero

2096
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:44,280
 um so i think like what what he needs is somebody to just listen

2097
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:47,040
 you don't have to put a label on these things

2098
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:47,520
 and

2099
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,920
 you just have to try to guide in these very unique

2100
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,400
 moments

2101
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,659
 where you can just like

2102
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:54,000
 de-escalate

2103
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,900
 what

2104
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,520
 is going on in your mind and

2105
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,120
 i suspect

2106
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:57,540
 what's

2107
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:01,380
 going on in his mind again to play armstrong quarterback i don't know

2108
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:06,139
 is that he is in a moment where he just feels lower than low

2109
01:32:06,139 --> 01:32:07,139
 and

2110
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:10,980
 we all do it we've all had these moments where we don't know how

2111
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,900
 to get attention

2112
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,780
 and if you didn't grow up in a healthy environment you

2113
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,719
 may go through a negative way to get attention

2114
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:24,179
 and it's not to excuse it but it's to understand it

2115
01:32:24,179 --> 01:32:31,440
 that's so profound the feeling less than and at those low points

2116
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:37,679
 going externally to find it and maybe creating conflict

2117
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:44,219
 and scandal to get that attention the way that my doctor explained it to me is

2118
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:45,540
 um

2119
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:48,239
 you have to think about yourself worth like

2120
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,940
 a knot it's inside of

2121
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:51,780
 a very complicated

2122
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,280
 set of knots so

2123
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,239
 it's like a some

2124
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:55,920
 people don't have these knots it's

2125
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:56,460
 just presented

2126
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:57,840
 to you on a platter

2127
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,080
 but for some of us because of the way we grow up it's

2128
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,360
 covered in all these knots so

2129
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,920
 the whole goal

2130
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,500
 is to loosen those knots

2131
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:13,139
 and it happens slowly it happens unpredictably and it takes a long time

2132
01:33:13,139 --> 01:33:13,679
 and

2133
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,719
 so while you're doing that you are going to have moments

2134
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:17,760
 where when you feel less than you're not prepared

2135
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,480
 to

2136
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,280
 look inside and say actually here's

2137
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:25,219
 how i feel about myself it's pretty cool i'm happy with how where i'm at

2138
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,020
 i have to ask on

2139
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,760
 the topic of friendship you

2140
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,239
 do an amazing podcast called all in podcast people

2141
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:36,300
 should stop listening to this and go listen to that you

2142
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,580
 just did your 100th episode i

2143
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:42,000
 mean it's one of my favorite podcasts it's incredible for

2144
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,500
 the

2145
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:49,860
 the the technical and the human psychological wisdom that you guys

2146
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:54,960
 constantly give and in the way you analyze the world but also just the chemistry

2147
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:00,179
 between the between you you're clearly there's there's a tension and

2148
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:05,580
 there's a camaraderie that's all all laid out on on the table so

2149
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:09,300
 i don't know the two davids that well but i have met jason what

2150
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,600
 do you love about him i mean i'll give you a little psychological

2151
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:16,080
 breakdown of all three of these guys sure

2152
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:20,340
 um just my opinion yeah and i love you guys

2153
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,000
 um would

2154
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,199
 they agree with your psychological

2155
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:22,980
 breakdown i

2156
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,060
 don't know you know i

2157
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,860
 i think that what i would say about

2158
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,300
 jay cal is

2159
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,639
 he is unbelievably

2160
01:34:29,639 --> 01:34:31,739
 loyal

2161
01:34:31,739 --> 01:34:38,040
 um to no end and you know he's like any of those movies

2162
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:38,639
 where

2163
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,380
 which are about like the the

2164
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:40,860
 mafia

2165
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:42,600
 or whatever where like you know something

2166
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,080
 bad's

2167
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,960
 going wrong and you need somebody to show up

2168
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:49,500
 that's jcal so if you killed the said proverbial

2169
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,100
 homeless

2170
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,480
 person he would be right there to

2171
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:52,500
 help you the body yeah

2172
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:52,860
 but

2173
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,060
 he's the one that he'll defend

2174
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:54,719
 you in

2175
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,179
 every way shape or form even if it's not doesn't

2176
01:34:57,179 --> 01:34:59,100
 make sense in that moment he

2177
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:00,780
 doesn't see

2178
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:01,260
 that

2179
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:03,420
 as an action of whether it'll solve the problem he

2180
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:04,860
 sees that as an act of devotion

2181
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,600
 to you your friend and

2182
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,900
 that's an incredible gift that he gives us

2183
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,780
 the other side of it is that you know j cal

2184
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:13,679
 needs

2185
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:14,580
 to learn

2186
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:21,020
 how to trust that other people love him back as much as he loves us foreign

2187
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:22,020
 because

2188
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:25,260
 he assumes that he's not as lovable as the rest of us

2189
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:28,739
 but he's infinitely more lovable than he understands he's i

2190
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:31,320
 mean you have to see lex like he is

2191
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,219
 unbelievably

2192
01:35:32,219 --> 01:35:33,900
 funny i mean i

2193
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:36,659
 cannot tell you how funny this guy is

2194
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:43,080
 um next level funny yeah his timing timing everything charm the care he takes

2195
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:46,920
 so he is as lovable but he doesn't believe himself to be and

2196
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:51,060
 that manifests itself in areas that drive us all crazy from time to time which

2197
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:55,320
 makes it for a very pleasant listening experience okay so what about the the two

2198
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:55,860
 david's

2199
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:56,460
 deus

2200
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:57,420
 ex and david friedberg

2201
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:57,900
 david

2202
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:58,380
 sacks

2203
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:59,639
 is the one that i would say i

2204
01:35:59,639 --> 01:36:00,900
 have the most emotional

2205
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,580
 connection with

2206
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:05,820
 um he and i can go a year without talking and

2207
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:08,100
 then we'll talk for four hours straight and

2208
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,480
 then we know where

2209
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:10,440
 we are and

2210
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,840
 we have this ability to pick up and have a level of intimacy

2211
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,520
 with each other and

2212
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:17,880
 i think that's just because i've known david for so long now

2213
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:20,760
 um that i find really comforting

2214
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:25,440
 and then freeburg is this person who i think similar to me had

2215
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:31,199
 a very turbulent upbringing has fought through it to build an incredible life for himself and

2216
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:32,520
 i have this enormous

2217
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,679
 respect for his journey i

2218
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:38,460
 don't particularly care about his outcomes to be honest but i just have i

2219
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,260
 look at that guy and i think

2220
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:44,940
 and he did it and so if i didn't do it

2221
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:49,440
 um i would be glad that he did it if it makes any sense

2222
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:54,239
 um and you can see that he

2223
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:59,940
 um feels like his entire responsibility is really around his kids

2224
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:05,159
 and just kind of like give a better counterfactual

2225
01:37:05,159 --> 01:37:06,480
 and

2226
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,380
 and

2227
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:10,620
 you know sometimes i think he gets that right and wrong but

2228
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:14,280
 he's a very special human being that way on that show the

2229
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,679
 two of you have a very kind of

2230
01:37:16,679 --> 01:37:22,980
 like from a geopolitics perspective i don't know there's just a very

2231
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:23,699
 effective

2232
01:37:23,699 --> 01:37:26,580
 way to think deeply about the world the big

2233
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:30,320
 picture of the world he's a very systems level thinker yeah

2234
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:33,120
 very very absolutely

2235
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,460
 fairy systems levels very

2236
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:39,780
 rooted in you know a broad body of knowledge which

2237
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:43,980
 i have a tremendous respect for he brings all these things in

2238
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,600
 sax is

2239
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,000
 incredible because he has this unbelievable

2240
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,719
 understanding

2241
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:50,940
 of things but it has a core nucleus

2242
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:51,540
 so

2243
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,219
 free bird can just basically abstract

2244
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:55,860
 a whole bunch of systems and talk about it i

2245
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,659
 tend to be more like that where i try to kind

2246
01:37:57,659 --> 01:37:58,020
 of i

2247
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,880
 find it to be more of a puzzle

2248
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:00,719
 socks

2249
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:05,820
 is more like anchored in you know a philosophical and historical context as the answer

2250
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:09,540
 and he starts there but he gets to these profound understandings

2251
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:11,699
 of systems as well on

2252
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:13,139
 the podcast in

2253
01:38:13,139 --> 01:38:17,219
 life you guys hold to your opinion pretty strong

2254
01:38:17,219 --> 01:38:18,659
 what's

2255
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:22,739
 what's the secret to being able to argue passionately with friends so

2256
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:24,540
 hold your position but

2257
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,400
 also not murder each other which

2258
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,500
 you guys seem to come close to i

2259
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,060
 think it's like strong

2260
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:33,980
 opinions weekly held

2261
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:40,380
 yeah

2262
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:42,600
 like you know like look today you

2263
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:43,739
 and i yeah what

2264
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:48,060
 have we we steel man like the two sides of three different things yeah

2265
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:52,920
 um now you could be confused and think i believe in those things i

2266
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,560
 believe that it's important to be able to intellectually traverse

2267
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:59,520
 there whether i believe in it or not and like steel man not superman like that's

2268
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,080
 a really but we introde

2269
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:04,500
 those things by saying let us steal men in this position sometimes

2270
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,880
 you guys skip the

2271
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:06,360
 we

2272
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,739
 skip you're right we we edit

2273
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:08,699
 those things out and sometimes

2274
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:09,780
 we'll sit on either sides

2275
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,159
 and we'll just kind of bat

2276
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:13,860
 things back and forth just to see what

2277
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:15,840
 the other person thinks so

2278
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,980
 that's how like

2279
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:20,159
 as fans we should listen to that sometimes like so sometimes

2280
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:23,460
 because you hold the strong opinion sometimes

2281
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:27,360
 like for example the cost of energy going to zero

2282
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:32,520
 is that like what's the degree of certainty on that is is this

2283
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,920
 kind of like you really

2284
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:42,060
 taking a prediction of how the world will unroll and if it does this will benefit

2285
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,800
 a huge amount of companies

2286
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,780
 and people that will believe

2287
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:48,000
 that idea so you really you

2288
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,840
 you like

2289
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,600
 you spend a few days a few weeks with that idea i've

2290
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,380
 been spending

2291
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:52,860
 two

2292
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,659
 years with that idea and

2293
01:39:54,659 --> 01:39:58,139
 that idea has manifested into

2294
01:39:58,139 --> 01:40:04,800
 um many pages and pages of more and more branches of a tree

2295
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:05,340
 but

2296
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:08,219
 it started with that idea so if you think about this tree this

2297
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:10,800
 logical tree that i built i would consider it more of a mosaic

2298
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,639
 and

2299
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:14,760
 at the at the base or root however you want to talk about it is

2300
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:15,840
 this idea the

2301
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:16,380
 incremental

2302
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,800
 cost of energy goes to zero how does it manifest and

2303
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:26,100
 so i talked about one traversal which is the competition of households versus utilities

2304
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,920
 but if even some of that comes to pass

2305
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:33,840
 we're going to see a bunch of other implications from a regulatory and technology perspective if

2306
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,639
 some of those come to pass so

2307
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:37,620
 i've tried to think think

2308
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:42,420
 sort of this you know six seven eight hops forward

2309
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:44,340
 and i have some like

2310
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,420
 to use the chest analogy

2311
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:49,139
 i have a bunch of short lines which i think can work

2312
01:40:49,139 --> 01:40:52,620
 um and i've started to test those by making investments

2313
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:55,920
 tens of millions over here to 100 millions over there

2314
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:01,500
 but it's a distribution based on how probabilistic i think this these outcomes are

2315
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:02,460
 and how downside

2316
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:02,940
 protected

2317
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:04,860
 i can be and how much i will learn how

2318
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,500
 many mistakes i can make you know etc

2319
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:10,500
 and then very quickly over the next two years some

2320
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:14,639
 of those things will happen or not happen and i will rapidly re-underwrite

2321
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:16,980
 and i'll rewrite that tree

2322
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:20,880
 and then i'll get some more data i'll make some more investments

2323
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,100
 and i'll rapidly re-underwrite so

2324
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:24,000
 you know in order for

2325
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,179
 me to get to this tree maybe you can ask how did i get there it

2326
01:41:27,179 --> 01:41:27,960
 was complete

2327
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,400
 accident

2328
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:29,760
 the

2329
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,600
 way that it happened was

2330
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:30,840
 i

2331
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:31,920
 have a friend of mine who

2332
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:32,159
 works

2333
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:33,000
 at a great organization

2334
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:33,659
 called fortress

2335
01:41:33,659 --> 01:41:33,960
 his

2336
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,500
 name is drew

2337
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:34,739
 mcknight

2338
01:41:34,739 --> 01:41:34,980
 and

2339
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:35,639
 he called me one

2340
01:41:35,639 --> 01:41:36,659
 day and he said hey i'm doing a

2341
01:41:36,659 --> 01:41:37,020
 deal will

2342
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:37,380
 you anchor

2343
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:39,060
 it we're going public

2344
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:43,800
 and it's a rare earth mining company and i said drew like if

2345
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:48,119
 i'm going to get tart and feathered in silicon valley for backing a mining company and

2346
01:41:48,119 --> 01:41:50,820
 he said just talk to the guy and learn

2347
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:53,880
 and the guy jim lotinski blew me away he's

2348
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:54,119
 like

2349
01:41:54,119 --> 01:41:54,360
 here's

2350
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:55,080
 what it means for energy

2351
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:55,320
 and

2352
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:55,560
 here's

2353
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:55,980
 what it means

2354
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:56,639
 for the supply chain

2355
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:57,000
 here's

2356
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
 what it means for the united states versus china

2357
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,300
 but lax i did that deal and then i did seven others

2358
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:07,880
 and that deal made money let's have another

2359
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,659
 but i learned i

2360
01:42:09,659 --> 01:42:10,560
 made enough mistakes

2361
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,360
 where the net of it was

2362
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:15,480
 i got to a thesis that i believed in i could see it

2363
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,280
 and i was like okay

2364
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:17,699
 i paid

2365
01:42:17,699 --> 01:42:18,420
 the price i

2366
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,199
 acquired the learning

2367
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,960
 i made my mistakes i know where i am at and

2368
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,699
 this is step one

2369
01:42:23,699 --> 01:42:24,300
 and

2370
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:26,400
 then i learned a little bit more i made some more investments

2371
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,840
 and that's how i that's

2372
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,880
 how i do the job that's the

2373
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,380
 minute that you try

2374
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:35,219
 to wait for perfection in order to make a bet either on yourself or

2375
01:42:35,219 --> 01:42:36,840
 a company

2376
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:42,540
 a girlfriend whatever it's too late so if we just linger on that tree

2377
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:44,760
 it seems like a lot of geopolitics

2378
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:48,300
 a lot of international military even conflict is

2379
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,040
 around energy so

2380
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,480
 how does

2381
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,699
 your thinking about energy connect

2382
01:42:53,699 --> 01:42:57,420
 to what you see happening in the next 10 20 years maybe

2383
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:00,300
 you can look at the war in ukraine

2384
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:01,260
 or

2385
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:06,540
 relationship with china and other places through the lens of energy what

2386
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:09,600
 what's the hopeful what's the cynical trajectory

2387
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,179
 that the world might take through with this

2388
01:43:12,179 --> 01:43:14,100
 drive towards zero energy zero

2389
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:15,179
 cost energy so

2390
01:43:15,179 --> 01:43:18,600
 the united states was in a period of energy surplus

2391
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,340
 um until the last few years some

2392
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:23,400
 number of years in trump and i think some number of now the current administration

2393
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,380
 with president biden

2394
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:29,100
 um but we know what it means

2395
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:33,920
 um to basically have more than enough energy to fund our own domestic

2396
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,659
 manufacturing and living standards

2397
01:43:36,659 --> 01:43:37,500
 foreign

2398
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,040
 and

2399
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:41,340
 i think that by being able to generate this energy from the sun that

2400
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,380
 is very capex efficient that

2401
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,380
 is very climate efficient

2402
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:48,600
 gives us a huge tailwind

2403
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:53,580
 the second thing is that we are now in a world in a regime for

2404
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:56,280
 many years to come of non-zero interest rates

2405
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:02,100
 and it may interest you to know that the really the last time

2406
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:05,460
 that you know we had long-dated

2407
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,800
 wars supported you

2408
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,219
 know at

2409
01:44:08,219 --> 01:44:09,000
 low interest rates

2410
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,100
 was world war ii where i think the average interest rates

2411
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,300
 was like 1.07

2412
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:14,460
 in the tenure

2413
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:18,960
 and every other war tends to have these very quick open and closes because

2414
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,360
 these long protracted fights

2415
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:25,380
 get very difficult to finance when rates are non-zero

2416
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:28,320
 so just as an example even starting in 2023

2417
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:31,679
 so the practical example today in the united states is president biden's

2418
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:32,639
 budget is

2419
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:34,020
 about 1.5 trillion

2420
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:34,739
 and

2421
01:44:34,739 --> 01:44:36,179
 for next year that's

2422
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:39,659
 not including the entitlement spending okay meaning medicare

2423
01:44:39,659 --> 01:44:43,739
 social security right so the stuff that he wants to spend that he has discretion

2424
01:44:43,739 --> 01:44:44,719
 over is about

2425
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:45,719
 1.582

2426
01:44:45,719 --> 01:44:48,300
 trillion is the exact number

2427
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:51,960
 next year our interest payments are going to be 455

2428
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:57,239
 billion dollars that's 29 of every budget dollar is going to pay interest

2429
01:44:57,239 --> 01:45:03,239
 so you have these two worlds coming together right lex if you have us

2430
01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:05,760
 you know hurtling forward

2431
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,400
 to being able to generate our own energy and

2432
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:12,900
 the economic peril that comes with trying to underwrite several

2433
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,880
 trillion dollars for war which

2434
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,360
 we can't afford to pay when rates are at five percent means

2435
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,880
 that despite all the bluster the

2436
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:28,100
 probabilistic distribution of us engaging in war with russia and ukraine seems relatively low

2437
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:33,659
 the the override would obviously be a moral

2438
01:45:33,659 --> 01:45:35,760
 reason to do it that

2439
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,820
 may or may not come if there's some nuclear proliferation

2440
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:41,880
 but now you have to steal man the

2441
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:45,360
 other side of the equation which is well what were to happen if

2442
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,860
 you were sitting there and you were putin

2443
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:48,119
 let's deal man setting

2444
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:49,139
 off a tactical nuke

2445
01:45:49,139 --> 01:45:51,119
 someplace

2446
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:52,320
 okay i'm

2447
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:58,380
 getting calls every other day from my two largest energy buyers india and china telling

2448
01:45:58,380 --> 01:46:00,600
 me slow my roll

2449
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:03,600
 i have the entire world looking

2450
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,659
 to find the final excuse to

2451
01:46:06,659 --> 01:46:10,800
 turn me off and unplug me from the entire world economy

2452
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:11,520
 the

2453
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,900
 only morally reprehensible

2454
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:15,119
 thing that's left in my arsenal that

2455
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:18,420
 could do all of these things together would be to set off attack nuke

2456
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:23,900
 i would be the only person since world war ii to have done that

2457
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:28,340
 you know it's it seems like it's a really really really

2458
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,340
 big

2459
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,199
 step to take

2460
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:34,020
 and so i think that

2461
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:40,199
 x of the clamoring for war that the military-industrial complex wants us to buy into

2462
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:44,639
 the financial reasons to do it and the natural reason resources

2463
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:49,260
 needs to do it are making it very unlikely

2464
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:51,780
 that is not just true for us

2465
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,820
 i think it's also true for europe i

2466
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:54,659
 think the european

2467
01:46:54,659 --> 01:46:55,139
 economy

2468
01:46:55,139 --> 01:46:57,900
 is going to roll over

2469
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:01,800
 i think it's going i see a very hard landing for them which

2470
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:06,420
 means that if the economy slows down there's going to be less need for energy

2471
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,139
 and

2472
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:08,040
 so it

2473
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:11,040
 starts to become a thing where a negotiated settlement

2474
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:14,340
 is actually the win-win for everybody

2475
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,860
 but none of this would be possible without

2476
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:18,840
 zero interest rates in

2477
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,920
 a world of zero interest rates we would be in war

2478
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:25,460
 so you believe in the financial

2479
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:30,960
 forces and pressures overpowering i believe in the human lives

2480
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:35,460
 i really do believe in these even in in international war more

2481
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:38,159
 so there i think the invisible hand and

2482
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:41,520
 by the invisible hand for the audience i think really what it means is you

2483
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,199
 know the the financial complex

2484
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:49,800
 and really the central bank complex and the interplay between fiscal and monetary policy

2485
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:54,719
 um is a very convoluted and complicated set of things

2486
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:58,020
 but if we had zero interest rates

2487
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:01,739
 we would be probably in the middle of it now

2488
01:48:01,739 --> 01:48:05,780
 see there's a complexity to this game at the international

2489
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:15,000
 level where the nation some nations are authoritarian and are there's significant corruption

2490
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,100
 and so that adds

2491
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:20,040
 from a game theoretic optimal perspective

2492
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:26,940
 you know the invisible hand has is operating in the mud preventing war

2493
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:27,480
 the

2494
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,080
 person the

2495
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:28,500
 person that

2496
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,600
 is the most important figure in the world right now is jerome

2497
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:30,960
 powell

2498
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,020
 he is probably doing more to prevent more than anybody else

2499
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:39,840
 he keeps ratcheting rates it's just impossible it's a mathematical impossibility for the united states unless

2500
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,340
 there is such a cataclysmic

2501
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:45,659
 moral transgression by russia so there is tail risk that it is possible

2502
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:50,219
 where we say forget it all bets are off we're going back to zero rates issue

2503
01:48:50,219 --> 01:48:53,040
 a hundred year bond we're going to finance a war machine

2504
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,260
 there is a small risk of that but

2505
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:59,699
 i think the propensity of the majority of outcomes is more of a negotiated settlement so

2506
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,440
 what about i mean if you what's

2507
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:05,100
 the motivation of putin to invade ukraine in the first place if

2508
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:06,179
 financial

2509
01:49:06,179 --> 01:49:09,540
 forces are the most

2510
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,360
 um the most powerful forces

2511
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:18,739
 why did it happen because it seems like there's other forces at play of

2512
01:49:18,739 --> 01:49:27,060
 maintaining superpower status on the world stage yeah it seems like geopolitics doesn't happen just

2513
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,219
 with the invisible hand in

2514
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:33,780
 consideration i agree with that i can't beg to know to be honest i don't know

2515
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:37,020
 um but he did it

2516
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:39,960
 and i think it's easier for me

2517
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:42,000
 to guess the outcome from here it

2518
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,060
 would have been impossible for me to really understand it is

2519
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:47,219
 what got him to this place

2520
01:49:47,219 --> 01:49:52,020
 but it seems like there's an end game here and there's

2521
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:54,420
 um there's not much playability

2522
01:49:54,420 --> 01:50:00,239
 yeah i feel like i'm on a sturdy ground because there's been so many experts at

2523
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:06,739
 every stage of this that have been wrong well there are no experts well on this

2524
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:09,719
 there are no experts lex i

2525
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:11,880
 understand this well okay let's

2526
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:15,360
 dig into that because there's some because we just said phil helmuth is the

2527
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:19,020
 um is the greatest poker player of all time he has an opinion yeah

2528
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:22,679
 he doesn't he's so he would be mistaken hey

2529
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:23,100
 poker

2530
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:23,580
 phil

2531
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:24,780
 has an opinion ivy

2532
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:27,300
 has an opinion as well on how to play all these games

2533
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:31,380
 meaning an opinion means here's the lines i take here are the decisions i make

2534
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:34,980
 i live and die by those and if i'm right i win if i'm wrong i

2535
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,179
 lose i've

2536
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:38,460
 made more mistakes than my opponent

2537
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:41,159
 i thought you said there's an optimal

2538
01:50:41,159 --> 01:50:45,239
 so aren't there people that have a deeper understand

2539
01:50:45,239 --> 01:50:48,060
 a higher likelihood of being able to describe

2540
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:51,540
 and know the optimal the optimal set of actions here at

2541
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:53,340
 every layer well

2542
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,900
 they're they're they're being

2543
01:50:54,900 --> 01:51:00,300
 theoretically set of optimal decisions but you can't play your life

2544
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:01,739
 um

2545
01:51:01,739 --> 01:51:06,060
 against a computer like meaning the minute that you face an opponent and

2546
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:10,260
 that person takes you off that optimal path you have to adjust yeah

2547
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:16,139
 like what happens if a tactical nuke it would be really bad

2548
01:51:16,139 --> 01:51:17,280
 um

2549
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:17,880
 i

2550
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,800
 think the world is resilient enough i

2551
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:22,500
 think the ukrainians are resilient enough to overcome it it

2552
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:26,760
 would be really bad it's just an it's an incredibly sad moment in human history but

2553
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:29,100
 do you wonder what u.s does

2554
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:33,659
 is there any understanding do you think people inside the united states

2555
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:38,100
 understand not not the regular citizens but people in the military do

2556
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:41,639
 you think joe biden understands do you think i think joe biden does understand i

2557
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:46,280
 think that i think they have a clear plan i think that there are

2558
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:47,280
 few

2559
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,320
 reasons to let the gerontocracy

2560
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:52,260
 rule but this is one of the reasons where i think they are better adept

2561
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:54,420
 than other people

2562
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:57,780
 um you know folks that were around during the bay of pigs folks

2563
01:51:57,780 --> 01:52:00,060
 that hopefully have studied that and

2564
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:03,119
 studied you know nuclear de-escalation

2565
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:07,619
 we'll have a better playbook than i do my suspicion

2566
01:52:07,619 --> 01:52:09,119
 is that

2567
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:13,440
 there is a you know in an emergency break glass plan and

2568
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:17,520
 i think before military intervention or anything else

2569
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,580
 i think that there are an enormous number of financial

2570
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:31,320
 sanctions that you can do to just completely cripple russia that they haven't undertaken yet

2571
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:31,980
 um and

2572
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:34,020
 if you couple that with an economic

2573
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:37,440
 system in europe that is less and less in need of energy

2574
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:40,920
 because it is going into a recession it

2575
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:44,820
 makes it easier for them to be able to walk away while

2576
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:48,360
 the u.s ships a bunch of you know lng over there so

2577
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:48,900
 i

2578
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:52,639
 i don't know the game theory on all of this but does it make you nervous

2579
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,060
 that

2580
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:57,719
 or we're just being temperamental does

2581
01:52:57,719 --> 01:53:00,600
 it feels like the world hangs in a balance like

2582
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:02,280
 it feels like

2583
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:06,440
 at least for my naive perspective

2584
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,440
 i

2585
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:08,760
 thought we

2586
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:13,139
 were getting to a place where surely human civilization can't destroy itself and

2587
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:16,139
 here's a presentation of what looks like a hot war or

2588
01:53:16,139 --> 01:53:19,320
 multiple parties involved in escalating escalation

2589
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:25,500
 towards a world war is not entirely out of the realm of possibility it's not i

2590
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:28,980
 would really really hope that

2591
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:34,699
 he is spending time with his two young twins

2592
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:37,380
 well this is part

2593
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,100
 of

2594
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:42,360
 what i really i really hope he's spending time with his kids

2595
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:48,000
 agreed but not kids not just kids but friends and the the he

2596
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,100
 may not have friends but

2597
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:53,699
 it's very hard for anybody to look at their kids and not think about protecting

2598
01:53:53,699 --> 01:53:56,360
 the future

2599
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:58,679
 well there's

2600
01:53:58,679 --> 01:53:59,400
 um partially

2601
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:04,080
 because of the pandemic but partially because of the nature of power it

2602
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,260
 feels like you're surrounded by people you can't trust more and more i

2603
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:11,699
 do think the pandemic had a effect on that too the isolating effect a

2604
01:54:11,699 --> 01:54:15,179
 lot of people were not their best selves during the pandemic

2605
01:54:15,179 --> 01:54:18,540
 from a super heavy topic let me go back to

2606
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:23,219
 the space where you're one of the most successful people in the world

2607
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:28,260
 how to build companies how to find good companies what it takes

2608
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:28,679
 to

2609
01:54:28,679 --> 01:54:29,400
 find good companies

2610
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:30,719
 what it takes to build good companies

2611
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:31,260
 what advice

2612
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:34,199
 do you have for someone who wants to build the next

2613
01:54:34,199 --> 01:54:37,440
 super successful startup in the tech space and

2614
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:41,100
 you know have a chance to be impactful like facebook apple

2615
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:44,400
 that's i think that's the key word if your

2616
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:48,119
 precondition is to start something successful you've already failed because

2617
01:54:48,119 --> 01:54:52,380
 you're now you're playing somebody else's game what success means is not clear you're

2618
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:54,119
 walking into the woods

2619
01:54:54,119 --> 01:54:59,760
 it's murky it's dark it's wet it's raining there's all these animals about

2620
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:04,980
 um there's no comfort there so you better really like hiking

2621
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:06,420
 and

2622
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:10,619
 there's no short way to shortcut that so

2623
01:55:10,619 --> 01:55:14,280
 isn't it obvious what successes like success scale

2624
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:16,500
 so it's not what are the no

2625
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:23,100
 i think that there's a very brittle basic definition of success that's outside in

2626
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:27,840
 um but it's not that's not what it is

2627
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:33,659
 um you know i know people that are much much richer than i am

2628
01:55:33,659 --> 01:55:39,060
 you know and they are just so completely broken

2629
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:41,760
 and i think to myself the

2630
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:43,980
 only difference between you and me

2631
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,940
 is outsider's perception of your wealth versus mine

2632
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:49,320
 but the

2633
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:54,060
 the happiness and the joy that i have in the simple basic routines of my life

2634
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,699
 give me enormous joy

2635
01:55:56,699 --> 01:55:58,800
 and so

2636
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:05,159
 i feel successful no matter what anybody says about my success or lack of success

2637
01:56:05,159 --> 01:56:06,840
 um there are people

2638
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:12,060
 that live normal lives that have good jobs that have good families you

2639
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:14,580
 know i've this like idyllic sense like

2640
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:18,360
 i see it on tick tock all the time so i know it exists these

2641
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:24,060
 neighborhoods where there's like a cul-de-sac and these beautiful homes and these kids are biking around

2642
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:28,260
 and every time i see that lex i immediately flash back to

2643
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,179
 what i didn't have

2644
01:56:30,179 --> 01:56:32,699
 and i think that's success look

2645
01:56:32,699 --> 01:56:34,380
 at how happy those kids are

2646
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:37,440
 so no you there is no one definition and

2647
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:40,440
 so if people are starting out to try to make a

2648
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:44,159
 million dollars 100 million dollars a billion dollars you're gonna fail

2649
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:49,679
 there's a definition of personal success but is there's also some level of

2650
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:55,639
 um that's different from person to person but there's also some level of

2651
01:56:55,639 --> 01:56:57,139
 the

2652
01:56:57,139 --> 01:56:58,139
 responsibility

2653
01:56:58,139 --> 01:57:01,920
 you have if there's a mission to have a positive impact on the world so

2654
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,159
 i'm not sure that elon is happy no

2655
01:57:05,159 --> 01:57:05,699
 in

2656
01:57:05,699 --> 01:57:06,719
 fact i think if you focus

2657
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:07,080
 on trying

2658
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:07,800
 to have an impact

2659
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:08,040
 on

2660
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:08,520
 the world i

2661
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:09,540
 think you're going to end up deeply

2662
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:10,440
 unhappy

2663
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,179
 but does that matter

2664
01:57:12,179 --> 01:57:17,400
 like what may happen what happens it may happen as a byproduct

2665
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:22,320
 but i think that you should strive to find your own personal happiness and then measure

2666
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:27,239
 how that manifests as it relates to society and to other people but

2667
01:57:27,239 --> 01:57:30,300
 if the answer to those questions is zero that

2668
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:32,280
 doesn't make you less of a person no

2669
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:34,679
 100 but then the other way is

2670
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:38,659
 there are times when you need to sacrifice your own personal happiness

2671
01:57:38,659 --> 01:57:39,659
 force

2672
01:57:39,659 --> 01:57:40,080
 for

2673
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:43,920
 a bigger thing for that you've created yeah if you're if you're in a position to

2674
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,119
 do it i

2675
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:50,040
 think some folks are tested elon is probably the best example and

2676
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:55,800
 it must be really really hard to be him

2677
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,800
 um really hard i have

2678
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,300
 enormous

2679
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:02,639
 levels of empathy

2680
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:03,960
 and care for

2681
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:06,540
 him i really love him as a person because

2682
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:10,320
 i just see that it's not like it's not that fun

2683
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:13,440
 and and he has these ways of

2684
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:15,480
 being human that

2685
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:18,060
 in his position i just think are so dear

2686
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:19,679
 that if he never i

2687
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:22,860
 just hope he never loses them just a simple example like two

2688
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:24,119
 days ago

2689
01:58:24,119 --> 01:58:25,739
 i don't know why but i

2690
01:58:25,739 --> 01:58:27,719
 went on twitter and i saw the perfume

2691
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:29,520
 thing yeah so i'm like ah

2692
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,739
 fuck it i'm just gonna go buy some perfume so

2693
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:34,199
 i bought his perfume the burnt hair thing yeah

2694
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:35,340
 and i said and

2695
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:39,060
 i emailed him the receipt and i'm like all right you got me for a bottle

2696
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:39,840
 um and he

2697
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:40,260
 responded

2698
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:43,800
 in like eight seconds and it was just a smiley face or whatever yeah just

2699
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:49,440
 deeply normal things that you do amongst people that are just so nobody sees that

2700
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:52,020
 you know what i mean but it would be

2701
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:52,440
 he

2702
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:52,860
 deserves

2703
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:54,420
 for that stuff to be seen because the

2704
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,420
 rest of his life is so brutally hard yeah

2705
01:58:57,420 --> 01:59:03,659
 um he's just a normal guy that is just caught in this ultra mega vortex

2706
01:59:03,659 --> 01:59:07,739
 why do you think there's so few elons

2707
01:59:07,739 --> 01:59:12,780
 it's an extremely lonely set of trade-offs

2708
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:16,139
 because to your point if you get tested

2709
01:59:16,139 --> 01:59:18,599
 so if you think about it again probabilistically

2710
01:59:18,599 --> 01:59:21,179
 there's eight billion people in the world maybe

2711
01:59:21,179 --> 01:59:25,980
 50 of them get put in a position where they are building something of such colossal

2712
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:27,300
 importance that

2713
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:29,099
 they even have this choice

2714
01:59:29,099 --> 01:59:31,739
 and then of that 50 maybe

2715
01:59:31,739 --> 01:59:36,239
 10 of them are put in a moment where they actually have to make a trade-off

2716
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:36,659
 you

2717
01:59:36,659 --> 01:59:37,139
 know you're

2718
01:59:37,139 --> 01:59:38,340
 not going to be able to see your fam i'm

2719
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:39,060
 making this up you're

2720
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:40,139
 not going to be able to see your family

2721
01:59:40,139 --> 01:59:40,440
 you're

2722
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:41,099
 not you

2723
01:59:41,099 --> 01:59:42,000
 know you're going to have to basically

2724
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:42,300
 move

2725
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:42,719
 into your

2726
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:43,199
 factory you're

2727
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:43,860
 gonna have to sleep on

2728
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:44,940
 the floor but

2729
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:47,280
 here's the outcome energy independence

2730
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,980
 and you know resource abundance and peace

2731
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:53,580
 you know a massive peace dividend

2732
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:54,060
 and

2733
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:55,440
 then he says to himself i

2734
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,239
 don't know that he did because i've never had this combo

2735
01:59:57,239 --> 01:59:57,599
 yeah

2736
01:59:57,599 --> 01:59:59,639
 you know what that's worth it

2737
01:59:59,639 --> 02:00:03,060
 and like and then you look at your kids and you're like

2738
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:05,940
 i'm making this decision i don't know how to explain that to you

2739
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:06,480
 yeah

2740
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,340
 you want to be in that position there's

2741
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:10,980
 no there's no amount of money where i would want to be in that position so

2742
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:11,639
 that

2743
02:00:11,639 --> 02:00:14,699
 takes an enormous fortitude and a moral compass

2744
02:00:14,699 --> 02:00:17,699
 that he has and that's what i think people need to need

2745
02:00:17,699 --> 02:00:19,619
 to appreciate about that guy it's

2746
02:00:19,619 --> 02:00:23,880
 also on the first number he said it's confusing that there's 50 people or

2747
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,020
 10 people

2748
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:30,119
 like that are put in the position to have that level of impact it's unclear

2749
02:00:30,119 --> 02:00:32,400
 that that has to be that way it seems like there

2750
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:33,719
 could be much more

2751
02:00:33,719 --> 02:00:37,679
 there should be there's definitely people with the potential

2752
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:41,400
 um but you know think about think about his journey you know his

2753
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:43,980
 mom had to leave a very complicated environment moved

2754
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:44,880
 to canada moved

2755
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:46,020
 to toronto you

2756
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:48,179
 know a small apartment

2757
02:00:48,179 --> 02:00:51,900
 just north of bain bloor you know if you've ever been to toronto

2758
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:52,679
 um i remember talking

2759
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:53,940
 to her about this apartment is

2760
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:56,940
 so crazy because i used to live like around the corner from that place and

2761
02:00:56,940 --> 02:01:00,119
 raise these three kids and just have to so

2762
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:04,560
 how many people are going to start with those boundary conditions

2763
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:11,040
 you know and really grind it out it's just very few people in the end that

2764
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:14,760
 um will have the resiliency to stick it through where

2765
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:17,520
 you don't give in to the self-doubt

2766
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,420
 and

2767
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:21,300
 so it you know it's a really it's

2768
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:23,040
 just a really hard set of boundary conditions

2769
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:23,940
 where you can have 50

2770
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:26,340
 or 100 of these people that's why they needed to be really they

2771
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:28,800
 need to be really appreciated

2772
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:34,860
 yeah well that's true for all humans that

2773
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:35,699
 follow

2774
02:01:35,699 --> 02:01:37,320
 the the threat of their passion

2775
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:38,400
 and do something beautiful

2776
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:41,000
 in this world that could be in a small scale or a big scale

2777
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
 appreciation

2778
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,739
 is a

2779
02:01:43,739 --> 02:01:44,280
 that's

2780
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:47,520
 a gift you give to the other person but also a gift to yourself that's

2781
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,360
 somehow it becomes

2782
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:49,080
 like this

2783
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:49,739
 contagious

2784
02:01:49,739 --> 02:01:51,139
 thing i went to this

2785
02:01:51,139 --> 02:01:52,139
 you

2786
02:01:52,139 --> 02:01:55,739
 are so right you just like it my my brain just lit up because yesterday

2787
02:01:55,739 --> 02:01:59,699
 i went to an investor day of my friend of mine

2788
02:01:59,699 --> 02:02:00,840
 um describe

2789
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,400
 brad gerstner and

2790
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:06,060
 you know on the one very reductive world brad

2791
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:08,580
 and i are theoretically competitors but

2792
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:09,540
 we're not he

2793
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:12,960
 makes his own set of decisions i make my own set of decisions we're

2794
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:16,380
 both trying to do our own view of what is good work in the world

2795
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:18,679
 but he's been profoundly successful

2796
02:02:18,679 --> 02:02:19,679
 and

2797
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:20,580
 it

2798
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:23,099
 was really the first moment of my

2799
02:02:23,099 --> 02:02:26,340
 adult life where i could sit in a moment like that

2800
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:30,599
 and really be appreciative of his success and not feel less then

2801
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:35,340
 and so you know little selfishly for me but mostly for him as well

2802
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:37,320
 i was so proud to be in the room that's

2803
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:38,400
 my friend that

2804
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,320
 guy plays poker with me every thursday he

2805
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,840
 is crushing it it's awesome you

2806
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:47,599
 know and that's the it's a it's a really amazing feeling

2807
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:54,599
 i mean to to linger on the the trade-offs the complicated trade-offs with all this

2808
02:02:54,599 --> 02:03:01,139
 what's your take on work-life balance in in a in a company that's trying to do

2809
02:03:01,139 --> 02:03:03,540
 big things

2810
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:10,380
 i think that you have to have some very very strict boundaries

2811
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:14,520
 but otherwise i think balance is kind of dumb

2812
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,860
 it will make you limited

2813
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:19,440
 i think you need to immerse yourself in the problem

2814
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:22,320
 but you need to define that immersion with boundaries

2815
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:22,739
 so

2816
02:03:22,739 --> 02:03:25,800
 if you you know if you ask me like you know what does like my process

2817
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:26,159
 look

2818
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:27,300
 like

2819
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:32,639
 it's monotonous and regimented but it's all the time except

2820
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:35,400
 when it's not and that's also monotonous

2821
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:37,560
 and regimented

2822
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:42,119
 um and i think that makes me very good at my craft

2823
02:03:42,119 --> 02:03:44,940
 because it gives me what i need

2824
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:50,880
 to stay connected to the problem without feeling resentful about the problem which

2825
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:56,040
 part the monotonous all in nature of it or

2826
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:59,880
 the the when you say hard boundaries essentially

2827
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:00,599
 go

2828
02:04:00,599 --> 02:04:03,179
 all out until you stop and

2829
02:04:03,179 --> 02:04:07,080
 you don't stop often i'm in a little bit of a quandary right now

2830
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:10,920
 because i'm trying to redefine my goals

2831
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:13,800
 and you're catching me in a moment where

2832
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:18,599
 i have even in these last few years of evolution i

2833
02:04:18,599 --> 02:04:20,639
 think i've made some good progress

2834
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:25,860
 but in one very specific way i'm still very reptilian

2835
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:29,340
 and i'm trying to let go which was that exactly if

2836
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:31,320
 you can you know in my business it

2837
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:32,400
 really gets reduced

2838
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,739
 to what is your annual rate of compounding

2839
02:04:34,739 --> 02:04:36,060
 that's my demarcation

2840
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:37,020
 you know

2841
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:42,000
 steph curry and lebron james michael jordan it's how many points did you average not

2842
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,380
 just in a season

2843
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:45,360
 but over your career

2844
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:49,260
 you know and in their case to really be the greatest of all time

2845
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:54,900
 its points rebounds assists steals there's all kinds of measures

2846
02:04:54,900 --> 02:05:01,280
 to be you know in that pantheon of being really really good at your craft

2847
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:06,360
 um and in my business it's very reductive it's how well have you compounded

2848
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:09,719
 and if you look at all the heroes that

2849
02:05:09,719 --> 02:05:14,520
 i have put on a pedestal in my mind

2850
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:22,199
 um they've compounded you know at above 30 percent for a very long time

2851
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:23,820
 as have i

2852
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:24,780
 but

2853
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:28,980
 now i feel like i really need to let go because i

2854
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:32,699
 think i know how to do the basics of my job

2855
02:05:32,699 --> 02:05:33,360
 and

2856
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,480
 if i had to summarize like an investing challenge or investing

2857
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:39,420
 i think really it's you know when you first start out investing

2858
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:40,320
 you're

2859
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:45,659
 a momentum person you saw it in gamestop just a bunch of people aping each other

2860
02:05:45,659 --> 02:05:48,060
 and then it goes from momentum

2861
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,840
 to

2862
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:49,380
 you

2863
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:50,699
 start to think about cash flows

2864
02:05:50,699 --> 02:05:53,219
 you know how much profit is this person going to make whatever so

2865
02:05:53,219 --> 02:05:54,599
 that's like the evolution

2866
02:05:54,599 --> 02:05:58,020
 you know this is the this is the basic thing

2867
02:05:58,020 --> 02:06:01,500
 to this is a reasonably sophisticated way then

2868
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:06,179
 a much smaller group of people think about it in terms of macro geopolitics

2869
02:06:06,179 --> 02:06:08,699
 but then a very finite few cracked

2870
02:06:08,699 --> 02:06:11,760
 this special code which is there's a philosophy and

2871
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:15,360
 it's the philosophy that creates the system

2872
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,040
 and i'm scratching

2873
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:18,239
 at that furiously

2874
02:06:18,239 --> 02:06:18,960
 but i cannot

2875
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:19,380
 break through

2876
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:19,679
 and

2877
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:19,920
 i

2878
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:20,340
 haven't broken

2879
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:20,639
 through

2880
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:20,880
 and

2881
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:21,420
 i know that

2882
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,920
 in order to break through i

2883
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:24,119
 gotta let go

2884
02:06:24,119 --> 02:06:28,739
 so this is the journey that i'm in as in my in my professional life

2885
02:06:28,739 --> 02:06:32,159
 so it is an all-consuming thing but

2886
02:06:32,159 --> 02:06:33,960
 i'm always home for dinner

2887
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:37,560
 you know we have very prescribed moments where we take vacation the

2888
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:38,099
 weekends

2889
02:06:38,099 --> 02:06:38,340
 you

2890
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:39,179
 know like if i i

2891
02:06:39,179 --> 02:06:39,840
 can tell you about my

2892
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:40,199
 week if

2893
02:06:40,199 --> 02:06:40,619
 you're curious

2894
02:06:40,619 --> 02:06:42,000
 but it's like i would love i

2895
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,400
 would love to know your week it's since it's regimented

2896
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,860

 um before i used to have another machine i just pushed a button yeah

2919
02:07:25,619 --> 02:07:27,540
 but then i would push the button religiously

2920
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:29,159
 in the exact same way you

2921
02:07:29,159 --> 02:07:30,360
 know what i mean because

2922
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:32,099

2923
02:07:32,099 --> 02:07:33,780
 on that topic

2924
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:38,239

2934
02:07:57,179 --> 02:07:58,619
 my words i

2935
02:07:58,619 --> 02:08:01,560
 see all of the things in moments

2936
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:03,900
 where

2937
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:06,659
 there was no compassion given to me and

2938
02:08:06,659 --> 02:08:09,480
 so i just give him a ton of love

2939
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:14,040
 and compassion i have an infinite patience for my children not for other kids yes

2940
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:19,500
 of course but for a lot of kids so anyway so we have a breakfast thing

2941
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:23,400

2944
02:08:30,179 --> 02:08:33,239

 and

2963
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:02,340
 it helps me lock in for the for the

2964
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:03,719
 for the week

2965

 um and it's just helping me the recent past usually

2967
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,360
 sometimes

2968
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:15,540
 the recent past but usually it's about the past past

2969
02:09:15,540 --> 02:09:18,780
 something that i remember when i was a kid

2970
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:22,500

2971
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:26,040
 know so i put in that hour of work

2972

 tuesday thursday friday i'm allowed to have meetings wednesday

2988
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:11,340
 nothing it's all reading must

2989
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:15,179
 be unless it's a complete emergency it has to be

2990
02:10:15,179 --> 02:10:19,320
 kind of a full reading and reading is a bunch of blogs

2991
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:23,520
 youtube videos so i'm not trying not to do any talking no

2992
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:26,699
 talking it's like being in silence being present thinking

2993
02:10:26,699 --> 02:10:27,840
 about things by

2994
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:29,460
 the way how do you take notes give

2995
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:30,239
 us a

2996
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:33,300
 sketch i have a pad and i write stuff down sometimes

2997
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:36,960
 i go to my phone i'm a little all over the place sometimes

2998
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:38,639
 i do google docs i

2999
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:41,880
 don't have this is one thing i need to get better at actually

3000
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:44,340
 but typically what happens is i

3001
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:47,040
 actually do a lot of thinking in my mind and

3002
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:50,159
 i'm sort of filing a lot of stuff away and

3003
02:10:50,159 --> 02:10:52,980
 then it all spills out and then i have to write

3004
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:55,980
 and then that gives me a body of work that i can evaluate

3005
02:10:55,980 --> 02:10:59,760
 and think about and then i usually put it away

3006
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:02,219
 um and a lot of the time it goes nowhere but

3007
02:11:02,219 --> 02:11:04,500
 every now and then i come back to it and it just unlocks

3008
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:06,599
 two or three things and i have a sense of how

3009
02:11:06,599 --> 02:11:08,639
 else i'm thinking about things

3010
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:10,500
 um and then friday at the end of the day

3011
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:13,440
 nat and i talk to a couple's therapists

3012
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:16,199
 um and that's about checking out properly

3013
02:11:16,199 --> 02:11:22,199
 so it's like okay now it's like focusing the weekend is family

3014
02:11:22,199 --> 02:11:25,980
 being present being aware you know and

3015
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:31,440
 if there's email obviously if i have to do meetings from time to time no problem

3016
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:35,580
 um but there's boundaries checking out properly

3017
02:11:35,580 --> 02:11:41,699
 um oh man that is so powerful just like yeah officially transitioning yeah

3018
02:11:41,699 --> 02:11:45,080
 so these are these are really important

3019
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:46,080
 boundaries

3020
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:46,860
 so

3021
02:11:46,860 --> 02:11:48,480
 that i can be immersed and

3022
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:51,420
 what that means is like look on a saturday afternoon you

3023
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:53,219
 know on a random day she'll

3024
02:11:53,219 --> 02:11:56,580
 be like where's your mouth and i'll be up in my room and

3025
02:11:56,580 --> 02:11:58,560
 i've found a podcast talking

3026
02:11:58,560 --> 02:11:59,699
 about like

3027
02:11:59,699 --> 02:12:00,360
 um

3028
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:05,340
 decis which is like ductal cancer in situ because i've been fascinated about breast cancer surgeries

3029
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:06,840
 for a while and

3030
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:08,400
 learning about that and

3031
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:12,719
 she's like what are you doing i'm like i'm listening to podcasts about decis and

3032
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:16,199
 she's like what's that like you know ductal cancer in c2

3033
02:12:16,199 --> 02:12:17,639
 she's like okay

3034
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:22,500
 and so you know i so i have time to continue to just constantly learning

3035
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:25,500
 learning putting stuff in my memory banks to

3036
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:29,159
 organize into something and that's like a that's a week

3037
02:12:29,159 --> 02:12:32,520
 but then in these fixed moments of time

3038
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:35,639
 phone down everything down we go on vacation you know

3039
02:12:35,639 --> 02:12:39,900
 we go on a boat we go to whatever where it's just us and the kids

3040
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:42,540
 is there a structure when you're at work is

3041
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:46,440
 there instructed to your day in terms of meetings in terms of south side of wednesday

3042
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:47,159
 you

3043
02:12:47,159 --> 02:12:51,000
 know because you're having to keep meetings to less than 30 minutes

3044
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,199
 have to

3045
02:12:52,199 --> 02:12:52,860
 and

3046
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:53,820
 you know oftentimes

3047
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:54,239
 meetings

3048
02:12:54,239 --> 02:12:57,599
 can be as short as like 10 or 15 minutes because then i'm just like okay

3049
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:00,199
 because i'm trying to reinforce

3050
02:13:00,199 --> 02:13:01,199
 that

3051
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:05,460
 it's very rare that we all have something really important to say

3052
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:10,860
 and so the ritual that is becomes really valuable to get scale

3053
02:13:10,860 --> 02:13:13,980
 is not the ritual of meetings but the ritual of respecting

3054
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:17,280
 the collective time of the unit

3055
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:17,820
 and

3056
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:19,020
 so it's like you know what folks

3057
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:19,800
 i'm going to assume

3058
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,179
 that you guys are also tackling

3059
02:13:21,179 --> 02:13:21,840
 really important

3060
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:22,260
 projects

3061
02:13:22,260 --> 02:13:23,099
 you

3062
02:13:23,099 --> 02:13:24,420
 also want to have good boundaries

3063
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:28,260
 in this immersion go back to your kids and have dinner with them every night it's

3064
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:30,420
 not just for me it's for you so how about this why

3065
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:31,860
 don't you go and do your work this

3066
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:35,340
 painting didn't need to be 30 minutes it could be five and

3067
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,139
 the rest of the time is yours and and

3068
02:13:37,139 --> 02:13:37,560
 it's

3069
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:39,000
 weird because when people join

3070
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,239
 that system at social capital they just

3071
02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:42,719
 it's

3072
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:45,060
 like face time and it's like let me make sure and

3073
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:46,739
 let me talk a lot so

3074
02:13:46,739 --> 02:13:48,300
 i can't say anything i

3075
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:48,599
 respect

3076
02:13:48,599 --> 02:13:49,139
 the person that

3077
02:13:49,139 --> 02:13:49,380
 says

3078
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:49,800
 nothing for

3079
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:50,280
 two years and

3080
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:52,020
 the first thing that they say is not obvious

3081
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:52,920
 that

3082
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:56,280
 person is immensely more valuable than the person that tries to talk all the time

3083
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:56,880
 what

3084
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,139
 have you learned from your

3085
02:13:58,139 --> 02:13:59,460
 um so after facebook you

3086
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:01,380
 started social capital or what what is

3087
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:03,300
 now called social capital what

3088
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:05,639
 have you learned from all

3089
02:14:05,639 --> 02:14:09,060
 the successful investing you've done there

3090
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:14,460
 about investing or about life yeah or about running a team if

3091
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:17,040
 i'm very loath to give advice because i think it so

3092
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:18,659
 much of it is situational but

3093
02:14:18,659 --> 02:14:23,639
 my observation is that starting a business is really hard any kind of business

3094
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:26,940
 and most people don't know what they're doing

3095
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:29,760
 and as a result we make enormous

3096
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:30,960
 mistakes

3097
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:34,619
 but i would summarize this and this may be a little heterodoxical

3098
02:14:34,619 --> 02:14:37,260
 i think there are only three kinds of mistakes because

3099
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:40,020
 if we go back to what we said before in the business

3100
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:41,579
 it's just learning

3101
02:14:41,579 --> 02:14:45,960
 you're exploring the dark space to get to the answer faster than other people

3102
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:50,400
 and those the mistakes that you make are three

3103
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:57,360
 or the three kinds of decisions let's say you'll hire somebody and

3104
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:06,659
 they're really really really average but they're a really good person oh yeah you'll hire somebody

3105
02:15:06,659 --> 02:15:10,679
 and they really weren't candid with who they are and

3106
02:15:10,679 --> 02:15:15,659
 their real personality and their morality and their ethics only expose them

3107
02:15:15,659 --> 02:15:18,599
 over a long period of time

3108
02:15:18,599 --> 02:15:22,860
 and then you hire somebody and

3109
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:26,520
 they're not that good

3110
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:30,119
 morally but they're highly performant

3111
02:15:30,119 --> 02:15:33,239
 what do you do with those three things

3112
02:15:33,239 --> 02:15:35,880
 and i think successful companies

3113
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:43,199
 have figured out how to answer those three things because those are the things

3114
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:45,060
 that in my opinion determine

3115
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:48,440
 success and failure so it's basically hiring and you just identified

3116
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:49,440
 three

3117
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:52,139
 failure cases for hiring but very different failure

3118
02:15:52,139 --> 02:15:56,040
 cases and very complicated ones right like the highly performant person who's

3119
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:57,900
 not that great as

3120
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:59,639
 a human being do

3121
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:01,020
 you keep them around well

3122
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:03,960
 a lot of people would air towards keeping that person around what

3123
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:08,460
 is the right answer i don't know it's the context of the situation

3124
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:10,920
 um and the second one is also very tricky

3125
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:11,340
 what

3126
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:13,380
 about if they really turned out that they were just not candid

3127
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:13,560
 with

3128
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:13,679
 who

3129
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:13,860
 they

3130
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:13,980
 are

3131
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:14,099
 and

3132
02:16:14,099 --> 02:16:14,280
 it

3133
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:14,400
 took

3134
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:14,520
 you

3135
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:14,699
 a

3136
02:16:14,699 --> 02:16:14,820
 long

3137
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:14,940
 time

3138
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:15,119
 to

3139
02:16:15,119 --> 02:16:15,239
 figure

3140
02:16:15,239 --> 02:16:15,420
 out

3141
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:15,599
 who

3142
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:15,719
 you

3143
02:16:15,719 --> 02:16:15,900
 were

3144
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:16,500
 these

3145
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:19,920
 are all mistakes of the senior person that's running this organization

3146
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:25,139
 i think if you can learn to manage those situations well

3147
02:16:25,139 --> 02:16:25,800
 those

3148
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:30,300
 are the real edge cases where you can make mistakes that are fatal to a company

3149
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:33,898
 yeah that's what i've learned over 11 and a half years honestly

3150
02:16:33,898 --> 02:16:37,200
 otherwise the business of investing

3151
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:40,799
 i feel that it's like a it's a secret

3152
02:16:40,799 --> 02:16:44,340
 and if you are willing to just keep chipping away

3153
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:46,978
 you'll peel back enough of these you know

3154
02:16:46,978 --> 02:16:47,638
 layers

3155
02:16:47,638 --> 02:16:50,820
 will come off and you'll see if the scales will come off and you'll eventually

3156
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:51,959
 see it i

3157
02:16:51,959 --> 02:16:55,920
 really struggle with maybe you can be my therapist for a little bit well

3158
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:58,859
 that first case which you originally mentioned because

3159
02:16:58,859 --> 02:17:01,799
 i love people i see the good in people i

3160
02:17:01,799 --> 02:17:05,340
 really struggle with just a mediocre performing

3161
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:08,280
 person who's who's a good human being

3162
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:10,379
 that's a tough one

3163
02:17:10,379 --> 02:17:15,959
 i'll let you off the hook yeah i think those are incredibly important and useful people

3164
02:17:15,959 --> 02:17:19,679
 i think that if a company is like a body they

3165
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:22,138
 are like cartilage can you replace cartilage

3166
02:17:22,138 --> 02:17:22,859
 yeah

3167
02:17:22,859 --> 02:17:25,799
 but would you if he didn't have to no

3168
02:17:25,799 --> 02:17:31,620
 okay can i can i play devil's advocate yeah so those folks

3169
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:38,340
 because of their goodness make it okay to be mediocre

3170
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:44,398
 they they create a culture where well we what's important in life which

3171
02:17:44,398 --> 02:17:47,040
 is something i agree in my personal life is

3172
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:50,099
 to be good to each other to be friendly to be good

3173
02:17:50,099 --> 02:17:51,898
 vibes all that kind of stuff you

3174
02:17:51,898 --> 02:17:52,439
 know when i was at

3175
02:17:52,439 --> 02:17:59,160
 google just like the good atmosphere everyone's playing and just it's fun fun right

3176
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:01,620
 um but to me

3177
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:02,218
 like

3178
02:18:02,218 --> 02:18:06,599
 when i when i put on my hat of like having a mission and a goal

3179
02:18:06,599 --> 02:18:07,558
 what

3180
02:18:07,558 --> 02:18:08,519
 i

3181
02:18:08,519 --> 02:18:10,740
 love to see is the superstars

3182
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:15,420
 that shine for some in some way like do something incredible

3183
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:18,200
 and i want everyone

3184
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:19,398
 to

3185
02:18:19,398 --> 02:18:20,398
 also

3186
02:18:20,398 --> 02:18:21,240
 admire

3187
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:25,500
 that those superstars and perhaps not just for the productivity's

3188
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:26,820
 sake or performing

3189
02:18:26,820 --> 02:18:31,019
 or successful company's sake but because that too is

3190
02:18:31,019 --> 02:18:33,780
 an incredible thing that humans are able to accomplish which

3191
02:18:33,780 --> 02:18:37,920
 is shine i hear you but that's not a decision you make meaning you

3192
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:40,679
 get lucky when you have those people in your company

3193
02:18:40,679 --> 02:18:41,280
 that's

3194
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,138
 not the hard part for you the

3195
02:18:43,138 --> 02:18:46,620
 hard part is figuring out what to do with one two and three yeah keep

3196
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:47,280
 demote

3197
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,920
 promote fire what do you do

3198
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:50,459
 and

3199
02:18:50,459 --> 02:18:53,160
 this is why it's all about those three buckets i

3200
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:56,040
 personally believe that folks in that bucket one

3201
02:18:56,040 --> 02:19:00,840
 as long as those folks aren't more than 50 to 60 percent of a company are

3202
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:01,799
 good

3203
02:19:01,799 --> 02:19:03,599
 and they can be managed as

3204
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:04,320
 long as they

3205
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:04,859
 are one

3206
02:19:04,859 --> 02:19:05,760
 to two degrees away

3207
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:06,120
 from

3208
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:08,299
 one of those people that you just mentioned yeah

3209
02:19:08,299 --> 02:19:09,299
 yeah

3210
02:19:09,299 --> 02:19:13,260
 because it's easy then to drag the entire company down if

3211
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:14,820
 they're too far away from

3212
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:15,959
 the lebron james because

3213
02:19:15,959 --> 02:19:16,920
 you don't know what lebron

3214
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:17,580
 james looks

3215
02:19:17,580 --> 02:19:19,138
 and feels and smells and you

3216
02:19:19,138 --> 02:19:19,859
 know so

3217
02:19:19,859 --> 02:19:24,299
 you need that tactile sense of what excellence looks like in front of you

3218
02:19:24,299 --> 02:19:24,840
 a

3219
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:25,260
 great example

3220
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:26,820
 is if you like if you just go on youtube and

3221
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:27,420
 you search these

3222
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:27,959
 clips of how

3223
02:19:27,959 --> 02:19:28,558
 kobe

3224
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:29,879
 bryant's teammates described

3225
02:19:29,879 --> 02:19:30,599
 not

3226
02:19:30,599 --> 02:19:31,978
 kobe

3227
02:19:31,978 --> 02:19:35,218
 but how their own behavior

3228
02:19:35,218 --> 02:19:36,240
 not performance

3229
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:36,840
 because

3230
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:40,439
 there's a bunch of average people that kobe played with this whole career but

3231
02:19:40,439 --> 02:19:43,439
 their behavior changed

3232
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:45,179
 by being somewhat

3233
02:19:45,179 --> 02:19:48,359
 closer to him and i think that's an important psychological

3234
02:19:48,359 --> 02:19:53,399
 thing to note for how you can do reasonably good team construction if

3235
02:19:53,399 --> 02:19:56,160
 you're lucky enough to find those generational talents

3236
02:19:56,160 --> 02:20:00,960
 you have to find a composition of a team that keeps them roughly close

3237
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:03,660
 to enough of the org that way that

3238
02:20:03,660 --> 02:20:05,820
 group of people

3239
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:09,420
 can continue to add value and then you'll have courage to

3240
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:09,960
 fire these

3241
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:11,460
 next two groups of people and

3242
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:14,640
 i think the answer is to fire those two groups of people because

3243
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:17,399
 no matter how good you are that stuff just injects

3244
02:20:17,399 --> 02:20:18,960
 poison into a into

3245
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:19,920
 a living organism

3246
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:23,760
 and that living organism will die when exposed to poison

3247
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:24,359
 so

3248
02:20:24,359 --> 02:20:28,200
 would you invest in a lot of companies you've looked at a lot of companies what

3249
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:30,720
 do you think makes for a good leader so

3250
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:32,939
 we talked about building a team but

3251
02:20:32,939 --> 02:20:36,180
 a good leader for a company what are the qualities

3252
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:37,439
 you know i

3253
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:39,720
 um when i first meet people

3254
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:43,020
 um i never asked to see a resume

3255
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:44,160
 um

3256
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,500
 and when i'm meeting a company ceo

3257
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:49,680
 for the first time i couldn't care less about the business in

3258
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:51,479
 fact

3259
02:20:51,479 --> 02:20:54,120
 um and i try to take the time

3260
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:56,760
 to let them reveal themselves now

3261
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:59,640
 in this environment you know i'm doing most of the talking but

3262
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:01,800
 if this were the other way around and you were ever raising

3263
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:04,920
 capital and usage math i'd be interested in you looking at this business

3264
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:07,800
 i'd probably say eight to ten words

3265
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:10,800
 for hours and just listen prod you

3266
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:14,399
 know i throw things out prod and let you meander and

3267
02:21:14,399 --> 02:21:19,560
 in you meandering i'm trying to build a sense of who this person is once

3268
02:21:19,560 --> 02:21:21,660
 i have a rough sense of that which

3269
02:21:21,660 --> 02:21:25,800
 is not necessarily right but it's a starting point

3270
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:28,439
 then i can go and understand why

3271
02:21:28,439 --> 02:21:29,340
 this

3272
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:31,920
 idea makes sense in this moment and

3273
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:34,920
 what i'm really trying to do is just kind of like unpack

3274
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:37,020
 where are the biases that

3275
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:40,140
 may make you you know fail

3276
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:43,560
 and then we go back to you

3277
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:44,700
 the thing that silicon

3278
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:45,479
 valley has

3279
02:21:45,479 --> 02:21:48,720
 the benefit of though is that they don't have to do any of this stuff

3280
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:51,899
 if there's momentum because then the

3281
02:21:51,899 --> 02:21:55,140
 rule book goes out the window and people clamor to invest so

3282
02:21:55,140 --> 02:21:57,240
 one of the things that i do

3283
02:21:57,240 --> 02:22:01,859
 and this is again back to this pugilism that i inflict on myself

3284
02:22:01,859 --> 02:22:05,160
 is i have these two things that i look at thing

3285
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:06,420
 number one is

3286
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:08,100
 i have a table that

3287
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:08,939
 says

3288
02:22:08,939 --> 02:22:11,460
 how much did we make from all of our best investments

3289
02:22:11,460 --> 02:22:12,060
 how

3290
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:15,000
 much did we lose from all of our worst investments what

3291
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:18,319
 is the ratio of winners to losers over 11 years

3292
02:22:18,319 --> 02:22:19,319
 and

3293
02:22:19,319 --> 02:22:21,420
 in our case it's 23 to 1.

3294
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:25,439
 on you know billions of dollars so you can you can kind of like you

3295
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:27,300
 can see a lot of signal

3296
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:32,899
 but what that allows me to do is really like say wait a minute like

3297
02:22:32,899 --> 02:22:33,899
 we

3298
02:22:33,899 --> 02:22:36,000
 cannot violate these

3299
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,800
 rules around how

3300
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:41,939
 much money we're willing to commit in an errant personality you

3301
02:22:41,939 --> 02:22:42,899
 know the

3302
02:22:42,899 --> 02:22:44,460
 second is i ask myself of

3303
02:22:44,460 --> 02:22:48,780
 all the other top vcs in silicon valley name them all you know

3304
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:51,600
 um what's our correlation meaning

3305
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:53,399
 when i do a deal how

3306
02:22:53,399 --> 02:22:57,840
 often does anybody from sequoia excel benchmark kleiner who you name it

3307
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:00,300
 do it at the same time or after

3308
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:01,979
 and vice versa

3309
02:23:01,979 --> 02:23:02,520
 and

3310
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:03,240
 then then

3311
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:06,720
 i look at the data to see how much they do it amongst themselves

3312
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:09,840
 what's a good sign i'm at zero as

3313
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:13,260
 virtually close to zero as possible that's a good thing well

3314
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:19,020
 it's not a good thing when the markets are way way up because it creates

3315
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:19,740
 an

3316
02:23:19,740 --> 02:23:23,280
 enormous amount of momentum so i have to make money the hard way

3317
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:23,819
 i

3318
02:23:23,819 --> 02:23:27,720
 have to you know because i'm trafficking and things that are highly uncorrelated

3319
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:33,359
 to the the gestalt of silicon valley which can be a lonely business

3320
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:37,560
 but it's really valuable in moments where markets get crushed because correlation

3321
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:42,780
 is the first thing that causes massive destruction of of capital massive

3322
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:47,880
 because one person all of a sudden with one blow up in one company boom

3323
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:50,040
 the contagion hits everybody except

3324
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:53,520
 the person that was you know not and so now

3325
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:58,859
 those are like more sophisticated elements of risk management which is again this pugilism

3326
02:23:58,859 --> 02:24:00,600
 that i inflict on my nobody asks

3327
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:01,620
 me to do that nobody

3328
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:02,399
 actually at

3329
02:24:02,399 --> 02:24:04,800
 some level when the markets are up really care that

3330
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:08,399
 when markets are sideways or when markets are down i think that

3331
02:24:08,399 --> 02:24:11,340
 that allows me to feel proud of our process

3332
02:24:11,340 --> 02:24:14,280
 you know but that requires you to think a

3333
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:19,680
 lot a lot outside the box it's lonely because you're taking risks also your

3334
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:22,319
 public personality so you say stuff that

3335
02:24:22,319 --> 02:24:26,160
 if it's wrong you get yelled at for constantly for

3336
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:32,640
 for being i mean your mistakes aren't private no and that's something that

3337
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,979
 um has been a really really healthy

3338
02:24:34,979 --> 02:24:36,660
 moment of growth

3339
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:39,420
 it's like an athlete you know

3340
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:43,319
 if you really want to be a winner you got to hit the shot

3341
02:24:43,319 --> 02:24:45,720
 in front of the fans

3342
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:47,460
 and if you miss it you

3343
02:24:47,460 --> 02:24:49,500
 have to be willing to take the responsibility

3344
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:52,140
 of the fact that you bricked it

3345
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:52,680
 and

3346
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:53,760
 over time hopefully

3347
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,260
 there's a body of work that

3348
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:55,920
 says you've

3349
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:58,319
 generally hit more than you've missed

3350
02:24:58,319 --> 02:25:02,460
 but if you look at even the best shooters what are they 52 percent

3351
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:06,180
 so these are razor thin margins at the end of the day which

3352
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:08,819
 is really so then what can you control

3353
02:25:08,819 --> 02:25:13,260
 i can't control the defense i can't control what they throw up me i

3354
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:14,460
 can just control my preparation

3355
02:25:14,460 --> 02:25:16,200
 and whether i'm in the best position to

3356
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:18,600
 launch a reasonable shot

3357
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:24,660
 you said that the world's first trillionaire would be somebody in climate change in the past

3358
02:25:24,660 --> 02:25:26,819
 um let's update that what's

3359
02:25:26,819 --> 02:25:30,660
 today as we stand here today what sector will the world's first trillionaire

3360
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:33,600
 come from yeah i think it's energy transition so

3361
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:36,420
 energy so the things we've been talking about yeah really

3362
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:39,780
 so isn't it okay well i think i think the way that i think about so

3363
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:43,319
 this is a single division it's hard to interrupt you see their

3364
02:25:43,319 --> 02:25:46,439
 ability to actually build a company that makes huge

3365
02:25:46,439 --> 02:25:47,760
 amount of money as

3366
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:49,020
 opposed to this distributed

3367
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:52,439
 idea that you've been talking about yeah i'll give you my philosophy

3368
02:25:52,439 --> 02:25:54,840
 on wealth

3369
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:58,859
 um most of it is not you

3370
02:25:58,859 --> 02:26:01,260
 um an enormous amount of it is

3371
02:26:01,260 --> 02:26:05,340
 the genetic distribution of being born in the right place and blah blah irrespective

3372
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:08,460
 of the boundary conditions of how you were born or

3373
02:26:08,460 --> 02:26:10,800
 where you were raised right so you

3374
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:12,120
 know at the end of the day you and i ended

3375
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:12,780
 up in the united states

3376
02:26:12,780 --> 02:26:13,680
 it's

3377
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:16,020
 a huge benefit to us

3378
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:19,260
 second is the benefit of our age

3379
02:26:19,260 --> 02:26:20,880
 it's much better and

3380
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:24,720
 much more likely to be successful as a 46 year old in 2023 than

3381
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:26,880
 a 26 year old in 2023

3382
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:27,660
 because

3383
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:30,120
 in my case i have demographics

3384
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:31,979
 working for me

3385
02:26:31,979 --> 02:26:33,960
 with a 26 year old he

3386
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:34,979
 or she has demographics

3387
02:26:34,979 --> 02:26:37,920
 working slightly against them can you explain that a little bit what

3388
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:39,660
 are the demographics here

3389
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:42,600
 in the case of me

3390
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:43,920
 the

3391
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:47,460
 distribution of population in america looks like a pyramid

3392
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:49,859
 and in that pyramid

3393
02:26:49,859 --> 02:26:53,880
 i'm swedged in between these two massive population cohorts

3394
02:26:53,880 --> 02:26:58,319
 the boomers and then these you know gen z and millennials

3395
02:26:58,319 --> 02:27:00,000
 um and that's a very advantageous

3396
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:04,080
 position it's not dissimilar to the position that buffett was where he was you

3397
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:05,399
 know packaged

3398
02:27:05,399 --> 02:27:10,080
 in between boomers beneath him and the silent generation above him and

3399
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:13,020
 being in between two massive population cohorts

3400
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:16,020
 turns out to be extremely advantageous because when

3401
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:21,000
 the cohort above you transitions power and capital and all of this stuff you're

3402
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,540
 the next person that likely gets handed it so we have a disproportionate

3403
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:29,819
 likelihood to be you know we are lucky to be older than younger

3404
02:27:29,819 --> 02:27:31,380
 um so that's that's an advantage

3405
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:32,640
 and then the other advantage

3406
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:34,500
 that has nothing to do with me

3407
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:36,420
 is that i stumbled into technology

3408
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:37,859
 i got a degree in electrical

3409
02:27:37,859 --> 02:27:40,740
 engineering and i ended up coming to silicon valley

3410
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:41,280
 and

3411
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:45,420
 it turned out that in that moment it was such a transformational wind of change that

3412
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:48,540
 was at my back right so

3413
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:51,960
 the wealth that one creates is

3414
02:27:51,960 --> 02:27:59,460
 a huge part of those variables and then the last variable is your direct contributions

3415
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:03,359
 in that moment and the reason why

3416
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:12,780
 that can create extreme wealth is because when those things come together at the right moment

3417
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:18,080
 it's like a chemical reaction i mean it's just crazy so

3418
02:28:18,359 --> 02:28:21,540
 that was sort of part number one of what i wanted to say the

3419
02:28:21,540 --> 02:28:23,520
 second thing is when you look then inside

3420
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:26,340
 of these systems where you have all these tailwinds

3421
02:28:26,340 --> 02:28:31,020
 right so in tech i think i benefit from these three big tail ones

3422
02:28:31,020 --> 02:28:31,439
 if

3423
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:35,760
 you build the company or are part of a company or a part of a movement

3424
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:38,760
 your economic participation

3425
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:42,380
 tends to be a direct byproduct

3426
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:48,740
 of the actual value that that thing creates in the world

3427
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:54,479
 and that the thing that that creates in the world will be bigger

3428
02:28:54,479 --> 02:29:00,720
 if it is not just an economic system but it's like a philosophical system

3429
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:04,200
 it changes the way the governance happens it changes the way that people think

3430
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:06,780
 about all kinds of other things about their lives

3431
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:09,120
 so there's a reason

3432
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:14,819
 i think why database companies are worth acts social companies are worth why but

3433
02:29:14,819 --> 02:29:18,960
 the military industrial complex is worth you know as much

3434
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:21,720
 and i think there's a reason why that

3435
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:25,020
 if you for example were to go off and build some

3436
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:25,740
 newfangled

3437
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:29,340
 source of energy that's clean and hyper abundant

3438
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:31,020
 and safe

3439
02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:33,720
 that what you're really going to displace

3440
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:35,580
 or reshape is trillions

3441
02:29:35,580 --> 02:29:39,780
 and trillions of dollars of worldwide gdp so the global gdp is

3442
02:29:39,780 --> 02:29:43,620
 i call it 85 trillion right it's going at two to three percent a year

3443
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:48,240
 so in the next 10 years we'll be dealing with a hundred trillion dollars of gdp

3444
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:52,620
 right somebody who develops clean energy in 2035

3445
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:59,660
 will probably shift 10 of that around 10 trillion dollars

3446
02:29:59,819 --> 02:30:05,760
 a company can easily capture thirty percent of a market three trillion dollars

3447
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:11,760
 a human being can typically own a third of one of these companies one trillion dollars

3448
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:12,180
 so

3449
02:30:12,180 --> 02:30:13,859
 you can kind of get to this answer where

3450
02:30:13,859 --> 02:30:14,700
 it's like it's

3451
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:17,399
 going to happen in our lifetime

3452
02:30:17,399 --> 02:30:21,420
 but you have to i think find these systems that are so gargantuan

3453
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:23,700
 and they exist today

3454
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:27,540
 it's more bounded because price discovery takes longer and

3455
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:29,040
 an existing thing it's more unbounded

3456
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,020
 because you know what it is you know the tentacles

3457
02:30:31,020 --> 02:30:32,580
 that energy reaches

3458
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:35,880
 right of that 80 trillion dollars of worldwide gdp i

3459
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:37,680
 bet you if you added up all the energy companies

3460
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:38,280
 but

3461
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:40,620
 then you added up all of manufacturing

3462
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:43,319
 you know if you added up all of transport you'd

3463
02:30:43,319 --> 02:30:46,200
 probably get to like 60 of the 80.

3464
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:50,100
 do you have an idea of which energy

3465
02:30:50,100 --> 02:30:57,200
 which alternate energy sustainable energy is the most promising well i think that we

3466
02:30:57,200 --> 02:31:00,660
 have to do a better job of exploring

3467
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:04,560
 what i call the suburbs of the periodic table

3468
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:05,340
 so

3469
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:09,540
 you know we're really good in seattle you know the upper northwest yes

3470
02:31:09,540 --> 02:31:11,939
 you know we're kind of good in portland

3471
02:31:11,939 --> 02:31:16,620
 but we're not existent in san diego and we have zero plan for

3472
02:31:16,620 --> 02:31:18,600
 north carolina through florida

3473
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:20,819
 yeah and so is

3474
02:31:20,819 --> 02:31:24,600
 that a fancy way of saying nuclear is should be part of the discussion

3475
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:28,979
 i think nuclear i think room temperature semiconductors

3476
02:31:28,979 --> 02:31:29,640
 i'm

3477
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:33,660
 i'm not convinced right now that the existing set of nuclear solutions will

3478
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:36,060
 do a good job of scaling beyond bench scale i

3479
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:37,680
 think there is a lot of complicated technical

3480
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:38,160
 problems

3481
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:38,939
 that make

3482
02:31:38,939 --> 02:31:43,200
 it work at a bench scale level even partially but the energy equation

3483
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:45,660
 is going to be very difficult to overcome in the absence

3484
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:46,439
 of some leaps

3485
02:31:46,439 --> 02:31:47,880
 in material science

3486
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:48,540
 have

3487
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:49,800
 you seen any leaps

3488
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:50,819
 is there promising

3489
02:31:50,819 --> 02:31:51,600
 stuff like you're

3490
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:53,939
 you're seeing the cutting edge from a company perspective

3491
02:31:53,939 --> 02:31:54,840
 yeah i

3492
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:56,280
 would say not yet i

3493
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:57,600
 do but the precursor

3494
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:58,620
 yes i

3495
02:31:58,620 --> 02:32:00,420
 have been spending a

3496
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:05,580
 fair amount of time so talking about like a new framework that's in my mind is

3497
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:09,420
 around these room temp superconductors

3498
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:13,560
 um and so i've been kind of bumbling around in that forest

3499
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:15,439
 for about a year

3500
02:32:15,439 --> 02:32:16,439
 i

3501
02:32:16,439 --> 02:32:18,600
 haven't really put together any

3502
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:21,960
 meaningful perspectives but again talking about like trafficking

3503
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:28,620
 in in companies and investments that are very lonely but they allow me to generate returns

3504
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:30,899
 that are relatively unique and independent

3505
02:32:30,899 --> 02:32:31,380
 that's

3506
02:32:31,380 --> 02:32:33,899
 an area where i don't see anybody else when i'm there i'll

3507
02:32:33,899 --> 02:32:35,580
 give you another area

3508
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:37,680
 you know we

3509
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:41,819
 um i think are about to unleash in a world of zero energy and and

3510
02:32:41,819 --> 02:32:45,080
 zero compute costs

3511
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:49,319
 computational biology will replace white chemistry

3512
02:32:49,319 --> 02:32:54,120
 and when you do that you will be able to iterate on tools

3513
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:57,540
 that will be able to solve a lot of human disease

3514
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:59,939
 i think like if you look at the head

3515
02:32:59,939 --> 02:33:04,200
 of like the top 400 most recurring rare diseases

3516
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:06,479
 i think like half the number 200

3517
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:07,260
 is

3518
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:09,960
 a specific point mutation as

3519
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:12,960
 just the mismethylation between c and t

3520
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:16,080
 i mean that's like whoa wait you're telling me in billions

3521
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:17,700
 of lines of code i

3522
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:19,080
 forgot you know semicolon

3523
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:19,920
 right there that's

3524
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:20,340
 causing

3525
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:21,540
 this the whole thing to miscompile

3526
02:33:21,540 --> 02:33:24,420
 so i just got to go in there and boom and it's all done that's

3527
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:27,120
 a crazy idea that was a c plus plus c

3528
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:33,380
 c throwback for people that don't know there's two people who are two people there everybody

3529
02:33:33,380 --> 02:33:36,359
 it's perfect sense um but but

3530
02:33:36,359 --> 02:33:36,899
 um so

3531
02:33:36,899 --> 02:33:40,680
 that couldn't that be a truly a source of the competition

3532
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:41,460
 biology unlocks

3533
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:42,720
 i mean obviously medicine is

3534
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:43,200
 begging

3535
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:43,979
 for the

3536
02:33:43,979 --> 02:33:45,060
 thing with energy

3537
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:45,540
 though

3538
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:47,460
 is that the groundwork

3539
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:50,040
 is well laid

3540
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:54,120
 um and talking about sort of like the upper bound is well defined

3541
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:58,260
 the upper bound in medicine is not well defined because it is not

3542
02:33:58,260 --> 02:33:58,800
 the

3543
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:01,200
 sum total of the market cap of the pharma industries it

3544
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:05,040
 is actually the sum total of the value of human life

3545
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:09,720
 and that's an extremely ethical and moral question isn't there special

3546
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:12,479
 interests that are resisting

3547
02:34:12,479 --> 02:34:13,380
 moving

3548
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:16,859
 making progress on the energy side so like

3549
02:34:16,859 --> 02:34:17,700
 governments

3550
02:34:17,700 --> 02:34:18,060
 and

3551
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:20,160
 how do you break through that i mean you have to acknowledge

3552
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:20,640
 the reality

3553
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:22,260
 of that i think it's less governments

3554
02:34:22,260 --> 02:34:23,939
 in fact like i said i think president biden

3555
02:34:23,939 --> 02:34:25,020
 has done a

3556
02:34:25,020 --> 02:34:29,399
 really incredible job while chuck schumer really is done a really incredible job because

3557
02:34:29,399 --> 02:34:32,760
 so just to give you the math on this right like back to this so

3558
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:36,060
 three percent of everything is of a market or zealots

3559
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:38,700
 but when you get past five percent things

3560
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:40,020
 tend to just go nuclear

3561
02:34:40,020 --> 02:34:42,680
 to 50 60 percent

3562
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:45,899
 the way that they wrote this last bill

3563
02:34:45,899 --> 02:34:46,859
 the

3564
02:34:46,859 --> 02:34:47,460
 cost

3565
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:50,939
 i'll just use cars as an example the cost of an average car is

3566
02:34:50,939 --> 02:34:52,979
 22 and a half thousand the

3567
02:34:52,979 --> 02:34:56,520
 cost of the cheapest battery car is thirty thousand and

3568
02:34:56,520 --> 02:35:00,180
 lo and behold there's a seventy five hundred dollar credit and it's like to

3569
02:35:00,180 --> 02:35:01,740
 think the invisible hand didn't

3570
02:35:01,740 --> 02:35:03,120
 know that that math was

3571
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:03,780
 right i

3572
02:35:03,780 --> 02:35:05,880
 think is kind of a little bit malarkey

3573
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:06,479
 and

3574
02:35:06,479 --> 02:35:07,319
 so the

3575
02:35:07,319 --> 02:35:07,740
 battery ev

3576
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:08,100
 car

3577
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:09,120
 is going to be the same price

3578
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:09,359
 as

3579
02:35:09,359 --> 02:35:09,600
 the

3580
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:09,899
 thing and

3581
02:35:09,899 --> 02:35:10,800
 it's going to go to 40

3582
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:11,100
 50

3583
02:35:11,100 --> 02:35:12,780
 percent

3584
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:17,640
 um so we're already at this tipping point so we're kind of ready to go

3585
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:18,180
 um

3586
02:35:18,180 --> 02:35:22,500
 in these other markets it's a little bit more complicated because there's a lot of infrastructure

3587
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:24,060
 that needs to get built so you

3588
02:35:24,060 --> 02:35:26,640
 know the the gene editing thing as an example you

3589
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:28,920
 know we have to build a tool chain

3590
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:32,160
 that looks more like

3591
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:36,720
 um code that you can write to facebook is written in i think php originally

3592
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:37,859
 hbo which

3593
02:35:37,859 --> 02:35:38,819
 is i'm

3594
02:35:38,819 --> 02:35:40,560
 still a big fan of sometimes

3595
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:43,500
 you have to use the ugly solution and

3596
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:46,200
 make it look good versus trying

3597
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:48,899
 to come up with a good solution

3598
02:35:48,899 --> 02:35:51,060
 um which will be too late let

3599
02:35:51,060 --> 02:35:56,520
 me ask you you consider a run for governor of california then decided against it what

3600
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:59,460
 went into each of these decisions and

3601
02:35:59,460 --> 02:36:03,420
 broadly i should have maybe a selfish question about silicon

3602
02:36:03,420 --> 02:36:05,660
 valley

3603
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:10,800
 is it over as a world leader for new tech companies

3604
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:15,120
 as a this beacon of promise of

3605
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:19,680
 young minds stepping in and creating something that changes the world

3606
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:22,560
 i don't know if those two questions are connected so

3607
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:24,780
 it's not it's not over but

3608
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:26,760
 i think it's definitely

3609
02:36:26,760 --> 02:36:29,580
 we're in a challenging moment

3610
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:32,180
 because

3611
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:36,600
 so back to that analogy of the demographics if

3612
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:40,620
 you think about the like if you bucketed forget like our

3613
02:36:40,620 --> 02:36:42,180
 relative successes

3614
02:36:42,180 --> 02:36:45,060
 but there's a bunch of us in this

3615
02:36:45,060 --> 02:36:49,260
 mid 50s to mid 30s cohort of people that

3616
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:50,580
 have now been around you

3617
02:36:50,580 --> 02:36:54,960
 know for 20 years 15 years to 25 years that have done stuff right

3618
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:58,260
 from andreessen to zoc to jack dorsey

3619
02:36:58,260 --> 02:37:05,040
 etc elon you know whatever maybe you throw me in the mix david sacks whatever okay

3620
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:11,100
 none of us have done a really good job of becoming a statesman

3621
02:37:11,100 --> 02:37:13,439
 um or a states woman you know

3622
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:21,180
 um and really showing a broad empathy and awareness for the broader systems

3623
02:37:21,180 --> 02:37:24,180
 so silicon valley is to survive as a system

3624
02:37:24,180 --> 02:37:27,840
 we need to know that we've transitioned from move fast and break things to

3625
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:28,560
 get

3626
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:31,740
 to the right answer and take your time if that's what it means

3627
02:37:31,740 --> 02:37:35,040
 and so we have to be a participant of the system

3628
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:38,399
 and i believe that and i think that it's important to

3629
02:37:38,399 --> 02:37:42,960
 not be a dilettante and not be thumbing your face to washington

3630
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:43,680
 or

3631
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:48,300
 not push the boundaries and say you know we'll deal with it after the fact but

3632
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:51,600
 to work with folks that are trying to do the best again

3633
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:53,700
 steel man their point of view

3634
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:55,800
 you know work with them potentially

3635
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:57,000
 run for office so

3636
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,580
 potentially like be you know understand

3637
02:37:59,580 --> 02:38:02,280
 the system it makes me

3638
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:03,899
 sad that there's no

3639
02:38:03,899 --> 02:38:04,620
 tech

3640
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:10,500
 people or not many tech people in congress and certainly not in the presidential level not

3641
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:12,899
 many governors or senators well

3642
02:38:12,899 --> 02:38:15,000
 i think that we also have roughly

3643
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:16,859
 you know our rules will

3644
02:38:16,859 --> 02:38:17,460
 never allow

3645
02:38:17,460 --> 02:38:19,920
 some of the best and brightest folks to run for president because

3646
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:20,939
 of just the rules

3647
02:38:20,939 --> 02:38:22,680
 against it but you know if

3648
02:38:22,680 --> 02:38:26,100
 if oh you mean yeah yeah i mean like more than this i think david sacks

3649
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:27,420
 would be an incredible presidential

3650
02:38:27,420 --> 02:38:28,800
 candidate now i

3651
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:32,100
 also think he'd be a great governor no he was born in south africa

3652
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:35,880
 you know i think he'd be a great governor i think he'd be a great

3653
02:38:35,880 --> 02:38:39,359
 um secretary of state i mean he'd be great at whatever he wanted to do

3654
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:43,080
 um you know friedberg you know wasn't born here

3655
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:46,680
 um so there's there's a lot of people that could contribute at

3656
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:49,380
 different levels and i hope that

3657
02:38:49,380 --> 02:38:51,780
 by the way the other thing i like about the pod is like i

3658
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:52,859
 also think it helps normalize

3659
02:38:52,859 --> 02:38:54,359
 tech a little bit because

3660
02:38:54,359 --> 02:38:56,700
 you just see like normal people dealing

3661
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:59,100
 with normal situations

3662
02:38:59,100 --> 02:38:59,700
 um and

3663
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:01,200
 i think that that's good you

3664
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:04,680
 know it is a really normative place it's not the caricature

3665
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:06,540
 that it's made out to be but there

3666
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:10,319
 is a small virul and strain of people that make it caricature-like

3667
02:39:10,319 --> 02:39:14,580
 with this in one direction what do you think about the whole

3668
02:39:14,580 --> 02:39:16,140
 culture of

3669
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:21,780
 um i don't know if better turns but woke activism so sort of activism

3670
02:39:21,780 --> 02:39:22,319
 which

3671
02:39:22,319 --> 02:39:25,380
 in some contexts is a powerful and important thing but infiltrating

3672
02:39:25,380 --> 02:39:25,979
 companies

3673
02:39:25,979 --> 02:39:26,520
 i'll

3674
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:28,020
 answer this in the context of renee

3675
02:39:28,020 --> 02:39:29,100
 gerard so like he

3676
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:30,600
 says that people tend to copy

3677
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:31,680
 each other

3678
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:32,280
 and

3679
02:39:32,280 --> 02:39:32,939
 then when

3680
02:39:32,939 --> 02:39:33,540
 they're copying

3681
02:39:33,540 --> 02:39:34,260
 each other they're

3682
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:36,600
 really what they're fighting what they're doing is they're fighting over some

3683
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:37,020
 scarce

3684
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:38,700
 resource

3685
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:43,740
 and then you find a way to organize against you know the group of you

3686
02:39:43,740 --> 02:39:44,340
 against

3687
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:44,700
 a

3688
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:45,240
 person or

3689
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:46,439
 a thing that you think is the

3690
02:39:46,439 --> 02:39:46,680
 actual

3691
02:39:46,680 --> 02:39:46,979
 cause

3692
02:39:46,979 --> 02:39:47,939
 of all of this conflict

3693
02:39:47,939 --> 02:39:48,899
 and you try to expel

3694
02:39:48,899 --> 02:39:49,859
 them

3695
02:39:49,859 --> 02:39:52,800
 the thing that wokeism doesn't understand

3696
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:58,800
 is that unless that person is truly to blame the cycle just continues

3697
02:39:58,800 --> 02:39:59,520
 and

3698
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:01,380
 you know that was a that

3699
02:40:01,380 --> 02:40:02,280
 was a framework

3700
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:05,160
 that he developed that you know he's really conclusively

3701
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:09,840
 proven to be true and it's observable in humanity in life

3702
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:15,600
 so these movements i think the extreme left and the extreme right

3703
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:23,220
 are trying to interpret away to allow people to compete for some scarce resource

3704
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:23,760
 but

3705
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:26,340
 i also think that in all of that what they don't realize

3706
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:28,020
 is that they can scapegoat

3707
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:29,520
 whoever they want but

3708
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:31,500
 it's not going to work because the

3709
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:34,439
 the bull work of people in the middle realize

3710
02:40:34,439 --> 02:40:37,020
 that it's just not true

3711
02:40:37,020 --> 02:40:38,340
 yeah they realize

3712
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:40,740
 but they're still because in leadership positions

3713
02:40:40,740 --> 02:40:41,819
 there's still momentum

3714
02:40:41,819 --> 02:40:43,800
 and they still scapegoat

3715
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:45,359
 and they continue

3716
02:40:45,359 --> 02:40:50,640
 and it seems to hurt the actual ability is more successful in

3717
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:54,000
 fairness though if you had to graph the effectiveness of that function it's

3718
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,740
 decaying rapidly it's

3719
02:40:55,740 --> 02:40:57,840
 the least effective it's ever been you're

3720
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:01,680
 absolutely right being canceled five years ago was a huge deal

3721
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:05,760
 today i think it was jordan peterson on your podcast he

3722
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:08,280
 said i've been canceled and it was amazing he said 38

3723
02:41:08,280 --> 02:41:11,939
 times or 40 he said some number which was a ginormous number a

3724
02:41:11,939 --> 02:41:14,520
 that he kept account of it and b was able to classify

3725
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:15,960
 it yeah i'm like what classifier

3726
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:17,460
 is going on in his mind where

3727
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:18,300
 he's like ah

3728
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:21,240
 that's an attempt to cancel me but this one is not but my point is

3729
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:23,520
 was clearly not working

3730
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:24,060
 and

3731
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:24,660
 so the guy

3732
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:28,319
 is still there and the guy is you know putting his view out into the world

3733
02:41:28,319 --> 02:41:28,740
 um and

3734
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:29,700
 so it's not what

3735
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:30,780
 not to judge whether what

3736
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:32,280
 he says is right or wrong

3737
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:36,960
 it's just to observe that this mechanism mechanism of action is now weakened but

3738
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:41,580
 it's weakened because it's not the thing that people think is really to blame yeah

3739
02:41:41,580 --> 02:41:42,240
 you've

3740
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:43,319
 been canceled on

3741
02:41:43,319 --> 02:41:45,600
 a small scale a few times so let's not i'm

3742
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:47,100
 sure it didn't feel small actually

3743
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:51,540
 it wasn't small i'm trying to minimize

3744
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:54,720
 did that did that psychologically hurt you yeah

3745
02:41:54,720 --> 02:41:59,100
 it was tough i mean in the moment you don't know what's going on but

3746
02:41:59,100 --> 02:42:02,280
 i would like to thank a certain ceo of

3747
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:04,859
 a certain well-known company

3748
02:42:04,859 --> 02:42:07,859
 and he sent me

3749
02:42:07,859 --> 02:42:10,740
 basically like a step-by-step

3750
02:42:10,740 --> 02:42:13,260
 manual

3751
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:16,859
 and does it involve mushrooms no no and

3752
02:42:16,859 --> 02:42:18,660
 and he was right

3753
02:42:18,660 --> 02:42:20,040
 you know the

3754
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:22,439
 storm passed and life went on is

3755
02:42:22,439 --> 02:42:23,220
 it

3756
02:42:23,220 --> 02:42:25,319
 i don't know if you can share the the list

3757
02:42:25,319 --> 02:42:27,660
 of steps but is the fundamental core idea

3758
02:42:27,660 --> 02:42:28,620
 is that just

3759
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:29,220
 life

3760
02:42:29,220 --> 02:42:30,240
 goes on

3761
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:30,960
 the

3762
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:34,920
 the core fundamental idea is like you need to be willing

3763
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:38,220
 and able to apologize

3764
02:42:38,220 --> 02:42:43,200
 for what is in your control but not for other people's mistakes

3765
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:46,979
 your mistakes yes and if you feel like there's something then

3766
02:42:46,979 --> 02:42:48,359
 you should take accountability

3767
02:42:48,359 --> 02:42:49,500
 of that

3768
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:53,220
 but to apologize for somebody else for

3769
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:55,640
 something that they want to hear

3770
02:42:55,640 --> 02:42:56,640
 isn't

3771
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:57,899
 going to solve anything

3772
02:42:57,899 --> 02:42:59,819
 yeah there's something about apologies

3773
02:42:59,819 --> 02:43:02,460
 if you do them they should be authentic

3774
02:43:02,460 --> 02:43:04,859
 to what you actually want to say versus

3775
02:43:04,859 --> 02:43:07,859
 what somebody else needs to wants to hear

3776
02:43:07,859 --> 02:43:08,580
 otherwise

3777
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:10,260
 it doesn't ring true yeah

3778
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:13,740
 and people can see through that and people can see through it and also what

3779
02:43:13,740 --> 02:43:16,020
 people see through is not just the fact that you

3780
02:43:16,020 --> 02:43:16,500
 know your

3781
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:17,760
 apology was somewhat hollow

3782
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:18,359
 but

3783
02:43:18,359 --> 02:43:22,319
 also that this entire majority of people now walked away the mob was like okay thanks

3784
02:43:22,319 --> 02:43:27,000
 yeah and then people are like also you didn't care at all this is like

3785
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:32,399
 and so then it reflects more broadly on them yeah

3786
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:33,000
 i

3787
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,040
 know you said you don't like to give advice but

3788
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:37,520
 what advice would you give to a young person

3789
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:38,520
 you've

3790
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:43,620
 lived an incredible life from very humble beginnings difficult childhood and

3791
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:47,160
 you're one of the most successful people in the world so what advice i

3792
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:50,479
 mean a lot of people look to you for inspiration

3793
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:56,340
 kids in high school or early college they're not doing good or

3794
02:43:56,340 --> 02:44:00,600
 um are trying to figure out basically

3795
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:07,700
 what to do when they have complete doubt in themselves what advice would you give them

3796
02:44:12,420 --> 02:44:16,020
 it is really important that if somebody

3797
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:16,439
 that

3798
02:44:16,439 --> 02:44:18,000
 you respect and i'm gonna just

3799
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:23,160
 for the purpose of this put myself in that bucket and if you're listening to this

3800
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:26,939
 um i wish somebody had told this to me

3801
02:44:26,939 --> 02:44:30,200
 um we are all equal

3802
02:44:30,540 --> 02:44:32,160
 and you

3803
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:36,840
 will fight this demon inside you that says you are less than a

3804
02:44:36,840 --> 02:44:38,580
 lot of other people

3805
02:44:38,580 --> 02:44:43,380
 for reasons that will be hard to see until you're much much older

3806
02:44:43,380 --> 02:44:47,280
 and so you have to find

3807
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:52,020
 either a set of people far far away like what i did

3808
02:44:52,020 --> 02:44:58,260
 or one or two people really really close to you or maybe it's both

3809
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:03,660
 that will remind you in key moments of your life that that is true otherwise

3810
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:08,160
 you will give in to that beast

3811
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:09,120
 and

3812
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:09,840
 it's

3813
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:11,280
 not the end of the world and

3814
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:15,540
 you'll recover from it i've made a lot of mistakes

3815
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:18,180
 but it requires a lot of energy

3816
02:45:18,180 --> 02:45:22,920
 and sometimes it's just easier to just stop and give up

3817
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:23,520
 so

3818
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:25,740
 i think that if you're starting out in the world if

3819
02:45:25,740 --> 02:45:29,220
 you've been lucky to have a wonderful life and you had wonderful parents

3820
02:45:29,220 --> 02:45:29,819
 man

3821
02:45:29,819 --> 02:45:30,060
 you

3822
02:45:30,060 --> 02:45:31,439
 should go and give them a huge hug because

3823
02:45:31,439 --> 02:45:31,680
 they

3824
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:32,100
 did use

3825
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:32,399
 such

3826
02:45:32,399 --> 02:45:32,760
 a service

3827
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:33,479
 that

3828
02:45:33,479 --> 02:45:36,540
 most folks don't do to most kids unfortunately

3829
02:45:36,540 --> 02:45:39,420
 and it's not the fault of these parents

3830
02:45:39,420 --> 02:45:42,300
 but it's just tough life is tough

3831
02:45:42,300 --> 02:45:43,859
 so give him a kiss

3832
02:45:43,859 --> 02:45:47,399
 and then figure out a way where you can just do work that validates

3833
02:45:47,399 --> 02:45:50,880
 you and where you feel like you're developing some kind of mastery

3834
02:45:50,880 --> 02:45:51,540
 who

3835
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:53,760
 cares what anybody else thinks about it

3836
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:54,180
 just

3837
02:45:54,180 --> 02:45:57,420
 do it because it feels good do it because you like to get good at something

3838
02:45:57,420 --> 02:46:01,580
 but if you're not one of those lucky people

3839
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:05,700
 um you can believe in your friends or you can just believe in me

3840
02:46:05,700 --> 02:46:08,280
 i'm telling you preserve optionality

3841
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:12,000
 how you do that is by regulating

3842
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:15,620
 um your reactions to things

3843
02:46:15,660 --> 02:46:16,200
 and

3844
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:16,979
 your reactions

3845
02:46:16,979 --> 02:46:18,540
 are going to be largely guided

3846
02:46:18,540 --> 02:46:22,020
 in moments where you think that you are not the same as everybody else and

3847
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:25,260
 specifically that you are less than those people and you're not

3848
02:46:25,260 --> 02:46:27,060
 so just save

3849
02:46:27,060 --> 02:46:33,120
 this part of this podcast and just play it on a loop if you need to

3850
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:36,840
 um but that is my biggest learning is i am equal

3851
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:39,840
 i'm the same as all these other people and

3852
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:41,040
 you can imagine what

3853
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:43,859
 that means to me to go out in the world to see people and think okay

3854
02:46:43,859 --> 02:46:45,600
 i'm the same as this person i'm i'm as

3855
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:47,160
 good as them

3856
02:46:47,160 --> 02:46:51,720
 and you could imagine what you're probably thinking of what i'm thinking is not that thing

3857
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:56,399
 right you're probably thinking man this guy yeah this guy i'm so much better no

3858
02:46:56,399 --> 02:46:59,340
 i am fighting this thing

3859
02:46:59,340 --> 02:47:01,380
 all the time

3860
02:47:01,380 --> 02:47:04,979
 well i've also met a bunch of folks who

3861
02:47:04,979 --> 02:47:09,960
 i think is a counter reaction to that once they become successful they

3862
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:16,500
 start developing a philosophy then they are better or even some people are better than others

3863
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:18,420
 i understand you

3864
02:47:18,420 --> 02:47:21,540
 know there's lebron james versus other people and so on but

3865
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:25,020
 i always really resisted that thought

3866
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:27,540
 because i feel like it's a slightly better

3867
02:47:27,540 --> 02:47:31,920
 they have mastery in a thing that they fall in love with yeah

3868
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:35,700
 i'm trying to develop mastery in a thing that i love

3869
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:39,780
 you know i love the art i love investing it's like solving puzzles

3870
02:47:39,780 --> 02:47:45,780
 and i love that i love trying to develop mastery and poker i really love that

3871
02:47:45,780 --> 02:47:46,260
 um i'm

3872
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:46,620
 learning

3873
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:48,120
 how to be a parent to a teenager

3874
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:50,160
 because i have finally have one

3875
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:53,460
 it's all new stuff to me and i'm learning

3876
02:47:53,460 --> 02:47:55,020
 um

3877
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:57,120
 that's what it's all about

3878
02:47:57,120 --> 02:48:00,359
 yeah so you don't want to think you're lesser than and

3879
02:48:00,359 --> 02:48:03,359
 you don't want to think you're better than because those both

3880
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:06,960
 lead you astray i've never thought i was better than i

3881
02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:09,479
 manifested better than

3882
02:48:09,479 --> 02:48:13,140
 because i was trying to compensate for feeling less then

3883
02:48:13,140 --> 02:48:13,680
 my

3884
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:15,780
 goal is just to feel like everybody else feels

3885
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:16,620
 on the presumption

3886
02:48:16,620 --> 02:48:17,399
 that everybody had

3887
02:48:17,399 --> 02:48:19,319
 like a normal life

3888
02:48:19,319 --> 02:48:20,100
 given

3889
02:48:20,100 --> 02:48:23,160
 your nickname is the dictator do you trust yourself with power like

3890
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:24,180
 if i if

3891
02:48:24,180 --> 02:48:27,420
 the world gave you absolute power for a month

3892
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:28,700
 no

3893
02:48:28,700 --> 02:48:29,700
 no

3894
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:33,060
 because i think that you know i'm still riddled with bias i

3895
02:48:33,060 --> 02:48:35,760
 i don't i don't deserve that position i don't and

3896
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:38,819
 i would not want that weight on my shoulders

3897
02:48:38,819 --> 02:48:44,280
 i had a i had a spot naturally where it was a very

3898
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:47,160
 important and big poker game

3899
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:50,520
 and it was a spot where i was in the pot and

3900
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:53,700
 it was a really large pot it was like a million dollar pot

3901
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:54,960
 and

3902
02:48:54,960 --> 02:49:01,260
 i had to make a ruling and the ruling was in in my favor and okay

3903
02:49:01,260 --> 02:49:04,740
 i was just beside myself

3904
02:49:04,740 --> 02:49:05,160
 because

3905
02:49:05,160 --> 02:49:05,819
 i don't

3906
02:49:05,819 --> 02:49:08,160
 play i play for the challenge i like to get pushed

3907
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:09,420
 to the limit of my capabilities

3908
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:09,840
 i

3909
02:49:09,840 --> 02:49:11,340
 want to see

3910
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:12,660
 can i think

3911
02:49:12,660 --> 02:49:14,939
 at the same level of these folks you

3912
02:49:14,939 --> 02:49:18,300
 know because these guys are all experts they're all pros

3913
02:49:18,300 --> 02:49:22,200
 and i get enormous joy from that challenge

3914
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:26,580
 and i like to win but i like to win just a small amount

3915
02:49:26,580 --> 02:49:30,300
 you know what i mean and then i never wanted to win in that way

3916
02:49:30,300 --> 02:49:34,380
 but because it was you know my game i had to make this call

3917
02:49:34,380 --> 02:49:37,380
 on a million dollar pot and i wanted to just

3918
02:49:37,380 --> 02:49:38,819
 shoot myself i

3919
02:49:38,819 --> 02:49:44,100
 just was like this is gross and disgusting and and he was a complete gentleman

3920
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:46,640
 which made it even worse

3921
02:49:46,640 --> 02:49:47,640
 so

3922
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:48,840
 i do not want absolute

3923
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:51,899
 power well those are the people you do want to have power is

3924
02:49:51,899 --> 02:49:54,120
 the ones that don't want it which

3925
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:57,120
 is a a weird system to have because

3926
02:49:57,120 --> 02:50:00,720
 then you in that kind of system don't get the leaders

3927
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:01,500
 that

3928
02:50:01,500 --> 02:50:02,939
 you should have because

3929
02:50:02,939 --> 02:50:05,939
 the ones that one power aren't the ones that should have power it's

3930
02:50:05,939 --> 02:50:06,979
 a weird weird system

3931
02:50:06,979 --> 02:50:07,979
 what

3932
02:50:07,979 --> 02:50:08,700
 do you think let

3933
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:09,120
 me sneak

3934
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:10,319
 this question in there what

3935
02:50:10,319 --> 02:50:13,080
 do you think is the meaning of life

3936
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:16,800
 i don't well why are we here

3937
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:20,760
 look up at the stars and think about like the big

3938
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:23,720
 why question

3939
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:29,280
 i think that it's a chance to just enjoy the ride

3940
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:31,859
 i don't think it really like

3941
02:50:31,859 --> 02:50:38,700
 i don't believe in this idea of legacy that much i think it's a real trap

3942
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:43,260
 so do you think you'll be forgotten by history i hope so i

3943
02:50:43,260 --> 02:50:44,880
 really really hope so because

3944
02:50:44,880 --> 02:50:47,580
 if you think about it there are two or three people that are remembered

3945
02:50:47,580 --> 02:50:49,200
 for positive things and

3946
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:51,780
 everybody else it's all negative things and

3947
02:50:51,780 --> 02:50:55,380
 the the likelihood that you'll be remembered for a positive thing is

3948
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:58,680
 harder and harder and harder and so the surface area of being remembered

3949
02:50:58,680 --> 02:50:59,460
 is

3950
02:50:59,460 --> 02:51:00,660
 negative and

3951
02:51:00,660 --> 02:51:01,979
 then the second what

3952
02:51:01,979 --> 02:51:04,260
 will it matter i'll be gone

3953
02:51:04,260 --> 02:51:10,859
 i really just want to like have fun do my thing learn

3954
02:51:10,859 --> 02:51:12,660
 get better

3955
02:51:12,660 --> 02:51:15,720
 but i want i want to reward myself

3956
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:17,939
 by feeling like

3957
02:51:17,939 --> 02:51:22,319
 oh that was awesome like i've told this story many times and i

3958
02:51:22,319 --> 02:51:23,760
 have put again my

3959
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:26,640
 own narrative fallacy on top of this but

3960
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:28,020
 you know steve jobs's

3961
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:32,460
 sister wrote this you know obit in the new york times when he died and

3962
02:51:32,460 --> 02:51:36,420
 she ends it by saying his last words were oh wow oh wow oh wow

3963
02:51:36,420 --> 02:51:38,640
 that seems like an awesome way to die

3964
02:51:38,640 --> 02:51:40,979
 you're surrounded by your friends and family not

3965
02:51:40,979 --> 02:51:42,840
 the fact that he died obviously but

3966
02:51:42,840 --> 02:51:48,240
 in a moment where what i read into it was your family was there

3967
02:51:48,240 --> 02:51:54,359
 maybe you thought about all the cool shit that you were able to do

3968
02:51:54,359 --> 02:51:58,439
 and then you know you just started the simulation all over again and

3969
02:51:58,439 --> 02:51:59,700
 so yeah just

3970
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:04,200
 on the off chance that that's true i don't want to take this thing too seriously

3971
02:52:04,200 --> 02:52:09,979
 you know what i mean just enjoy it so you're not afraid of it the end

3972
02:52:10,800 --> 02:52:13,560
 good in tomorrow get in right now

3973
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:14,100
 so

3974
02:52:14,100 --> 02:52:18,600
 every day you can go and you're happy you're happy with the things you've done yeah

3975
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:23,540
 you know there there are obviously things i want to do that i haven't done

3976
02:52:23,580 --> 02:52:31,520
 um but there are no gaping things i've really really been in love

3977
02:52:31,800 --> 02:52:40,700
 total gift there have been moments where i've really really felt like everybody else

3978
02:52:40,740 --> 02:52:44,279
 there have been moments where i have deep deep deep joy

3979
02:52:44,279 --> 02:52:46,560
 and connection with my children

3980
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:48,720
 there are moments where i've had incredible

3981
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:51,180
 giggling fun with my friends

3982
02:52:51,180 --> 02:52:57,420
 there's moments where i've been able to enjoy really incredible experiences wine food all that stuff

3983
02:52:57,420 --> 02:53:03,180
 great i mean what more do you want like i i could keep asking for more

3984
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:08,460
 i would just be a really crappy human being at some point

3985
02:53:08,460 --> 02:53:10,979
 you know what i mean it's enough yeah

3986
02:53:10,979 --> 02:53:13,140
 yeah it's enough it's

3987
02:53:13,140 --> 02:53:14,100
 enough this

3988
02:53:14,100 --> 02:53:16,319
 life this life is pretty beautiful if

3989
02:53:16,319 --> 02:53:18,300
 you allow yourself to see it yeah it's

3990
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:22,140
 really great and it's better than it's ever been

3991
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:22,979
 um for

3992
02:53:22,979 --> 02:53:24,840
 most of us actually yeah

3993
02:53:24,840 --> 02:53:28,560
 it's pretty nice you know and all of the like you know millennials

3994
02:53:28,560 --> 02:53:29,880
 and gen z's

3995
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:35,359
 you're about to get a boatload of money from your parents

3996
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:39,120
 and you better figure out

3997
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:49,080
 how to be happy before you get that money yeah because otherwise you will be miserable

3998
02:53:49,080 --> 02:53:51,300
 get a lot of dairy queen

3999
02:53:51,300 --> 02:53:51,960
 no

4000
02:53:51,960 --> 02:53:54,359
 that would that only worked the first time it

4001
02:53:54,359 --> 02:53:58,020
 worked two times in grade five and grade six my god that next year flex

4002
02:53:58,020 --> 02:54:00,359
 i worked my ass off i'm like but

4003
02:54:00,359 --> 02:54:02,580
 i could never bring myself to ask her yeah

4004
02:54:02,580 --> 02:54:04,740
 and then she did it and i was like man she's

4005
02:54:04,740 --> 02:54:06,060
 this woman's miss bruni

4006
02:54:06,060 --> 02:54:06,479
 the

4007
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:07,920
 room is a gem yeah

4008
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:10,500
 but the third time it faded

4009
02:54:10,500 --> 02:54:13,859
 isn't that the sad thing in my life you

4010
02:54:13,859 --> 02:54:17,399
 know the finiteness of it the scarcity of it

4011
02:54:17,399 --> 02:54:23,640
 without that we perhaps wouldn't ice cream wouldn't be so damn delicious you're an incredible human

4012
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:27,060
 um i definitely recommend that people listen to on all all

4013
02:54:27,060 --> 02:54:27,779
 platforms

4014
02:54:27,779 --> 02:54:32,279
 just we're very lucky to be able to get your wisdom i enjoy i agree with

4015
02:54:32,279 --> 02:54:32,939
 um i've

4016
02:54:32,939 --> 02:54:37,260
 talked a lot about you with the audrey capothy who's somebody i really respect and

4017
02:54:37,260 --> 02:54:38,580
 he just loves

4018
02:54:38,580 --> 02:54:41,220
 the shit out of you you know in in how much you

4019
02:54:41,220 --> 02:54:42,899
 how deeply you understand the world it's

4020
02:54:42,899 --> 02:54:45,779
 a huge honor he's an incredible human being so that's on a different yeah

4021
02:54:45,779 --> 02:54:46,200
 speaking

4022
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:46,979
 of semicolons

4023
02:54:46,979 --> 02:54:51,060
 there's some human beings that understand everything at

4024
02:54:51,060 --> 02:54:56,160
 the very low level and at the very high level and those people are also

4025
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:57,120
 um very

4026
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:58,260
 rare so it's

4027
02:54:58,260 --> 02:55:01,080
 it's a huge honor and also a huge honor that you

4028
02:55:01,080 --> 02:55:03,000
 would be so kind to me just

4029
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,220
 like in subtle ways offline

4030
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:08,660
 that you would make me feel like i'm

4031
02:55:08,660 --> 02:55:09,660
 worthwhile

4032
02:55:09,660 --> 02:55:14,340
 well can i just say something as just a layman listener

4033
02:55:14,340 --> 02:55:18,600
 um what you do just so i could give you my version

4034
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:21,779
 is that you take things

4035
02:55:21,779 --> 02:55:25,500
 and people so ideas and people

4036
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:28,560
 that are mostly behind a rope

4037
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:31,140
 and you demystify it

4038
02:55:31,140 --> 02:55:36,600
 and what that does for all of us is it makes me feel

4039
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:38,160
 like

4040
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:41,040
 i can be a part of that

4041
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:41,700
 and

4042
02:55:41,700 --> 02:55:42,660
 that's a really inspiring

4043
02:55:42,660 --> 02:55:43,380
 thing because you're

4044
02:55:43,380 --> 02:55:46,439
 not giving advice you're not telling us how to solve the problem

4045
02:55:46,439 --> 02:55:49,979
 but you're allowing it to be understood in

4046
02:55:49,979 --> 02:55:51,960
 a way that's really

4047
02:55:51,960 --> 02:55:53,760
 accessible

4048
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:54,300
 and

4049
02:55:54,300 --> 02:55:57,120
 then you're intellectually curious in ways that you

4050
02:55:57,120 --> 02:55:58,620
 know some of us would never expect

4051
02:55:58,620 --> 02:56:02,279
 that we were and then you kind of end up in this rabbit hole

4052
02:56:02,279 --> 02:56:03,240
 um and then you have the courage

4053
02:56:03,240 --> 02:56:06,720
 to go and talk to people that are really all over the map

4054
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:10,140
 um like for example like i when i saw your

4055
02:56:10,140 --> 02:56:13,260
 jordan peterson example like you

4056
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:15,180
 went there like you talked about nazism

4057
02:56:15,180 --> 02:56:18,600
 and i was just like man this is a complicated argument

4058
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:21,420
 these guys are going to tackle and it's

4059
02:56:21,420 --> 02:56:23,460
 just it's really

4060
02:56:23,460 --> 02:56:24,240
 um really

4061
02:56:24,240 --> 02:56:24,600
 impressive

4062
02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:27,600
 so i have an enormous amount of respect for what you do i think it's very

4063
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:28,380
 hard

4064
02:56:28,380 --> 02:56:31,260
 to do what you do so consistently

4065
02:56:31,260 --> 02:56:34,680
 um and so i i look at you as somebody i i respect because it's

4066
02:56:34,680 --> 02:56:40,620
 um it just shows like somebody who's immersed in something and who's

4067
02:56:40,620 --> 02:56:41,160
 very

4068
02:56:41,160 --> 02:56:42,359
 special so thank you for including

4069
02:56:42,359 --> 02:56:43,080
 me in this i'm

4070
02:56:43,080 --> 02:56:44,939
 going to play that clip to myself privately

4071
02:56:44,939 --> 02:56:47,540
 over and over just when i feel

4072
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:48,540
 low

4073
