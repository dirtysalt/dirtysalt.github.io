1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,580
- I mean, look, we're adding a trillion dollars

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,537
to the national debt every 100 days right now,

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,100
and it's now passing the size

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,530
of the Defense Department budget, and it's compounding,

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,363
and it's pretty soon,

6
00:00:08,363 --> 00:00:09,900
it's gonna be adding a trillion dollars every 90 days,

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,920
and then it's gonna be adding

8
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,077
a trillion dollars every 80 days,

9
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:14,130
and then it's gonna be a trillion dollars every 70 days.

10
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,900
And then if this doesn't get fixed, at some point,

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,640
we enter a hyper-inflationary spiral

12
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,743
and we become Argentina or Brazil and-

13
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,070
- The following is a conversation with Marc Andreessen,

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,290
his second time on the podcast.

15
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,870
Marc is a visionary tech leader and investor

16
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,570
who fundamentally shaped the development

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,210
of the internet and the tech industry in general

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,130
over the past 30 years.

19
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,980
He's the co-creator of Mosaic,

20
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,870
the first widely used web browser,

21
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,820
co-founder of Netscape,

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,130
co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley

23
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,370
venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz,

24
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,420
and is one of the most influential voices in the tech world,

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,563
including at the intersection of technology and politics.

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,200

29
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,283
And now, dear friends, here's Marc Andreessen.

30
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,850
All right, let's start with optimism.

31
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,780
If you were to imagine the best possible 1 to 2 years,

32
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,100
2025, '26 for tech,

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,200
for big tech and small tech, what would it be?

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,340
What would it look like?

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,180
Lay out your vision

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,560
for the best possible scenario trajectory for America.

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
- The roaring '20s.

38
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,990
- The roaring '20s. - The roaring '20s.

39
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,130
I mean, look, couple things.

40
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,530
It is remarkable over the last several years

41
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,290
with all of the issues including, you know,

42
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,370
not just everything in politics,

43
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,260
but also COVID and every other thing that's happened.

44
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,926
It's really amazing, the United States just kept growing.

45
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:43,320
If you just look at economic growth charts,

46
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,120
the US just kept growing, and very significantly,

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,710
many other countries stopped growing.

48
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,970
So Canada stopped growing,

49
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,340
the UK has stopped growing, Germany has stopped growing,

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,690
and you know, some of those countries

51
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,730
may be actually growing backwards at this point.

52
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,100
And there's a very long discussion to be had

53
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,750
about what's wrong with those countries.

54
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,590
And there's of course,

55
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,090
plenty of things that are wrong with our country,

56
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,170
but the US is just flat out primed for growth.

57
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,580
And I think that's a consequence of many factors, you know,

58
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,737
some of which are lucky and some of which through hard work.

59
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:13,260
And so the lucky part is just, you know, number one,

60
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,210
you know, we just have like incredible physical security

61
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,280
by being our own continent.

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,413
You know, we have incredible natural resources, right?

63
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:21,390
There's this running joke now that like,

64
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,980
whenever it looks like the US is gonna run out

65
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,780
of some like rare earth material, you know,

66
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,970
some farmer in North Dakota like kicks over a hay bale

67
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,220
and finds like a $2 trillion deposit.

68
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,660
Right, I mean, we're just like blessed,

69
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,960
you know, with geography and with natural resources.

70
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,793
Energy.

71
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:37,620
You know, we can be energy independent anytime we want.

72
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,750
This last administration decided they didn't wanna be,

73
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,100
they wanted to turn off American energy.

74
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,290
This new administration has declared that they have a goal

75
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,960
of turning it on in a dramatic way.

76
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,550
There's no question we can be energy independent,

77
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,860
we can be a giant net energy exporter.

78
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,300
It's purely a question of choice,

79
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,850
and I think the new administration's gonna do that.

80
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,340
And oh, and then I would say two other things.

81
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,830
One is, you know, we are the beneficiaries,

82
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,910
and, you know, you're an example of this.

83
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,350
We're a beneficiary.

84
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,620
We're the beneficiary of, you know, 50, 100, 200 years

85
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,970
of like the basically most aggressive driven,

86
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,870
smartest people in the world,

87
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,920
most capable people, you know,

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,410
moving to the US and raising their kids here.

89
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,463
And so we just have,

90
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,970
you know, we're by far the most dynamic population,

91
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,020
most aggressive.

92
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,330
You know, we're the most aggressive set of characters,

93
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,430
certainly in any Western country,

94
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,521
and have been for a long time, and certainly are today.

95
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:24,420
And then finally, I would just say, look,

96
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,930
we are overwhelmingly the advanced technology leader.

97
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,059
You know, we have our issues and we have a...

98
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,470
I would say particular issue with manufacturing,

99
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,310
which we could talk about.

100
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,340
But for, you know, anything in software, anything in AI,

101
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,110
anything in, you know, all these, you know,

102
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,570
advanced biotech, all these advanced areas of technology,

103
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,100
like we're by far the leader.

104
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,930
Again, in part 'cause many of the best scientists

105
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,490
and engineers in those fields,

106
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,900
you know, come to the US.

107
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,910
And so we have all of the preconditions

108
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,050
for a just a monster boom.

109
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,880
You know, I could see economic growth going way up.

110
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,950
I could see productivity growth going way up,

111
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,450
rate of technology adoption going way up.

112
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,760
And then we can do a global tour, if you like,

113
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,170
but like, basically,

114
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,780
all of our competitors have like profound issues

115
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,490
and, you know, we could kind of go through them one by one,

116
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,910
but the competitive landscape just is, it's like,

117
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,850
it's remarkable

118
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,290
how much better positioned we are for growth.

119
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,640
- What about the humans themselves?

120
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
Almost a philosophical questions.

121
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,060
You know, I travel across the world

122
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,760
and there's something about the American spirit,

123
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,410
the entrepreneurial spirit

124
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,140
that's uniquely intense in America.

125
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,440
I don't know what that is.

126
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,130
I've talked to Saagar

127
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,890
who claims it might be the Scots-Irish blood

128
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,250
that runs through the history of America.

129
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,150
What is it?

130
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,640
You, at the heart of Silicon Valley,

131
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,110
is there something in the water?

132
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,600
Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit?

133
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,910
- Yeah. So is this a family show or am I allowed to swear?

134
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,792
- You could say whatever the fuck you want.

135
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:47,625
- (laughs) Okay.

136
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,860
So the great TV show, "Succession,"

137
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,990
the show, of course, which you were intended to root

138
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,823
for exactly zero

139
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:53,730
of the characters. - Yes.

140
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,100
- The best line from "Succession" was in the final episode

141
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,810
of the first season when the whole family's

142
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,320
over in Logan Roy's ancestral homeland of Scotland.

143
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,480
And they're at this castle, you know, for some wedding.

144
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,340
And Logan is just like completely miserable,

145
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,352
have to having to, you know,

146
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:07,500
'cause he is been in New York for 50 years,

147
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,530
he's totally miserable being back in Scotland.

148
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,880
And he gets in some argument with somebody

149
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,537
and he says, finally just says,

150
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:15,240
"My God, I cannot wait to get outta here

151
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,997
and go back to America where we can fuck without condoms."

152
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:21,360
(both laughing)

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,620
- Was that a metaphor or...

154
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,847
Okay. - Exactly. Right.

155
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:25,380
And so no, but it's exactly the thing,

156
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,754
and everybody instantly knows what,

157
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:27,587
like- - Yeah.

158
00:05:27,587 --> 00:05:29,160
- Everybody watching that instantly starts laughing

159
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,110
'cause you know what it means, which it's exactly this.

160
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,060
I think there's like an ethnographic, you know, way of it.

161
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,590
There's a bunch of books on, like you said,

162
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,390
the Scots-Irish, like all the different derivations

163
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,243
of all the different ethnic groups that have come to the US

164
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:40,320
over the course of the last 400 years.

165
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,230
Right, and what we have is this sort of amalgamation

166
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,630
of like, you know, the Northeast, you know, Yankees

167
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,060
who are like super tough and hardcore.

168
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,070
Yeah, the Scots-Irish are super aggressive, you know,

169
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,240
we've got the, you know, the Southerners

170
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,650
and the Texans, you know,

171
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,050
and you know, the sort of, you know, whole kind of blended,

172
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,850
you know, kind of Anglo-Hispanic thing, you know,

173
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,800
super, incredibly tough, strong, driven,

174
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,480
you know, capable characters.

175
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,390
You know, the Texas Rangers, you know, we've got the, yeah,

176
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,577
we've got the California, you know, we've got the, you know,

177
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,980
the wild, we've got the incredibly, you know,

178
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,320
inventive hippies, but we also have the hardcore engineers.

179
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,460
We've got, you know, the best, you know,

180
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,510
rocket scientists in the world.

181
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,490
We've got the best, you know, artists in the world,

182
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,250
you know, creative professionals, you know, the best movies.

183
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,653
And so yeah, there is, you know,

184
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,410
I would say all of our problems,

185
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,170
I think are basically, you know, in my view to some extent,

186
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,450
you know, attempts to basically sand all that off

187
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,670
and make everything basically boring and mediocre.

188
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,620
But there is something in the national spirit

189
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,905
that basically keeps bouncing back.

190
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:35,160
And basically what we discover over time

191
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,200
is we basically just need people to stand up

192
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,050
at a certain point and say, you know,

193
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:41,308
"It's time to build,

194
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:43,890
it's time to grow, you know, it's time to do things."

195
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,210
And there's something in the American spirit

196
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,680
that just like roars right back to life.

197
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,513
And I've seen it before.

198
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:48,346
I actually saw, you know,

199
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:50,050
I saw it as a kid here in the early '80s,

200
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,383
you know, 'cause the '70s

201
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:54,300
were like horribly depressing, right?

202
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,233
In the US.

203
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:58,260
Like they were a nightmare on many fronts.

204
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,310
And in a lot of ways,

205
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,580
the last decade to me has felt a lot like the '70s

206
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,090
just being mired in misery

207
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,680
and just this self-defeating, you know, negative attitude

208
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,270
and everybody's upset about everything.

209
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,310
And, you know, and then by the way, like energy crisis

210
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,770
and hostage crisis and foreign wars

211
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,965
and just demoralization, right?

212
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:19,290
You know, the low point for in the '70s was, you know,

213
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,550
Jimmy Carter who just passed away.

214
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,780
He went on TV and he gave this speech

215
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,667
known as the Malaise Speech.

216
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,140
And it was like the weakest possible,

217
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,140
trying to like rouse people back to a sense of like passion,

218
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,027
he completely failed. And, you know, we had the, you know,

219
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:33,660
the hostages in, you know, Iran for I think 440 days.

220
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,490
And every night on the nightly news, it was, you know,

221
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,170
lines around the block, energy crisis,

222
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,000
depression, inflation.

223
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,590
And then, you know, Reagan came in

224
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,390
and, you know, Reagan was a very controversial character

225
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,223
at the time,

226
00:07:43,223 --> 00:07:44,850
and, you know, he came in and he is like, "Yep, nope,

227
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,260
it's morning in America

228
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,490
and we're the shining city on the hill,

229
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,330
and we're gonna do it."

230
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,407
And he did it, and we did it.

231
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:51,030
And the national spirit came roaring back

232
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,400
and, you know, roared really hard for a full decade.

233
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,750
And I think that's exactly what...

234
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,965
I think, you know, we'll see,

235
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:56,967
but I think that's what could happen here.

236
00:07:56,967 --> 00:08:00,480
- And I just did a super long podcast on Milton Friedman

237
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,320
with Jennifer Burns,

238
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,020
who's this incredible professor at Stanford,

239
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,640
and he was part of the Reagan.

240
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,860
So there's a bunch of components to that,

241
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,720
one of which is economic. - Yes.

242
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,630
- And one of which maybe you can put a word on it

243
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,300
of not to be romantic or anything,

244
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,600
but freedom, individual freedom, economic freedom,

245
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,350
political freedom, and just in general, individualism.

246
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,430
- Yeah, that's right.

247
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,450
Yeah, and as you know this,

248
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,910
America has this incredible streak of individualism,

249
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,580
you know, individualism in America probably peaked,

250
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,860
I think between roughly call it the end of the Civil War,

251
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,120
1865 through to probably call it 1931 or something,

252
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,919
you know, and there was this like incredible rush.

253
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,753
I mean, that period, you know,

254
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:40,886
we now know that period as the Second Industrial Revolution.

255
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,240
And it's when the United States

256
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,500
basically assumed global leadership

257
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,120
and basically took over technological

258
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,250
and economic leadership from England.

259
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,170
And then, you know, that led to, you know,

260
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,180
ultimately then therefore being able to, you know,

261
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,230
not only industrialize the world,

262
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,110
but also win World War II and then win the Cold War.

263
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,430
And yeah, you know, massive individualistic streak.

264
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,890
By the way, you know, Milton Friedman's old videos

265
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,723
are all on YouTube.

266
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,020
They are every bit as compelling

267
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,133
and inspiring. - Yep.

268
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,280
- As they were then, you know,

269
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,162
he is a singular figure

270
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:11,910
and many of us, you know, I never knew him,

271
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,160
but he was actually at Stanford

272
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,630
for many years at the Hoover Institution,

273
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,109
but I never met him,

274
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:18,120
but I know a lot of people who worked with him

275
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,490
and you know, he was a singular figure,

276
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,010
but all of his lessons, you know,

277
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,050
live on or are fully available.

278
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,970
But I would also say it's not just individualism,

279
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,740
and this is, you know, this is one of the big things,

280
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,480
it's like playing out in a lot of our culture

281
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,240
and kind of political fights right now, which is, you know,

282
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,460
basically this feeling, you know, certainly that I have

283
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,560
and I share with a lot of people, which is,

284
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,500
it's not enough for America to just be an economic zone.

285
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,690
And it's not enough for us to just be individuals,

286
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,370
and it's not enough to just have line go up,

287
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,530
and it's not enough to just have economic success.

288
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,780
There are deeper questions at play,

289
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,570
and also, you know, there's more to a country

290
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,403
than just that.

291
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:55,440
And you know, quite frankly, a lot of it is intangible.

292
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,650
A lot of it is, you know, involve spirit and passion.

293
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,970
And you know, like I said,

294
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,420
we have more of it than anybody else, but, you know,

295
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,740
we have to choose to want it.

296
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,180
The way I look at, it's like all of our problems

297
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,013
are self-inflicted.

298
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:09,120
Like, you know, decline is a choice.

299
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,440
You know, all of our problems

300
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,720
are basically demoralization campaigns,

301
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,100
you know, basically people telling us,

302
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,140
people in positions of authority telling us that,

303
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,970
you know, "We shouldn't, you know, stand out,

304
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,190
we shouldn't be adventurous, we shouldn't be exciting,

305
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,780
we shouldn't be exploratory,

306
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,610
you know, we shouldn't this, that, and the other thing.

307
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,320
And we should feel bad about everything that we do."

308
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,240
And I think we've lived through a decade

309
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,590
where that's been the prevailing theme.

310
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,060
And I think quite honestly,

311
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,060
as of November, I think people are done with it.

312
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,790
- If we could go on a tangent of a tangent,

313
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,740
since we're talking about individualism,

314
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,300
and that's not all that it takes.

315
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,837
You've mentioned in the past the book

316
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:42,330
"The Ancient City." - Yes.

317
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,950
- By, if I could only pronounce the name,

318
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,983
French historian Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges,

319
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:48,816
I don't know.

320
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:49,649
- That was amazing.

321
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,482
- Okay. All right.

322
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:51,315
From the 19th century.

323
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,010
Anyway, you said, this is an important book to understand

324
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,690
who we are and where we come from.

325
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,680
- So what that book does,

326
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
it's actually quite a striking book.

327
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,300
So that book is written by this guy as a (indistinct).

328
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,240
I'm gonna let Lex do the pronunciations,

329
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,610
the foreign language pronunciations for the day.

330
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,610
He was a professor classics at the Sorbonne in Paris,

331
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,760
you know, the top university, actually in the 1860s,

332
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,760
so actually, right around after the US Civil War.

333
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,490
And he was a savant of a particular kind, which is he,

334
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,920
and you can see this in the book as he had apparently read,

335
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,880
and, you know, sort of absorbed

336
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,950
and memorized every possible scrap of Greek

337
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,440
and Roman literature.

338
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,120
And so it's like a walking like index

339
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,110
on basically Greek and Roman,

340
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,610
everything we know about Greek and Roman culture,

341
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,080
and that's significant.

342
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,913
The reason this matters

343
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:36,617
is because basically none of that has changed, right?

344
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:39,060
And so he had access to the exact same written materials

345
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,230
that we have access to,

346
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,910
and you know, we've learned nothing.

347
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,200
And then specifically what he did is

348
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,400
he talked about the Greeks and the Romans,

349
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,470
but specifically what he did is he went back further.

350
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,540
He reconstructed the people who came before the Greeks

351
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,596
and the Romans and what their life and society was like.

352
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:51,690
And these were the people who were now known

353
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,310
as the Indo-Europeans.

354
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,780
And these were, or you may have heard of these

355
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,250
are the people who came down from the steppes.

356
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,500
And so they came out of what's now like Eastern Europe,

357
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,200
like around sort of the outskirts of what's now Russia.

358
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,540
And then they sort of swept through Europe.

359
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,430
They ultimately took over all of Europe, by the way,

360
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,010
you know, almost many of the ethnicities in the Americas,

361
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,390
the hundreds of years that follow, you know,

362
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,100
are Indo-European.

363
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,933
And so like, you know,

364
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,290
they were this basically this warrior,

365
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,660
basically class that like came down and swept through

366
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:17,760
and you know, essentially, you know,

367
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,350
populated much of the world.

368
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,030
And there's a whole interesting saga there.

369
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,490
But what he does, and then they basically,

370
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,440
from there came basically what we know as the Greeks

371
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,840
and the Romans were kind of evolutions off of that.

372
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,960
And so what he reconstructs a sort of what life was like,

373
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,980
at least in the West

374
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,530
for people in their kind of original social state.

375
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,683
And the significance of that is the original social state

376
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,370
is this is living in the state

377
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,770
of the absolute imperative for survival

378
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,930
with absolutely no technology, (laughs) right?

379
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,150
Like no modern systems, no nothing, right?

380
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,530
You've got the clothes on your back,

381
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,910
you've got your, you know,

382
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,960
you've got whatever you can build

383
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,793
with your bare hands, right?

384
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:52,150
This is, you know, predates basically all concepts

385
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:53,926
of technologies as we understand 'em today.

386
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:56,370
And so these are people under like maximum levels

387
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,110
of physical survival pressure.

388
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,000
And so what social patterns did they evolve

389
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,833
to be able to do that?

390
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,900
And the social pattern basically was as follows,

391
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,110
is a three-part social structure, family,

392
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,910
tribe and city, and zero concept of individual rights

393
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,451
and essentially no concept of individualism.

394
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:16,050
And so you were not an individual,

395
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,700
you were a member of your family.

396
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,320
And then a set of families would aggregate

397
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,970
into a tribe and then a set of tribes would aggregate

398
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,450
into a city.

399
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,670
And then the morality was completely,

400
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,860
it was actually what Nietzsche talks about.

401
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,360
The morality was entirely master morality,

402
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,193
not slave morality.

403
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:34,920
And so in their morality, anything that was strong was good,

404
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,150
and anything that was weak was bad.

405
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,650
And it's very clear why that is, right?

406
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,570
It's 'cause strong equals good equals survive.

407
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,400
Weak equals bad equals die.

408
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,900
And that led to what became known later

409
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,160
as the master-slave dialectic,

410
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,500
which is it more important for you to live on your feet

411
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,120
as a master, even at the risk of dying?

412
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,950
Or are you willing to, you know,

413
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,780
live as a slave on your knees in order to not die?

414
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,460
And this is sort of the derivation

415
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,690
of that moral framework.

416
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,700
Christianity later inverted that moral framework.

417
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,335
But it, you know, the original framework lasted for,

418
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:00,990
you know, many, many thousands of years.

419
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,130
No concept of individualism.

420
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,240
The head of the family had total life

421
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,070
and death control over the family,

422
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,180
the head of the tribe, same thing,

423
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,170
head of the city, same thing.

424
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,510
And then you were morally obligated to kill members

425
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,480
of the other cities on contact. (laughs)

426
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,770
Right, you were morally required to.

427
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,440
Like, if you didn't do it, you were a bad person.

428
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,060
And then the form of the society

429
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,730
was basically maximum fascism combined

430
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,680
with maximum communism, right?

431
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,020
And so it was maximum fascism in the form

432
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,940
of this like absolute top-down control

433
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,110
where the head of the family tribe

434
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,520
or city could kill other members

435
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,940
of the community at any time with no repercussions at all.

436
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,860
So maximum hierarchy,

437
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,420
but combined with maximum communism,

438
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,680
which is no market economy

439
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,480
and so everything gets shared, right?

440
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,590
And sort of the point of being

441
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,230
in one of these collectives is that it's a collective

442
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,270
you know, and people are sharing and of course,

443
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,590
that limited how big they could get

444
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,030
'cause you know, the problem with communism

445
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,410
is it doesn't scale, right?

446
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,520
It works at the level of a family.

447
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,070
It's much harder to make it work at the level of a country.

448
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,903
Impossible.

449
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:56,400
Maximum fascism, maximum communism.

450
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,460
And then it was all intricately tied into their religion.

451
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,190
And their religion was, it was in two parts.

452
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,500
It was veneration of ancestors

453
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,330
and it was veneration of nature.

454
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,910
And the veneration of ancestors is extremely important

455
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,820
because it was basically the ancestors were the people

456
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,807
who got you to where you were.

457
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:14,610
The ancestors were the people who had everything

458
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,930
to teach you, right?

459
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,100
And then it was veneration of nature

460
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,933
'cause of course, nature is the thing

461
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,023
that's trying to kill you.

462
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:20,990
And then you had your ancestor,

463
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,100
every family, tribe or city had their ancestor gods,

464
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,020
and then they had their nature gods.

465
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,700
Okay, so fast-forward to today,

466
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,270
like we live in a world that is like radically different,

467
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,560
and the book takes you through kind of what happened

468
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,700
from that through the Greeks and Romans,

469
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,900
through to Christianity.

470
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,270
But it's very helpful to kind of think

471
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,070
in these terms because the conventional view

472
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,130
of the progress through time is that we are, you know,

473
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,890
the cliche is the arc of the moral universe, you know,

474
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,270
bend towards justice, right?

475
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,220
Or so-called wig history, which is, you know,

476
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,870
that the arc of progress is positive, right?

477
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,330
And so, you know, what you hear all the time,

478
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,100
what you're taught in school and everything is, you know,

479
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,720
every year that goes by, we get better and better

480
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,310
and more and more moral and more and more pure

481
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,320
and a better version of ourselves,

482
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,007
our Indo-European ancestors would say,

483
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:02,760
"Oh, no, like you people have like fallen to shit.

484
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,950
Like you people took all of the principles

485
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,540
of basically your civilization,

486
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,100
and you have diluted them down to the point

487
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,720
where they barely even matter.

488
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,070
You know, and you're having, you know,

489
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,150
children outta a wedlock

490
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,950
and you're, you know, you regularly encounter people

491
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,300
of other cities and you don't try to kill them."

492
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,770
And like, how crazy is that?

493
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,210
And they would basically consider us

494
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,060
to be living like an incredibly diluted version

495
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,600
of this sort of highly religious, highly cult-like, right?

496
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,340
Highly organized, highly fascist,

497
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,870
communist society.

498
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,500
I can't resist noting that as a consequence

499
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,840
of basically going through all the transitions

500
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,673
we've been through,

501
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:35,940
going all the way through Christianity coming out

502
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,200
the other end of Christianity,

503
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,610
Nietzsche declares God is dead.

504
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,310
We're in a secular society, you know, that still has,

505
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,450
you know, tinges of Christianity,

506
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,280
but you know, largely prides itself

507
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,830
on no longer being religious in that way.

508
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,850
You know, we being

509
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,000
the sort of most fully evolved, modern secular, you know,

510
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,030
expert, scientists and so forth have basically re-evolved

511
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,060
or fallen back on the exact same religious structure

512
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,880
that the Indo-Europeans had, specifically ancestor worship,

513
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,790
which is identity politics and nature worship,

514
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,089
which is environmentalism.

515
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,180
And so we have actually like,

516
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,980
worked our way all the way back to their cult religions

517
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,329
without realizing it.

518
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,710
And it just goes to show that like, you know,

519
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,560
in some ways we have fallen far from the family tree,

520
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,170
but in some cases, we're exactly the same.

521
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,196
- You kind of described this progressive idea of wokeism

522
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:23,460
and so on as worshiping ancestors.

523
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,170
- Identity politics is worshiping ancestors,

524
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,181
right? - Yeah.

525
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,230
- It's tagging newborn infants with either,

526
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,030
you know, benefits or responsibilities

527
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,380
or, you know, levels of condemnation

528
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,860
based on who their ancestors were.

529
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,873
The Indo-Europeans would've recognized it on sight.

530
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,090
We somehow think it's like super socially progressive.

531
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,923
- Yeah.

532
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:40,853
And it is not.

533
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:43,020
- I mean, I would say obviously not.

534
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,940
You know, get nuanced, which is where I think you're headed,

535
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,290
which is look like,

536
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,310
is the idea that you can

537
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,470
like completely reinvent society every generation,

538
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,750
and have no regard whatsoever for what came before you?

539
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,250
That seems like a really bad idea, right?

540
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,740
That's like the Cambodians with Year Zero under Pol Pot

541
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,300
and, you know, death follows.

542
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,200
It's obviously the Soviets tried that.

543
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:03,600
You know, the utopian fantasists who think

544
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,220
that they can just rip up everything that came before

545
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,990
and create something new in the human condition

546
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,790
and human society have a very bad history

547
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,140
of causing, you know, enormous destruction.

548
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,850
So on the one hand, it's like, okay,

549
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,229
there is like a deeply important role for tradition.

550
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,310
And the way I think about that is the process

551
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,080
of evolutionary learning, right?

552
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,850
Which is what tradition ought to be,

553
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,410
is the distilled wisdom of all.

554
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,060
And you know, this is what Indo-Europeans thought about.

555
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,800
It should be the distilled wisdom of everybody

556
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,240
who came before you, right?

557
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,240
All those important and powerful lessons learned.

558
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,800
And that's why I think it's fascinating to go back

559
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,940
and study how these people lived is

560
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,405
'cause that's part of the history

561
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,238
and you know, part of the learning

562
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:36,810
that got us to where we're today.

563
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,300
Having said that, there are many cultures around the world

564
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,310
that are, you know, mired in tradition to the point

565
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,990
of not being able to progress.

566
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,610
And in fact, you might even say globally,

567
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,470
that's the default human condition, which is, you know,

568
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,353
a lot of people are in societies in which, you know,

569
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:51,240
there's like absolute seniority by age, you know,

570
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,073
kids are completely...

571
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:53,880
You know, like in the US, like for some reason,

572
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,116
we decided kids are in charge of everything, right?

573
00:18:56,116 --> 00:18:57,180
And like, you know, they're the trendsetters

574
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,530
and they're allowed to like, set all the agendas

575
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,360
and like set all the politics and set all the culture

576
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,950
and maybe that's a little bit crazy.

577
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,210
But like in a lot of other cultures,

578
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,400
kids have no voice at all, no role at all.

579
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,600
'Cause it's the old people who are in charge

580
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
of everything, you know, they're gerontocracies,

581
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,430
and it's all a bunch of 80-year-olds running everything,

582
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,480
which by the way, we have a little bit of that too, right?

583
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,370
And so what I would say is like,

584
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,320
there's a real downside, you know,

585
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,192
full traditionalism is communitarianism, you know,

586
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,873
it's ethnic particularism, you know, it's ethnic chauvinism,

587
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:26,790
it's, you know, this incredible level

588
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,173
of resistance to change.

589
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,290
You know, I mean, it just doesn't get you anywhere.

590
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,670
Like, it may be good and fine

591
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,780
at the level of individual tribe,

592
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,880
but as a society living in the modern world,

593
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,890
you can't evolve, you can't advance,

594
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,877
you can't participate in all the good things that,

595
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:41,910
you know, that have happened.

596
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,260
And so, you know, I think it probably,

597
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,210
this is one of those things where extremists on either side

598
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,360
is probably a bad idea,

599
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,170
but this needs to be approached

600
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,920
in a sophisticated and nuanced way.

601
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,353
- So the beautiful picture you painted of the roaring '20s,

602
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,860
how can the Trump administration play a part

603
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,510
in making that future happen?

604
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,920
- Yeah, so look, a big part of this

605
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,800
is getting the government boot off the neck

606
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,365
of the American economy, the American technology industry,

607
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:08,365
the American people.

608
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:11,160
You know, and again, this is a replay of what happened

609
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,960
in the '60s and '70s, which is, you know,

610
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,180
for what started out looking like, you know, I'm sure good

611
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,060
and virtuous purposes, you know, we ended up both then

612
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,140
and now with this, you know,

613
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,260
what I describe as sort of a form of soft authoritarianism.

614
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,370
You know, the good news is it's not

615
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,510
like a military dictatorship.

616
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,940
It's not like, you know, you get thrown into Lubyanka.

617
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,773
You know, for the most part,

618
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,460
it's not coming at 4:00 in the morning.

619
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,720
You're not getting dragged off to a cell.

620
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,130
So it's not hard authoritarianism,

621
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,810
but it is soft authoritarianism.

622
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,480
And so it's this, you know, incredible suppressive blanket

623
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,640
of regulation rules, you know,

624
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,800
this concept of a vetocracy, right?

625
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,560
What's required to get anything done?

626
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,620
You know, you need to get 40 people

627
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,050
to sign off on anything, any one of them can veto it.

628
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,883
You know,

629
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:49,380
there's a lot of (indistinct) political system works.

630
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,900
And then, you know, just this general idea of, you know,

631
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,910
progress is bad, and technology is bad,

632
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,110
and capitalism is bad,

633
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,900
and building businesses is bad and success is bad.

634
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,590
You know, tall poppy syndrome, you know, basically anybody

635
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,520
who sticks their head up, you know,

636
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,990
deserves to get it, you know, chopped off.

637
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,760
Anybody who's wrong about anything deserves

638
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,290
to get condemned forever.

639
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,450
You know, just this very kind of, you know,

640
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,190
grinding repression.

641
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,890
And then coupled with specific government actions

642
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,290
such as censorship regimes, right?

643
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,390
And debanking, right?

644
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,610
And, you know, draconian, you know,

645
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,870
deliberately kneecapping, you know,

646
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,430
critical American industries

647
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,140
and then, you know, congratulating yourselves

648
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,973
on the back for doing it,

649
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:28,110
or, you know, having these horrible social policies,

650
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,580
like let's let all the criminals outta jail

651
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,800
and see what happens, right?

652
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,570
And so, like we've just been through this period,

653
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,070
you know, I call it a demoralization campaign.

654
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,810
Like we've just been through this period where, you know,

655
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,130
whether it started that way or not,

656
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,380
it ended up basically being this comprehensive message

657
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,060
that says, "You're terrible and if you try to do anything,

658
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,827
you're terrible and fuck you."

659
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,340
And the Biden administration reached kinda the full pinnacle

660
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,600
of that in our time.

661
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,200
They got really bad on many fronts at the same time.

662
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:54,210
And so just like relieving that

663
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,750
and getting kind of back to a reasonably, you know,

664
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,700
kind of optimistic, constructive, you know,

665
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,870
pro-growth frame of mind, there's so much pent-up energy

666
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,070
and potentially in the American system,

667
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,944
that alone is gonna, I think, cause, you know, growth

668
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:09,240
and spirit to take off.

669
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,430
And then there's a lot of things proactively that, yeah.

670
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,540
And then there's a lot of things proactively

671
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,620
that could be done.

672
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,390
- So how do you relieve that?

673
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,490
To what degree has the thing

674
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,390
you describe ideologically permeated government

675
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,880
and permeated big companies?

676
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,840
- Disclaimer at first,

677
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,730
which is I don't wanna predict anything on any of this stuff

678
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,110
'cause I've learned the hard way

679
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,200
that I can't predict politics or Washington at all.

680
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,000
But I would just say that the plans and intentions

681
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,649
are clear and the staffing supports it,

682
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:37,290
and all the conversations are consistent

683
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,030
with the due administration and that they plan to take,

684
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,710
you know, very rapid action on a lot

685
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,180
of these fronts very quickly.

686
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,230
They're gonna do as much as they can

687
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,063
through executive orders,

688
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,360
and then they're gonna do legislation

689
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,280
and regulatory changes for the rest.

690
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,330
And so they're gonna move, I think,

691
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,470
quickly on a whole bunch of stuff.

692
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,303
You can already feel,

693
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,930
I think a shift in the national spirit,

694
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,860
or at least, let's put it this way,

695
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,750
I feel it for sure in Silicon Valley.

696
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,460
Like, I mean, you know,

697
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,510
we just saw a great example of this with what, you know,

698
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,967
with what Mark Zuckerberg is doing, you know,

699
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,890
and obviously I'm involved with his company,

700
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,020
but you know, we just saw it kind of in public, the scope,

701
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,700
and speed of the changes, you know,

702
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,760
are reflective of a lot of these shifts.

703
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,130
But I would say that same conversation,

704
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,420
those same kinds of things are happening

705
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,440
throughout the industry, right?

706
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
And so the tech industry itself,

707
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,920
whether people were pro-Trump or anti-Trump, like,

708
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,780
there's just like a giant vibe shift

709
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,340
mood shift that's like kicked in already.

710
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,530
And then I was with a group of Hollywood people

711
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,090
about two weeks ago,

712
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,260
and they were still, you know,

713
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,780
people who at least vocally were still very anti-Trump,

714
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,107
but I said, you know,

715
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,927
"Has anything changed since November 6th?"

716
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:32,047
And they immediately said,

717
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:33,450
"Oh, it's completely different.

718
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,220
It feels like the ice has thawed.

719
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,260
You know, woke is over."

720
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,850
You know, they said that all kinds of projects

721
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,080
are gonna be able to get made now they couldn't

722
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,070
before that, you know,

723
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,140
Hollywood's gonna start making comedies again.

724
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,480
You know, like, they were just,

725
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,590
just like an incredible immediate environmental change.

726
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,050
And as I talk to people kind of throughout, you know,

727
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,910
certainly throughout the economy, people who run businesses,

728
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,820
I hear that all the time, which is just this last 10 years

729
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,690
of misery is just over.

730
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,060
I mean, the one that I'm watching that's really funny.

731
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,410
I mean, Facebook's getting a lot,

732
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,400
Meta's getting a lot of attention,

733
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,680
but the other funny one is BlackRock, which I'm not,

734
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,880
you know, and I don't know him,

735
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,020
but I've watched for a long time.

736
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,640
And so, you know, the Larry Fink,

737
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,660
who's the CEO of BlackRock

738
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,940
was like first in as a major, you know,

739
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,630
investment CEO on like every dumb social trend

740
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,800
and rule set, like every...

741
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:22,230
All right, I'm going for it. Every retardant, (laughs)

742
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,520
every retarded thing

743
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,750
you can imagine. - Yeah.

744
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,970
- Every ESG and every, like,

745
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,770
every possible saddling companies

746
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,760
with every aspect

747
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,100
of just these crazed ideological positions.

748
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,080
And, you know, he was coming in, he literally was like,

749
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,110
had a aggregated together trillions of dollars

750
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,095
of shareholdings that he did not,

751
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:42,060
you know, that were his customer's rights.

752
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,860
And he, you know, seized their voting control

753
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,000
of their shares and was using it

754
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,080
to force all these companies to do

755
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,150
all of this like crazy ideological stuff.

756
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,560
And he was like the Typhoid Mary

757
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,530
of all this stuff in corporate America.

758
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,380
And he in the last year

759
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,910
has been like backpedaling from that stuff,

760
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,743
like as fast as he possibly can.

761
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,490
And I saw just an example, last week,

762
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,810
he pulled out of the,

763
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,880
whatever the Corporate Net-Zero Alliance,

764
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,400
you know, he pulled out of the crazy energy stuff.

765
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,310
And so, like, you know, he's backing away as fast as he can.

766
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,220
Remember, the Richard Pryor backwards walk?

767
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,410
Richard Pryor had this way where he could back out of a room

768
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,174
while looking like he was walking forward.

769
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:13,266
(Lex laughing)

770
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:17,550
(laughs) And so, you know, even there doing that,

771
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,725
and just the whole thing, I mean this,

772
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:21,600
I dunno if you saw the court recently ruled that NASDAQ

773
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,720
had these crazy board of directors composition rules.

774
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,070
One of the funniest moments of my life

775
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,220
is when my friend Peter Thiel and I were on the Meta board

776
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,570
and these NASDAQ rules came down,

777
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,640
mandated diversity on corporate boards.

778
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,020
And so we sat around the table

779
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,890
and had to figure out, you know,

780
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,030
which of us counted as diverse.

781
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,140
And the very professional attorneys at Meta explained

782
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,230
with 100% complete straight face that Peter Thiel counts

783
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,710
as diverse by virtue of being LGBT.

784
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,607
And this is a guy who literally wrote a book called

785
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:50,400
"The Diversity Myth." - Yeah.

786
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,230
- And he literally looked like he'd swallowed

787
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,590
a live goldfish and that- - Yeah.

788
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,730
- And this was imposed,

789
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,803
I mean, this was like so incredibly offensive to him

790
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:00,270
that like, it was just absolutely appalling

791
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,380
and I felt terrible for him.

792
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,181
But the look in his face was very funny.

793
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:04,014
(Lex laughing)

794
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:05,430
And it was imposed by NASDAQ, you know,

795
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,110
your stock exchange imposing this stuff on you,

796
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,760
and then the court, whatever,

797
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,130
the Court of Appeals just nuked that,

798
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,600
you know, so like these things basically

799
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,220
are being like ripped down one by one.

800
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,440
And what's on the other side of it is basically,

801
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,600
you know, finally being able to get back to, you know,

802
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,370
everything that, you know, everybody always wanted to do,

803
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,410
which is like, run their companies, have great products,

804
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,040
have happy customers, you know, like succeed,

805
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,353
achieve, outperform, and, you know,

806
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,030
work with the best and the brightest

807
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,863
and not be made to feel bad about it.

808
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:32,220
And I think that's happening

809
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,080
in many areas of American society.

810
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,400
- It's great to hear that Peter Thiel

811
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,640
is fundamentally a diversity hire.

812
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,620
- Well, so it was very, you know, there was a moment.

813
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,693
So you know, Peter, of course, you know,

814
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,980
is publicly gay, has been for a long time,

815
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,720
but you know, there are other men on the board, right?

816
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,800
And, you know, we're sitting there

817
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,180
and we're all looking at it, and we're like, all right,

818
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,963
like, okay, LGBT, and we keep coming back to the B, right?

819
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,911
And it's like-

820
00:26:56,911 --> 00:26:59,040
(Lex laughing)

821
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,873
- Yeah.

822
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:01,444
- You know, it's like- - All right.

823
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:03,937
- You know, I'm willing to do a lot for this company, but-

824
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:05,430
(both laughing)

825
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,170
- It's all about sacrifice for diversity.

826
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,003
- Well, yeah.

827
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,437
And then it's like, okay, like is there a test?

828
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:10,350
- Right. - Right.

829
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,140
You know, so. (Lex laughing)

830
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,850
- Oh, yeah, exactly.

831
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,683
How do you prove it?

832
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:18,399
- [Marc] The questions that got asked, you know.

833
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,620
- What are you willing to do- - Yeah, and-

834
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,788
- The greater good?

835
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:21,621
- I've become very good

836
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:24,300
at asking lawyers completely absurd questions

837
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,010
with a totally straight face.

838
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,560
- And do they answer with a straight face, like lawyers-

839
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,393
- Sometimes. - Okay.

840
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:30,450
- I think in fairness,

841
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,700
they have trouble telling when I'm joking.

842
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,250
- So you mentioned the Hollywood folks,

843
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,730
maybe people in Silicon Valley and the vibe shift.

844
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,300
Maybe you can speak to preference falsification.

845
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,400
What do they actually believe?

846
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,040
How many of them actually hate Trump?

847
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,150
Like what percent of them are feeling this vibe shift

848
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,580
and are interested in creating the roaring '20s

849
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,690
in the way they've described?

850
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,910
- So first, we should maybe talk population.

851
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,010
So there's like all of Silicon Valley

852
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:02,843
and the way to just measure

853
00:28:02,843 --> 00:28:04,410
that is just look at voting records, right?

854
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,790
And what that shows consistently

855
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,690
is Silicon Valley is just a,

856
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,710
you know, at least historically,

857
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,840
my entire time there has been overwhelmingly majority

858
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,140
just straight up Democrat.

859
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,160
The other way to look at that is political donation records.

860
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,050
And again, you know, the political donations

861
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,377
in the Valley, you know, range from 90 to 99%,

862
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:20,040
you know, to one side.

863
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,900
And so, you know, I just bring it up 'cause like,

864
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,280
we'll see what happens with the voting

865
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,930
and with donations going forward.

866
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,210
We can maybe talk about the fire later,

867
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,040
but I can tell you there is a very big question

868
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,073
of what's happening in Los Angeles right now.

869
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,293
I don't wanna get into the fire,

870
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:34,126
but like, it's catastrophic.

871
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:35,760
And, you know, there was already a rightward shift

872
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,290
in the big cities in California,

873
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,900
and I think a lot of people in LA are really thinking

874
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,000
about things right now as they're trying to, you know,

875
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,580
literally save their houses and save their families.

876
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,710
But, you know, even in San Francisco,

877
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,660
you know, there was a big shift to the right in the voting

878
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,660
in '24. So, we'll see where that goes, but you know,

879
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,020
you observe that by just looking at the numbers over time.

880
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,300
The part that I'm more focused on is, you know,

881
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,680
and I don't know how to exactly describe this,

882
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
but it's like the top 1,000

883
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,833
or the top 10,000 people, right?

884
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,900
You know, and I don't have a list,

885
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,000
but like, you know, it's all the top founders,

886
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,357
top CEOs, top executives, top engineers, top VCs, you know,

887
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:11,580
and then kind of into the ranks, you know,

888
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,830
the people who kind of built and run the companies.

889
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,570
And they're, you know, I don't have numbers,

890
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,330
but I have a much more tactile feel, you know,

891
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,380
for what's happening.

892
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,863
So the big thing I have now come to believe

893
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,683
is that the idea that people have beliefs is mostly wrong.

894
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,820
I think that most people just go along,

895
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,330
and I think even most high-status people just go along.

896
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,130
And I think maybe the most high-status people

897
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,900
are the most prone to just go along

898
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,600
because they're the most focused on status.

899
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,180
And the way I would describe that is, you know,

900
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,340
one of the great forbidden philosophers

901
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,100
of our time is the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski.

902
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,270
And amidst his madness,

903
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,730
he had this extremely interesting articulation.

904
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,310
You know, he was an insane lunatic murderer,

905
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,803
but he was also a Harvard super genius.

906
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,901
Not that those are in conflict.

907
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,030
(both laughing)

908
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,560
But- - Shots fired, man.

909
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,990
- But he was a very bright guy,

910
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,720
and he did this whole thing where he talked about,

911
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,550
basically he was very right-wing

912
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,680
and talked about leftism a lot.

913
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,700
And he had this great concept

914
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,140
that's just stuck in my mind ever since I read it,

915
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,973
which is he had this concept,

916
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,593
you just called over-socialization.

917
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,771
And so, you know, most people are socialized,

918
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:25,440
like most people are, you know, we live in a society,

919
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,180
most people learn how to be part of a society.

920
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,550
They give some deference to the society.

921
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,620
There's something about modern Western elites

922
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,270
where they're over-socialized

923
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,520
and they're just like overly oriented

924
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,350
towards what other people like themselves,

925
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,060
you know, think and believe.

926
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,310
And you can get a real sense

927
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,200
of that if you have a little bit of an outside perspective,

928
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,490
which I just do,

929
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,430
I think as a consequence of where I grew up.

930
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,440
Like even before I had the views that I have today,

931
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,910
there was always just this weird thing where it's like,

932
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,130
why does every dinner party

933
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,750
have the exact same conversation?

934
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,780
Why does everybody agree on every single issue?

935
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,490
Why is that agreement precisely

936
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,130
what was in The New York Times today?

937
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,900
Why are these positions not the same

938
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,330
as they were five years ago? (laughs)

939
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,470
Right?

940
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,557
But why does everybody like snap into agreement every step

941
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:10,390
of the way?

942
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,270
And that was true when I came to Silicon Valley,

943
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,980
and it's just as true today 30 years later.

944
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,800
And so I think most people are just literally,

945
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,973
I think they're taking their cues from,

946
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,820
it's some combination of the press, the universities,

947
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,110
the big foundations.

948
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,910
So basically, it's like The New York Times,

949
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,230
Harvard, the Ford Foundation,

950
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,950
and you know, I don't know, you know, a few CEOs

951
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,140
and a few public figures and you know,

952
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,150
maybe the President if your party is in power.

953
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,500
And like, whatever that is,

954
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,070
everybody who's sort of good and proper and elite

955
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,930
and good standing and in charge of things,

956
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,210
and a sort of correct member of, you know,

957
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,530
let's call it coastal American society,

958
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,240
everybody just believes those things.

959
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,770
And then, you know, the two interesting things

960
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,150
about that is, number one,

961
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,300
there's no divergence among the organs of power, right?

962
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,850
So Harvard and Yale believed the exact same thing.

963
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,900
The New York Times and The Washington Post

964
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,950
believed the exact same thing.

965
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,510
The Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation

966
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,530
believed the exact same thing.

967
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,540
Google, and, you know, whatever, you know,

968
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,210
Microsoft believed the exact same thing.

969
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,210
But those things change over time,

970
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,180
but there's never conflict in the moment, right?

971
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,823
And so, you know, The New York Times

972
00:32:10,823 --> 00:32:13,440
and The Washington Post agreed on exactly everything

973
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,610
in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020,

974
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,640
despite the fact that the specifics changed radically.

975
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,680
The lockstep was what mattered.

976
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,760
And so I think basically,

977
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,680
we in the valley, we're on the tail end of that,

978
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,627
in the same way Hollywood's on the tail end of that,

979
00:32:26,627 --> 00:32:28,920
in the same way New York's on the tail end of that,

980
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,630
the same way the media's on the tail end of that.

981
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,090
It's like some sort of collective hive mind thing.

982
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,590
And I just go through that to say like,

983
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,240
I don't think most people in my orbit,

984
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,420
or you know, let's say the top 10,000 people in the Valley,

985
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,800
or the top 10,000 people in LA,

986
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,170
I don't think they're sitting there thinking basically,

987
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,003
I have rocks...

988
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,780
I mean, they probably think they have rocks solid beliefs,

989
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,830
but they don't actually

990
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,630
have like some inner core of rocks solid beliefs.

991
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,896
And then they kind of watch reality change around them

992
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:51,729
and try to figure out

993
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:52,800
how to keep their beliefs like correct.

994
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,730
I don't think that's what happens.

995
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,190
I think what happens is they conform to the belief system

996
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,050
around them, and I think most of the time,

997
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,150
they're not even aware

998
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,680
that they're basically part of a herd.

999
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,530
- Is it possible that the surface chatter

1000
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,740
of dinner parties, underneath that,

1001
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,530
there is a turmoil of ideas and thoughts

1002
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,090
and beliefs that's going on,

1003
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,820
but you're just talking to people really close to you

1004
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,470
or in your own mind,

1005
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,005
and the socialization happens at the dinner parties?

1006
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:22,680
Like when you go outside the inner circle

1007
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,900
of one, two, three, four people who you really trust,

1008
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,160
then you start to conform.

1009
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,060
But inside there, inside the mind, there is an actual belief

1010
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,130
or a struggle, attention within New York Times

1011
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:36,840
with the listener.

1012
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,190
For the listener,

1013
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,070
there's a slow smile that overtook Marc Andreessen's face.

1014
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,120
- So look, I'll just tell you what I think,

1015
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,890
which is at the dinner parties

1016
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,340
and at the conferences, no, there's none of that.

1017
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,530
What there

1018
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,950
is that all of the heretical conversations,

1019
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,440
anything that challenges the status quo,

1020
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,090
any heretical ideas and any new idea,

1021
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,250
you know, is a heretical idea.

1022
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,710
Any deviation is either discussed a one-on-one,

1023
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,560
face-to-face, it's like a whisper network

1024
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,180
or it's like a real-life social network.

1025
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,160
There's a secret handshake, which is like, okay,

1026
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,440
you meet somebody and you like know each other a little bit,

1027
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,370
but like not well.

1028
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,750
And like you're both trying to figure out

1029
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,340
if you can like talk to the other person openly

1030
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,199
or whether you have to like be fully conformist.

1031
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,780
It's a joke.

1032
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,650
- Well, yeah, humor-

1033
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,090
- [Marc] Somebody cracks a joke, right?

1034
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,350
Somebody cracks a joke. - Yep.

1035
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,810
- If the other person laughs, the conversation is on.

1036
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,800
- [Lex] Yeah. Yeah.

1037
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,900
- If the other person doesn't laugh,

1038
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,170
back slowly away from the scene, (laughs)

1039
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,520
I didn't mean anything by it.

1040
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,353
- Yeah. - Right.

1041
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:31,186
And then by the way, it doesn't have to be like

1042
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:32,018
a super offensive joke.

1043
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:34,080
It just has to be a joke that's just up against the edge

1044
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,480
of one of the, use the Sam Bankman-Fried term,

1045
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,530
one of the chivalrous.

1046
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,378
You know, it has to be up against one of the things,

1047
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,043
you know, one of the things that you're absolutely required

1048
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:44,460
to believe to be the dinner parties.

1049
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,900
And then at that point, what happens is you have

1050
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,270
a peer-to-peer network, right?

1051
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,429
You have a one-to-one connection with somebody,

1052
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,080
and then you have your own,

1053
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,810
your little conspiracy of a thought criminality,

1054
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,240
and then you've probably been through this,

1055
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,830
you have your network of thought criminals,

1056
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,027
and then they have their network of thought criminals,

1057
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:02,100
and then you have this like delicate mating dance

1058
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,933
as to whether you should bring

1059
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,710
the thought criminals together, right?

1060
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,210
- And the fundamental mechanism of the dance is humor.

1061
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,950
- Yeah, it's humor like it, right?

1062
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,940
Well, of course. - Memes. Yeah.

1063
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,131
- Well, for two reasons.

1064
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:15,510
Number one, humor's a way to have deniability, right?

1065
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,210
Humor is a way to discuss serious thing without,

1066
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,050
with having deniability.

1067
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,716
Oh, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. Right?

1068
00:35:20,716 --> 00:35:21,549
So that's part of it,

1069
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:23,190
which is one of the reasons why comedians can get away

1070
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,360
with saying things the rest of us can't.

1071
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,860
'Cause, you know, they can always fall back on,

1072
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,693
oh, yeah, I was just going

1073
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:27,526
for the laugh. - Yeah.

1074
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:28,830
- But the other key thing about humor, right?

1075
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,470
Is that laughter's involuntary, right?

1076
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,610
Like, you either laugh or you don't.

1077
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,350
And it's not like a conscious decision

1078
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,183
whether you're gonna laugh.

1079
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,110
And everybody can tell when somebody's fake laughing, right?

1080
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,940
And this, every professional comedian knows this, right?

1081
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,810
The laughter is the clue

1082
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,460
that you're onto something truthful.

1083
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,680
Like, people don't laugh at like, made-up bullshit stories.

1084
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,930
They laugh 'cause like you're revealing something

1085
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,120
that they either have not been allowed to think about

1086
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,160
or have not been allowed to talk about, right?

1087
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,030
Or is off limits.

1088
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,950
And all of a sudden, it's like the ice breaks

1089
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,300
and it's like, oh, yeah, that's the thing.

1090
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,642
And it's funny and like I laugh,

1091
00:35:56,642 --> 00:35:57,510
and then, of course, this is why, of course,

1092
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,500
live comedy is so powerful

1093
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,180
is 'cause you're all doing that at the same time,

1094
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,910
so you start to have, you know, the safety of numbers.

1095
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,010
And so the comedians have like the all,

1096
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,853
it's no surprise to me.

1097
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:07,860
Like for example, Joe has been as successful as he has

1098
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,840
'cause they have this hack that the, you know,

1099
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,550
the rest of us who are not professional comedians

1100
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,040
don't have, but you have your in-person version of it.

1101
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,260
Yeah, and then you've got the question

1102
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,160
of whether you can sort of join the networks together.

1103
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,383
And then you've probably been to this is, you know,

1104
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:20,280
then at some point there's like a different,

1105
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,260
there's like the alt dinner party,

1106
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,250
the (indistinct) dinner party,

1107
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,570
and you get six or eight people together

1108
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,440
and you join the networks.

1109
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,090
And those are like the happiest,

1110
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,020
at least in the last decade,

1111
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,910
those are like the happiest moments of everybody's lives,

1112
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,010
'cause they're just like, everybody's just ecstatic,

1113
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,090
'cause they're like, I don't have to worry

1114
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,770
about getting yelled at and shamed,

1115
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,000
like for every third sentence

1116
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,833
that comes outta my mouth,

1117
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,270
and we can actually talk about real things.

1118
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,393
So that's the live version of it.

1119
00:36:41,393 --> 00:36:42,720
And then, of course, the other side of it's the, you know,

1120
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,093
the group chat phenomenon, right?

1121
00:36:46,129 --> 00:36:48,251
And then basically the same thing played out, you know,

1122
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:50,850
until Elon bought X and until Substack took off, you know,

1123
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,260
which were really the two big breakthroughs

1124
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,580
in free speech online,

1125
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,110
the same dynamic played out online,

1126
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,300
which is you had absolute conformity on the social networks,

1127
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,490
like literally enforced by the social networks themselves

1128
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,323
through censorship,

1129
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:02,280
and then also through cancellation campaigns

1130
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,203
and mobbing and shaming, right?

1131
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,350
But then group chats grew up to be the equivalent

1132
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,670
of samizdat, right?

1133
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,620
Anybody who grew up in the Soviet Union under, you know,

1134
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,970
communism, note, you know,

1135
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,740
they had the hard version of this, right?

1136
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,555
It is like, how do you know who you could talk to?

1137
00:37:15,555 --> 00:37:16,710
And then how do you distribute information?

1138
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,350
And like, you know, again,

1139
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,120
that was the hard authoritarian version of this.

1140
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,490
And then we've been living through this weird mutant,

1141
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,750
you know, soft authoritarian version,

1142
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,700
but with, you know, with some of the same patterns.

1143
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,200
- And WhatsApp allows you to scale

1144
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,180
and make it more efficient to build on these groups

1145
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,120
of heretical ideas bonded by humor.

1146
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,786
- Yeah, exactly. Well, and this is the thing,

1147
00:37:37,786 --> 00:37:38,760
and well, this is kind of the running joke

1148
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,593
about groups, right?

1149
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:40,830
The running kind of thing about group chats.

1150
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,773
It's not even a joke. It's true.

1151
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,860
It's like, every group chat,

1152
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,030
if you've noticed this like,

1153
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,050
this principle of group chats,

1154
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,470
every group chat ends up being about memes and humor.

1155
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,570
And the game of the group chat

1156
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,040
is to get as close to the line

1157
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,662
of being actually objectionable.

1158
00:37:54,662 --> 00:37:55,495
- [Lex] Yeah.

1159
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:58,047
- As you can get without actually tripping it, right?

1160
00:37:58,047 --> 00:37:59,670
And like literally every group chat

1161
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,140
that I have been in for the last decade,

1162
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,060
even if it starts some other direction,

1163
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,620
what ends up happening is it becomes

1164
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,710
the absolute comedy fest where, but it's walking,

1165
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,080
they walk right up the line and they're constantly testing.

1166
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,550
And every once in a while somebody will trip the line

1167
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,420
and people will freak out.

1168
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,983
And it's like, "Oh, too soon. Okay.

1169
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:15,900
You know, we gotta wait until next year to talk about that."

1170
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,100
You know, they walk it back.

1171
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,057
And so it's that same thing, and yeah.

1172
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:20,460
And then group chats is a technological phenomenon.

1173
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,420
It was amazing to see.

1174
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,950
'Cause basically, it was number one,

1175
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,020
it was, you know, obviously the rise of smartphones,

1176
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,590
then it was the rise of the new messaging services,

1177
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,780
then it was the rise specifically

1178
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,830
of I would say combination of WhatsApp and Signal.

1179
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,710
And the reason for that is those were the two big systems

1180
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,780
that did the full encryption,

1181
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,400
so you actually felt safe.

1182
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,990
And then the real breakthrough,

1183
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,120
I think was disappearing messages,

1184
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,420
which hit Signal probably four or five years ago

1185
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,970
and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago.

1186
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,160
And then the combination of encryption

1187
00:38:52,821 --> 00:38:54,480
and disappearing messages, I think really unleashed it.

1188
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,860
Well, then there's the fight

1189
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,590
over the length of the disappearing messages, right?

1190
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,650
And so it's like, you know, I often get behind on my thing,

1191
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,837
so I set to seven-day, you know, disappearing messages

1192
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:05,280
and my friends who, you know,

1193
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,230
are like, no, that's way too much risk.

1194
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,310
- Yeah. - It's gotta be a day.

1195
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,020
And then every once in a while somebody will set it

1196
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,853
to five minutes

1197
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:12,540
before they send something like particularly inflammatory.

1198
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,130
- Yeah, 100%.

1199
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,163
Well, what,

1200
00:39:15,163 --> 00:39:16,590
I mean, one of the things that bothers me about WhatsApp,

1201
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:20,100
the choices between 24 hours and, you know, seven days,

1202
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,630
one day or seven days. - (laughs) Right.

1203
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,550
- And I have to have an existential crisis

1204
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,920
about deciding. - Yes.

1205
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,780
- Whether I can last for seven days

1206
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,400
with what I'm about to say. (laughs)

1207
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,220
- Yeah, exactly. Now, of course, what's happening right now

1208
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,280
is the big thaw, right?

1209
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,570
And so the vibe shift.

1210
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,940
So what's happening on the other side of the election is,

1211
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,340
you know, Elon on Twitter two years ago

1212
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,927
and now Mark with Facebook and Instagram.

1213
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:41,880
And by the way, with the continued growth of Substack

1214
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,160
and with other, you know, new platforms that are emerging.

1215
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,190
You know, like I think it may be, you know,

1216
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,780
I don't know that everything just shifts back into public,

1217
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,780
but like a tremendous amount of the verboten conversations,

1218
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,220
you know, can now shifts back into public view.

1219
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,710
And I mean, quite frankly, this is one of those things,

1220
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,543
you know, quite frankly,

1221
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:00,854
even if I was opposed to what those,

1222
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:01,687
you know, what people are saying,

1223
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:03,690
and I'm sure I am in some cases, you know,

1224
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,640
I would argue still like net better for society

1225
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,310
that those things happen in public instead of private.

1226
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,470
You know, do you really want, like, yeah.

1227
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,060
Like does she wanna know?

1228
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,111
- [Lex] Yeah.

1229
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:14,280
- And then it's just,

1230
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,230
look, it's just I think, clearly much healthier

1231
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,063
to live in a society

1232
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:18,360
in which people are not literally scared

1233
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,800
of what they're saying.

1234
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,570
- I mean, to push back,

1235
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,400
to come back to this idea that we're talking about.

1236
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,620
I do believe that people have beliefs

1237
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,180
and thoughts that are heretical,

1238
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,170
like a lot of people.

1239
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,173
I wonder what fraction of people have that?

1240
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,400
To me, the preference falsification is really interesting.

1241
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,770
What is the landscape of ideas

1242
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,820
that human civilization has in private

1243
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,770
as compared to what's out in public?

1244
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,160
'Cause like that the dynamical system

1245
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,920
that is the difference between those two is fascinating.

1246
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,690
Like, throughout history,

1247
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,750
the fall of communism and multiple regimes

1248
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,000
throughout Europe is really interesting,

1249
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,850
'cause everybody was following, you know,

1250
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,310
the line until not. - Right.

1251
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:06,390
- But for sure, privately, there was a huge number

1252
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,120
of boiling conversations happening,

1253
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,450
where like this is the bureaucracy of communism,

1254
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,830
the corruption of communism,

1255
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,200
all of that was really bothering people more

1256
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,310
and more and more and more.

1257
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,510
And all of a sudden,

1258
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,320
there's a trigger that allows the vibe shift to happen.

1259
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,380
To me, like the interesting question here is,

1260
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,920
what is the landscape of private thoughts and ideas

1261
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,750
and conversations that are happening

1262
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,590
under the surface of Americans?

1263
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:38,100
Especially, my question is how much dormant energy is there

1264
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,780
for this roaring '20s?

1265
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,020
What people are like, no more bullshit, let's get shit done.

1266
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,210
- Yeah, so we'll go through the theory

1267
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,165
of preference falsification just to-

1268
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:46,998
- [Lex] Yes.

1269
00:41:46,998 --> 00:41:47,831
By the way, amazing.

1270
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:49,590
The books on this is fascinating.

1271
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,423
- Yeah, yeah.

1272
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:52,440
So this is exactly, this is one of the all-time great books.

1273
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,120
Incredibly, about 20, 30-year-old book,

1274
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,100
but it's completely modern and current

1275
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,150
in what it talks about

1276
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,430
as well as very deeply historically informed.

1277
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,830
So it's called "Private Truths, Public Lies."

1278
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,663
And it's written

1279
00:42:02,663 --> 00:42:06,273
by a social science professor named Timur Kuran,

1280
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,710
at I think Duke, and his a definitive work on this.

1281
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,240
And so he has this concept,

1282
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,470
he calls preference falsification.

1283
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,630
And so preference falsification is two things,

1284
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,530
preference falsification...

1285
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,707
And you get it from the title of the book,

1286
00:42:17,707 --> 00:42:19,080
"Private Truths, Public Lies."

1287
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,240
So preference falsification is when you believe something

1288
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,020
and you can't say it,

1289
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,400
or/and this is very important, you don't believe something

1290
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,353
and you must say it, right?

1291
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:32,063
And the commonality there is in both cases, you're lying.

1292
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:34,386
You believe something internally,

1293
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,600
and then you're lying about it in public.

1294
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,160
And so the thing, you know,

1295
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,170
and there's sort of the two classic forms of it.

1296
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,370
There's the, you know, for example,

1297
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,840
there's the, I believe communism is rotten,

1298
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,880
but I can't say it version of it.

1299
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,730
But then there's also the famous parable

1300
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,590
of the real-life example,

1301
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,630
but the thing that Vaclav Havel talks

1302
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,130
about in the other good book on this topic,

1303
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,500
which is "The Power of the Powerless,"

1304
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,630
you know, who is an anti-communist resistance fighter

1305
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,947
who ultimately became the, you know,

1306
00:42:58,947 --> 00:43:01,560
the president Czechoslovakia after the fall of the wall.

1307
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,393
But he wrote this book,

1308
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:03,690
and he describes the other side of this,

1309
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,917
which is workers of the world unite, right?

1310
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,430
And so he describes what he calls

1311
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,720
the parable of the greengrocer,

1312
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,740
which is your greengrocer in Prague in 1985.

1313
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,388
And for the last 70 years, it has been...

1314
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:17,790
50 years, it's been absolutely mandatory

1315
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,680
to have a sign in the window of your story

1316
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,020
that says, "Workers of the world, unite," right?

1317
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,490
And it's 1985,

1318
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,527
it is like crystal clear that the workers of the world

1319
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:26,703
are not going to unite.

1320
00:43:27,868 --> 00:43:29,400
(laughs) Like of all the things

1321
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,428
that could happen in the world,

1322
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:31,560
that is not going to happen.

1323
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,090
The Commies have been at that for 70 years,

1324
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:33,923
it is not happening.

1325
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:36,090
But that slogan had better be in your window every morning,

1326
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,650
because if it's not in your window every morning,

1327
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,880
you are not a good communist.

1328
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,200
The secret police are gonna come by

1329
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,286
and they're gonna get you.

1330
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,170
And so the first thing you do

1331
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,003
when you get to the store

1332
00:43:44,003 --> 00:43:44,940
is you put that slogan in the window

1333
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,770
and you make sure that it stays in the window all day long.

1334
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,870
But he says, the thing is, every single person,

1335
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,850
the greengrocer knows the slogan is fake.

1336
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,170
He knows it's a lie.

1337
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,330
Every single person walking past the slogan knows

1338
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:55,163
that it's a lie.

1339
00:43:55,163 --> 00:43:57,213
Every single person walking past the store knows

1340
00:43:57,213 --> 00:43:59,250
that the greengrocer is only putting it up there

1341
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,933
because he has to lie in public.

1342
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:04,050
And the greengrocer has to go through the humiliation

1343
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,580
of knowing that everybody knows

1344
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,500
that he's caving into the system and lying in public.

1345
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,983
And so it turns into demoralization campaign.

1346
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,660
In fact, it's not ideological enforcement anymore

1347
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,070
because everybody knows it's fake.

1348
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:17,910
The authorities know it's fake,

1349
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,200
everybody knows it's fake.

1350
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,480
It's not that they're enforcing the actual ideology

1351
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,130
of the workers of the world uniting.

1352
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,040
It's that they are enforcing compliance, right?

1353
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,240
And compliance with the regime.

1354
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,207
And fuck you, you will comply, right?

1355
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:32,037
And so anyway, that's the other side of that.

1356
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:33,900
And of course, we have lived in the last decade

1357
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,630
through a lot of both of those.

1358
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,550
I think anybody listening to this could name

1359
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,560
a series of slogans that we've all been forced to chant

1360
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,700
for the last decade,

1361
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,500
that everybody knows at this point are just like,

1362
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,640
simply not true.

1363
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,810
I'll let the audience, you know,

1364
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,640
speculate on their own group chats.

1365
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,520
(both laughing)

1366
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,010
- Send Marc your memes online as well, please.

1367
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:53,910
- Yes, yes, exactly.

1368
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,830
Okay, so anyway, so it's the two sides of that, right?

1369
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,040
So it's "Private Truths, Public Lies."

1370
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,600
So then what preference falsification does

1371
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,490
is it talks about extending that from the idea

1372
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,720
of the individual experience in that

1373
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,150
to the idea of the entire society experiencing that, right?

1374
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,070
And this gets to your percentages question, which is like,

1375
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,160
okay, what happens in a society in which people are forced

1376
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,630
to lie in public about what they truly believe?

1377
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,220
What happens number one is that individually

1378
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,450
they're lying in public, and that's bad.

1379
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,530
But the other thing that happens

1380
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,200
is they no longer have an accurate gauge at all

1381
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,479
or any way to estimate how many people agree with them.

1382
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:24,670
And this is how you, and again, this literally is like

1383
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,070
how you get something like the communist system,

1384
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,010
which is like, okay, you end up in a situation

1385
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,170
in which 80 or 90 or 99% of a society

1386
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,910
can actually all be thinking individually,

1387
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,530
I really don't buy this anymore.

1388
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,940
And if anybody would just stand up

1389
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,560
and say it, I would be willing to go along with it,

1390
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,520
but I'm not gonna be the first one

1391
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,990
to put my head on the chopping block.

1392
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,250
But you have no,

1393
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,810
because of the suppression censorship,

1394
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,310
you have no way of knowing

1395
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,390
how many other people agree with you.

1396
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,607
And if the people who agree with you

1397
00:45:47,607 --> 00:45:49,020
are 10% of the population

1398
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,200
and you become part of a movement, you're gonna get killed.

1399
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,090
If 90% of the people agree with you,

1400
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,370
you're gonna win the revolution, right?

1401
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,867
And so the question of like what the percentage actually

1402
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:00,930
is like a really critical question.

1403
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,767
And then, basically, in any sort of authoritarian system,

1404
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:04,710
you can't like run a survey, right?

1405
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:05,757
To get an accurate result.

1406
00:46:05,757 --> 00:46:07,800
And so you actually can't know until you put it to the test.

1407
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,230
And then what he describes in the book

1408
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,860
is it's always put at the test in the same way.

1409
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,513
This is exactly what's happened for the last two years,

1410
00:46:12,513 --> 00:46:14,460
like 100% of exactly what's happened.

1411
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,080
It's like straight outta this book,

1412
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,910
which is somebody, Elon, sticks his hand up (laughs)

1413
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,820
and says, "The workers of the world are not going to unite."

1414
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,653
- Yeah. - Right.

1415
00:46:24,653 --> 00:46:26,599
Or the emperor is actually wearing no clothes, right?

1416
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:28,140
You know that famous parable, right?

1417
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,580
So one person stands up and does it,

1418
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,830
and literally that person is standing there by themselves,

1419
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,547
and everybody else in the audience is like,

1420
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:36,990
"Ooh, I wonder what's gonna happen to that guy," right?

1421
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,310
But again, nobody knows.

1422
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,810
Elon doesn't know, the first guy doesn't know,

1423
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,787
other people don't know, like, which way is this gonna go?

1424
00:46:41,787 --> 00:46:43,680
And it may be that's a minority position

1425
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,060
and that's the way to get yourself killed.

1426
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,890
Or it may be that's a majority position

1427
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,350
and you are now the leader of a revolution.

1428
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,000
And then basically, of course, what happens is, okay,

1429
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,730
the first guy does that doesn't get killed, (laughs)

1430
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,774
the second guy does...

1431
00:46:54,774 --> 00:46:56,100
Well, a lot of the time that guy does get killed,

1432
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,300
but when the guy doesn't get killed,

1433
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,650
then a second guy pops his head up,

1434
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,820
says the same thing, all right?

1435
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,350
Now, you've got two.

1436
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,570
Two leads to four, four leads to eight, eight leads to 16.

1437
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,090
And then as we saw with the fall of the Berlin Wall,

1438
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,510
this is what happened in Russia and Eastern Europe in '89,

1439
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,770
when it goes, it can go, right?

1440
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,150
And then it rips.

1441
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,370
And then what happens is very, very quickly,

1442
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,710
if it turns out that you had a large percentage

1443
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,543
of the population

1444
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,810
that actually believed the different thing,

1445
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,070
it turns out all of a sudden everybody

1446
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,367
has this giant epiphany that says,

1447
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:23,340
"Oh, I'm actually part of the majority."

1448
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,290
And at that point, like you were on the freight train

1449
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:26,280
to revolution, right?

1450
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,320
Like it is rolling.

1451
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,153
Right, now.

1452
00:47:29,153 --> 00:47:30,960
The other part of this is the distinction

1453
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,020
between the role of the elites and the masses.

1454
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,853
And here the best book is called

1455
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:37,290
"The True Believer," which is the Eric Hoffer book.

1456
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,510
And so the nuance you have to put on this

1457
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,527
is the elites play a giant role in this

1458
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,450
'cause the elites do idea formation and communication.

1459
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,880
But the elites, by definition are a small minority.

1460
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,550
And so there's also this giant role played by the masses,

1461
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,650
and the masses are not necessarily thinking these things

1462
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,513
through in the same intellectualized formal way

1463
00:47:54,513 --> 00:47:56,100
that the elites are,

1464
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,630
but they are for sure experiencing these things

1465
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,460
in their daily lives, and they for sure have

1466
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,137
at least very strong emotional views on them.

1467
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:03,240
And so when you really get the revolution,

1468
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,100
it's when you get the elites lined up with,

1469
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,500
or either the current elites change

1470
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,990
or a new set of counter elites,

1471
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,957
basically come along and say,

1472
00:48:10,957 --> 00:48:12,270
"No, there's actually a different better way

1473
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,110
to live."

1474
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,730
And then the people basically decide

1475
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,620
to follow the, you know, to follow the counter elite.

1476
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,210
So that's the other dimension to it.

1477
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,550
And of course, that part is also happening right now.

1478
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,677
And again, case study one of that would be Elon

1479
00:48:22,677 --> 00:48:23,880
and you know, who turns out, you know,

1480
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,230
in truly massive following.

1481
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,540
- And he has done that over and over

1482
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,060
in different industries, not just saying crazy shit online,

1483
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,200
but saying crazy shit in the realm of space,

1484
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,180
in the realm of autonomous driving,

1485
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,530
in the realm of AI,

1486
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,880
just over and over and over again.

1487
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,290
Turns out saying crazy shit

1488
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,120
is one of the ways to do a revolution

1489
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,350
and to actually make progress.

1490
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,150
- Yeah. And it's like, well, but then there's the test.

1491
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,410
Is it crazy shit or is it the truth?

1492
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,330
- Yeah. - Right.

1493
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,076
You know, and this is where, you know,

1494
00:48:50,076 --> 00:48:51,720
there are many specific things about Elon's genius,

1495
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,020
but one of the really core ones

1496
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,440
is an absolute dedication to the truth.

1497
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,670
And so when Elon says something,

1498
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,040
it sounds like crazy shit, but in his mind it's true.

1499
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,150
Now, is he always right?

1500
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,290
No.

1501
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,190
Sometimes the rockets crash,

1502
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,690
like, you know, sometimes he's wrong.

1503
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,280
Yeah, he's human, he's like anybody else.

1504
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,113
He's not right all the time.

1505
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:08,700
But at least my through line with him both in

1506
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,650
what he says in public and what he says in private,

1507
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,420
which by the way are the exact same things.

1508
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,380
He does not do this.

1509
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,330
He doesn't lie in public about what he believes in private,

1510
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,440
or at least he doesn't do that anymore.

1511
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,920
Like he's 100% consistent in my experience.

1512
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,850
By the way, there's two guys

1513
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,670
who are 100% consistent like that I know.

1514
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,863
Elon and Trump.

1515
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:25,770
(both laughing)

1516
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,510
- Yeah. - Whatever you think of them.

1517
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,670
- [Lex] Yeah.

1518
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,730
- What they say in private is 100% identical

1519
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:30,563
to what they say in public.

1520
00:49:30,563 --> 00:49:31,680
Like, they're completely transparent,

1521
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,780
they're completely honest in that way, right?

1522
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,770
Which is like, and again,

1523
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,700
it's not like they're perfect people,

1524
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,378
but they're honest in that way.

1525
00:49:37,378 --> 00:49:38,910
And it makes them potentially both

1526
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,130
as they have been very powerful leaders of these movements,

1527
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,300
'cause they're both willing to stand up

1528
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,520
and say the thing that if it's true,

1529
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,260
it turns out to be the thing in many cases

1530
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,170
that many or most or almost everyone else actually believes,

1531
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,150
but nobody was actually willing to say out loud.

1532
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,890
And so they can actually catalyze these shifts.

1533
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,660
And I mean, I think this framework is exactly

1534
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,070
why Trump took over the Republican Party,

1535
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,510
as I think Trump stood up there on stage

1536
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,130
with all these other kind of conventional Republicans,

1537
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,390
and he started saying things out loud

1538
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,520
that it turned out the base really was,

1539
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,540
they were either already believing

1540
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,920
or they were prone to believe,

1541
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,540
and he was the only one who was saying them.

1542
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,310
And so the again, elite masses,

1543
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,110
he was the elite, the voters of the masses

1544
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,180
and the voters decided, you know,

1545
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,060
no, no more bushes, like we're going this other direction.

1546
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,590
That's the mechanism of social change.

1547
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,670
Like what we just described

1548
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,230
is like the actual mechanism of social change.

1549
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,690
It is fascinating to me that we have been living

1550
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:22,950
through exactly this.

1551
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,810
We've been living through everything exactly

1552
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:26,430
what Timur Kuran describes,

1553
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,830
everything that Vaclav Havel described, (laughs)

1554
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,540
you know, Black Squares and Instagram,

1555
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,830
like the whole thing, right?

1556
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,330
All of it.

1557
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,370
And we've been living through the, you know,

1558
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,551
the true believer elites masses, you know, thing with,

1559
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:39,810
you know, with a set of like basically incredibly corrupt

1560
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:40,800
elites wondering why they don't

1561
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,850
have the loyalty masses anymore,

1562
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,920
and a set of new elites that are running away with things.

1563
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,753
And so like,

1564
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:47,310
we're living through this like incredible applied case study

1565
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,450
of these ideas.

1566
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,167
And you know, if there's a moral of the story, it is,

1567
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:51,840
you know, I think fairly obvious,

1568
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,600
which is it's a really bad idea for a society

1569
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,830
to wedge itself into a position

1570
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:56,910
in which most people don't believe

1571
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,290
the fundamental precepts

1572
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,940
of what they're told they have to do, you know,

1573
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,080
to be good people like that.

1574
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,000
That is just not a good state to be in.

1575
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,760
- So one of the ways to avoid that in the future maybe,

1576
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,850
is to keep the delta between what's said in private

1577
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,890
and what's said in public small.

1578
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,722
- Yeah. It's like, well, this is sort of the siren song

1579
00:51:12,722 --> 00:51:14,580
of censorship is we can keep people from saying things,

1580
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,680
which means we can keep people from thinking things.

1581
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,513
- [Lex] Yeah.

1582
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:18,840
- And you know, by the way,

1583
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,400
that may work for a while, right?

1584
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,610
Like, you know, I mean, again, the hard form,

1585
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,010
you know, Soviet Union owning a mimeograph,

1586
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,930
pre-photocopiers, there were mimeograph machines

1587
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,030
that were used to make samizdat and underground newspapers,

1588
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,190
which is the mechanism of written communication

1589
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,023
of radical ideas.

1590
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,390
Ownership of a mimeograph machine

1591
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,290
was punishable by death, right?

1592
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,332
So that's the hard version, right?

1593
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:43,290
You know, the soft version is somebody clicks a button

1594
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,410
in Washington and you are erased from the internet, right?

1595
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:48,510
Like, which, you know, good news, you're still alive.

1596
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,343
Bad news is, you know,

1597
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:51,240
shame about not being able to get a job.

1598
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,830
You know, too bad your family now, you know,

1599
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,870
they hates you and won't talk to you, but you know,

1600
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:57,600
you know, whatever the version of cancellation has been.

1601
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,730
And so like, does that work?

1602
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,464
Like maybe it works for a while,

1603
00:52:01,464 --> 00:52:03,420
like it worked for the Soviet Union for a while,

1604
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,430
you know, in its way, especially when it was coupled with,

1605
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:06,510
you know, official state power.

1606
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:07,800
But when it unwinds,

1607
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,590
it can unwind with like incredible speed and ferocity.

1608
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,390
'Cause to your point, there's all this bottled up energy.

1609
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,120
Now, your question was like, what are the percentages?

1610
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,170
Like what's the breakdown?

1611
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,050
And so my rough guess,

1612
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,910
just based on what I've seen in my world

1613
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:24,000
is it's something like 20, 60, 20.

1614
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,320
It's like you've got 20%,

1615
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,480
like true believers in whatever is, you know,

1616
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,900
the current thing, you know, you got 20%

1617
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,372
of people who are just like true believers of whatever they,

1618
00:52:32,372 --> 00:52:33,531
you know, whatever's in the new, like I say,

1619
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:35,187
whatever's in The New York Times, Harvard professors

1620
00:52:35,187 --> 00:52:37,714
and the Ford Foundation, like they're just believe.

1621
00:52:37,714 --> 00:52:39,330
And by the way, maybe it's 10, maybe it's five,

1622
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:40,980
but let's say generously it's 20.

1623
00:52:42,257 --> 00:52:45,360
So you know, 20% kind of full-on revolutionaries.

1624
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,270
And then you've got, let's call it 20% on the other side

1625
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,040
that are like, "No, I'm not on board with this.

1626
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,880
This is crazy.

1627
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,780
I'm not signing up for this."

1628
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,240
But, you know, they view themselves

1629
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,230
as they're in a small minority,

1630
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,150
and in fact, they start out in a small minority,

1631
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,670
'cause what happens is the 60% go with the first 20%,

1632
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,140
not the second 20%.

1633
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,360
So you've got this large middle of people.

1634
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,730
And it's not that the people in the middle

1635
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:06,727
are not smart or anything like that.

1636
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:09,480
It's that they just have like normal lives

1637
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,680
and they're just trying to get by

1638
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,940
and they're just trying to go to work each day

1639
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,760
and do a good job and be a good person and raise their kids

1640
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,970
and, you know, have a little bit of time to watch the game.

1641
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,650
And they're just not engaged in the cut

1642
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:20,850
and thrust of, you know,

1643
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,473
political activism or any of this stuff.

1644
00:53:22,473 --> 00:53:23,853
It's just not their thing.

1645
00:53:25,181 --> 00:53:27,084
But that's where the over socialization comes in,

1646
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:30,150
it's just like, okay, by default, the 60% will go along

1647
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,100
with the 20% of the radical revolutionaries,

1648
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,990
at least for a while.

1649
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:36,750
And then the counter elite is in this other 20%.

1650
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,290
And over time, they build up a theory and network

1651
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:43,830
and ability to resist and a new set of representatives,

1652
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:44,880
in a new set of ideas.

1653
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,063
And then at some point there's a contest and then, right?

1654
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,400
And then the question is, what happens in the middle?

1655
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,658
What happens in the 60%?

1656
00:53:52,658 --> 00:53:53,491
And it's kinda my point,

1657
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:55,800
it's not even really does the 60% change their beliefs

1658
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,113
as much as it's like, okay, what is the thing

1659
00:53:58,113 --> 00:54:02,190
that 60% now decides to basically fall into step with?

1660
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,050
And I think that, in the valley,

1661
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,870
that 60% for the last decade decided to be woke

1662
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,160
and, you know, extremely,

1663
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,360
I would say, (laughs) on edge on a lot of things.

1664
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,510
And you know, that 60% is pivoting in real time.

1665
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,800
They're just done.

1666
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,540
They've just had it.

1667
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,030
- And I would love to see where that pivot goes

1668
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,700
'cause there's internal battles happening right now, right?

1669
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,810
- So this is the other thing, okay,

1670
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:26,910
so there's two forms of things,

1671
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,950
and Timur has actually talked about this,

1672
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,270
Professor Kuran has talked about this.

1673
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,590
So one is, he said,

1674
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:32,790
this is the kind of unwind

1675
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,500
where what you're gonna have is you're now gonna have people

1676
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,166
in the other direction. You're gonna have people who claim

1677
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:37,050
that they supported Trump all along,

1678
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,720
who actually didn't, (laughs)

1679
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,890
right? - Right.

1680
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,335
- So it's gonna swing the other way.

1681
00:54:42,335 --> 00:54:43,620
And by the way, Trump's not the only part of this,

1682
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,420
but you know, he's just a convenient shorthand for,

1683
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,035
you know, for a lot of this.

1684
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:48,000
But, you know, whatever it is,

1685
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,990
you'll have people who will say,

1686
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,340
well, I never supported the EI, right?

1687
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,840
Or I never supported ESG,

1688
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,673
or I never thought

1689
00:54:52,673 --> 00:54:53,790
we should have canceled that person, right?

1690
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,220
Where of course, they were full on a part of the mob,

1691
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,170
like, you know, kind of at that moment. And so anyway,

1692
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,747
so you'll have preference falsification happening

1693
00:54:59,747 --> 00:55:01,020
in the other direction.

1694
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,540
And his prediction, I think, basically is you'll end up

1695
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,360
with the same quote, "problem" on the other side.

1696
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,740
Now, will that happen here?

1697
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,573
I don't know.

1698
00:55:08,573 --> 00:55:10,599
You know, how far is American society willing to go

1699
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:11,432
on any of these things?

1700
00:55:11,432 --> 00:55:12,265
I don't know.

1701
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:13,953
But like, there is some question there.

1702
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,590
And then the other part of it is, okay,

1703
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,750
now you have this, you know, elite that is used

1704
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,494
to being in power for the last decade.

1705
00:55:21,494 --> 00:55:23,100
And by the way, many of those people are still in power

1706
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,660
and they're in very, you know, important positions.

1707
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,857
And The New York Times is still The New York Times,

1708
00:55:25,857 --> 00:55:27,000
and Harvard is still Harvard.

1709
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,093
And like, those people haven't changed like at all, right?

1710
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:32,370
And bureaucrats in the governments and,

1711
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,780
you know, senior democratic,

1712
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,517
you know, politicians and so forth.

1713
00:55:35,517 --> 00:55:36,660
And they're sitting there, you know,

1714
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,357
right now feeling like reality has just smacked them hard

1715
00:55:38,357 --> 00:55:41,280
in the face 'cause they lost the election so badly.

1716
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,617
But they're now going into a,

1717
00:55:43,617 --> 00:55:45,180
and specifically the Democratic Party,

1718
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,163
is going into a Civil War, right?

1719
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,070
And that form of the Civil War is completely predictable

1720
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:51,150
and it's exactly what's happening,

1721
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,010
which is half of them are saying,

1722
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,480
we need to go back to the center.

1723
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,330
We need to de-radicalize 'cause we've lost the people.

1724
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:58,680
We've lost the people in the middle

1725
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,030
and so we need to go back to the middle

1726
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:00,863
in order to be able

1727
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:03,510
to get 50% plus one in an election, right?

1728
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:04,597
And then the other half of them are saying,

1729
00:56:04,597 --> 00:56:05,940
"No, we weren't true to our principles.

1730
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,290
We were too weak, we were too soft.

1731
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:08,850
You know, we must become more revolutionary.

1732
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,770
We must double down and we must, you know, celebrate,

1733
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,790
you know, murders in the street

1734
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:14,131
of health insurance executives."

1735
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:15,780
And that right now is like a real fight.

1736
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,730
- If I could tell you a little personal story

1737
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,430
that breaks my heart a little bit,

1738
00:56:20,524 --> 00:56:23,340
there's a professor, a historian, I won't say who,

1739
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,140
who I admire deeply, love his work.

1740
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,080
He's a kind of a heretical thinker.

1741
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,620
And we were talking about having a podcast,

1742
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,030
on doing a podcast.

1743
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:37,050
And he eventually said that, "You know what, at this time,

1744
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:41,730
given your guest list, I just don't want the headache

1745
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,480
of being in the faculty meetings

1746
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,580
in my particular institution."

1747
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,340
And I asked, "Who are the particular figures

1748
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,900
in this guest list?"

1749
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,397
He said, "Trump."

1750
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,077
And the second one, he said,

1751
00:56:56,077 --> 00:56:57,630
"That you announced your interest

1752
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,037
to talk to Vladimir Putin."

1753
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,280
So I just don't want the headache.

1754
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,510
Now, I fully believe it would surprise a lot of people

1755
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,190
if I said who it is.

1756
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,590
You know, this is a person who's not bothered

1757
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:13,200
by the guest list.

1758
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,570
And I should also say that 80-plus percent

1759
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,910
of the guest list is left wing.

1760
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:18,743
Okay?

1761
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,560
Nevertheless, he just doesn't want the headache.

1762
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,030
And that speaks to the thing

1763
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:25,590
that you've kind of mentioned,

1764
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,660
that you just don't want the headache.

1765
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,390
You just want to just have a pleasant morning

1766
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,630
with some coffee and talk to your fellow professors.

1767
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:36,060
And I think a lot of people are feeling that in universities

1768
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,850
and in other contexts, in tech companies.

1769
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:43,260
And I wonder if that shifts, how quickly that shifts?

1770
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:47,020
And there, the percentages you mentioned 20, 60, 20 matters

1771
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:50,850
and the contents of the private groups matters,

1772
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:53,460
and the dynamics of how that shifts matters.

1773
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,840
'Cause it's very possible,

1774
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,120
nothing really changes in universities

1775
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,533
and in major tech companies.

1776
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:02,250
There's a kind of excitement right now

1777
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,400
for potential revolution

1778
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,910
and these new ideas, these new vibes to reverberate

1779
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,410
through these companies and universities,

1780
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:14,670
but it's possible the wall will hold.

1781
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:15,503
- Yeah.

1782
00:58:15,503 --> 00:58:17,070
So he's a friend of yours,

1783
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,150
I respect that you don't wanna name him.

1784
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,530
I also respect you don't wanna beat on him,

1785
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,230
so I would like to beat on him on your behalf.

1786
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,820
Does he have tenure?

1787
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,653
- Yes.

1788
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,300
He should use it.

1789
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,120
- So this is the thing, right?

1790
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,067
This is the ultimate indictment of the corruption

1791
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:34,530
and the rot at the heart of our education system,

1792
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:35,700
at the heart of these universities.

1793
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,200
And it's, by the way, it's like across the board,

1794
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,390
it's like all the top universities.

1795
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,896
It's like, 'cause the siren song for right?

1796
00:58:41,896 --> 00:58:44,250
What it's been for 70 years, whatever, of the tenure system,

1797
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,220
peer review system, tenure system, which is like, yeah,

1798
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,160
you work your butt off as an academic to get a professorship

1799
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,993
and then to get tenure,

1800
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:55,230
because then you can say what you actually think, right?

1801
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:58,230
Then you can do your work and your research

1802
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,640
and your speaking and your teaching

1803
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,030
without fear of being fired, right?

1804
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,890
Without fear of being canceled.

1805
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,990
Like academic freedom.

1806
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,170
I mean, think of the term academic freedom

1807
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:12,690
and then think of what these people have done to it.

1808
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:15,240
Like it's gone,

1809
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:20,240
like that entire thing was fake and is completely rotten.

1810
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,553
And these people are completely,

1811
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,330
completely giving up the entire moral foundation

1812
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,740
of the system that's been built for them,

1813
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,573
which by the way,

1814
00:59:29,573 --> 00:59:33,123
is paid for virtually 100% by taxpayer money.

1815
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,500
- What's the inkling of hope in this?

1816
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,210
Like what this particular person

1817
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,450
and others who hear this, what can give them strength,

1818
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,370
inspiration, and courage?

1819
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,660
- That the population at large

1820
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,310
is gonna realize the corruption in their industry

1821
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:49,536
and it's going to withdraw the funding?

1822
00:59:49,536 --> 00:59:50,369
- (laughs) It's okay.

1823
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:53,094
So desperation. (laughs) - No, no, no, no, no.

1824
00:59:53,094 --> 00:59:54,760
Think about what happens next. Okay, so let's go through it.

1825
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,180
So the universities are funded

1826
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,430
by four primary sources of federal funding.

1827
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,260
The big one is a federal student loan program,

1828
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,093
which is, you know,

1829
01:00:02,093 --> 01:00:03,270
in the many trillions of dollars at this point.

1830
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,590
And then only spiraling, you know,

1831
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,990
way faster than inflation.

1832
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:07,823
That's number one.

1833
01:00:07,823 --> 01:00:08,880
Number two is federal research funding,

1834
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,290
which is also very large.

1835
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:13,470
And you probably know that when a scientist

1836
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,240
at the university gets a research grant,

1837
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,120
the university rakes as much as 70% of the money

1838
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,825
for central uses.

1839
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:20,880
- [Lex] Yeah.

1840
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,070
- Number three is tax exemption at the operating level,

1841
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:24,120
which is based on the idea

1842
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,280
that these are nonprofit institutions as opposed to,

1843
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,980
let's say, political institutions.

1844
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,230
And then number four is tax exemptions

1845
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,180
at the endowment level, you know,

1846
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,350
which is the financial buffer

1847
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,500
that these places have.

1848
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,600
Anybody who's been close to a university budget

1849
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,160
will basically see that what would happen

1850
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,770
if you withdrew those sources of federal taxpayer money,

1851
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,480
and then for the state schools, the state money,

1852
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,310
they all instantly go bankrupt.

1853
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,413
And then you could rebuild.

1854
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:51,780
Then you could rebuild,

1855
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:52,653
'cause the problem right now, you know,

1856
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:54,090
like the folks at University of Austin

1857
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:55,410
are like mounting a very valiant effort,

1858
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,240
and I hope that they succeed and I'm cheering for them,

1859
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,970
but the problem is, you're now inserting.

1860
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,500
Suppose you and I wanna start a new university

1861
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,360
and we wanna hire all the free thinking professors,

1862
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,280
and we wanna have the place that fixes all this.

1863
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,410
Practically speaking, we can't do it

1864
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,410
because we can't get access to that money.

1865
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,243
I'll give you the most direct reason,

1866
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:11,610
we can't get access to that money,

1867
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,890
we can't get access to federal student funding.

1868
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:16,110
Do you know how universities are accredited

1869
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,130
for the purpose of getting access

1870
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,300
to federal student funding?

1871
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,400
Federal student loans?

1872
01:01:20,756 --> 01:01:21,930
They're accredited by the government,

1873
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,730
but not directly, indirectly.

1874
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:25,800
They're not accredited by the Department of Education.

1875
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,760
Instead, what happens is,

1876
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,180
the Department of Education accredits accreditation bureaus

1877
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,490
that are nonprofits that do the accreditation.

1878
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:35,670
Guess what the composition of the accreditation bureaus is?

1879
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:36,970
The existing universities.

1880
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,750
They're in complete control.

1881
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,650
The incumbents are in complete control

1882
01:01:43,176 --> 01:01:44,430
as to who gets access to federal student loan money.

1883
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,410
Guess how enthusiastic they are about accrediting

1884
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:47,260
a new university?

1885
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:51,540
Right, and so we have a government funded

1886
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,420
and supported cartel that has gone...

1887
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,440
I mean, it's just obvious now.

1888
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,610
It's just gone like sideways

1889
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:58,650
in basically any possible way it could go sideways,

1890
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,030
including, I mean, literally as you know,

1891
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:02,436
students getting beaten up on campus for being,

1892
01:02:02,436 --> 01:02:03,900
you know, the wrong religion.

1893
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,120
They're just wrong in every possible way at this point.

1894
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,490
And it's all in the federal taxpayer back.

1895
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:11,460
And there is no way, I mean, my opinion,

1896
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:14,730
there is no way to fix these things without replacing them.

1897
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:15,810
And there's no way to replace them

1898
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:16,920
without letting them fail.

1899
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,590
And by the way, it's like everything in life.

1900
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:21,420
I mean, in a sense, this is like the most obvious conclusion

1901
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,220
of all time, which is what happens

1902
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,830
in the business world when a company does a bad job,

1903
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:26,663
is they go bankrupt

1904
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:28,407
and another company takes its place, right?

1905
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:30,660
And that's how you get progress.

1906
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,420
And of course, below that is what happens is this

1907
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,840
is the process of evolution, right?

1908
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,250
Why does anything ever get better?

1909
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,540
'Cause things are tested and tried,

1910
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,053
and then you, you know,

1911
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:39,180
the things that are good survive.

1912
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,160
And so these places have cut themselves off.

1913
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,930
They've been allowed to cut themselves off from both,

1914
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,970
from evolution at the institutional level

1915
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,610
and evolution of the individual level as shown

1916
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,970
by the just widespread abuse of tenure.

1917
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:53,610
And so we've just stalled out.

1918
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,320
We built an ossified system, an ossified,

1919
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,370
centralized, corrupt system,

1920
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,220
where we're surprised by the results.

1921
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,260
They are not fixable in their current form.

1922
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,760
- I disagree with you on that.

1923
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,920
Maybe it's grounded in hope

1924
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,950
that I believe you can revolutionize the system from within

1925
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,490
because I do believe Stanford and MIT are important.

1926
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,890
- Oh, but that logic doesn't follow at all.

1927
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,630
That's underpants gnome logic.

1928
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,760
- Underpants gnome, can you explain what that means?

1929
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,690
- Underpants gnomes logic.

1930
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,550
So I just started watching a key touchstone

1931
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:21,960
of American culture with my nine-year-old,

1932
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,760
which of course is "South Park."

1933
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,750
- Yes. - And there is-

1934
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:25,583
- Wow.

1935
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:26,416
- And there is a,

1936
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,050
which by the way is a little aggressive for a nine-year-old.

1937
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:28,883
- Very aggressive.

1938
01:03:28,883 --> 01:03:29,730
- But he likes it.

1939
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:32,460
So he's learning all kinds of new words.

1940
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,110
- And all kinds of new ideas.

1941
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:34,943
But yeah, go on.

1942
01:03:34,943 --> 01:03:36,300
- I told him, I said, "You're gonna hear words on here

1943
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,470
that you are not allowed to use."

1944
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:38,820
- Right. (laughs)

1945
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,653
Education.

1946
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:41,070
- And I said, "You know how we have an agreement

1947
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,727
that we never lie to mommy?"

1948
01:03:42,727 --> 01:03:45,510
(both laughing)

1949
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,190
- [Lex] Yeah. - I said, "Not using a word

1950
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,790
that you learn in here does not count as lying."

1951
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,140
- [Lex] Wow. - "And keep that in mind."

1952
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,510
- This is Orwellian redefinition of lying.

1953
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:55,591
But yes, go ahead.

1954
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:56,490
- And of course, in the very opening episode,

1955
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,960
in the first 30 seconds,

1956
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,850
one of the kids calls the other kid a dildo.

1957
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,380
Right, we're off to the races.

1958
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,467
- Yep. Let's go.

1959
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:04,560
- "Daddy, what's a dildo?"

1960
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,589
- [Lex] Yep.

1961
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:07,148
(both laughing)

1962
01:04:07,148 --> 01:04:09,499
- So, you know, "Sorry son, I don't know."

1963
01:04:09,499 --> 01:04:11,315
- [Lex] Yeah.

1964
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:14,070
- So the- - Underpants gnome.

1965
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:17,130
- So famous episode of "South Park," the underpants gnomes.

1966
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,450
So there's this rat...

1967
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:19,560
All the kids basically realize

1968
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,790
that their underpants are going missing

1969
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,620
from their dresser drawers.

1970
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,730
Somebody's stealing the underpants.

1971
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,140
And it's just like, well, who on earth would steal

1972
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,220
the underpants?

1973
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,410
And it turns out it's the underpants gnomes.

1974
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,330
And it turns out the underpants gnomes that come to town

1975
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:31,710
and they've got this little underground warrant

1976
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,630
of tunnels in storage places for all the underpants.

1977
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:35,220
And so they go out at night, they steal the underpants,

1978
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,530
and the kids discover that, you know, the underpants gnomes,

1979
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,940
and they're, you know, "What are you doing?

1980
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,107
Like what's the point of this?"

1981
01:04:40,107 --> 01:04:43,020
And so the underpants gnomes present their master plan,

1982
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,490
which is a three-part plan,

1983
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:47,130
which is step one, collect underpants,

1984
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,200
step three, profit. - Yeah.

1985
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,002
- [Marc] Step two, question mark.

1986
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:52,320
(Lex laughing)

1987
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,370
- [Lex] Yeah, yeah.

1988
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:54,570
- So you just proposed

1989
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:55,950
the underpants gnome- - Yeah.

1990
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,150
- Which is very common in politics.

1991
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,380
Oh, so the form of this in politics

1992
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:00,570
is we must do something. - Yeah.

1993
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:03,543
- This is something, therefore we must do this.

1994
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:06,480
But there's no causal logic chain

1995
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,210
in there at all to expect that's actually gonna succeed

1996
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,200
'cause there's no reason to believe

1997
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,033
that it is. - Yeah, but-

1998
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:11,866
- And it's the same thing,

1999
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:12,720
but this is what I hear all the time,

2000
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,083
and I will let you talk as the host of the show in a moment,

2001
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:19,781
but I hear this all the time.

2002
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:21,300
I hear this, I have friends who are on these boards,

2003
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,133
right? - Yeah.

2004
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:22,966
- Very involved in these places,

2005
01:05:22,966 --> 01:05:23,799
and I hear this all the time, which is like,

2006
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,710
"Oh, these are very important.

2007
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:27,210
We must fix them."

2008
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:28,910
And so therefore, they're fixable.

2009
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,580
There's no logic chain there at all.

2010
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:34,500
- If there's that pressure that you described

2011
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,540
in terms of cutting funding,

2012
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,130
then you have the leverage

2013
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:40,470
to fire a lot of the administration

2014
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:43,200
and have new leadership that steps up

2015
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,710
that aligns with this vision

2016
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,960
that things really need to change

2017
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,430
at the heads of the universities.

2018
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:53,610
And they put students and faculty primary,

2019
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,410
fire a lot of the administration

2020
01:05:55,410 --> 01:06:00,000
and realign and reinvigorate this idea of freedom of thought

2021
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,193
and intellectual freedom.

2022
01:06:01,193 --> 01:06:02,730
I mean, I don't...

2023
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:05,100
Because there is already a framework

2024
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,500
of great institutions that's there,

2025
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,720
and the way they talk about what it means

2026
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,450
to be a great institution is aligned with this very idea

2027
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:14,280
that you're talking about.

2028
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,770
It's this meaning like intellectual freedom,

2029
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:18,930
the idea of tenure, right?

2030
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:21,150
On the surface it's aligned,

2031
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,400
underneath it's become corrupted.

2032
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,440
- If we say free speech and academic freedom, often enough,

2033
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,720
sooner or later, these tenured professors will get brave.

2034
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,100
- Wait, do you think the universities

2035
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,020
are fundamentally broken?

2036
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,130
Okay, so how do you fix it?

2037
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:37,130
How do you have institutions for educating 20-year-olds

2038
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,490
and institutions that host researchers

2039
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:44,640
that have the freedom to do epic shit,

2040
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,030
like research-type shit that's outside the scopes

2041
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:50,040
of R&D departments and inside companies?

2042
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,900
So how do you create institution like that?

2043
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,100
- How do you create a good restaurant

2044
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,200
when the one down the street sucks?

2045
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,300
- Right. You invent something new?

2046
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,560
- You open a new restaurant.

2047
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,393
- Yeah.

2048
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:01,650
- Like how often in your life

2049
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,670
have you experienced a restaurant

2050
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:04,080
that's just absolutely horrible,

2051
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,310
and it's poisoning all of its customers

2052
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,240
and the food tastes terrible,

2053
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,570
and then three years later you go back and it's fantastic?

2054
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:10,863
Charlie Munger actually had the best comment on,

2055
01:07:10,863 --> 01:07:11,730
this great investor,

2056
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:12,675
Charlie Munger, has great comment.

2057
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:14,790
He was once asked, he's like, you know, his, you know,

2058
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,380
General Electric was going through all these challenges

2059
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,208
and he was asked to do Q&A.

2060
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,041
It said, "How would you fix the culture

2061
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:19,874
at General Electric?"

2062
01:07:19,874 --> 01:07:21,270
And he said, "Fix the culture at General Electric?"

2063
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,889
He said, "I couldn't even fix the culture at a restaurant."

2064
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:25,860
(Lex laughing)

2065
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,693
Like, it's insane.

2066
01:07:26,693 --> 01:07:27,990
Like obviously you can't do it.

2067
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,823
- [Lex] Yeah.

2068
01:07:28,823 --> 01:07:30,090
- Nobody in business thinks you can do that.

2069
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:32,550
Like, it's impossible.

2070
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,410
Like it's not, now look,

2071
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:36,436
having said all that, I should also express this

2072
01:07:36,436 --> 01:07:38,640
'cause I have a lot of friends who work at these places

2073
01:07:39,924 --> 01:07:40,980
and are involved in various attempts to fix these.

2074
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:43,380
I hope that I'm wrong, I would love to be wrong.

2075
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:46,320
I would love for the underpants gnome step two

2076
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,210
to be something clear and straightforward

2077
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:50,400
that they can figure out how to do. I would love to fix it,

2078
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,560
I'd love to see them come back to their spoken principles,

2079
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,460
I think that'd be great.

2080
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,280
I'd love to see the professors with tenure get bravery.

2081
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,800
I would love to see, I mean, it would be fantastic.

2082
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,880
You know, my partner

2083
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,620
and I have done like a lot of public speaking on this topic,

2084
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,840
it's been intended to not just be harsh,

2085
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,970
but also be like, okay, like these challenges

2086
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:07,530
have to be confronted directly.

2087
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,210
By the way, let me also say something positive.

2088
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,280
You know, especially post-October 7th,

2089
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,160
there are a bunch of very smart people who are major donors

2090
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,680
and board members of these institutions like Marc Rowan,

2091
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,613
you know, who are really coming in trying to, you know,

2092
01:08:18,613 --> 01:08:20,609
I think legitimately trying to fix these places.

2093
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:22,050
I have a friend on the executive committee

2094
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:23,490
at one of the top technical universities.

2095
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,490
He's working overtime to try to do this.

2096
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,270
Man, I hope they can figure it out.

2097
01:08:29,609 --> 01:08:30,930
But the counter question would just be like,

2098
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:31,859
do you see it actually happening

2099
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:34,319
at a single one of these places?

2100
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,120
- I'm a person that believes in leadership.

2101
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,580
If you have the right leadership-

2102
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,510
- [Marc] Right.

2103
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,520
- The whole system can be changed.

2104
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,765
- So here's a question for your friend

2105
01:08:42,765 --> 01:08:44,189
who have tenure at one of these places,

2106
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:45,840
which is who runs his university?

2107
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:48,090
- You know how I think runs it?

2108
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:48,990
- [Marc] Yeah.

2109
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:51,180
- Whoever the fuck says they run it,

2110
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,770
that's what great leadership is.

2111
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:53,603
Like a president

2112
01:08:53,603 --> 01:08:54,649
has that power. - But how does-

2113
01:08:54,649 --> 01:08:56,370
- President of university has the leverage

2114
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:58,140
'cause they can mouth off like Elon can.

2115
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,490
- Can they fire the professors?

2116
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:03,118
- They can fire them through being vocal publicly, yes.

2117
01:09:03,118 --> 01:09:04,260
- Can they fire the professors?

2118
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,479
- What are you talking about legally?

2119
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:06,313
- [Marc] Can they fire-

2120
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:07,529
- No, they cannot fire the professors.

2121
01:09:07,529 --> 01:09:08,760
- Then we know who runs the university.

2122
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,593
- The professors?

2123
01:09:09,593 --> 01:09:10,710
- Yeah, professors.

2124
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:11,609
The professors and the students,

2125
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:13,260
the professors and the feral students.

2126
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,093
Then they're, of course,

2127
01:09:14,093 --> 01:09:15,660
in a radicalization feedback cycle driving-

2128
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,377
- You said feral students? - The feral students.

2129
01:09:18,377 --> 01:09:19,211
Yeah, the feral students.

2130
01:09:19,211 --> 01:09:20,729
What happens when you're put in charge

2131
01:09:20,729 --> 01:09:22,439
of your bureaucracy where the thing

2132
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:24,832
that the bureaucracy knows is that they can outlast you?

2133
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:27,080
The thing that the tenured professors

2134
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,912
at all these places know

2135
01:09:27,912 --> 01:09:29,340
is it doesn't matter who the president is

2136
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:32,580
because they can outlast them because they cannot get fired.

2137
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,200
By the way, it's the same thing that bureaucrats

2138
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,033
in the government know.

2139
01:09:35,033 --> 01:09:36,779
It's the same thing that the bureaucrats

2140
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:37,613
in the Department of Education know.

2141
01:09:37,613 --> 01:09:38,823
They know the exact same thing.

2142
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:41,100
They cannot outlast you.

2143
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,050
I mean it's the whole thing that, it's the resistance.

2144
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:43,950
Like they can be the resistance.

2145
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:45,689
They can just sit there and resist,

2146
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:46,523
which is what they do.

2147
01:09:46,523 --> 01:09:47,399
They're not fireable.

2148
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,140
- That's definitely a crisis that needs to be solved.

2149
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,220
That's a huge problem.

2150
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:53,189
And I also don't like that I'm defending academia here.

2151
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,110
I agree with you that the situation is dire

2152
01:09:58,667 --> 01:10:01,050
but I just think that institutions are important.

2153
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:02,430
And I should also add context

2154
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:03,990
since you've been grilling me a little bit,

2155
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:06,960
you were using restaurants as an analogy

2156
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,010
and earlier offline

2157
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:09,720
in this conversation you said the Dairy Queen

2158
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,560
is a great restaurant.

2159
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,400
So let's-

2160
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,450
- I didn't say Dairy Queen is a great restaurant.

2161
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:13,710
- Let the listener take-

2162
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,240
- I said Dairy Queen is the best restaurant.

2163
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,200
- The best restaurant. There you go.

2164
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,803
So everything that Marc Andreessen is saying today-

2165
01:10:19,803 --> 01:10:20,700
- I don't wanna- - Put that into cont-

2166
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:21,900
- You should go order a Blizzard.

2167
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:22,733
One day, you should walk down there

2168
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:24,240
and order a Blizzard. - Yeah.

2169
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,250
- They can get like 4,000 calories in a cup.

2170
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,233
- They can and they're delicious.

2171
01:10:27,233 --> 01:10:28,430
- [Marc] It's amazing.

2172
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,727
- They're truly delicious- - They're really fantastic.

2173
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:30,720
And they'll put anything

2174
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,717
in there you want. - All right-

2175
01:10:31,717 --> 01:10:32,850
- Okay, so, but anyway,

2176
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,560
lemme just close by saying, look,

2177
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,767
my friends at the university system, I would just say,

2178
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:37,560
"Look like, this is the challenge."

2179
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,570
Like I would just pose this as the challenge.

2180
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:40,800
Like to me, like this is,

2181
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,150
having had a lot of these conversations,

2182
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,040
like this is the bar in my view,

2183
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,870
this is the conversation that actually has to happen.

2184
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,160
This is the bar that actually has to be hit.

2185
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,445
These problems need to be confronted directly,

2186
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,360
'cause I think there's been way too much,

2187
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,190
I mean, I'm actually worried kinda on the other side,

2188
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,410
there's too much happy talk in these conversations.

2189
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:57,270
I think the taxpayers do not understand

2190
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:58,320
this level of crisis,

2191
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,420
and I think if the taxpayers come to understand it,

2192
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,980
I think the funding evaporates.

2193
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:05,310
And so I think the fuse is going through, you know,

2194
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,290
no fault of any of ours, but like the fuse is going

2195
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:09,090
and there's some window of time here

2196
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,770
to fix this and address it and justify the money

2197
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,180
'cause it just,

2198
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:15,810
normal taxpayers sitting in normal towns in normal jobs

2199
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,900
are not gonna tolerate this for that much longer.

2200
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,970
- You've mentioned censorship a few times.

2201
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:24,420
Let us, if we can go deep into the darkness of the past

2202
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:27,210
and how censorship mechanism was used.

2203
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:30,840
So you are a good person to speak about the history of this

2204
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,110
because you were there on the ground floor

2205
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:37,770
in 2013-ish Facebook.

2206
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:41,670
I heard that you were there when they invented

2207
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:46,500
or maybe developed the term hate speech

2208
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:51,300
in the context of censorship on social media.

2209
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,237
So take me to, through that history, if you can,

2210
01:11:54,237 --> 01:11:55,980
the use of censorship.

2211
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,488
- So I was there on the ground floor in 1993.

2212
01:11:58,488 --> 01:11:59,970
(both laughing)

2213
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:02,310
- There's multiple floors to this building, apparently.

2214
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:03,540
- There are. - (laughs) Yeah.

2215
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,920
- So I got the first ask

2216
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,290
to implement censorship on the internet,

2217
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:08,850
which was in the web browser.

2218
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,380
- That is fascinating. - Yeah, yeah.

2219
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,880
Actually, 1992.

2220
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,160
I was asked to implement a nudity filter.

2221
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,740
- Did you have the courage to speak up back then? (laughs)

2222
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:19,050
- I did not have any problems speaking up back then.

2223
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,480
I was making $6.25 cents an hour.

2224
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,550
I did not have a lot to lose.

2225
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:24,814
No, I was asked at the time,

2226
01:12:24,814 --> 01:12:26,120
and then look, you know, I was legitimate, you know,

2227
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,510
in some sense, a legitimate request,

2228
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,910
which is working on a research project actually funded

2229
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:32,220
by the federal government at a public university.

2230
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:33,560
So, you know, I don't think my boss was like

2231
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,583
in any way outta line, but it was like, yeah,

2232
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,200
like this web browser thing is great,

2233
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,060
but like could it just make sure to not have any photos

2234
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,680
of naked people that show up?

2235
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,900
But if you think about this for a second, as a technologist,

2236
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,707
I had a issue, which is this was like pre-image net, right?

2237
01:12:45,707 --> 01:12:47,520
And so I had a brief period where I tried

2238
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,170
to imagine an algorithm

2239
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,003
that I referred to

2240
01:12:50,003 --> 01:12:53,310
as the breast detection algorithm (laughs)

2241
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,200
that I was going to have to design.

2242
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,700
And then apparently a variety of other,

2243
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,570
apparently body parts people

2244
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:59,970
are also sensitive about. - Yeah.

2245
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:01,920
- And then I politely declined to do this.

2246
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,140
- For just the technical difficulties of it.

2247
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:04,973
- Well, number one,

2248
01:13:04,973 --> 01:13:05,806
I actually didn't know how to do it,

2249
01:13:05,806 --> 01:13:07,659
but number two is just like, no,

2250
01:13:07,659 --> 01:13:09,030
I'm just not building a censorship engine.

2251
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:11,340
Like I'm a, you know, I'm just not doing it.

2252
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,660
And in those days it was, you know,

2253
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,190
in those days the internet generally was, you know,

2254
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,317
a free-fire zone for everything.

2255
01:13:15,317 --> 01:13:18,000
It was actually interesting as sort of pre-'93,

2256
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,310
the internet was such a specific niche community.

2257
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:24,240
Like, it was like the million kind of highest IQ nerds

2258
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,350
in the world.

2259
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:27,930
And so it actually like didn't really have a lot of,

2260
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:30,090
you know, issues that people were like super interested

2261
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:31,350
in talking about like astrophysics

2262
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,150
and not very interested in, you know,

2263
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,560
even politics at that time.

2264
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,910
So there really was not an issue there.

2265
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:38,403
But yeah, I didn't wanna start the process.

2266
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,610
So I think the way to think about this, so first of all,

2267
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:42,870
you know, yeah, so I was involved

2268
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,640
in this at Facebook, by the way,

2269
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,557
I've been involved with this at Facebook every step

2270
01:13:45,557 --> 01:13:46,390
of the way.

2271
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,290
I joined the board there in 2007,

2272
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,890
so I've seen everything in the last, you know,

2273
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,690
almost 20 years every step of the way.

2274
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:52,523
But also I've been involved in most

2275
01:13:52,523 --> 01:13:54,180
of the other companies over time,

2276
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,500
so I was an angel investor in Twitter.

2277
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,790
I knew them really well.

2278
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,490
We were the founding investor in Substack.

2279
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:01,770
Part of the Elon takeover of Twitter with X.

2280
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,180
I was an angel at LinkedIn.

2281
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,963
So I've been in these, we were the funder of Pinterest.

2282
01:14:05,963 --> 01:14:08,100
We were one of the main investors there,

2283
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,390
Reddit as well.

2284
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:10,680
And I was having these conversations

2285
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,790
with all these guys all the way through.

2286
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:13,590
So as much talk specifically about Facebook,

2287
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:15,660
but I can just tell you like the general pattern.

2288
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,340
And for quite a while it was kind of all

2289
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:18,940
the same across these companies.

2290
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,110
Yeah, so basically the way to think about this,

2291
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,760
the true kind of nuanced view of this

2292
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,830
is that there is practically speaking,

2293
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,590
no internet service that can have zero censorship.

2294
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:31,740
And by the way, that also mirrors, there is no country

2295
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:34,410
that actually has unlimited free speech either.

2296
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:36,670
The US First Amendment actually has 12

2297
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,973
or 13 formal carve outs from the Supreme Court over time.

2298
01:14:39,973 --> 01:14:41,370
You know, so incitement to violence

2299
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:44,250
and terrorist recruitment and child abuse.

2300
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,270
And so, you know, child pornography

2301
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:48,690
and so forth, they're not covered by the First Amendment.

2302
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:50,100
And just practically speaking,

2303
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,570
if you and I are gonna start an internet company

2304
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,237
and have a service, we can't have that stuff either, right?

2305
01:14:53,237 --> 01:14:55,470
'Cause it's illegal or it will just clearly,

2306
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:56,490
you know, destroy the whole thing.

2307
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:59,760
So you're always gonna have a censorship engine.

2308
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,710
I mean, hopefully, it's not actually in the browser,

2309
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:02,970
but like you're gonna have it for sure

2310
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,773
at the level of an internet service.

2311
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:08,640
But then what happens is now you have a machine right now.

2312
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,850
Now you have a system where you can put in rules saying,

2313
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:13,800
we allow this, we don't allow that.

2314
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,280
You have enforcement, you have consequences, right?

2315
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,350
And once that system is in place,

2316
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:21,990
like it becomes the ring of power, right?

2317
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:24,300
Which is like, okay, now anybody in that company

2318
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,830
or anybody associated with that company,

2319
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:27,540
or anybody who wants to pressure that company

2320
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,610
will just start to say, "Okay, you should use that machine

2321
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:31,200
for more than just terrorist recruitment

2322
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,250
and child pornography.

2323
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:35,310
You should use it for X, Y, Z."

2324
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:37,530
And basically that transition happened,

2325
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,970
call it 2012, 2013

2326
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:42,960
is when there was this like very, very kind of rapid pivot.

2327
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,793
I think the kickoff

2328
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:45,600
to it for some reason it was the beginning

2329
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,490
of the second Obama term.

2330
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:51,120
I think it also coincided with the sort of arrival

2331
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,980
of the first kind of super woke kids

2332
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:53,930
into these schools.

2333
01:15:54,891 --> 01:15:58,406
You know, it's the kids that were in school between like,

2334
01:15:58,406 --> 01:15:59,239
you know, for the Iraq war

2335
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:00,390
and then the global financial crisis

2336
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,130
and like, they came out like super radicalized.

2337
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:02,963
They came into these companies,

2338
01:16:02,963 --> 01:16:05,250
they immediately started mounting these social crusades

2339
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,203
to ban and censor lots of things.

2340
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:09,090
And then, you know, quite frankly,

2341
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,437
the Democratic Party figured this out.

2342
01:16:10,437 --> 01:16:12,360
And they figured out that these companies were, you know,

2343
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,466
very subject to being controlled

2344
01:16:14,466 --> 01:16:15,630
and the, you know, the executive teams

2345
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,250
and boards of directors were almost all Democrats

2346
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:19,200
and, you know, there's tremendous circulation.

2347
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,330
A lot of Obama people from the first term actually came

2348
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:22,620
and worked in these companies.

2349
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,960
And a lot of FBI people and other, you know,

2350
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,533
law enforcement intelligence people came in

2351
01:16:26,533 --> 01:16:27,680
and worked, and you know,

2352
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,640
they were all Democrats for that set.

2353
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,320
And so they just, you know,

2354
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,150
the ring of power was lying on the table.

2355
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:35,220
It had been built and they, you know,

2356
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,830
picked it up and put it on, and then they just ran.

2357
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:39,810
And the original discussions

2358
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,400
were basically always on two topics.

2359
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,100
It was hate speech and misinformation.

2360
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,750
Hate speech was the original one.

2361
01:16:46,591 --> 01:16:48,360
And the hate speech conversation started exactly

2362
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,060
like you'd expect, which is, we can't have the N-word.

2363
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:52,560
And which the answer is fair enough,

2364
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,670
let's not have the N-word.

2365
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:56,853
Okay, now, we've set a precedent, right?

2366
01:16:58,110 --> 01:16:59,820
And Jordan Peterson has talked a lot about this.

2367
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,100
The definition of hate speech ended up being things

2368
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,990
that make people uncomfortable, right?

2369
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:04,823
So we can't have things that make,

2370
01:17:04,823 --> 01:17:06,150
you know, people uncomfortable.

2371
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:06,983
I, of course, you know,

2372
01:17:06,983 --> 01:17:09,210
people like me that are disagreeable raise their hands

2373
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,188
and say,

2374
01:17:10,188 --> 01:17:12,060
"Well, that idea right there makes me uncomfortable."

2375
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,400
But of course, that doesn't count as hate speech, right?

2376
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,637
So, you know, the ring of power is on one hand

2377
01:17:17,637 --> 01:17:19,380
and not on the other hand.

2378
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,450
And then basically that began this slide

2379
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:23,730
where it ended up being that, you know,

2380
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:26,610
completely anodyne is the point Mark

2381
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,890
has been making recently like completely anodyne comments

2382
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:30,630
that are completely legitimate on television

2383
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,790
or on the Senate floor all of a sudden our hate speech

2384
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:33,623
can't be said online.

2385
01:17:33,623 --> 01:17:35,340
So that, you know, the ring of power was wielded

2386
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,440
in grossly irresponsible ways.

2387
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,450
We could talk about all the stuff that happened there.

2388
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:40,680
And then the other one was misinformation.

2389
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,710
And there was a little bit of that early on,

2390
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:46,050
but of course, that really kicked in with Trump.

2391
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:49,350
So the hate speech stuff pre-dated Trump

2392
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:51,480
by like three or four years.

2393
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,850
The misinformation stuff was,

2394
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:54,683
it was a little bit later

2395
01:17:54,683 --> 01:17:56,820
and it was a consequence of the Russiagate hoax.

2396
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,710
And then that was, you know, a ring of power

2397
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:01,200
that was even more powerful, right?

2398
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,240
Because, you know, hate speech, it's like, okay,

2399
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,520
at some point, if something offensive or not,

2400
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,430
like at least you can have a question

2401
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:07,710
as to whether that's the case.

2402
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:10,050
But the problem with misinformation is like,

2403
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:11,223
is it the truth or not?

2404
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:14,070
You know, what do we know for 800 years

2405
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:15,390
or whatever Western civilization,

2406
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,340
it's that, you know, there's only a few entities

2407
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,020
that can determine the truth on every topic.

2408
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,840
You know, there's God, you know, there's the king.

2409
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,070
We don't have those anymore

2410
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:25,380
and the rest of us are all imperfect and flawed.

2411
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,930
And so the idea that any group of experts is gonna sit

2412
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:29,730
around the table and decide on the truth is, you know,

2413
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:31,740
deeply anti-Western and deeply authoritarian.

2414
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,500
And somehow the misinformation kind of crusade went

2415
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,470
from the Russiagate hoax into just full-blown,

2416
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:40,680
we're gonna use that weapon for whatever we want.

2417
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,690
And then of course, then the culminating moment on that,

2418
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:44,370
that really was the straw that broke the camel's back

2419
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:47,070
was we're gonna censor all theories

2420
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:49,380
that the COVID virus might have been manufactured

2421
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:50,823
in a lab as misinformation.

2422
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,760
And inside these companies like that was the point

2423
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,500
where people for the first time, this is like what,

2424
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,000
three years ago for the first time they were like,

2425
01:18:59,107 --> 01:19:00,450
and that was when it sunk in where it's just like, okay,

2426
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:02,932
this has spun completely outta control.

2427
01:19:02,932 --> 01:19:05,348
But anyway, that's how we got to where we are.

2428
01:19:05,348 --> 01:19:07,980
And then basically that spell lasted

2429
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:10,680
that complex existed and got expanded basically from,

2430
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,473
call it 2013 to 2023.

2431
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:16,800
I think basically two things broke it.

2432
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,270
One is Substack,

2433
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:20,550
and so when I am super proud of those guys,

2434
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:22,380
'cause they started from scratch

2435
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,030
and declared right up front

2436
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:26,433
that they were gonna be a free speech platform.

2437
01:19:27,495 --> 01:19:29,730
And they came under intense pressure,

2438
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:31,230
including from the press.

2439
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:32,730
And, you know, they tried to just beat them

2440
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:33,930
to the ground and kill them.

2441
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:35,580
And intense pressure, by the way, from, you know,

2442
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,860
let's say certain of the platform companies, you know,

2443
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,440
basically threatening them. And they stood up to it.

2444
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,550
And, you know, sitting here today,

2445
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:44,610
they have the widest spectrum of speech and conversation,

2446
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:46,170
you know, anywhere on planet Earth.

2447
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:47,010
And they've done a great job.

2448
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:48,660
And it's worked by the way, it's great.

2449
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:51,420
And then obviously Elon, you know, with X was the, you know,

2450
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,100
the hammer blow.

2451
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,300
And then the third one now

2452
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:56,000
is what Mark is doing at Facebook.

2453
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,460
- And there's also like singular moments,

2454
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:03,840
I think you've spoken about this, which like Jon Stewart

2455
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,240
going on Stephen Colbert

2456
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,610
and talking about the lab leak theory.

2457
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:09,930
- [Marc] Yes.

2458
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,763
- There's certain moments

2459
01:20:10,763 --> 01:20:14,430
that just kinda shake everybody up, the right person,

2460
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:17,850
the right time, just it's a wake-up call.

2461
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:20,070
- So that there, and I will tell you, like,

2462
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,690
and I should say Jon Stewart attacked me recently,

2463
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,130
so I'm not that thrilled about him,

2464
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:26,370
but I would say, I would say long run fan of Jon Stewart.

2465
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:27,390
I watched probably every episode

2466
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:29,730
of "The Daily Show" when he was on it,

2467
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,020
you know, for probably 20 years.

2468
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,720
But he did a very important public service

2469
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,160
and it was that appearance on the Colbert Show.

2470
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,870
And I don't know how broadly this is, you know,

2471
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:38,130
at the time, it was in the news briefly,

2472
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:39,570
but I don't know how, if people remember this,

2473
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:42,150
but I will tell you in the rooms where people discuss

2474
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:43,350
what his misinformation

2475
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,030
and these policies, that was a very big moment.

2476
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:47,160
That was probably actually the key catalyzing moment.

2477
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,500
And I think he exhibited, I would say, conspicuous bravery

2478
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,690
and had a big impact with that.

2479
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:54,171
And yeah, for people who don't recall what he did,

2480
01:20:54,171 --> 01:20:55,110
and this was in the full-blown,

2481
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:57,990
like, you know, you absolutely must lock down for two years.

2482
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,520
You absolutely must keep all the schools closed.

2483
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,440
You absolutely must have everybody work from home.

2484
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,530
You absolutely must wear a mask like the whole thing.

2485
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:07,380
And then one of those was, you absolutely must believe

2486
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,870
that COVID was completely natural.

2487
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,010
You must believe that.

2488
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:11,850
And not believing

2489
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:14,250
that means you're a fascist Nazi Trump supporter,

2490
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,501
MAGA, evil QAnon person, right?

2491
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:18,000
And that was like uniform and that was enforced

2492
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,500
by the social media companies.

2493
01:21:21,092 --> 01:21:22,110
And like I said, that was the peak.

2494
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:23,910
And Jon Stewart went on the Colbert Show,

2495
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:25,680
and I don't know if they planned it or not,

2496
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,640
'cause Colbert looked shocked.

2497
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,840
I don't know how much of it was a bit,

2498
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,940
but he went on there and he just had one of these,

2499
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,977
like the Emperor's wearing no closed things where he said,

2500
01:21:32,977 --> 01:21:34,380
"It's just not plausible

2501
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,860
that you had the COVID super virus appear 300 yards

2502
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:41,017
down the street from the Wuhan Institute (laughs)

2503
01:21:41,017 --> 01:21:42,267
of lethal coronaviruses."

2504
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:45,210
Like, it's just not plausible

2505
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,890
that certainly that you could just rule that out.

2506
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:48,450
And then there was another key moment, actually,

2507
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:49,860
the more serious version was I think the author,

2508
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,110
Nicholson Baker wrote a big piece for New York Magazine.

2509
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:54,270
And Nicholson Baker is like one of our great novelist,

2510
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:55,980
writers of our time.

2511
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,150
And he wrote the piece

2512
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:59,490
and he did the complete undressing of it.

2513
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:00,323
And that was the first,

2514
01:22:00,323 --> 01:22:01,440
I think that was the first legit,

2515
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,420
there had been like alt, you know, renegade,

2516
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,100
there had been, you know, people running around saying this,

2517
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,240
but getting censored all over the place.

2518
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,270
That was the first one that was like in the mainstream press

2519
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:10,680
and he talked to all the heretics

2520
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,997
and he just like laid the whole thing out.

2521
01:22:12,997 --> 01:22:13,830
And that was a moment.

2522
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:14,940
And I remember let's say a board meeting

2523
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:16,360
at one of these companies after that,

2524
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,760
where basically, you know,

2525
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,087
everybody looked around the table and was like,

2526
01:22:19,087 --> 01:22:20,887
"All right, like, I guess we're not,

2527
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,820
we don't need to censor that anymore."

2528
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:24,960
And, you know, and then of course,

2529
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,077
what immediately follows from that is,

2530
01:22:26,077 --> 01:22:26,910
"Well, wait a minute,

2531
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:29,070
why were we censoring that in the first place?"

2532
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,445
And okay, like,

2533
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:31,830
and then, you know, the downstream, not that day,

2534
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,187
but the downstream conversations were like,

2535
01:22:33,187 --> 01:22:35,940
"Okay, if we made such a giant, in retrospect,

2536
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:36,773
if we all made

2537
01:22:36,773 --> 01:22:39,000
such a giant collective mistake censoring that,

2538
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,800
then what does that say about the rest of our regime?"

2539
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,000
And I think that was the thread

2540
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,040
in the sweater that started to unravel it.

2541
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:44,940
- I should say it again,

2542
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:46,890
I do think that the Jon Stewart appearance

2543
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:49,427
and the statement he made was a courageous act.

2544
01:22:49,427 --> 01:22:50,449
- [Marc] Yeah, I agree.

2545
01:22:50,449 --> 01:22:53,280
- I think we need to have more of that in the world.

2546
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,560
And like you said, Elon, everything he did with X

2547
01:22:57,809 --> 01:23:01,020
is a series of courageous acts.

2548
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:06,020
And I think what Mark Zuckerberg did on Rogan a few days ago

2549
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:10,170
is a courageous act.

2550
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:12,170
Can you just speak to that?

2551
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:13,003
- He has become,

2552
01:23:13,003 --> 01:23:14,883
I think, an outstanding communicator, right?

2553
01:23:14,883 --> 01:23:15,716
And he's, you know,

2554
01:23:15,716 --> 01:23:16,890
somebody who came in for a lot of criticism earlier

2555
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:18,300
in his career on that front.

2556
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,607
And I think he's, you know, he's one of these guys

2557
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:22,950
who can sit down and talk for three hours

2558
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:23,880
and make complete sense.

2559
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:27,210
And you know, as you do with all of your episodes,

2560
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,010
like when somebody sit and talks for three hours,

2561
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:30,450
like you really get a sense of somebody

2562
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:33,270
'cause it's really hard to be artificial for that long.

2563
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:35,010
And, you know, he's now done that repeatedly.

2564
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:35,843
He's really good at it.

2565
01:23:35,843 --> 01:23:36,810
And then, look, again,

2566
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:39,120
I would maybe put him in the third category now with,

2567
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,170
certainly after that appearance,

2568
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:43,100
I would say I would put him up there now with,

2569
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:43,933
you know, kind of Elon and Trump

2570
01:23:43,933 --> 01:23:45,840
in the sense of the public and the private

2571
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:46,710
are now synchronized.

2572
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:47,543
I guess I'd say that.

2573
01:23:47,543 --> 01:23:50,190
Like he said on that show what he really believes,

2574
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,840
he said all the same things that he says in private.

2575
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,560
Like, I don't think there's really any discrepancy anymore.

2576
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,780
I would say he has always taken upon himself

2577
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:59,160
a level of obligation,

2578
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,790
responsibility to running a company the size of Meta

2579
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:06,060
and to running services that are that large.

2580
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,160
And I think, you know, his conception of what he's doing,

2581
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,870
which I think is correct, is he's running services

2582
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,400
that are bigger than any country, right?

2583
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,233
He's running, you know,

2584
01:24:12,233 --> 01:24:13,930
over 3 billion people use those services.

2585
01:24:15,715 --> 01:24:17,220
And then, you know, the company has, you know,

2586
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,620
many tens of thousands of employees and many investors,

2587
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,720
and it's a public company, and he thinks very deeply

2588
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,770
and seriously about his responsibilities.

2589
01:24:24,697 --> 01:24:26,970
And so, you know, he has not felt like he has had,

2590
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:30,060
let's just say, the complete flexibility that Elon has had.

2591
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,040
And, you know, people could argue that one way or the other,

2592
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:35,670
but, you know, he talked about a lot.

2593
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,080
He's evolved a lot.

2594
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,490
A lot of it was, he learned a lot.

2595
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,680
And by the way, I'm gonna put myself right back up there.

2596
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,480
Like, I'm not claiming any huge foresight

2597
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,022
or heroism on any of this. Like, I've also learned a lot.

2598
01:24:46,022 --> 01:24:47,550
Like, my views on things are very different

2599
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:49,740
than they were 10 years ago on lots of topics.

2600
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:52,140
And so, you know, I've been on a learning journey.

2601
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,120
He's been on a learning journey.

2602
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,820
He is a really, really good learner.

2603
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:58,830
He assimilates information, you know,

2604
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:01,180
as good as, or better than anybody else I know.

2605
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,380
The other thing I guess I would just say

2606
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:05,910
is he talked on that show about something very important,

2607
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,920
which is when you're in a role

2608
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,150
where you're running a company like that,

2609
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:12,077
there are a set of decisions that you get to make

2610
01:25:12,077 --> 01:25:13,470
and you deserve to be criticized

2611
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:16,200
for those decisions and so forth and it's valid,

2612
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:20,070
but you are under tremendous external pressure as well.

2613
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:20,903
And by the way,

2614
01:25:20,903 --> 01:25:22,620
you're under tremendous internal pressure.

2615
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,570
You've got your employees coming at you.

2616
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:26,460
You've got your executives in some cases coming at you.

2617
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:29,220
You've got your board in some cases coming at you.

2618
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,930
You've got your shareholders coming at you.

2619
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:32,580
So you've got your internal pressures,

2620
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,650
but you also have the press coming at you.

2621
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:36,780
You've got academia coming at you.

2622
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:39,030
You've got the entire nonprofit complex activist

2623
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:40,560
complex coming at you.

2624
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,420
And then really critically, you know,

2625
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:43,500
he talked about in Rogan

2626
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,720
and these companies all went through this,

2627
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,880
in this last especially five years,

2628
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,340
you had the government coming at you

2629
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,900
and, you know, that's the really, you know,

2630
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,270
stinky end of the pool where, you know,

2631
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:55,710
the government was, in my view,

2632
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:57,630
you know, illegally exerting, you know,

2633
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:59,340
just in flagrant violation of the First Amendment

2634
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,010
and federal laws on speech and coercion

2635
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:04,320
and conspiracy, forcing these companies

2636
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,510
to engage in activities.

2637
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:07,343
You know, then again,

2638
01:26:07,343 --> 01:26:08,176
in some cases they may have wanted to do,

2639
01:26:08,176 --> 01:26:09,540
but in other cases they clearly didn't wanna do

2640
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,950
and felt like they had to do.

2641
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:14,580
And the level of pressure, like I say,

2642
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:16,710
like I've known every CEO of Twitter,

2643
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:18,420
they've all had the exact same experience,

2644
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:21,630
which when they were in the job, it was just daily beatings.

2645
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:22,590
Like it just getting punched

2646
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:24,900
in the face every single day, constantly.

2647
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,510
And, you know, Mark is very good

2648
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:29,880
at getting (laughs) physically punched in the face,

2649
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:30,713
and then- - Getting better and better.

2650
01:26:30,713 --> 01:26:31,546
Yeah.

2651
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,530
- You know, and he's very good at, you know, taking a punch

2652
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:36,270
and he has taken many, many punches.

2653
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:38,280
So I would encourage people to have a level of sympathy

2654
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,750
for these are not kings,

2655
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:42,000
these are people who operate with like, I would say,

2656
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,250
extraordinary levels of external pressure.

2657
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:46,320
I think if I had been in his job for the last decade,

2658
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,140
I would be a little puddle on the floor.

2659
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:52,050
And so it says, I think a lot about him that he has,

2660
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:54,102
you know, risen to this occasion the way that he has.

2661
01:26:54,102 --> 01:26:55,020
And by the way, I should also say, you know,

2662
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:56,820
the cynicism of course is immediately out

2663
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:59,727
and, you know, legitimate thing for people to say,

2664
01:26:59,727 --> 01:27:00,560
but you know, it's like,

2665
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,530
"Oh, you're only doing this because of Trump,

2666
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:02,430
or, you know, whatever."

2667
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,190
And it's just like, no, like he has been thinking about

2668
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:06,120
and working on these things

2669
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,250
and trying to figure them out for a very long time.

2670
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:10,320
And so I think what you saw are legitimate,

2671
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,900
deeply held beliefs, not some, you know,

2672
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:13,733
sort of just in the moment thing

2673
01:27:13,733 --> 01:27:15,150
that could change at any time.

2674
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:16,890
- So what do you think it's like to be him

2675
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:20,250
and other leaders of companies, to be you

2676
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:24,780
and withstand internal pressure and external pressure?

2677
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:25,750
What's that life like?

2678
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,720
Is it deeply lonely?

2679
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:28,553
- That's a great question.

2680
01:27:28,553 --> 01:27:30,270
So leaders are lonely to start with.

2681
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:31,140
And this is one of those things

2682
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:33,360
where almost nobody has sympathy, right?

2683
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,076
Nobody feels sorry for a CEO, right?

2684
01:27:35,076 --> 01:27:37,860
Like, it's not a thing, right?

2685
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:38,880
And again, legitimately so,

2686
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,560
like CEOs get paid a lot, like the whole thing.

2687
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,640
There's a lot of great things about it.

2688
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,140
So it's not like they should be out there asking

2689
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:43,973
for a lot of sympathy,

2690
01:27:43,973 --> 01:27:46,170
but it is the case that they are human beings.

2691
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:47,790
And it is the case that it is a lonely job.

2692
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:49,920
And the reason it's a lonely job

2693
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,170
is because your words carry tremendous weight

2694
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,800
and you are dealing with extremely complicated issues,

2695
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,930
and you're under a tremendous amount of emotional, you know,

2696
01:27:57,930 --> 01:27:59,880
personal, emotional stress.

2697
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,067
And, you know, you often end up not being able to sleep well

2698
01:28:02,067 --> 01:28:03,570
and you end up not being able to like,

2699
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,442
keep up an exercise routine and all those things.

2700
01:28:05,442 --> 01:28:07,020
And you know, you come under family stress

2701
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,040
'cause you're working all the time.

2702
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,230
Or my partner Ben, you know, he was CEO

2703
01:28:10,230 --> 01:28:12,450
of our last company before we started the venture firm.

2704
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:14,040
He said, you know, the problem he had

2705
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,380
like with his family life was even when he was home

2706
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,240
at night, he wasn't home

2707
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,280
because he was in his head trying to solve

2708
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,113
all the business problems.

2709
01:28:21,113 --> 01:28:22,650
And so he was like supposed to be like having dinner

2710
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:23,790
with his kids and he was physically there,

2711
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:24,720
but he wasn't mentally there.

2712
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,150
So, you know, you get that a lot.

2713
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:28,950
But the key thing is like, you can't talk to people, right?

2714
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:31,065
So I mean, you could talk to your spouse and your kids,

2715
01:28:31,065 --> 01:28:32,280
but like, they don't understand

2716
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,390
that they're networking in your company.

2717
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:35,993
They don't understand, have the context to really help you.

2718
01:28:36,899 --> 01:28:37,732
If you talk to your executives,

2719
01:28:37,732 --> 01:28:39,813
they all have agendas, right?

2720
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:41,900
And they can't resist.

2721
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,816
Like it's just human nature.

2722
01:28:43,816 --> 01:28:46,710
And so you can't necessarily rely on what they say.

2723
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:49,620
It's very hard in most companies to talk to your board

2724
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:50,920
because they can fire you.

2725
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:53,900
Now, Mark has the situation 'cause he has control,

2726
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,680
it actually turns out he can talk to his board.

2727
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,690
And Mark talks to us about many things that he does

2728
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,310
that most CEOs won't talk to their boards about

2729
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:02,070
because we literally, because we can't fire him.

2730
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,590
But a general, including all the CEOs of Twitter,

2731
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:05,697
that none of them had control

2732
01:29:05,697 --> 01:29:07,650
and so they could all get fired.

2733
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:09,780
So you can't talk to the board members,

2734
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,640
they're gonna fire you, you can't talk to the shareholders

2735
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,280
'cause they'll just like dump your stock, right?

2736
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:17,040
Like, okay, so every once in a while,

2737
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,260
what you find is basically the best-case scenario they have

2738
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,940
is they can talk to other CEOs,

2739
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:22,500
and there's these little organizations

2740
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,457
where they kind of pair up and do that

2741
01:29:23,457 --> 01:29:25,900
and so they maybe get a little bit outta that.

2742
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:26,760
But even that's fraught with peril

2743
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,010
'cause can you really talk about confidential information

2744
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:32,130
with another CEO, insider trading risk.

2745
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:34,680
And so it's just a very lonely isolating thing

2746
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:35,513
to start with.

2747
01:29:37,019 --> 01:29:39,840
And then on top of that, you apply pressure, right?

2748
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,770
And that's where it gets painful.

2749
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:42,150
And then maybe I'll just spend a moment

2750
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,343
on this internal, external pressure thing.

2751
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:47,910
My general experience with companies

2752
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:51,990
is that they can withstand most forms of external pressure

2753
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:54,480
as long as they retain internal coherence.

2754
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,350
- Hmm. - Right.

2755
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:57,900
So as long as the internal team

2756
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,670
is really bonded together

2757
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,650
and supporting each other,

2758
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:04,020
most forms of external pressure you can withstand,

2759
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:06,240
and by that I mean investors dump your stock,

2760
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,060
you lose your biggest customers, you know,

2761
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:12,180
whatever negative article, you know, negative headline

2762
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,457
and you know, you can withstand all that.

2763
01:30:14,457 --> 01:30:16,710
And basically, in fact, many of those forms of pressure

2764
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:19,203
can be bonding experiences for the team

2765
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:20,490
where they come out stronger.

2766
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:24,000
What you 100% cannot withstand is the internal crack.

2767
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,020
And what I always look for

2768
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,240
in high-pressure corporate situations now

2769
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:30,060
is the moment when the internal team cracks.

2770
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,133
Because I know the minute that happens,

2771
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:35,160
we're in a different regime. (laughs)

2772
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,480
Like, it's like the, you know,

2773
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,560
the solid has turned into a liquid.

2774
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,670
Like we're in a different regime

2775
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:40,800
and like the whole thing can unravel in the next week

2776
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,390
'cause then people turn, I mean this,

2777
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:45,610
I guess this is what's happening in Los Angeles right now.

2778
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:46,950
The mayor and the fire chief turned on each other,

2779
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:49,470
and that's it.

2780
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:50,730
That government is dysfunctional.

2781
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,710
It is never going to get put back together again.

2782
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:55,170
It is over, it is not going to work ever again.

2783
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:57,510
And that's what happens to inside companies.

2784
01:30:57,510 --> 01:31:00,060
And so somebody like Mark

2785
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:03,120
is under like profound internal pressure

2786
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,470
and external pressure at the same time.

2787
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,270
Now he's been very good at maintaining the coherence

2788
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:08,070
of his executive team,

2789
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:11,230
but he has had over the years, a lot of activist employees

2790
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:13,077
as a lot of these companies have had

2791
01:31:13,077 --> 01:31:15,761
and so that's been continuous pressure.

2792
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:16,860
And then the final thing I'd say, as I said,

2793
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,600
that companies can withstand most forms

2794
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,130
of external pressure, but not all.

2795
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:23,190
And especially, although not all one is government pressure.

2796
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:24,720
Is that when your government comes for you?

2797
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,570
Like yeah,

2798
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:29,100
any CEO who thinks that they're bigger

2799
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,120
than their government,

2800
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:32,910
has that notion beaten out of them in short order.

2801
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:34,170
- Can you just linger on that

2802
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:39,170
'cause it is maybe educating and deeply disturbing?

2803
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:40,740
You've spoken about it before,

2804
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:44,460
but we're speaking about again this government pressure.

2805
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:46,530
So you think they've crossed a line

2806
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:50,310
into essentially criminal levels of pressure?

2807
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:51,460
- Flagrant criminality,

2808
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:55,080
felonies, like obvious felonies.

2809
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,760
And I can actually cite the laws, (laughs)

2810
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,880
but yes, absolute criminality.

2811
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,097
- Can you explain how those possible to happen

2812
01:32:03,097 --> 01:32:05,160
and maybe on a hopeful note,

2813
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,890
how we can avoid that happening again?

2814
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:09,730
- So I just start with is a lot of this now

2815
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:11,640
is in the public record,

2816
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,530
which is good 'cause it needs to be in the public record.

2817
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:14,940
And so there's three forms of things

2818
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:16,470
that are in the public record that people can look at.

2819
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:19,650
So when is the Twitter Files, right, which Elon put out

2820
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:21,240
with the set of journalists when he took over.

2821
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,710
And I will just tell you, the Twitter Files

2822
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:24,210
are 100% representative

2823
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:25,917
of what I've seen at every other one of these companies.

2824
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:28,470
And so you can just see what happened in Twitter

2825
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:29,970
and you can just assume that that happened

2826
01:32:29,970 --> 01:32:32,340
in these other companies, you know, for the most part,

2827
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,020
certainly in terms of the kind of pressure that they got.

2828
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:34,907
So that's number one.

2829
01:32:34,907 --> 01:32:36,660
That's stuff, you can just read it

2830
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:38,910
and you should if you haven't.

2831
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:42,210
The second is Mark referenced this in the Rogan podcast.

2832
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:43,290
There's a congressman Jim Jordan,

2833
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:45,210
who has a congressional committee

2834
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:46,800
called the Weaponization Committee.

2835
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,720
And they, in the last, you know, whatever three years

2836
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,970
have done a full-scale investigation of this.

2837
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:53,220
And Facebook produced a lot of documents

2838
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,660
into that investigation

2839
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:57,000
and many of those have now been made public

2840
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,110
and you can download those reports.

2841
01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:00,930
And there's like 2,000 pages worth of material on that.

2842
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:02,520
And that's essentially the Facebook version

2843
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,990
of the Twitter Files just arrived

2844
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:05,670
at with a different mechanism.

2845
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:08,910
And then third is Mark himself talking about this on Rogan.

2846
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:10,770
So I'll, you know, just defer to his comments there.

2847
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:13,860
But yeah, basically what those three forms

2848
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:16,230
of information show you is basically the government,

2849
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:20,370
you know, over time and then culminating in 2020, 2021,

2850
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:21,660
you know, in the last four years,

2851
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:24,510
just decided that the First Amendment didn't apply to them.

2852
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:27,720
And they just decided that federal laws around free speech

2853
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,450
and around conspiracies to take away the rights

2854
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:31,900
of citizens just don't apply.

2855
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:33,870
And they just decided

2856
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:36,643
that they can just arbitrarily pressure.

2857
01:33:36,643 --> 01:33:38,400
They just like literally arbitrarily call up companies

2858
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,800
and threaten and bully and yell and scream

2859
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,360
and, you know, threaten repercussions

2860
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,253
and force them to censor.

2861
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,250
And you know, there's this whole thing of like,

2862
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,840
well, the First Amendment only applies to, you know,

2863
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,220
the government, it doesn't apply to companies.

2864
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:51,053
It's like, well,

2865
01:33:51,053 --> 01:33:53,340
there's actually a little bit of nuance to that.

2866
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:56,596
First of all, it definitely applies to the government.

2867
01:33:56,596 --> 01:33:57,510
Like 100%,

2868
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:59,400
the First Amendment applies to the government.

2869
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,080
By the way, so does the Fourth Amendment

2870
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:01,913
and the Fifth Amendment,

2871
01:34:01,913 --> 01:34:03,150
including the right to due process,

2872
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:04,380
also applies to the government.

2873
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:06,180
There was no due process at all

2874
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:08,340
to any of the censorship regime that was put in place.

2875
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:10,080
There was no due process put in place, by the way,

2876
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,730
for de-banking either.

2877
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,590
Those are just as serious violations

2878
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:15,720
as the free speech violations.

2879
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,370
And so this is just like flagrant, flagrant,

2880
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:18,390
unconstitutional behavior.

2881
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:20,970
And then there are specific federal statutes,

2882
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:23,730
it's 18 241 and 18 242.

2883
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:24,780
And one of them applies

2884
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,586
to federal employees, government employees,

2885
01:34:26,586 --> 01:34:28,736
and the other one applies to private actors

2886
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:31,830
around what's called deprivation of rights

2887
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:33,240
and conspiracy to deprive rights.

2888
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,800
And it is not legal

2889
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,300
according to the United States Criminal Code

2890
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,740
for government employees

2891
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:39,780
or in a conspiracy private entities

2892
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:41,820
to take away constitutional rights.

2893
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:43,560
And interestingly,

2894
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,390
some of those constitutional rights are enumerated,

2895
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:47,460
for example, in the First Amendment, freedom of speech.

2896
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:48,930
And then some of those rights actually

2897
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:50,380
do not need to be enumerated.

2898
01:34:51,846 --> 01:34:54,360
If the government takes away rights that you have,

2899
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,340
they don't need to be specifically enumerated rights

2900
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,690
in the Constitution order to still be a felony.

2901
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,890
The Constitution very specifically

2902
01:35:01,890 --> 01:35:03,720
does not say you only have the rights that it gives you.

2903
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,100
It says you have all the rights

2904
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,390
that have not been previously

2905
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:08,220
defined as being taken away from you.

2906
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:11,183
Right, and so de-banking qualifies as a right,

2907
01:35:11,183 --> 01:35:12,016
you know, right to access

2908
01:35:12,016 --> 01:35:13,770
to the financial system, is every bit something

2909
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:16,440
that's subject to these laws as free speech.

2910
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,000
And so yeah, this has happened.

2911
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,320
And then I'll just add one final thing,

2912
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,880
which is we've talked about two parties so far.

2913
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,560
We talked about the government employees

2914
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,750
and then we've talked about the companies.

2915
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:27,390
The government employees for sure have misbehaved.

2916
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:29,520
The companies, there's a very interesting question there

2917
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,343
as to whether they are victims or perpetrators or both.

2918
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,280
You know, they will defend and they will argue,

2919
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,450
and I believe they have a good case,

2920
01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:37,643
that they are victims, not perpetrators, right?

2921
01:35:37,643 --> 01:35:40,710
They're the downstream subjects of pressure,

2922
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:42,690
you know, not the cause of pressure,

2923
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:45,060
but there's a big swath of people who are in the middle

2924
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,070
and specifically the ones that are funded by the government

2925
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:49,650
that I think are in possibly pretty big trouble.

2926
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:53,490
And that's all of these third-party censorship bureaus.

2927
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:55,200
I mean the one that is sort of is most obvious

2928
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,640
is the so-called Stanford Internet Observatory

2929
01:35:58,650 --> 01:36:00,540
that got booted up there over the last several years.

2930
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:03,510
And they basically were funded by the federal government

2931
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,760
to be third-party censorship operations.

2932
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,610
And they're private sector actors,

2933
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:10,440
but acting with federal funding.

2934
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,450
And so it puts them in this very interesting spot

2935
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:14,580
where there could be, you know,

2936
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:16,744
very obvious theory under which they're basically acting

2937
01:36:16,744 --> 01:36:18,210
as agents of the government.

2938
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:20,220
And so I think they're also very exposed on this

2939
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:22,530
and have behaved in just flagrantly illegal ways.

2940
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:23,400
- So fundamentally,

2941
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:27,120
government should not do any kind of pressure,

2942
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,090
even soft pressure on companies to censor?

2943
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:30,923
- Can't.

2944
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:32,880
Not allowed.

2945
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,650
- It really is disturbing.

2946
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:37,683
I mean it probably started soft,

2947
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:40,170
lightly slowly,

2948
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:43,200
and then it escalates as the the old

2949
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,993
will to power will instruct them to do.

2950
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:48,293
I mean, yeah,

2951
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:51,270
that's why there's protection

2952
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:54,510
'cause you can't put a check on power for government, right?

2953
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:56,370
- There are so many ways that they can get you,

2954
01:36:56,370 --> 01:36:58,380
like there are so many ways they can come at you and get you

2955
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:00,450
and, you know, the thing here to think about

2956
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:03,244
is a lot of times when people think about government action,

2957
01:37:03,244 --> 01:37:04,920
they think about legislation, right?

2958
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,720
So when I was a kid,

2959
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,190
we got trained, how does government work?

2960
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:10,380
There was this famous animated short,

2961
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,030
the thing we got shown was just a cartoon

2962
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:13,260
of how a bill becomes a law.

2963
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,093
It's like this, you know,

2964
01:37:14,093 --> 01:37:15,510
fancy little bill sneaked along and goes this-

2965
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:16,615
- I'm just the bill.

2966
01:37:16,615 --> 01:37:18,356
Yeah. - Exactly.

2967
01:37:18,356 --> 01:37:19,350
It's like, all right, number one,

2968
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:20,183
that's not how it works at all.

2969
01:37:20,183 --> 01:37:21,630
Like that doesn't actually happen.

2970
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:22,710
We could talk about that.

2971
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:24,740
But even beyond that, mostly what we're dealing with

2972
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,070
is not legislation.

2973
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:27,510
When we talk about government power these days,

2974
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:29,340
mostly it's not legislation.

2975
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:31,260
Mostly it's either regulation,

2976
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:33,000
which is basically the equivalent of legislation,

2977
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,160
but having not gone through the legislative process,

2978
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,780
which is a very big open legal issue.

2979
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:39,570
And one of the things that the DOGE is very focused on.

2980
01:37:39,570 --> 01:37:41,280
Most government rules are not legislated.

2981
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,130
They're regulated

2982
01:37:42,966 --> 01:37:44,550
and there's tons and tons of regulations

2983
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:45,383
that these companies are,

2984
01:37:45,383 --> 01:37:47,137
this is another cliche you'll hear a lot, which is,

2985
01:37:47,137 --> 01:37:48,600
"Oh, private companies can do whatever they want."

2986
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,250
It's like, "Oh, no, they can't."

2987
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:52,440
They're subject to tens of thousands of regulations

2988
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,370
that they have to comply with.

2989
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:56,280
And the hammer that comes down when you don't comply

2990
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,450
with regulations is profound.

2991
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:58,830
Like they can completely wreck your company

2992
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:01,680
with no ability for you to do anything about it.

2993
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,090
So regulation is a big part

2994
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:04,830
of the way the power gets exercised.

2995
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:05,663
And then there's what's called

2996
01:38:05,663 --> 01:38:07,680
just flat out administrative power,

2997
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,513
the term that you'll hear

2998
01:38:08,513 --> 01:38:10,230
and administrative power is just literally

2999
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:11,063
the government telling you,

3000
01:38:11,063 --> 01:38:12,750
calling you and telling you what to do.

3001
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:13,650
Here's an example of how this works.

3002
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:15,900
So Facebook had this whole program a few years back

3003
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:19,020
to do a global cryptocurrency for payments called Libra.

3004
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,460
And they built the entire system

3005
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:21,720
and it was this high-scale, you know,

3006
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,553
sort of new cryptocurrency,

3007
01:38:22,553 --> 01:38:23,880
and they were gonna build into every product,

3008
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,915
and they were gonna be 3 billion people

3009
01:38:24,915 --> 01:38:26,430
who could transact with Libra.

3010
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:28,200
And they went to the government and they went to the,

3011
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,243
all these different try to figure out how to make it,

3012
01:38:29,243 --> 01:38:31,590
so it's like fully compliant with anti-money laundering

3013
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:32,850
and all these, you know, controls and everything.

3014
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:34,470
And they had the whole thing ready to go.

3015
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:37,417
Two senators wrote letters to the big banks saying,

3016
01:38:37,417 --> 01:38:40,080
"We're not telling you that you can't work

3017
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,900
with Facebook on this, but if you do,

3018
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:45,000
you should know that every aspect of your business

3019
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,100
is going to come under greatly increased level

3020
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,960
of regulatory scrutiny,"

3021
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,580
which is, of course, the exact equivalent

3022
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:53,220
of it sure is a nice corner restaurant you have here.

3023
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,270
It would be a shame if, you know,

3024
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:56,100
somebody tossed a Molotov cocktail through the window

3025
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,300
and burned it down tonight, right?

3026
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,300
And like, what is that letter?

3027
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:02,853
Like, it's not a law, it's not even a regulation,

3028
01:39:02,853 --> 01:39:06,390
it's just like straight direct state power.

3029
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:08,370
And then it culminates in literally calls

3030
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:09,600
from the White House

3031
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,490
where they're just like flat out telling you what to do,

3032
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:13,110
which is, of course, what a king gets to do,

3033
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:14,910
but not what a president gets to do.

3034
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:18,180
And so anyway, so what these companies experienced

3035
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:20,550
was they experienced the full panoply of this,

3036
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:23,610
but the level of intensity was in that order,

3037
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:26,070
it was actually, legislation was the least important part.

3038
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:27,240
Regulation was more important,

3039
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,620
administrative power was more important

3040
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,450
and then just like flat out demands

3041
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:33,510
and flat out threats were ultimately the most important.

3042
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:34,380
How do you fix it?

3043
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:35,223
Well, first of all,

3044
01:39:35,223 --> 01:39:38,493
like you have to elect people who don't do it, right?

3045
01:39:38,493 --> 01:39:39,630
So like as with all these things,

3046
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:42,120
ultimately the fault lies with the voters.

3047
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,620
And so, you know, you have to decide.

3048
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:45,443
You don't wanna live in that regime. I have no idea

3049
01:39:45,443 --> 01:39:46,860
what part of this recent election mapped

3050
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:47,880
to the censorship regime.

3051
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,920
I do know a lot of people on the right got very angry

3052
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,300
about the censorship, but I, you know,

3053
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,470
I think it probably at least helped

3054
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:53,920
with enthusiasm on that side.

3055
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,130
You know, maybe some people on the left

3056
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:57,750
will now not want their, you know,

3057
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:59,950
Democratic nominees to be so pro-censorship.

3058
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:02,520
So the voters definitely, you know,

3059
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,260
get a vote, number one.

3060
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,600
Number two, I think you need transparency.

3061
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,040
You need to know what happened.

3062
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,900
We know some of what happened.

3063
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:12,180
Peter Thiel has written in the FT just now saying,

3064
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:13,820
we just need like broad after what we've been through

3065
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:14,653
in the last decade,

3066
01:40:14,653 --> 01:40:17,250
we need to broad base truth and reconciliation,

3067
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:20,490
you know, efforts to really get to the root of things.

3068
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:22,290
So maybe that's part of it.

3069
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:24,840
We need investigations for sure.

3070
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,340
Ultimately, we need prosecutions.

3071
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:28,740
Like ultimately, we need people to go to jail

3072
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:29,943
'cause we need to set object lessons that say

3073
01:40:29,943 --> 01:40:32,250
that you don't get to do this.

3074
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,840
And on those last two, I would say

3075
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,520
that those are both up to the new administration,

3076
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,990
and I don't wanna speak for them

3077
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:38,817
and I don't wanna predict what they're gonna do,

3078
01:40:38,817 --> 01:40:40,800
but they for sure have the ability to do both

3079
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,270
of those things and you know, we'll see where they take it.

3080
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:44,580
- Yeah, it's truly disturbing.

3081
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,860
I don't think anybody wants this kind of overreach of power

3082
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,150
for government,

3083
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:50,940
including perhaps people that are participating in it.

3084
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:55,353
It's like this dark momentum of power

3085
01:40:55,353 --> 01:40:57,150
that you just get caught up in it.

3086
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:59,880
And that's the reason there's that kind of protection.

3087
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:00,990
Nobody wants that.

3088
01:41:00,990 --> 01:41:01,920
- So I use the metaphor,

3089
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,753
the ring of power. - Yeah.

3090
01:41:02,753 --> 01:41:04,440
- And for people who don't catch the reference,

3091
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:05,670
that's "Lord of the Rings."

3092
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:06,840
And the thing with the Ring of Power

3093
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,310
and "Lord of the Rings," it's the ring the Gollum

3094
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:10,290
has in the beginning and it turns you invisible.

3095
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:11,640
And it turns out it like unlocks

3096
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:12,750
all this like fearsome power.

3097
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:14,790
It's the most powerful thing in the world,

3098
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:15,623
is to key to everything.

3099
01:41:15,623 --> 01:41:17,880
And basically, the moral lesson of "Lord of the Rings,"

3100
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,050
which was, you know, written by a guy

3101
01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:21,390
who thought very deeply about these things is, yeah,

3102
01:41:21,390 --> 01:41:23,550
the ring of power is inherently corrupting.

3103
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:24,577
The characters at one point, they're like,

3104
01:41:24,577 --> 01:41:26,760
"Gandalf, just put on the ring and like fix this."

3105
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:29,910
Right, and he will not put the ring on

3106
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:32,250
even to like end the war

3107
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:34,590
because he knows that it will corrupt him.

3108
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:35,970
And then, you know, as it starts,

3109
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:38,777
the character of Gollum is the result of, you know,

3110
01:41:38,777 --> 01:41:41,220
like a normal character who ultimately becomes,

3111
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,300
you know, this incredibly corrupt

3112
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,440
and deranged version of himself.

3113
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,940
And so, I mean,

3114
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,650
I think you said something actually quite profound there,

3115
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:49,950
which is the ring of power is infinitely tempting.

3116
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:51,870
You know, the censorship machine is infinitely tempting.

3117
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:55,110
If you have it, like you are going to use it.

3118
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:57,960
It's overwhelmingly tempting 'cause it's so powerful,

3119
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,420
and that it will corrupt you.

3120
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:01,253
And yeah, I don't know

3121
01:42:01,253 --> 01:42:04,350
whether any of these people feel any of this today.

3122
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:05,220
They should.

3123
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:06,690
I don't know if they do.

3124
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:07,523
But yeah.

3125
01:42:07,523 --> 01:42:09,750
You go out five or 10 years later, you know, you would hope

3126
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,730
that you would realize that your soul has been corroded

3127
01:42:11,730 --> 01:42:13,470
and you probably started out thinking

3128
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:14,550
that you were a patriot

3129
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:15,990
and you were trying to defend democracy,

3130
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:17,310
and you ended up being, you know,

3131
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:18,990
extremely authoritarian and anti-democratic

3132
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:20,250
and anti-Western.

3133
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:23,163
- Can I ask you a tough question here?

3134
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,730
Staying on the ring of power,

3135
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:30,273
Elon is quickly becoming the most powerful human on Earth.

3136
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,730
- I'm not sure about that.

3137
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:36,900
- You don't think he is?

3138
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,180
- Well, he doesn't have the nukes so.

3139
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:40,233
- Nukes.

3140
01:42:40,233 --> 01:42:42,210
(Marc laughing)

3141
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:43,680
Yeah, there's different definitions

3142
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,540
and perspectives on power, right?

3143
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:46,545
- Yeah.

3144
01:42:46,545 --> 01:42:48,760
- How can he and/or Donald Trump

3145
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:53,100
avoid the corrupting aspects of this power?

3146
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:54,930
- I mean, I think the danger is there with power.

3147
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:56,760
It's flat out there.

3148
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,320
I would say with Elon, we'll see.

3149
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,150
I would say with Elon, and I would say by the way,

3150
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:01,860
overwhelmingly, I would say so far so good.

3151
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:03,300
I'm extremely, extremely thrilled by

3152
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:06,386
what he's done on almost every front for like,

3153
01:43:06,386 --> 01:43:07,324
you know, the last 30 years.

3154
01:43:07,324 --> 01:43:08,280
(Lex laughing)

3155
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:09,420
But including all this stuff recently,

3156
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:11,490
like I think he's been a real hero on a lot of topics

3157
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:12,870
where we needed to see heroism.

3158
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:15,090
But look, I would say, I guess the sort of case

3159
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:17,130
that he has this level of power is that some combination

3160
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:18,713
of the money

3161
01:43:18,713 --> 01:43:19,770
and the proximity to the president.

3162
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:21,387
And obviously both of those are, you know,

3163
01:43:21,387 --> 01:43:22,920
are instruments of power.

3164
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,930
The counter argument to that is,

3165
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:27,990
I do think a lot of how Elon is causing change

3166
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:29,518
in the world right now.

3167
01:43:29,518 --> 01:43:30,780
I mean, there's the companies he's running directly

3168
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:31,950
where I think he's doing very well,

3169
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:35,193
and we're investors in multiple of them and doing very well.

3170
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:37,800
But I think like a lot of the stuff

3171
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,690
that gets people mad at him is like,

3172
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:41,282
it's the social and political stuff

3173
01:43:41,282 --> 01:43:42,480
and it's, you know, it's his statements,

3174
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,520
and then it's the downstream effects of his statements.

3175
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:45,503
So like for example, it's, you know,

3176
01:43:45,503 --> 01:43:48,150
for the last couple weeks, it's been him, you know,

3177
01:43:48,150 --> 01:43:50,220
kind of weighing in on this rape gang scandal, you know,

3178
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:52,570
this rape organized child rape thing in the UK.

3179
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:57,060
And you know, it's a preface cascade.

3180
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:57,893
It's one of these things

3181
01:43:57,893 --> 01:43:59,190
where people knew there was a problem,

3182
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:00,840
they weren't willing to talk about it,

3183
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,490
it kind of got suppressed.

3184
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:04,440
And then Elon brought it up,

3185
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,330
and then all of a sudden there's now in the UK

3186
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:08,610
this like massive explosion of basically open conversation

3187
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:09,620
about it for the first time.

3188
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,280
And you know, it's like this catalyzing,

3189
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,690
all of a sudden everybody's kind of woken up

3190
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:15,330
and being like, "Oh, my God, you know, this is really bad."

3191
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:17,460
And there will be now, you know,

3192
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,050
pretty clearly big changes as a result.

3193
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:21,390
So, and Elon was, you know, he played the role of the boy

3194
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:23,880
who said, the emperor has no clothes, right?

3195
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,770
But here's the thing, here's my point.

3196
01:44:25,770 --> 01:44:28,047
Like he said it about something that was true, right?

3197
01:44:28,047 --> 01:44:30,690
And so had he said it about something that was false,

3198
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:32,760
you know, he would get no credit for it.

3199
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,560
He wouldn't deserve any credit for it.

3200
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,523
But he said something that was true.

3201
01:44:36,523 --> 01:44:37,800
And by the way, everybody over there instantly,

3202
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,214
they were like, "Oh, yeah, he's right," right? (laughs)

3203
01:44:40,214 --> 01:44:42,030
Like nobody seriously said they're just arguing

3204
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:43,290
the details now.

3205
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:45,498
So number one, it's like, okay, he says true things.

3206
01:44:45,498 --> 01:44:47,850
And so it's like, okay, how far...

3207
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:48,683
Put it this way.

3208
01:44:48,683 --> 01:44:51,450
Like, how worried are we about somebody becoming corrupt

3209
01:44:51,450 --> 01:44:52,710
by virtue of their power being

3210
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:54,540
that they get to speak the truth?

3211
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:56,430
And I guess I would say, especially in the last decade

3212
01:44:56,430 --> 01:44:57,263
of what we've been through

3213
01:44:57,263 --> 01:44:58,770
where everybody's been lying all the time about everything,

3214
01:44:58,770 --> 01:45:00,750
I'd say, I think we should run this experiment

3215
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,583
as hard as we can

3216
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:02,640
to get people to tell the truth.

3217
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:05,190
And so I don't feel that bad about that.

3218
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:07,170
And then the money side, you know,

3219
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:10,050
this rapidly gets into the money and politics question.

3220
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:11,333
And the money and politics question

3221
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,990
is this very interesting question

3222
01:45:12,990 --> 01:45:16,440
because it seems like it, there's a clear-cut case

3223
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:18,417
that the more money in politics, the worse things are

3224
01:45:18,417 --> 01:45:20,940
and the more corrupted the system is.

3225
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,430
That was a very popular topic of public conversation up

3226
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:27,990
until 2016 when Hillary outspent Trump 3 to 1 and lost.

3227
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:30,930
You'll notice that money and politics has all most vanished

3228
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:32,880
as a topic in the last eight years.

3229
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,040
And once again, Trump spent far, you know,

3230
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,260
Kamala raised and spent 1.5 billion

3231
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:38,940
on top of what Biden had spent.

3232
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:40,140
So they were at, I don't know,

3233
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,910
something like 3 billion total in Trump,

3234
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:44,560
I think spent again like a third or a fourth of that.

3235
01:45:45,753 --> 01:45:47,430
And so the money in politics kind of topic

3236
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:49,127
has kind of vanished from a popular conversation

3237
01:45:49,127 --> 01:45:50,360
in the last eight years.

3238
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:53,160
It has come back a little bit now that Elon is spending.

3239
01:45:56,297 --> 01:45:57,390
You know, but again, it's like,

3240
01:45:57,390 --> 01:45:59,220
okay, he's spending, but the data would seem

3241
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,140
to indicate in the last, at least in the last eight years,

3242
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:02,880
that money doesn't win the political battles.

3243
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,130
It's actually like the voters actually have a voice

3244
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:06,060
and they actually exercise it,

3245
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,560
and they don't just listen to ads.

3246
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:08,910
And so again, there I would say like, yeah,

3247
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:09,900
clearly there's some power there,

3248
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:13,920
but I don't know if it's some weapon

3249
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,390
that he can just like turn on

3250
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:17,850
and use in a definitive way.

3251
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:19,530
- And I don't know if those parallels there,

3252
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:22,710
but I could also say just on a human level,

3253
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:24,840
he has a good heart and I interact

3254
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:26,070
with a lot of powerful people,

3255
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:28,620
and that's not always the case.

3256
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:30,750
So that's a good thing there. - Yeah.

3257
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,790
- If we can draw parallels to the Hobbit

3258
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:34,680
or whatever. (laughs)

3259
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,970
Who gets to put on the ring?

3260
01:46:35,970 --> 01:46:36,803
- [Marc] Frodo.

3261
01:46:36,803 --> 01:46:38,100
- Frodo, yeah. - Yeah.

3262
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,380
Maybe one of the lessons of "Lord of the Rings" right,

3263
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:41,190
is even Frodo would've been, you know,

3264
01:46:41,190 --> 01:46:42,750
even Frodo would've been corrupted, right?

3265
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:45,510
But, you know, nevertheless, you had somebody who could do

3266
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:47,364
what it took at at the time.

3267
01:46:47,364 --> 01:46:48,390
The thing that I find just so amazing

3268
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:49,590
about the Elon phenomenon

3269
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:51,090
and all the critiques is, you know,

3270
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:52,110
the one thing that everybody

3271
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:53,970
in our societies universally agrees on

3272
01:46:53,970 --> 01:46:58,200
because it's sort of our post-Christian egalitarian.

3273
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,130
So, you know, we live in sort

3274
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:02,250
of this post-secularized Christian context in the West now,

3275
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:05,610
and it's, you know, we consider Christianity kind of,

3276
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:06,443
you know, backwards,

3277
01:47:06,443 --> 01:47:08,070
but we still believe essentially all the same things.

3278
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:11,147
We just dress them up in sort of fake science.

3279
01:47:11,147 --> 01:47:12,540
(Lex laughing)

3280
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:14,400
So the one thing that we're all told,

3281
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,540
we're all taught from early

3282
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:16,980
is that the best people in the world are the people

3283
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:18,390
who care about all of humanity, right?

3284
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:21,300
And we venerate, you know, all of our figures are people

3285
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:22,140
who care about all of, you know...

3286
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:23,820
Jesus cared about all of humanity.

3287
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:25,140
Gandhi cared about all of humanity.

3288
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:26,550
Martin Luther King cared about all of humanity.

3289
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:27,960
Like it's this universe,

3290
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:31,000
the person who cares the most about everybody.

3291
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,170
And with Elon, you have a guy who literally, like, is,

3292
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:35,340
he talks about this constantly,

3293
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:36,620
and he talks about exactly the same in private.

3294
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:38,820
He is literally, he is operating on behalf

3295
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:40,860
of all of humanity to try to get us to,

3296
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:41,693
you know, he goes through

3297
01:47:41,693 --> 01:47:43,290
to get us through multi-planetary civilization,

3298
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:44,940
so that we can survive a strike on any one planet,

3299
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:46,740
so that we can extend the light of human consciousness

3300
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:48,270
into the world and, you know, into the universe

3301
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:49,680
and have it persist,

3302
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:50,790
you know, in the good of the whole thing.

3303
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:52,560
And like literally the critique is, yeah,

3304
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,000
we want you to care about all of humanity,

3305
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,474
but not like that.

3306
01:47:55,474 --> 01:47:56,700
(both laughing)

3307
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:57,533
- Yeah.

3308
01:47:57,533 --> 01:47:58,683
All the critics.

3309
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:01,170
All the surface turmoil,

3310
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:03,115
the critics will be forgotten.

3311
01:48:03,115 --> 01:48:05,190
- Yeah, I think, yeah, that's clear.

3312
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:08,670
- You said that we always end up being ruled

3313
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:10,770
by the elite of some kind.

3314
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:13,560
Can you explain this law, this idea?

3315
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:16,980
- So this comes from a Italian political philosopher

3316
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,930
from about 100 years ago named Robert...

3317
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:20,130
I'm gonna mangle it from,

3318
01:48:20,130 --> 01:48:21,810
let you pronounce the Italian.

3319
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:25,350
Michels or Michels.

3320
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:28,200
And then I learned about it through a famous book

3321
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,866
on politics, probably the best book on politics written

3322
01:48:29,866 --> 01:48:30,990
in the 20th century

3323
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:34,290
called "The Machiavellians" by this guy James Burnham,

3324
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:35,760
who has had a big impact on me.

3325
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,110
But in "The Machiavellians,"

3326
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:38,100
he resurrects what he calls

3327
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,480
is this sort of Italian realist school

3328
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,560
of political philosophy

3329
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,470
from the '10s and '20s. And these were people, to be clear,

3330
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:44,730
this was not like a Mussolini thing.

3331
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:46,620
These were people who were trying to understand

3332
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:49,950
the actual mechanics of how politics actually works.

3333
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:53,700
So to get to the actual sort of mechanical substance of like

3334
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:55,140
how the political machine operates.

3335
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:58,680
And this guy, Michels had this concept ended up

3336
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:01,170
with called the iron law of oligarchy.

3337
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:03,960
And so what the iron law of oligarchy,

3338
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,130
and I mean take a step back

3339
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:06,240
to say what he meant by oligarchy

3340
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:07,260
'cause it has multiple meanings.

3341
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:09,030
So basically, in classic political theory,

3342
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:11,610
there's basically three forms of government at core.

3343
01:49:11,610 --> 01:49:14,460
There's democracy, which is rule of many.

3344
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:16,620
There's oligarchy, which is rule of the few.

3345
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:18,510
And there's monarchy, which is rule of the one.

3346
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:20,490
And you can just use that as a general framework

3347
01:49:20,490 --> 01:49:21,600
of any government you're gonna be under

3348
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,030
is gonna be one of those, just mechanical observation

3349
01:49:24,030 --> 01:49:25,410
without even saying which one's good or bad,

3350
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:27,063
just a structural observation.

3351
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:29,850
And so the question that Michels asked was like,

3352
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:31,290
is there such a thing as democracy?

3353
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:33,330
Like is there actually such a thing as democracy?

3354
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:36,690
Is there ever actually like direct government?

3355
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:37,523
And what he did was

3356
01:49:37,523 --> 01:49:39,930
he mounted this sort of incredible historical exploration

3357
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:42,330
of whether democracies had ever existed in the world.

3358
01:49:42,330 --> 01:49:44,100
And the answer basically is almost never.

3359
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:45,060
And we could talk about that.

3360
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:46,500
But the other thing he did was

3361
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:50,580
he sought out the most democratic private organization

3362
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:52,110
in the world that he could find at that point,

3363
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:52,943
which he concluded

3364
01:49:52,943 --> 01:49:55,800
was some basically communist German autoworkers union

3365
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,480
that was like wholly devoted to the workers

3366
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,530
of the world uniting, you know,

3367
01:49:58,530 --> 01:50:00,390
back when that was like the hot thing.

3368
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:01,710
And he went in there and he is like, okay,

3369
01:50:01,710 --> 01:50:03,510
this is the organization out of all organizations

3370
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:05,767
on planet Earth that must be operating

3371
01:50:05,767 --> 01:50:06,600
as a direct democracy.

3372
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,266
And he went in there and he is like, "Oh, nope."

3373
01:50:08,266 --> 01:50:09,099
There's a leadership class.

3374
01:50:09,099 --> 01:50:10,500
You know, there's like six guys at the top

3375
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,458
and they control everything (laughs)

3376
01:50:12,458 --> 01:50:14,040
and then they lead the rest of the membership along,

3377
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:14,940
you know, by the nose,

3378
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:17,760
which is, of course, the story of every union.

3379
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,383
The story of every union is always the story of, you know,

3380
01:50:20,383 --> 01:50:21,390
there's a Jimmy Hoffa in there, you know,

3381
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:22,704
kind of running the thing.

3382
01:50:22,704 --> 01:50:23,537
You know, we just saw

3383
01:50:23,537 --> 01:50:24,370
that with the dock workers' union, right?

3384
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:28,350
Like, you know, there's a guy and he's in charge.

3385
01:50:28,350 --> 01:50:30,810
And by the way, the number two is his son, right?

3386
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:34,020
Like, that's not like a, you know, an accident, right?

3387
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:36,970
So the iron law oligarchy basically says democracy is fake.

3388
01:50:38,430 --> 01:50:40,110
There's always a ruling elite structurally.

3389
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:41,133
And he said,

3390
01:50:41,133 --> 01:50:41,966
"The reason for that

3391
01:50:41,966 --> 01:50:44,100
is because the masses can't organize," right?

3392
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,390
What's the fundamental problem?

3393
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:47,400
Whether the mass is 25,000 people in a union

3394
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:48,930
or 250 million people in a country,

3395
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:51,750
the masses can't organize, the majority cannot organize,

3396
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,640
only a minority can organize.

3397
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:56,340
And to be effective in politics, you must organize.

3398
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,950
And therefore, every political structure

3399
01:50:58,950 --> 01:50:59,880
in human history

3400
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:03,000
has been some form of a small organized elite ruling

3401
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,980
a large and dispersed majority.

3402
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:05,853
Every single one.

3403
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:09,480
The Greeks and the Florentines

3404
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:11,910
had brief experiments in direct democracy,

3405
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:14,100
and they were total disasters.

3406
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:15,766
In Florence... I forget the name of it.

3407
01:51:15,766 --> 01:51:17,310
It was called like The Workers' Revolt

3408
01:51:17,310 --> 01:51:18,332
or something like that.

3409
01:51:18,332 --> 01:51:20,190
There was like a two-year period

3410
01:51:20,190 --> 01:51:22,920
where they basically experimented with direct democracy

3411
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:23,753
during the Renaissance,

3412
01:51:23,753 --> 01:51:25,320
and it was a complete disaster

3413
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:27,180
and they never tried it again.

3414
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:28,800
In the state of California,

3415
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,540
we have our own experiment on this,

3416
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:33,030
which is the proposition system, which is an overlay

3417
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:34,950
on top of the legislature.

3418
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:36,120
You know, anybody who looks at it

3419
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:38,520
for two seconds concludes it's been a complete disaster.

3420
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:39,780
It's just a catastrophe,

3421
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:41,970
and it's caused enormous damage to the state.

3422
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:44,400
And so basically, the presumption

3423
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,420
that we are in a democracy

3424
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:46,800
is just sort of by definition fake.

3425
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,330
Now, good news for the US,

3426
01:51:48,330 --> 01:51:49,437
it turns out the founders understood this.

3427
01:51:49,437 --> 01:51:51,720
And so of course, they didn't give us a direct democracy,

3428
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:53,627
they gave us a representative democracy, right?

3429
01:51:53,627 --> 01:51:56,040
And so they built the oligarchy into the system

3430
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:57,117
in the form of Congress

3431
01:51:57,117 --> 01:51:59,567
and the executive branch and the judicial branch.

3432
01:52:00,450 --> 01:52:01,770
So anyway, so as a consequence,

3433
01:52:01,770 --> 01:52:03,570
democracy is always everywhere fake.

3434
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:05,120
There is always a ruling elite.

3435
01:52:06,291 --> 01:52:08,480
And basically, the lesson of "The Machiavellians"

3436
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:10,140
is you can deny that if you want,

3437
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,520
but you're fooling yourself.

3438
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,980
The way to actually think about how to make a system work

3439
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:16,957
and maintain any sort of shred of freedom

3440
01:52:16,957 --> 01:52:18,900
is to actually understand that is actually what's happening.

3441
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:20,160
- And lucky for us,

3442
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:24,720
the founders saw this and figured out a way to,

3443
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:27,510
given that there's going to be a ruling elite,

3444
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:29,320
how to create a balance of power

3445
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,950
among that elite- - Yes.

3446
01:52:31,950 --> 01:52:32,787
- So it doesn't get out of hand.

3447
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:34,640
- And it was very clever. Right?

3448
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:36,870
And you know, some of this was based on earlier experiments.

3449
01:52:36,870 --> 01:52:37,703
By the way, you know,

3450
01:52:37,703 --> 01:52:39,087
these were very, very smart people, right?

3451
01:52:39,087 --> 01:52:40,770
And so they knew tremendous amounts

3452
01:52:40,770 --> 01:52:41,820
of like Greek and Roman history.

3453
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:43,837
They knew the Renaissance history, you know,

3454
01:52:43,837 --> 01:52:45,840
"The Federalist Papers," they argue this a great length.

3455
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,130
You can read it all.

3456
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:49,770
You know, they ran like a one of the best seminars

3457
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:51,840
in world history trying to figure this out.

3458
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,297
And they went through all this and yeah.

3459
01:52:53,297 --> 01:52:54,840
And so they thought through it very carefully,

3460
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,010
but just, I'll give you an example,

3461
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:57,810
which continues to be a hot topic.

3462
01:52:57,810 --> 01:52:59,370
So, you know, one way they did it

3463
01:52:59,370 --> 01:53:01,110
just through the three branches of government, right?

3464
01:53:01,110 --> 01:53:02,910
Executive, legislative and judicial,

3465
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:05,550
sort of balance of powers.

3466
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:06,383
But the other way,

3467
01:53:06,383 --> 01:53:07,710
they did it was they sort of echoing

3468
01:53:07,710 --> 01:53:08,700
what had been done earlier.

3469
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:10,800
I think in the UK Parliament,

3470
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,180
they created the two different bodies

3471
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:13,710
of the legislature, right?

3472
01:53:13,710 --> 01:53:15,180
And so the, you know, the House and the Senate,

3473
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:16,710
and as you know, the house is a portion

3474
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:19,680
on the basis of population, and the Senate is not, right?

3475
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:21,360
The small states have just as many senators

3476
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,620
as the big states.

3477
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,690
And then they made the deliberate decision

3478
01:53:24,690 --> 01:53:26,490
to have the house get reelected every two years

3479
01:53:26,490 --> 01:53:28,167
to make it very responsive to the will of the people.

3480
01:53:28,167 --> 01:53:29,820
And they made the decision to have the Senate

3481
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:33,300
get reelected every six years so that it had more buffer

3482
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:35,130
from the passions of the moment.

3483
01:53:35,130 --> 01:53:35,963
But what's interesting

3484
01:53:35,963 --> 01:53:37,890
is they didn't choose one or the other, right?

3485
01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:39,210
They did them both.

3486
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:40,770
And then to get legislation passed,

3487
01:53:40,770 --> 01:53:41,747
you have to get through both of them.

3488
01:53:41,747 --> 01:53:43,560
And so they built in like a second layer

3489
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,180
of checks and balances.

3490
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:47,580
And then there's a thousand observations

3491
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:48,540
we could make about like

3492
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:49,797
how well the system is working today

3493
01:53:49,797 --> 01:53:52,170
and like how much does it live up to the ideal

3494
01:53:52,170 --> 01:53:53,790
and how much are we actually complying

3495
01:53:53,790 --> 01:53:54,720
with the constitution?

3496
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:55,770
And you know,

3497
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:58,140
there's lots of open questions there, but you know,

3498
01:53:58,140 --> 01:54:01,560
this system has survived for coming on 250 years

3499
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,690
with a country that has been spectacularly successful.

3500
01:54:03,690 --> 01:54:05,790
But I don't think, at least, you know, I don't think any

3501
01:54:05,790 --> 01:54:07,287
of us would trade the system for any other one.

3502
01:54:07,287 --> 01:54:09,810
And so it's, yeah, one of the great all-time achievements.

3503
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:10,643
- Yeah, it's incredible.

3504
01:54:10,643 --> 01:54:13,080
And we should say they were all pretty young relative

3505
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:15,810
to our current set of leaders. - They were.

3506
01:54:15,810 --> 01:54:17,970
Many in their 20s at the time, and like super geniuses.

3507
01:54:17,970 --> 01:54:19,620
This is one of those things where it's just like, all right,

3508
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:22,050
something happened where there was a group of people where,

3509
01:54:22,050 --> 01:54:23,190
you know, nobody ever tested their IQs,

3510
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:25,350
but like these are Einsteins of politics.

3511
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:26,400
Yeah. An amazing thing.

3512
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,200
But anyway, I go through all that,

3513
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:29,910
which is they were very keen students

3514
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:33,630
of the actual mechanical practice of democracy,

3515
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:35,550
not fixated on what was desirable.

3516
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:38,040
They were incredibly focused on what would actually work,

3517
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,870
which is, you know, I think the way to think

3518
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:40,703
about these things.

3519
01:54:40,703 --> 01:54:42,420
- There were engineers of sort,

3520
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:45,003
not the fuzzy humanity students of sort.

3521
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:48,120
- They were shape rotators, not word cells. (laughs)

3522
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,590
- I remember that.

3523
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:52,140
Wow. That meme came and went.

3524
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:53,250
I think you were center to them,

3525
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:54,857
you're center to a lot of memes.

3526
01:54:54,857 --> 01:54:55,690
- [Marc] I was.

3527
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:58,260
- You're the meme dealer and the meme popularizer.

3528
01:54:58,260 --> 01:54:59,160
- That's true.

3529
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:00,481
That meme I get some credit for

3530
01:55:00,481 --> 01:55:01,314
and then the current thing is,

3531
01:55:01,314 --> 01:55:02,507
the other one I get some credit for.

3532
01:55:02,507 --> 01:55:03,600
I don't know that I invented either one,

3533
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:05,670
but I popularized them.

3534
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:06,900
- Take credit and run with it.

3535
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:07,733
- [Marc] Yep.

3536
01:55:09,548 --> 01:55:11,848
- If we can just linger on the Machiavellians.

3537
01:55:13,062 --> 01:55:15,330
It's a study of power and power dynamics,

3538
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:19,050
like you mentioned looking at the actual reality

3539
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:21,600
of the machinery of power.

3540
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,970
From everything you've seen now in government,

3541
01:55:23,970 --> 01:55:25,770
but also in companies,

3542
01:55:25,770 --> 01:55:28,590
what are some interesting things you can sort of continue

3543
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:30,540
to say about the dynamics of power,

3544
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:31,620
the jostling for power

3545
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:34,380
that happens inside these institutions?

3546
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:36,090
- Yeah, so a lot of it, you know,

3547
01:55:36,090 --> 01:55:37,950
we already talked about this a bit with the universities,

3548
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:40,710
which is you can apply a Machiavellian-style lens to the...

3549
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:42,690
It's why I posed the question to you that I did,

3550
01:55:42,690 --> 01:55:46,020
which is, okay, who runs the university, the trustees,

3551
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:48,390
the administration, the students or the faculty?

3552
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:50,460
And you know, the true answer is some combination

3553
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:53,550
of the three or of the four, plus the donors,

3554
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:54,630
by the way, plus the government,

3555
01:55:54,630 --> 01:55:56,070
plus the press, et cetera, right?

3556
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:57,270
And so you know,

3557
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:59,400
there's a mechanical interpretation of that.

3558
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:01,530
I mean, companies operate under the exact same,

3559
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:02,430
you know, set of questions.

3560
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:03,960
Who runs a company?

3561
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,010
You know, the CEO,

3562
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:07,500
but like the CEO runs the company basically up to the day

3563
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:10,260
that either the shareholders or the management team revolt.

3564
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:12,450
If the shareholders revolt, it's very hard for the CEO

3565
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:13,283
to stay in the seat.

3566
01:56:13,283 --> 01:56:14,116
If the management team revolts,

3567
01:56:14,116 --> 01:56:16,080
it's very hard for the CEO to stay in the seat.

3568
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,460
By the way, if the employees revolt,

3569
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:19,170
it's also hard to stay in the seat.

3570
01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:20,853
By the way, if The New York Times comes at you,

3571
01:56:20,853 --> 01:56:22,500
it's also very hard to stay in the seat.

3572
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,550
If the Senate comes at you,

3573
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:25,020
it's very hard to stay in the seat.

3574
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:28,890
So, you know, like a reductionist version

3575
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:31,733
of this that is a good shorthand is who can get who fired?

3576
01:56:33,121 --> 01:56:34,380
You know, so who has more power?

3577
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:36,303
You know, the newspaper columnist who makes, you know,

3578
01:56:36,303 --> 01:56:37,740
$200,000 a year,

3579
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:40,200
or the CEO who makes, you know, $200 million a year.

3580
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,060
And it's like, well, I know for sure

3581
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:43,530
that the columnist can get the CEO fired.

3582
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:46,290
I've seen that happen before I have yet to see a CEO

3583
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:47,970
get a columnist fired.

3584
01:56:47,970 --> 01:56:52,487
- Did anyone ever get fired from the Bill Ackman assault

3585
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,050
on journalism? (laughs)

3586
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:57,930
So Bill like really showed the bullshit

3587
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:59,400
that happens in journalism.

3588
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:01,297
- No, 'cause what happens is they wear it with a...

3589
01:57:01,297 --> 01:57:03,150
And yeah, I would say to their credit,

3590
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:04,200
they wear it as a badge of honor

3591
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:05,070
and then to their shame,

3592
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:06,630
they wear it as a badge of honor, right?

3593
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:09,300
Which is, you know, if they're doing the right thing,

3594
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:11,610
then they are justifiably priding themselves

3595
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:13,170
for standing up under pressure.

3596
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:15,090
But it also means that they can't respond

3597
01:57:15,090 --> 01:57:16,020
to legitimate criticism

3598
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:18,720
and, you know, they're obviously terrible at that now.

3599
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:22,920
As I recall, he went straight to the CEO of Axel Springer

3600
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,480
that owns Insider.

3601
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,610
You know, and I happen to know the CEO,

3602
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:27,630
and I think he's quite a good CEO,

3603
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:28,983
but I like, well, this is a good example.

3604
01:57:28,983 --> 01:57:32,760
Does the CEO Axel Springer run his own company, right?

3605
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:34,280
Like, well, there's a fascinating, okay,

3606
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:36,117
so there's a fascinating playing out right now.

3607
01:57:36,117 --> 01:57:38,130
Not to dwell on these fires,

3608
01:57:38,130 --> 01:57:41,190
but you see the pressure reveals things, right?

3609
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:42,630
And so if you've been watching what's happened

3610
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:45,150
with the LA Times recently, so this guy,

3611
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:46,620
biotech entrepreneur buys the LA Times,

3612
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:48,060
like whatever, eight years ago.

3613
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:51,900
It is just like the most radical social revolutionary thing

3614
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:52,980
you can possibly imagine.

3615
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:55,650
It's endorses every crazy left-wing radical you can imagine.

3616
01:57:55,650 --> 01:57:56,760
It endorses Karen Bass,

3617
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:57,750
it endorses Gavin Newsom.

3618
01:57:57,750 --> 01:58:00,450
It's just like a litany of all the people who, you know,

3619
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:02,310
are currently burning the city to the ground.

3620
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:04,230
It's just like endorsed every single bad person

3621
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:05,520
every step of the way.

3622
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:07,200
He's owned it the entire time.

3623
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:09,840
You know, for the first time,

3624
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,790
I think put his foot down right before the November election

3625
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:13,530
and said, we're getting...

3626
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:14,640
He said, "We're gonna get outta this thing

3627
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:15,900
where we just always endorse the Democrat."

3628
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:17,227
And we said, we're not endorsing, I think he said,

3629
01:58:17,227 --> 01:58:18,810
"We're not endorsing for the presidency."

3630
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:20,490
And like the paper flipped out, right?

3631
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:23,104
It's like our billionaire backer who's...

3632
01:58:23,104 --> 01:58:23,937
And I don't know what he spends, but like,

3633
01:58:23,937 --> 01:58:26,700
he must be burning 50 or 100 million dollars a year out

3634
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:28,560
of his pocket to keep this thing running.

3635
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,130
He paid 500 million for it, which is amazing.

3636
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:35,790
Back when people still thought these things were businesses.

3637
01:58:35,790 --> 01:58:39,060
And then he's probably burned another 500 million

3638
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:40,527
over the last decade keeping it running.

3639
01:58:40,527 --> 01:58:42,960
And he burns probably another 50, 100 million a year

3640
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:43,793
to do this.

3641
01:58:43,793 --> 01:58:45,360
And the journalists at the LA Times hate him

3642
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,562
with the fury of 1,000 suns.

3643
01:58:47,562 --> 01:58:49,710
Like they just like absolutely freaking despise him.

3644
01:58:49,710 --> 01:58:51,390
And they have been like attacking him

3645
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:53,190
and you know, the ones that can get jobs elsewhere quit

3646
01:58:53,190 --> 01:58:54,390
and do it, and the rest just stay

3647
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:56,160
and say the worst, you know, most horrible things about him.

3648
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:58,553
And they wanna constantly run these stories attacking him.

3649
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,620
And so he has had this reaction

3650
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:03,660
that a lot of people in LA are having right now

3651
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:04,493
to this fire,

3652
01:59:04,493 --> 01:59:06,360
and to this just like incredibly vivid collapse

3653
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:07,193
of leadership.

3654
01:59:07,193 --> 01:59:08,026
And all these people

3655
01:59:08,026 --> 01:59:10,383
that his paper head endorsed are just disasters.

3656
01:59:11,633 --> 01:59:14,103
And he's on this tour, he's basically just,

3657
01:59:15,687 --> 01:59:16,920
he's decided to be the boy

3658
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:18,030
who says the emperor has no clothes,

3659
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:20,550
but he's doing it to his own newspaper. (laughs)

3660
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:21,383
Very smart guy.

3661
01:59:21,383 --> 01:59:23,160
He is not a press tour and he is basically saying, yeah,

3662
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:25,200
yes, we did all that and we endorsed all these people

3663
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:27,600
and it was a huge mistake and we're gonna completely change.

3664
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:30,990
And his paper is, you know, in a complete internal revolt.

3665
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:32,040
But I go through it, which is okay,

3666
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:33,270
now we have a very interesting question,

3667
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:35,550
which is who runs the LA Times?

3668
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:37,710
Because for the last eight years,

3669
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:40,290
it hasn't been him. (laughs)

3670
01:59:40,290 --> 01:59:41,490
It's been the reporters.

3671
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:44,917
Now for the first time, the owner is showing up saying,

3672
01:59:44,917 --> 01:59:46,140
"Oh, no, I'm actually in charge."

3673
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:48,570
And the reporters are saying, "No, you're not."

3674
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:51,087
And like it is freaking on.

3675
01:59:51,087 --> 01:59:53,220
And so again, if the, the Machiavellian's mindset on this

3676
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:56,790
is like, okay, how is power actually exercised here?

3677
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:58,650
Can a guy who's like even super rich

3678
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:00,630
and super powerful who even owns his own newspaper,

3679
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:02,550
can he stand up to a full-scale assault,

3680
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:03,780
not only by his own reporters,

3681
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,730
but by every other journalism outlet

3682
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:08,400
who also now thinks he's the Antichrist?

3683
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,590
- And he is trying to exercise power

3684
02:00:10,590 --> 02:00:11,627
by speaking out publicly

3685
02:00:11,627 --> 02:00:13,710
and so that's the game of power there.

3686
02:00:13,710 --> 02:00:15,085
- And firing people. - Firing people. Yeah.

3687
02:00:15,085 --> 02:00:17,040
- You know, he has removed people and he has set new rules.

3688
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:19,140
I mean, he is now, I think at long,

3689
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:19,973
I think he's saying

3690
02:00:19,973 --> 02:00:21,960
he's now at long last actually exercising prerogatives

3691
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:23,400
of an owner of a business,

3692
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:24,750
which is decide on the policies

3693
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:25,710
and staffing of the business.

3694
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:27,960
There are certain other owners of these publications

3695
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:30,528
that are doing similar things right now.

3696
02:00:30,528 --> 02:00:32,910
He's the one I don't know, so he's the one I can talk about.

3697
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:33,810
But there are others that are going

3698
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,020
through the same thing right now.

3699
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:38,610
And I think it's a really interesting open question.

3700
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:40,650
Like, you know, in a fight between the employees

3701
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:42,420
and the employer, like it's not crystal clear

3702
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:43,920
that the employer wins that one.

3703
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,540
- And just to stay on journalism for a second,

3704
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:46,620
we mentioned Bill Ackman.

3705
02:00:46,620 --> 02:00:50,280
I just wanna say put him in the category we mentioned

3706
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:52,740
before of a really courageous person.

3707
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:56,020
I don't think I've ever seen anybody so fearless

3708
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,910
in going after, you know,

3709
02:00:59,910 --> 02:01:02,970
in following what he believes in publicly.

3710
02:01:02,970 --> 02:01:04,023
That's courage.

3711
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:07,860
That several things he's done publicly

3712
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:09,210
has been really inspiring.

3713
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:10,980
Just being courageous.

3714
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:11,860
- What do you think is like the most impressive example?

3715
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:14,940
- Where he went after journalists

3716
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:17,970
whose whole incentive is to, like,

3717
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:22,920
I mean, it's like kicking the beehive or whatever,

3718
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:26,790
you know, what's gonna follow and do that.

3719
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:28,020
I mean that's why it's difficult

3720
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:31,260
to challenge journalistic organizations

3721
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:32,940
because they're going to, you know,

3722
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:34,680
there's just so many mechanisms they use,

3723
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:36,240
including like writing articles

3724
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:38,940
and get cited by Wikipedia and then drive the narrative

3725
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:40,140
and then they can get you fired,

3726
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:41,340
all this kind of stuff.

3727
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:46,340
Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer just tweets these essays

3728
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:50,730
and just goes after them legally

3729
02:01:50,730 --> 02:01:52,110
and also in the public eye.

3730
02:01:52,110 --> 02:01:53,883
And just, I don't know.

3731
02:01:53,883 --> 02:01:55,200
That was truly inspiring.

3732
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:59,760
There's not many people like that out in public

3733
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:01,590
and hopefully that inspires not just me,

3734
02:02:01,590 --> 02:02:05,310
but many others to be courageous themselves.

3735
02:02:05,310 --> 02:02:06,143
- Did you know of him

3736
02:02:06,143 --> 02:02:08,370
before he started doing this in public?

3737
02:02:08,370 --> 02:02:10,200
- I knew of Neri, his wife,

3738
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:11,970
who's a brilliant researcher and scientist.

3739
02:02:11,970 --> 02:02:13,230
And so I admire her.

3740
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:15,300
Looked up to her and think she's amazing.

3741
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:16,590
- Well, the reason I ask if you knew about Bill

3742
02:02:16,590 --> 02:02:19,200
is because a lot of people had not heard of him before,

3743
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:20,520
especially like before October 7th

3744
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:22,200
and before some of the campaigns he's been running

3745
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:24,330
since in public, and with Harvard and so forth.

3746
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:26,310
But he was very well known

3747
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:28,380
in the investment world before that.

3748
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:30,240
So he was a famous,

3749
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:32,940
he was so-called activist investor for, you know,

3750
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:33,777
very, very successful

3751
02:02:33,777 --> 02:02:36,280
and very widely respected for probably 30 years

3752
02:02:37,539 --> 02:02:38,372
before now.

3753
02:02:38,372 --> 02:02:40,380
And I bring that up because it turns out,

3754
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:41,765
they weren't for the most part battles

3755
02:02:41,765 --> 02:02:43,320
that happened in kind of full public view.

3756
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:44,910
They weren't national stories, but in the business

3757
02:02:44,910 --> 02:02:48,240
and investing world, the activist investor is a very,

3758
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:49,230
it's like in the movie "Taken."

3759
02:02:49,230 --> 02:02:50,858
It's a very specific set of skills.

3760
02:02:50,858 --> 02:02:52,260
(both laughing)

3761
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:53,331
- Yeah.

3762
02:02:53,331 --> 02:02:55,260
- On how to like really take control

3763
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:56,093
of situations. - Yeah.

3764
02:02:56,093 --> 02:02:59,190
- And how to wreck the people who you're going up against.

3765
02:02:59,190 --> 02:03:03,600
And there's been controversy over the years

3766
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:05,760
on this topic, and there's too much detail to go into.

3767
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,350
But the defense of activist investing,

3768
02:03:07,350 --> 02:03:09,990
which I think is valid is, you know, these are the guys

3769
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:11,130
who basically go in

3770
02:03:11,130 --> 02:03:12,180
and take stakes in companies

3771
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:15,371
that are being poorly managed or under-optimized.

3772
02:03:15,371 --> 02:03:16,204
And then generally what that means is,

3773
02:03:16,204 --> 02:03:18,660
at least the theory is that means the existing management

3774
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:22,200
is become entrenched and lazy, mediocre, you know,

3775
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:23,033
whatever.

3776
02:03:23,033 --> 02:03:25,290
Not, you're responding to the needs of the shareholders.

3777
02:03:25,290 --> 02:03:27,510
Often not responding to the customers.

3778
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:30,900
And the activists basically go in with a minority position

3779
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:33,180
and then they rally support among other investors

3780
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:34,650
who are not activists.

3781
02:03:34,650 --> 02:03:37,350
And then they basically show up and they force change.

3782
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:39,450
But they are the aggressive version of this.

3783
02:03:39,450 --> 02:03:41,610
And I've been involved in companies

3784
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:42,450
that have been on the receiving end

3785
02:03:42,450 --> 02:03:43,800
of these- - Oh-oh.

3786
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:45,810
- Where it is amazing how much somebody like

3787
02:03:45,810 --> 02:03:47,700
that can exert pressure on situations

3788
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:49,620
even when they don't have formal control.

3789
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:53,340
So it would be another chess piece on the mechanical board

3790
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:54,630
of kind of how power gets exercised.

3791
02:03:54,630 --> 02:03:56,280
And basically what happens is the effective analysts,

3792
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:57,870
a large amount of time,

3793
02:03:57,870 --> 02:03:59,850
they end up taking over control of companies

3794
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:00,810
even though they never own more

3795
02:04:00,810 --> 02:04:02,520
than like 5% of the stock.

3796
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:03,990
And so anyway, so it turns out with Bill's,

3797
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,950
it's such a fascinating case.

3798
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:07,530
'Cause he has that like complete skillset.

3799
02:04:07,530 --> 02:04:08,817
- (laughs) Yeah.

3800
02:04:08,817 --> 02:04:10,980
- And he has now decided to bring it to bear

3801
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:13,410
in areas that are not just companies.

3802
02:04:13,410 --> 02:04:14,970
And two interesting things for that.

3803
02:04:14,970 --> 02:04:16,920
One is, you know, some of these places, you know,

3804
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:18,150
and some of these battles are still ongoing,

3805
02:04:18,150 --> 02:04:21,300
but number one, like a lot of people who run universities

3806
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:22,500
or newspapers are not used

3807
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:24,480
to being up against somebody like this.

3808
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:26,730
And by the way, also now with infinitely deep pockets

3809
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:28,050
and lots of experience in courtrooms

3810
02:04:28,050 --> 02:04:29,880
and all the things that kind of go with that.

3811
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,770
But the other is through example,

3812
02:04:31,770 --> 02:04:34,080
he is teaching a lot of the rest of us

3813
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:36,720
the activists playbook, like in real time.

3814
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:40,230
And so Liam Neeson skillset is getting more broadly diffused

3815
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:42,330
just by being able to watch and learn from him.

3816
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:44,400
So I think he's having a, you know,

3817
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:45,450
I would put him up there with Elon

3818
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:47,580
in terms of somebody who's really affecting

3819
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:48,780
how all this is playing out.

3820
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:50,640
- But even skillset aside just courage and-

3821
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:51,570
- Yes, including by the way,

3822
02:04:51,570 --> 02:04:53,790
courage to go outside of his own zone.

3823
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,320
- Yeah. - Right.

3824
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:56,520
You know, 'cause like he hasn't been,

3825
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:57,353
I'll give you an example.

3826
02:04:57,353 --> 02:04:59,610
Like my firm venture capital firm, we have LPs.

3827
02:04:59,610 --> 02:05:01,650
There are things that I feel like I can't do or say

3828
02:05:01,650 --> 02:05:03,630
'cause I feel like I would be bringing, you know,

3829
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:04,890
I would be bringing embarrassment

3830
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:07,080
or other consequences to our LPs.

3831
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:10,412
He has investors also where he worries about that.

3832
02:05:10,412 --> 02:05:11,460
And so a couple things.

3833
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:13,350
One, it's his willingness to go out a bit

3834
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:15,750
and risk his relationship with his own investors.

3835
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:16,710
But I will tell you the other thing,

3836
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:18,600
which is his investors... I know this for a fact.

3837
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:20,790
His investors have been remarkably supportive

3838
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:22,344
of him doing that.

3839
02:05:22,344 --> 02:05:23,177
'Cause as it turns out,

3840
02:05:23,177 --> 02:05:25,050
a lot of them actually agree with him.

3841
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:27,557
And so it is the same thing he does

3842
02:05:27,557 --> 02:05:29,040
in the his activism campaigns.

3843
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,990
He is able to be the tip of the spear on something

3844
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:33,060
that actually a lot more people agree with.

3845
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:33,893
- Yeah.

3846
02:05:33,893 --> 02:05:35,700
It turns out if you have truth behind you,

3847
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:37,200
it helps.

3848
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,820
- And just again, our, you know,

3849
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:41,670
how I started is a lot of people are just fed up.

3850
02:05:41,670 --> 02:05:43,560
- You've been spending a bunch of time in Mar-a-Lago,

3851
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:46,890
in Palm Beach helping the new administration in many ways,

3852
02:05:46,890 --> 02:05:49,500
including interviewing people who might join.

3853
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:53,250
So what's your general sense about the talent,

3854
02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:54,570
about the people who are coming in

3855
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:56,610
into the new administration?

3856
02:05:56,610 --> 02:05:57,630
- So I should start by saying

3857
02:05:57,630 --> 02:05:59,780
I'm not a member of the new administration.

3858
02:06:01,703 --> 02:06:03,060
I'm not like in the room when a lot of these people

3859
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:03,893
are being selected.

3860
02:06:03,893 --> 02:06:05,760
- I believe you said unpaid intern.

3861
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:06,720
- I'm an unpaid intern.

3862
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:09,330
So I'm a volunteer and I, you know, when helpful,

3863
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:12,603
but I'm not making the decisions, nor am I in a position to,

3864
02:06:12,603 --> 02:06:13,436
you know, speak for the administration.

3865
02:06:13,436 --> 02:06:14,880
So I don't wanna say anything

3866
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:15,947
that would cause people to think I'm doing that.

3867
02:06:15,947 --> 02:06:17,520
It's a very unusual situation, right?

3868
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,705
Where you had an incumbent president

3869
02:06:18,705 --> 02:06:19,800
and then you had a four-year gap

3870
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:20,633
where he is outta office,

3871
02:06:20,633 --> 02:06:22,170
and then you have him coming back, right?

3872
02:06:22,170 --> 02:06:24,150
And as you'll recall, there was a fair amount

3873
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:27,600
of controversy over the end of the first term.

3874
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,433
- Oh, yeah.

3875
02:06:28,433 --> 02:06:31,080
- The specific concern was, you know,

3876
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:32,666
the first Trump administration,

3877
02:06:32,666 --> 02:06:33,840
you know, they will all say this is like,

3878
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,250
they didn't come in with a team, right?

3879
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:36,900
So you know, they didn't come in with a team

3880
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:38,580
and most of the sort of institutional base

3881
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:40,953
of the Republican Party were Bush Republicans.

3882
02:06:41,801 --> 02:06:42,634
And many of them had become never Trumpers.

3883
02:06:42,634 --> 02:06:45,030
And so they had a hard time putting the team together.

3884
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:45,863
And then by the way,

3885
02:06:45,863 --> 02:06:47,100
they had a hard time getting people confirmed.

3886
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,720
And so if you talk to the people

3887
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:49,770
who were there in the first term,

3888
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:51,630
it took them 2 to 3 years to kind of even get

3889
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:53,070
the government in place.

3890
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:56,010
And then they basically only had the government in place,

3891
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:58,620
you know, for basically like 18 months, and then COVID hit.

3892
02:06:58,620 --> 02:07:00,330
You know, and then sort of the aftermath and everything,

3893
02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:02,250
and all the drama and headlines and everything.

3894
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:04,110
And so the concern, you know,

3895
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:05,400
including from some various smart people

3896
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,690
in the last two years has been, boy,

3897
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:08,250
if Trump gets a second term,

3898
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:10,020
is he gonna be able to get a team that

3899
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:11,670
is as good as the team he had last time

3900
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:13,170
or a team that is actually not as good?

3901
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:14,850
'Cause maybe people got burned out.

3902
02:07:14,850 --> 02:07:16,170
Maybe they're more cynical now.

3903
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:18,210
Maybe they're not willing to go through the drama.

3904
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:20,430
By the way, a lot of people in the first term came under,

3905
02:07:20,430 --> 02:07:22,230
like, you know, with their own withering legal assaults,

3906
02:07:22,230 --> 02:07:23,550
and, you know, some of them went to prison

3907
02:07:23,550 --> 02:07:26,340
and like, you know, a lot of stuff happened,

3908
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:28,800
lots of investigations, lots of legal fees,

3909
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:31,860
lots of bad press, lots of debanking, by the way.

3910
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:34,860
A lot of the officials in the first Trump term got debanked,

3911
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:39,180
including the president's wife and son.

3912
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:40,512
- Yeah, I heard you tell that story.

3913
02:07:40,512 --> 02:07:41,345
That's insane.

3914
02:07:41,345 --> 02:07:42,178
That's just insane.

3915
02:07:42,178 --> 02:07:43,080
- In the wake of the first term, yes.

3916
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:46,833
We now take out spouses and children with our ring of power.

3917
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:49,810
And so there's like this legitimate question

3918
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:50,880
as to like, whether, okay,

3919
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:52,317
what will the team for the second term look like?

3920
02:07:52,317 --> 02:07:54,090
And at least what I've seen

3921
02:07:54,090 --> 02:07:55,380
and what you're seeing with the appointments

3922
02:07:55,380 --> 02:07:57,660
is it looks much, much better.

3923
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:59,400
First of all, it just looks better than the first term

3924
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:00,540
and not 'cause the people in the first term

3925
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:01,440
were not necessarily good,

3926
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:03,330
but just you just have this like,

3927
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:05,580
influx of like incredibly capable people that have shown up

3928
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:07,590
that wanna be part of this,

3929
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:09,780
and you just didn't have that the first time.

3930
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:11,610
And so they're just drawing on a much deeper,

3931
02:08:11,610 --> 02:08:13,650
richer talent pool than they had the first time.

3932
02:08:13,650 --> 02:08:15,690
And they're drawing on people who know what the game is.

3933
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:17,610
Like they're drawing on people now who know

3934
02:08:17,610 --> 02:08:19,887
what is gonna happen and they're still willing to do it.

3935
02:08:19,887 --> 02:08:21,990
And so they're gonna get, I think, you know,

3936
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:23,310
some of the best people from the first term,

3937
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:24,480
but they're bringing in a lot of people

3938
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:27,033
who they couldn't get the first time around.

3939
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:29,820
And then second is there's a bunch of people,

3940
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:30,810
including people in the first term

3941
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:32,400
where they're just 10 years older.

3942
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,200
And so they went through the first term

3943
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:36,150
and they just learned how everything works.

3944
02:08:36,150 --> 02:08:37,140
Or they're young people

3945
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:38,520
who just had a different point of view

3946
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:39,870
and now they're 10 years older

3947
02:08:39,870 --> 02:08:42,240
and they're ready to go serving government.

3948
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,160
And so there's a generational shift happening.

3949
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:46,020
And actually one of the interesting things about the team

3950
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:48,660
that's forming up is it's remarkably young.

3951
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:50,637
Some of the cabinet members, and then many of the second

3952
02:08:50,637 --> 02:08:53,340
and third level people are like in their 30s and 40s,

3953
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:56,301
you know, which is a big change from the gerontocracy that,

3954
02:08:56,301 --> 02:08:58,980
you know, we've been under for the last 30 years.

3955
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:00,927
And so I think the caliber has been outstanding, you know,

3956
02:09:00,927 --> 02:09:03,090
and we could sit here and list tons and tons of people,

3957
02:09:03,090 --> 02:09:05,043
but like, you know, the people who are running, you know,

3958
02:09:05,043 --> 02:09:05,903
it's everything from the people

3959
02:09:05,903 --> 02:09:08,310
who are running all the different departments at HHS.

3960
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:09,690
It's the people running, you know,

3961
02:09:09,690 --> 02:09:11,820
the number two at the Pentagon is Steve Feinberg,

3962
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:13,560
who's just like an incredible legend

3963
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:16,200
of private equity, incredible capable guy.

3964
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:18,687
We've got, actually two of my partners are going in

3965
02:09:18,687 --> 02:09:20,970
who I both think are amazing.

3966
02:09:20,970 --> 02:09:22,797
Yeah, like many, many parts of the government,

3967
02:09:22,797 --> 02:09:25,710
the people are like, really impressive.

3968
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:27,420
- Well, I think one of the concerns

3969
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:32,420
is actually that given the human being of Donald Trump,

3970
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:36,930
that there would be more tendency towards,

3971
02:09:36,930 --> 02:09:40,770
let's say favoritism versus meritocracy.

3972
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:44,850
That there's kind of circles of sycophancy that form.

3973
02:09:44,850 --> 02:09:49,440
And if you're be able to be loyal

3974
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:50,970
and never oppose

3975
02:09:50,970 --> 02:09:54,240
and just be basically suck up to the president,

3976
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:55,440
that you'll get a position.

3977
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:56,580
So that's one of the concerns.

3978
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:59,580
And I think you're in a good position to speak to the degree

3979
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:04,560
that's happening versus hiring based on merit

3980
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,600
and just getting great teams.

3981
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:08,820
- Yeah, so look, I just start by saying any leader

3982
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:11,250
at that level, by the way, any CEO,

3983
02:10:11,250 --> 02:10:12,620
there's always some risk of that, right?

3984
02:10:12,620 --> 02:10:13,863
So there's always some, you know,

3985
02:10:13,863 --> 02:10:15,600
it's like a natural reality warps

3986
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:16,770
around powerful leaders.

3987
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:18,480
And so there's always some risk to that.

3988
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:19,680
Of course, the good and powerful leaders

3989
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:20,850
are, you know, very aware of that.

3990
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:22,260
And Trump, at this point in his life,

3991
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:23,280
I think is highly aware of that,

3992
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:24,330
at least in my interactions with him.

3993
02:10:24,330 --> 02:10:26,613
Like he definitely seems very aware of that.

3994
02:10:28,776 --> 02:10:29,609
So that's one thing.

3995
02:10:29,609 --> 02:10:30,990
I would just say that the, I think the way to look at that,

3996
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:31,890
I mean, and look, like I said,

3997
02:10:31,890 --> 02:10:33,060
I don't wanna predict what's gonna happen

3998
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:34,440
once this whole thing starts unfolding,

3999
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,360
but I would just say that it's again,

4000
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,193
the caliber of the people

4001
02:10:37,193 --> 02:10:38,460
who are showing up and getting the jobs,

4002
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:39,660
and then the fact that these are

4003
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:42,510
some of the most accomplished people in the business world

4004
02:10:43,358 --> 02:10:45,060
and in the medical field.

4005
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:45,893
I just, you know,

4006
02:10:45,893 --> 02:10:48,540
Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH,

4007
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:50,670
so I was actually, I was part of the interview team

4008
02:10:50,670 --> 02:10:52,423
for a lot of the HHS folks.

4009
02:10:52,423 --> 02:10:53,256
- Nice.

4010
02:10:53,256 --> 02:10:54,089
Jay's amazing.

4011
02:10:54,089 --> 02:10:55,680
Oh, I was so happy to see that.

4012
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:56,970
- So I literally got, this is a story.

4013
02:10:56,970 --> 02:10:58,667
I got to the transition office for one of the days

4014
02:10:58,667 --> 02:10:59,970
of the HHS interviews,

4015
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:01,320
and I was on one of the interview interviewing teams,

4016
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,986
and they gave us, I didn't know who the candidates were,

4017
02:11:02,986 --> 02:11:04,050
and they gave us the sheet in the beginning,

4018
02:11:04,050 --> 02:11:06,073
and I go down the sheet and I saw Jay's name, and I, like,

4019
02:11:06,073 --> 02:11:08,316
I almost physically fell outta my chair.

4020
02:11:08,316 --> 02:11:09,382
- Yeah.

4021
02:11:09,382 --> 02:11:10,887
- And I was just like...

4022
02:11:10,887 --> 02:11:13,338
(laughs) You know, and I happen to know Jay,

4023
02:11:13,338 --> 02:11:14,171
I happen to know Jay,

4024
02:11:14,171 --> 02:11:15,004
and I respect him enormously.

4025
02:11:15,004 --> 02:11:16,590
And then he proved himself under this,

4026
02:11:16,590 --> 02:11:18,030
like, talk about a guy who proved himself

4027
02:11:18,030 --> 02:11:19,290
under extraordinary pressure-

4028
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:20,910
- Yeah. - Over the last five years.

4029
02:11:20,910 --> 02:11:24,030
- And then go radical under the pressure.

4030
02:11:24,030 --> 02:11:27,180
He maintained balance and thoughtfulness and depth.

4031
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:28,050
I mean, incredibly-

4032
02:11:28,050 --> 02:11:31,143
- Very serious, very analytical, very applied.

4033
02:11:32,328 --> 02:11:33,240
And yes, 100%.

4034
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:34,890
Tested under pressure came out.

4035
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:37,680
Like the more people look back at what he said and did,

4036
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:39,840
and you know, he's not, you know, none of us are perfect,

4037
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:43,470
but like overwhelmingly insightful

4038
02:11:43,470 --> 02:11:44,340
throughout that whole period.

4039
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:46,680
And, you know, we would all be much better off today

4040
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:49,350
had he been in charge of the response.

4041
02:11:49,350 --> 02:11:51,150
And so just like an incredibly capable guy.

4042
02:11:51,150 --> 02:11:52,830
And look, and then he learned from all that, right?

4043
02:11:52,830 --> 02:11:54,900
He learned a lot in the last five years.

4044
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:57,360
And so the idea that somebody like that could be head of NIH

4045
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,560
as compared to the people

4046
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,270
we've had is just like breathtakingly.

4047
02:12:00,270 --> 02:12:02,430
It's just a gigantic upgrade.

4048
02:12:02,430 --> 02:12:04,680
You know, and then Marty Makary coming in to run FDA,

4049
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:06,308
exact same thing.

4050
02:12:06,308 --> 02:12:08,608
The guy coming to run a CDC, exact same thing.

4051
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:12,390
I mean, I've been spending time with Dr. Oz,

4052
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:14,460
so, you know, and I'm not, like, again,

4053
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:15,960
I'm not on these teams.

4054
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:16,793
I'm not in the room.

4055
02:12:16,793 --> 02:12:17,940
But like, I've been spending enough time trying

4056
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:20,070
to help that, like his level of insight

4057
02:12:20,070 --> 02:12:23,160
into the healthcare system, it's like astounding.

4058
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:25,080
And it comes from being a guy who's been like in the middle

4059
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:26,310
of the whole thing and been talking

4060
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:27,960
to people about this stuff and working on it

4061
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:29,160
and serving as a doctor himself

4062
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:31,260
and in medical systems for, you know, his entire life.

4063
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:32,880
And it's just like, you know,

4064
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:35,161
he's like a walking encyclopedia on these things.

4065
02:12:35,161 --> 02:12:36,510
And you know, very dynamic, you know,

4066
02:12:36,510 --> 02:12:39,453
very charismatic, very smart, organized, effective.

4067
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,990
So, you know, to have somebody like that in there.

4068
02:12:42,990 --> 02:12:44,750
And so anyway, they're just, I have like 30

4069
02:12:44,750 --> 02:12:48,333
of these stories now across all these different positions.

4070
02:12:49,657 --> 02:12:50,880
And then to be quite honest,

4071
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,917
you do the compare and contrast to the last four years.

4072
02:12:52,917 --> 02:12:55,770
And it, not even, these people are not in the same ballpark.

4073
02:12:55,770 --> 02:12:57,993
They're just like wildly better.

4074
02:12:59,190 --> 02:13:00,420
And so it, you know,

4075
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:02,310
the pound for pound is maybe be the best team

4076
02:13:02,310 --> 02:13:04,050
in the White House since, you know,

4077
02:13:04,050 --> 02:13:06,753
I don't even know, maybe the 90s,

4078
02:13:08,693 --> 02:13:11,400
maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s, you know,

4079
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:13,020
maybe Eisenhower had a team like this or something.

4080
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:16,380
But there's a lot of really good people in there now.

4081
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:17,520
- Yeah, the potential for change

4082
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:19,350
is certainly extremely high.

4083
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:20,750
Well, can you speak to DOGE?

4084
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:26,870
What's the most wildly successful next two years for DOGE,

4085
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:28,770
can you imagine?

4086
02:13:28,770 --> 02:13:31,530
Maybe also, can you think about the trajectory

4087
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:33,210
that's the most likely

4088
02:13:33,210 --> 02:13:36,030
and what kind of challenges would it be facing?

4089
02:13:36,030 --> 02:13:38,700
- Yeah, so start by saying, again, I'm not...

4090
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:40,010
Disclaimer, I have to disclaimer,

4091
02:13:40,010 --> 02:13:43,043
I'm not on DOGE, (laughs) I'm not a member of DOGE.

4092
02:13:43,043 --> 02:13:45,660
- We should say there's about 10 lawyers in the room,

4093
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:46,800
they're staring.

4094
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,570
No, I'm just kidding.

4095
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:50,190
- Both the angels and the devils on my shoulder

4096
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:51,023
are- - Okay. All right, cool.

4097
02:13:51,023 --> 02:13:53,220
- So yeah, so I'm not speaking for DOGE.

4098
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:55,290
I'm not in charge of DOGE. - Yeah.

4099
02:13:55,290 --> 02:13:56,640
- Those guys are doing it, I'm not doing it.

4100
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:58,740
But you know, again, I'm volunteering to help

4101
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:01,143
as much as I can and I'm 100% supportive.

4102
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,193
Yeah, so look, I think the way to think,

4103
02:14:04,193 --> 02:14:06,660
I mean, the basic outlines are in public, right?

4104
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:09,990
Which it's a time limited, you know, basically commission.

4105
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:11,790
It's not a formal government agency.

4106
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:13,840
It's a, you know, time limited, 18 month.

4107
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:16,530
In terms of implementation,

4108
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:18,480
it will advise the executive branch, right?

4109
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,970
And so the implementation will happen through

4110
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:22,620
the White House.

4111
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:23,940
And the president has total attitude

4112
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:25,833
on what he wants to implement.

4113
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:28,140
And then basically what I think about it

4114
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:31,260
is the three kind of streams, you know, kind of target sets,

4115
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:32,520
and they're related, but different.

4116
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:35,613
So money, people and regulations.

4117
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:38,610
And so, you know, the headline number, they, you know,

4118
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:39,870
put us the $2 trillion number

4119
02:14:39,870 --> 02:14:40,703
and there's already, you know,

4120
02:14:40,703 --> 02:14:41,937
disputes over that and whatever,

4121
02:14:41,937 --> 02:14:43,140
and there's whole question there.

4122
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:44,607
But then there's the people thing.

4123
02:14:44,607 --> 02:14:46,530
And the people thing is interesting 'cause you get

4124
02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:50,250
into these very kind of fascinating questions.

4125
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:52,230
And I've been doing this, I won't do this for you

4126
02:14:52,230 --> 02:14:54,080
as a pop quiz, but I do this for people in government

4127
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:57,030
as a pop quiz, and I can stump them every time, which is, A,

4128
02:14:57,030 --> 02:14:58,830
how many federal agencies are there?

4129
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:02,550
And the answer is somewhere between 450 and 520.

4130
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:04,260
And nobody's quite sure.

4131
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:05,093
And then the other is

4132
02:15:05,093 --> 02:15:07,590
how many people work for the federal government?

4133
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:09,480
And the answer is, you know, something on the order,

4134
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:11,400
I forget, but like 4 million full-time employees

4135
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:13,290
and maybe up to 20 million contractors,

4136
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:14,490
and nobody's quite sure.

4137
02:15:15,453 --> 02:15:18,510
And so there's a large people component to this.

4138
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:20,190
And then by the way, there's a related component to that,

4139
02:15:20,190 --> 02:15:22,860
which is how many of them are actually in the office?

4140
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:24,150
And the answer is not many,

4141
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:26,907
most of the federal buildings are still empty, right?

4142
02:15:26,907 --> 02:15:28,620
And then there's questions of like, are people,

4143
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:29,790
you know, working from home?

4144
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:31,320
Or are we actually working from home?

4145
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:32,520
So there's the people dimension,

4146
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:34,320
and of course, the money and the people are connected.

4147
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:35,153
And then there's the third,

4148
02:15:35,153 --> 02:15:36,837
which is the regulation thing, right?

4149
02:15:36,837 --> 02:15:39,390
And I described earlier how basically our system

4150
02:15:39,390 --> 02:15:41,340
of government is much more now based on regulations

4151
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:42,900
than legislation, right?

4152
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:45,030
Most of the rules that we all live under

4153
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:47,040
are not from a bill that went through Congress.

4154
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:49,860
They're from an agency that, that created a regulation.

4155
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,720
That turns out to be very, very important.

4156
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:53,310
So one is, Elon have already described,

4157
02:15:53,310 --> 02:15:54,510
we wanna do the DOGE

4158
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:56,130
wants to do broad-based regulatory relief,

4159
02:15:56,130 --> 02:15:57,297
and Trump has talked about this,

4160
02:15:57,297 --> 02:15:59,280
and basically get the government off people's backs

4161
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:00,750
and liberate the American people

4162
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:02,940
to be able to do things again.

4163
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:03,773
So that's part of it.

4164
02:16:03,773 --> 02:16:04,920
But there's also something else that's happened,

4165
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:05,760
which is very interesting,

4166
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:07,860
which was there were a set of Supreme Court decisions

4167
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:11,610
about two years ago that went directly after the idea

4168
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:15,120
that the executive branch can create regulatory agencies

4169
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:16,110
and issue regulations

4170
02:16:16,110 --> 02:16:17,400
and enforce those regulations

4171
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,863
without corresponding congressional legislation.

4172
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:24,120
And most of the federal government that exists today,

4173
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:27,480
including most of the departments and most of the rules,

4174
02:16:27,480 --> 02:16:29,070
and most of the money, and most of the people,

4175
02:16:29,070 --> 02:16:32,280
most of it is not enforcing laws that Congress passed.

4176
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:34,350
Most of it is regulation.

4177
02:16:34,350 --> 02:16:35,797
And the Supreme Court basically said,

4178
02:16:35,797 --> 02:16:38,309
"Large parts, you know,

4179
02:16:38,309 --> 02:16:40,410
large to maybe all of that regulation

4180
02:16:40,410 --> 02:16:42,959
that did not directly result from a bill

4181
02:16:42,959 --> 02:16:44,790
that went through Congress, the way that the cartoon said

4182
02:16:44,790 --> 02:16:48,870
that it should, that may not actually be legal.

4183
02:16:48,870 --> 02:16:51,660
Now, the previous White House, of course,

4184
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:53,129
was super in favor of big government.

4185
02:16:53,129 --> 02:16:55,080
They had no desire to, they did nothing based on this.

4186
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:56,969
They didn't, you know, pull anything back in.

4187
02:16:56,969 --> 02:17:00,600
But the new regime, if they choose to, could say, "Look,

4188
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:02,910
the thing that we're doing here is not,

4189
02:17:02,910 --> 02:17:04,410
you know, challenging the laws,

4190
02:17:04,410 --> 02:17:06,900
we're actually complying with the Supreme Court decision

4191
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:09,030
that basically says we have to unwind a lot of this,

4192
02:17:09,030 --> 02:17:11,459
and we have to unwind the regulations,

4193
02:17:11,459 --> 02:17:12,990
which are no longer legal, constitutional,

4194
02:17:12,990 --> 02:17:14,280
we have to unwind the spend

4195
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:15,980
and we have to unwind the people."

4196
02:17:16,889 --> 02:17:18,090
And that's how you get from,

4197
02:17:18,090 --> 02:17:19,860
basically you connect the thread from the regulation part

4198
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:22,469
back to the money part, back to the people part.

4199
02:17:22,469 --> 02:17:24,270
They have work going on all three of these threads.

4200
02:17:24,270 --> 02:17:26,670
They have, I would say, incredibly creative ideas

4201
02:17:26,670 --> 02:17:27,920
on how to deal with this.

4202
02:17:29,433 --> 02:17:30,750
I know lots of former government people

4203
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:32,910
who 100% of them are super cynical on this topic.

4204
02:17:32,910 --> 02:17:34,080
And they're like, "This is impossible.

4205
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:35,670
This could never possibly work."

4206
02:17:35,670 --> 02:17:37,379
And I'm like, "Well, I can't tell you

4207
02:17:37,379 --> 02:17:41,549
what the secret plans are, but like blow my mind."

4208
02:17:41,549 --> 02:17:43,290
And all three of those, like, they have ideas

4209
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:46,230
that are like really quite amazing as you'd expect from,

4210
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:47,610
you know, from the people involved.

4211
02:17:47,610 --> 02:17:50,010
And so over the course of the next few months, you know,

4212
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:51,870
that'll start to become visible.

4213
02:17:51,870 --> 02:17:53,723
And then the final thing I would say is,

4214
02:17:54,660 --> 02:17:56,730
this is going to be very different than attempts,

4215
02:17:56,730 --> 02:18:00,360
like there have been other programs like this in the past.

4216
02:18:00,360 --> 02:18:02,010
The Clinton-Gore administration had one,

4217
02:18:02,010 --> 02:18:05,400
and then there were others before that, Reagan had one.

4218
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:08,102
The difference is this time, their social media.

4219
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:11,942
And so there has never been like,

4220
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:15,150
it's interesting, one of the reasons people in Washington

4221
02:18:15,150 --> 02:18:17,910
are so cynical is because they know all the bullshit.

4222
02:18:17,910 --> 02:18:21,090
Like they know all the bad spending and all the bad rules

4223
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:23,340
and all the, like, you know, I mean, look,

4224
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:24,930
we're adding a trillion dollars to the national debt

4225
02:18:24,930 --> 02:18:26,343
every 100 days right now.

4226
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:29,400
And that's compounding, and it's now passing the size

4227
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:31,799
of the defense department budget, and it's compounding,

4228
02:18:31,799 --> 02:18:33,450
and it's pretty soon it's gonna be adding a trillion dollars

4229
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:34,282
every 90 days,

4230
02:18:34,282 --> 02:18:35,309
and then it's gonna be adding a trillion dollars

4231
02:18:35,309 --> 02:18:36,150
every 80 days,

4232
02:18:36,150 --> 02:18:38,430
and then it's gonna be a trillion dollars every 70 days.

4233
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:39,719
And then if this doesn't get fixed,

4234
02:18:39,719 --> 02:18:41,910
at some point we enter a hyper-inflationary spiral

4235
02:18:41,910 --> 02:18:46,139
and we become Argentina or Brazil and (indistinct), right?

4236
02:18:46,139 --> 02:18:48,690
And so, like everybody in DC knows that something

4237
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:51,270
has to be done, and then everybody in DC knows for a fact

4238
02:18:51,270 --> 02:18:54,090
that it's impossible to do anything, right?

4239
02:18:54,090 --> 02:18:54,930
They know all the problems

4240
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:56,969
and they also know the sheer impossibility of fixing it.

4241
02:18:56,969 --> 02:18:59,309
But I think what they're not taking into account,

4242
02:18:59,309 --> 02:19:00,143
that what the critics

4243
02:19:00,143 --> 02:19:03,360
are not taking into account is these guys can do this

4244
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:05,700
in the full light of day and they can do it on social media.

4245
02:19:05,700 --> 02:19:07,049
They can completely bypass the press,

4246
02:19:07,049 --> 02:19:09,240
they can completely bypass the cynicism,

4247
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:12,330
they can expose any element of, you know, unconstitutional

4248
02:19:12,330 --> 02:19:13,920
or, you know, silly government spending.

4249
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:15,959
They can run victory lapse every single day

4250
02:19:15,959 --> 02:19:16,793
on what they're doing.

4251
02:19:16,793 --> 02:19:18,959
They can bring the people into the process.

4252
02:19:18,959 --> 02:19:20,010
And again, if you think about it,

4253
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:22,740
this goes back to our Machiavellian structure,

4254
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:24,570
which is if you think about,

4255
02:19:24,570 --> 02:19:27,360
again, you've got democracy, oligarchy, monarchy,

4256
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:30,450
rule of the many, rule of the few, rule of the one.

4257
02:19:30,450 --> 02:19:31,830
You could think about what's happening here as a little bit

4258
02:19:31,830 --> 02:19:32,879
of a sandwich, right?

4259
02:19:32,879 --> 02:19:35,190
Which is, we don't have a monarch,

4260
02:19:35,190 --> 02:19:37,920
but we have a president, rule of the one with some power.

4261
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:40,170
And then we have the people who can't organize,

4262
02:19:40,170 --> 02:19:42,270
but they can be informed and they can be aware

4263
02:19:42,270 --> 02:19:43,889
and they can express themselves

4264
02:19:43,889 --> 02:19:45,870
through voting and polling, right?

4265
02:19:45,870 --> 02:19:47,673
And so there's a sandwich happening right now,

4266
02:19:47,673 --> 02:19:48,750
is a way to think about it,

4267
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:51,180
which is you've got basically (indistinct)

4268
02:19:51,180 --> 02:19:52,260
if you got rule of one combining

4269
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:53,880
with the rule of many, right?

4270
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:55,197
And rule of many is they do get to vote, right?

4271
02:19:55,197 --> 02:19:57,690
The people do get to vote basically.

4272
02:19:57,690 --> 02:20:00,090
And then essentially Congress as in this sort

4273
02:20:00,090 --> 02:20:01,830
of permanent bureaucratic class in Washington

4274
02:20:01,830 --> 02:20:03,750
as the oligarchy in the middle.

4275
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:06,930
And so the White House plus the people,

4276
02:20:06,930 --> 02:20:08,850
I think have the power to do all kinds of things here,

4277
02:20:08,850 --> 02:20:11,490
and I think that would be the way I would wash it.

4278
02:20:11,490 --> 02:20:13,320
- The transparency.

4279
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:18,320
I mean, Elon, just by who he is incentivized

4280
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:21,357
to be transparent and show the bullshit in the system

4281
02:20:21,357 --> 02:20:23,760
and to celebrate the victories.

4282
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:25,140
So it's gonna be so exciting.

4283
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:28,890
I mean, honestly, it just makes government more exciting,

4284
02:20:28,890 --> 02:20:31,230
which is a win for everybody.

4285
02:20:31,230 --> 02:20:33,300
- These people are spending our money.

4286
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:34,133
- [Lex] Yeah.

4287
02:20:34,133 --> 02:20:38,010
- These people have enormous contempt for the taxpayer.

4288
02:20:38,010 --> 02:20:39,300
Okay, here's the thing you hear in Washington,

4289
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:40,133
here's one of the things.

4290
02:20:40,133 --> 02:20:41,700
So the first thing you hear is, "This is impossible,

4291
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:42,540
they'll be able to do nothing."

4292
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:44,760
And then, yeah, I walk them through this and they're like,

4293
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:46,677
it starts to dawn on them that this is a new kind of thing.

4294
02:20:46,677 --> 02:20:48,270
And then they're like, "Well, it doesn't matter

4295
02:20:48,270 --> 02:20:50,460
because all the money is in entitlements and the debt

4296
02:20:50,460 --> 02:20:51,540
and the military."

4297
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:53,670
And so like, yeah, you've got like this silly,

4298
02:20:53,670 --> 02:20:57,270
fake whatever, you know, NPR funding or whatever,

4299
02:20:57,270 --> 02:20:59,070
and like, it's a rounding error and it doesn't matter.

4300
02:20:59,070 --> 02:21:00,270
And you look it up in the budget

4301
02:21:00,270 --> 02:21:03,460
and it's like, whatever, $500 million or $5 billion

4302
02:21:04,788 --> 02:21:07,140
or it's the charging stations that don't exist.

4303
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:08,760
It's the $40 billion of charging stations

4304
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,990
and they bill eight charging stations,

4305
02:21:09,990 --> 02:21:12,810
or it's the broadband internet plan

4306
02:21:12,810 --> 02:21:15,000
that delivered broadband to nobody, right?

4307
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,530
And costs you $30 billion.

4308
02:21:16,530 --> 02:21:17,910
Like, so these boondoggles

4309
02:21:17,910 --> 02:21:19,050
and what everybody in Washington says

4310
02:21:19,050 --> 02:21:20,700
is that $30 billion is a rounding error

4311
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:22,080
on the federal budget, it doesn't matter.

4312
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:23,850
Who cares if they make it go away?

4313
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:26,688
And of course, any taxpayer is like, "What the fuck?"

4314
02:21:26,688 --> 02:21:27,780
(Lex laughing)

4315
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:30,750
- What do you mean? - It's $30 billion.

4316
02:21:30,750 --> 02:21:31,860
- Yeah. - Right.

4317
02:21:31,860 --> 02:21:33,597
And then the experts are like,

4318
02:21:33,597 --> 02:21:34,800
and the press is in on this too.

4319
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,047
Then the experts are like, "Well, it doesn't matter

4320
02:21:36,047 --> 02:21:37,140
'cause it's surrounding error."

4321
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:38,790
No, it's $30 billion.

4322
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:41,280
And if you're this cavalier about $30 billion,

4323
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:43,230
imagine how cavalier you're about the 3 trillion.

4324
02:21:43,230 --> 02:21:44,790
- Yeah. - Okay.

4325
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:46,317
Then there's the, okay, $30 billion.

4326
02:21:46,317 --> 02:21:48,480
Is $30 billion a lot of the federal budget and percentage?

4327
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:49,313
No, it's not.

4328
02:21:49,313 --> 02:21:51,277
But $30 billion divided by 30, do the math,

4329
02:21:51,277 --> 02:21:52,380
$30 billion divided

4330
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:54,840
by let's say 300 million taxpayers, right?

4331
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:57,652
Like, what's that math expert?

4332
02:21:57,652 --> 02:21:58,485
- $100.

4333
02:21:58,485 --> 02:21:59,610
- $100 per taxpayer per year.

4334
02:21:59,610 --> 02:22:03,570
Okay, so $100 to an ordinary person

4335
02:22:03,570 --> 02:22:05,490
working hard every day to make money

4336
02:22:05,490 --> 02:22:06,323
and provide for their kids.

4337
02:22:06,323 --> 02:22:09,180
$100 is a meal out.

4338
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:10,920
It's a trip to the amusement park.

4339
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:12,420
It's the ability to, you know,

4340
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:14,460
buy additional educational materials.

4341
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:16,110
It's the ability to have a babysitter

4342
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:18,690
to be able to have a romantic relationship with your wife.

4343
02:22:18,690 --> 02:22:20,850
There's like 100 things that that person can do

4344
02:22:20,850 --> 02:22:22,830
with $100 that they're not doing

4345
02:22:22,830 --> 02:22:24,600
'cause it's going to some bullshit program

4346
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:27,450
that is being basically where the money's being looted

4347
02:22:27,450 --> 02:22:29,220
out in the form of just like ridiculous

4348
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:30,360
ridiculousness and graft.

4349
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:33,060
And so the idea that $30 billion program is not something

4350
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:35,070
that is like a very important thing to go after,

4351
02:22:35,070 --> 02:22:36,660
is just like the level of contempt

4352
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:37,980
for the taxpayer- - Yeah.

4353
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:40,170
- Is just off the charts.

4354
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:41,910
And then that's just one of those programs,

4355
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:44,700
there's like 100 of those programs

4356
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:45,720
and they're all just like that.

4357
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:47,430
Like, it's not like any of this stuff is running well,

4358
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:48,263
like the one thing we know

4359
02:22:48,263 --> 02:22:49,560
is that none of this stuff is running well.

4360
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:51,567
Like we know that for sure, right?

4361
02:22:51,567 --> 02:22:53,220
And we know these people aren't showing up to work

4362
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:54,380
and like we know that all this crazy stuff

4363
02:22:54,380 --> 02:22:55,260
is happening, right?

4364
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:56,790
And like, you know,

4365
02:22:59,975 --> 02:23:01,320
do you remember Elon's story of what got the Amish

4366
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:02,970
to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania?

4367
02:23:02,970 --> 02:23:04,350
Oh, okay.

4368
02:23:04,350 --> 02:23:05,790
Okay so Pennsylvania is like a wonderful state,

4369
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:06,623
great history.

4370
02:23:06,623 --> 02:23:07,920
It has these cities like Philadelphia

4371
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:09,600
that have descended like other cities

4372
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:10,890
into just like complete chaos,

4373
02:23:10,890 --> 02:23:12,360
violent madness, and death, right?

4374
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:14,320
And the federal government has just like, let it happen,

4375
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:16,470
these incredibly violent places.

4376
02:23:16,470 --> 02:23:18,420
And so the Biden administration decided

4377
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:19,563
that the big pressing law enforcement thing

4378
02:23:19,563 --> 02:23:21,720
that they needed to do in Pennsylvania was that they needed

4379
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:23,250
to start raiding Amish farms

4380
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:28,110
to prevent them from selling raw milk with armed raids.

4381
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:28,943
- [Lex] Right.

4382
02:23:28,943 --> 02:23:31,263
- And it turns out it really pissed off the Amish.

4383
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:33,960
It turns out they weren't willing to drive

4384
02:23:33,960 --> 02:23:36,030
to the polling places 'cause they don't have cars.

4385
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:37,680
But if you came and got them,

4386
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:38,513
they would go and they would vote.

4387
02:23:38,513 --> 02:23:39,990
And that's one of the reasons why Trump won.

4388
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:42,450
Anyway, so like the law enforcement agencies

4389
02:23:42,450 --> 02:23:44,100
are off working on like crazy things,

4390
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:46,200
like the system's not working.

4391
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:50,340
And so you add up, just pick $130 billion programs.

4392
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:51,450
All right, now you're okay.

4393
02:23:51,450 --> 02:23:53,263
Math major, 100 times 100.

4394
02:23:53,263 --> 02:23:54,096
- 10,000.

4395
02:23:54,096 --> 02:23:54,929
- $10,000. Okay.

4396
02:23:54,929 --> 02:23:57,570
$10,000 per taxpayer per year.

4397
02:23:57,570 --> 02:23:59,370
- But it's also not just about money.

4398
02:23:59,370 --> 02:24:01,980
That's really, obviously money is a hugely important thing,

4399
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:03,390
but it's the cavalier attitude-

4400
02:24:03,390 --> 02:24:04,223
- [Marc] Yes.

4401
02:24:04,223 --> 02:24:08,340
- That then in sort of, in the ripple effect of that,

4402
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:11,430
it makes it so nobody wants to work in government

4403
02:24:11,430 --> 02:24:12,750
and be productive.

4404
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:16,770
It makes it so that corruption can, it breeds corruption,

4405
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:19,860
it breeds laziness, it breeds secrecy

4406
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:21,300
'cause you don't wanna be transparent

4407
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:24,504
about having done nothing all year, all this kind of stuff.

4408
02:24:24,504 --> 02:24:26,245
And you now wanna reverse that,

4409
02:24:26,245 --> 02:24:28,050
so that it will be exciting for the future

4410
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:31,980
to work in government, because the amazing thing

4411
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:33,870
if you're to steel man government

4412
02:24:33,870 --> 02:24:36,450
is you can do shit at scale.

4413
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:39,750
You have money and you can directly impact people's lives

4414
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:43,410
in a positive sense at scale.

4415
02:24:43,410 --> 02:24:45,210
It's super exciting.

4416
02:24:45,210 --> 02:24:48,840
As long as there's no bureaucracy that slows you down

4417
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:51,390
or not huge amounts of bureaucracy

4418
02:24:51,390 --> 02:24:53,250
that slows you down significantly.

4419
02:24:53,250 --> 02:24:54,083
- Yeah.

4420
02:24:54,083 --> 02:24:55,800
So here's the trick, this blew my mind

4421
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:56,933
'cause I was, you know,

4422
02:24:58,500 --> 02:24:59,520
once you open the hellmouth

4423
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:00,840
of looking into the federal budget,

4424
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:02,340
you learn all kinds of things.

4425
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:06,960
So there is a term of art in government called impoundment.

4426
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:09,000
And so if you're like me,

4427
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:09,900
you've learned this the hard way

4428
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:11,700
when your car has been impounded.

4429
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:12,837
The government meaning of impoundment,

4430
02:25:12,837 --> 02:25:15,510
the federal budget meaning is a different meaning.

4431
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:17,160
Impoundment is as follows.

4432
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:20,190
The constitution requires Congress to authorize money

4433
02:25:20,190 --> 02:25:21,930
to be spent by the executive branch, right?

4434
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:23,977
So the executive branch goes to Congress says,

4435
02:25:23,977 --> 02:25:25,200
"We need money X."

4436
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:26,040
Congress does their thing.

4437
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:28,080
They come back and they say, "You can have money Y."

4438
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:29,430
The money's appropriated from Congress,

4439
02:25:29,430 --> 02:25:31,110
the executive branch spends it on the military

4440
02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:33,210
or whatever they spend it on, or on roads to nowhere

4441
02:25:33,210 --> 02:25:35,333
or charging stations to nowhere or whatever.

4442
02:25:37,316 --> 02:25:38,149
And what's in the constitution

4443
02:25:38,149 --> 02:25:40,263
is the Congress appropriates the money.

4444
02:25:41,580 --> 02:25:44,280
Over the last 60 years,

4445
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:46,020
there has been an additional interpretation

4446
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:48,180
of appropriations applied by the courts

4447
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:50,880
and by the system, which is the executive branch

4448
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:54,300
not only needs Congress to appropriate X amount of money,

4449
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:56,700
the executive branch is not allowed to underspend.

4450
02:25:56,700 --> 02:26:00,257
- Yeah, I'm aware of this. I'm aware of this.

4451
02:26:00,257 --> 02:26:02,160
- And so there's this thing that happens in Washington

4452
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,857
at the end of every fiscal year, which is September 30th,

4453
02:26:04,857 --> 02:26:06,840
and it's the great budget flush.

4454
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:08,670
And any remaining money that's in the system

4455
02:26:08,670 --> 02:26:10,020
that they don't know how to productively spend,

4456
02:26:10,020 --> 02:26:12,510
they deliberately spend it unproductively.

4457
02:26:12,510 --> 02:26:13,350
- Yep.

4458
02:26:13,350 --> 02:26:15,300
- To the tune of hundreds and hundreds

4459
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:16,680
of billions of dollars.

4460
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:17,513
A president

4461
02:26:17,513 --> 02:26:20,070
that doesn't wanna spend the money can't not spend it.

4462
02:26:20,070 --> 02:26:20,903
- Yeah.

4463
02:26:20,903 --> 02:26:24,090
- Like, okay, A, that's not what's in the constitution.

4464
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:25,830
And there's actually quite a good Wikipedia page

4465
02:26:25,830 --> 02:26:27,000
that goes through the great debate

4466
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:28,260
on this that's played out in the legal world

4467
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:29,310
over the last 60 years.

4468
02:26:29,310 --> 02:26:31,560
And like, basically, if you look at this

4469
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:33,277
with anything resembling, I think an open mind, you're like,

4470
02:26:33,277 --> 02:26:35,327
"All right, this is not what the founders meant."

4471
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:37,770
And then number two, again, we go back to this thing

4472
02:26:37,770 --> 02:26:42,690
of contempt, like, can you imagine showing up

4473
02:26:42,690 --> 02:26:44,010
and running the government like that

4474
02:26:44,010 --> 02:26:45,330
and thinking that you're doing the right thing

4475
02:26:45,330 --> 02:26:46,170
and not going home at night

4476
02:26:46,170 --> 02:26:48,000
and thinking that you've sold your soul, right?

4477
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,643
Like it's just like, I actually think you sort of had it

4478
02:26:50,643 --> 02:26:52,470
in a really good point, which is it's even unfair

4479
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:54,060
to the people who have to execute this.

4480
02:26:54,060 --> 02:26:55,037
- Yeah. - Right.

4481
02:26:55,037 --> 02:26:56,550
'Cause it makes them bad people.

4482
02:26:56,550 --> 02:26:59,463
And they didn't start out wanting to be bad people.

4483
02:26:59,463 --> 02:27:00,990
And so there is stuff like this like-

4484
02:27:00,990 --> 02:27:03,480
- Yeah, everywhere. - Everywhere.

4485
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:05,250
And so we'll see how far these guys get.

4486
02:27:05,250 --> 02:27:07,620
I am extremely encouraged what I've seen so far.

4487
02:27:07,620 --> 02:27:09,540
- It seems like a lot of people will try to slow 'em down,

4488
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:10,538
but yeah- - For sure.

4489
02:27:10,538 --> 02:27:11,580
- I hope they get far. - Yeah.

4490
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:13,290
- Another difficult topic, immigration.

4491
02:27:13,290 --> 02:27:14,123
- [Marc] Yeah.

4492
02:27:14,123 --> 02:27:15,780
- What's your take on the, let's say,

4493
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:19,110
heated H-1B visa debate that's going on online

4494
02:27:19,110 --> 02:27:22,170
and legal immigration in general?

4495
02:27:22,170 --> 02:27:23,340
- Yeah, I should so start by saying,

4496
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:25,290
I am not involved in any aspect

4497
02:27:25,290 --> 02:27:26,217
of government policy on this.

4498
02:27:26,217 --> 02:27:28,980
I'm not planning to be, this is not an issue

4499
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:31,530
that I'm working on or that I'm going to work on.

4500
02:27:31,530 --> 02:27:32,490
This is not part of the agenda

4501
02:27:32,490 --> 02:27:35,103
of what the firm is doing. So my firm is doing, so like,

4502
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,580
I'm not in this in the new administration or the government.

4503
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:42,300
I'm not planning to be, so purely just personal opinion.

4504
02:27:42,300 --> 02:27:45,510
So I would say I would describe as a complex

4505
02:27:45,510 --> 02:27:48,000
or nuanced, hopefully nuanced view on this issue

4506
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:48,930
that's maybe a little bit different

4507
02:27:48,930 --> 02:27:50,643
than what a lot of my peers have.

4508
02:27:53,231 --> 02:27:54,360
And I kind of thought about this, you know,

4509
02:27:54,360 --> 02:27:55,343
I didn't say anything about it all the way through

4510
02:27:55,343 --> 02:27:56,880
the big kind of debate over Christmas,

4511
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:59,550
but I thought about it a lot and read everything.

4512
02:27:59,550 --> 02:28:00,390
I think what I realized

4513
02:28:00,390 --> 02:28:02,280
is that I just have a very different perspective

4514
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:03,113
on some of these things,

4515
02:28:03,113 --> 02:28:05,190
and the reason is because of the combination

4516
02:28:05,190 --> 02:28:08,010
of where I came from and then where I ended up.

4517
02:28:08,010 --> 02:28:10,620
And so, oh, let's start with this,

4518
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:13,230
where I ended up, in Silicon Valley so

4519
02:28:13,230 --> 02:28:14,063
and I have made

4520
02:28:14,063 --> 02:28:17,100
the pro high-skilled immigration argument many, many times

4521
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:19,020
the H-1B argument many times.

4522
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:21,960
In past lives, I've been in DC many times arguing

4523
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:24,000
with prior administrations about this,

4524
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,040
always on the side of trying to get more H-1B's

4525
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:27,840
and trying to get more high-skilled immigration.

4526
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:30,660
And, you know, I think that argument is very strong

4527
02:28:30,660 --> 02:28:33,570
and very solid and very, you know,

4528
02:28:33,570 --> 02:28:35,907
has paid off for the US in many, many ways.

4529
02:28:35,907 --> 02:28:38,003
And we can go through it, but I think it's the argument

4530
02:28:38,003 --> 02:28:38,940
everybody already knows, right?

4531
02:28:38,940 --> 02:28:40,200
It's like the stock.

4532
02:28:40,200 --> 02:28:41,340
You take any Silicon Valley person,

4533
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:42,330
you press the button and they tell you

4534
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:43,620
why we need to brain drain the world

4535
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:44,750
to get more H-1B's, right?

4536
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:46,500
So everybody kind of gets that argument.

4537
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:48,510
- So it's basically, just to summarize,

4538
02:28:48,510 --> 02:28:51,210
it's a mechanism by which you can get super smart people

4539
02:28:51,210 --> 02:28:52,350
from the rest of the world,

4540
02:28:52,350 --> 02:28:55,200
import them in, keep them here

4541
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:58,350
to increase the productivity of the US companies.

4542
02:28:58,350 --> 02:28:59,490
- Yeah,

4543
02:28:59,490 --> 02:29:01,020
and then it's not just good for the them

4544
02:29:01,020 --> 02:29:03,180
and it's not just good for Silicon Valley

4545
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:04,650
or the tech industry, it's good for the country

4546
02:29:04,650 --> 02:29:06,360
because they then create new companies

4547
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:07,590
and create new technologies

4548
02:29:07,590 --> 02:29:10,260
and create new industries that then create many more jobs

4549
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:12,120
for Americans, native-born Americans

4550
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:13,260
than would've previously existed.

4551
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:14,760
And so you've got a, it's a positive,

4552
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:17,190
some flywheel thing where everybody wins.

4553
02:29:17,190 --> 02:29:19,320
Like everybody wins, there are no trade-offs.

4554
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:22,143
It's all absolutely glorious in all directions.

4555
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:26,040
There cannot possibly be a moral right argument

4556
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:27,330
against it under any circumstances.

4557
02:29:27,330 --> 02:29:29,160
Anybody who argues against it is obviously doing

4558
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:31,080
so from a position of racism,

4559
02:29:31,080 --> 02:29:33,720
is probably a fascist and a Nazi, right?

4560
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:34,860
Right, I mean that- - Right.

4561
02:29:34,860 --> 02:29:35,891
- That's the thing.

4562
02:29:35,891 --> 02:29:37,110
And like I said, I've made that argument many times.

4563
02:29:37,110 --> 02:29:38,190
I'm very comfortable with that argument.

4564
02:29:38,190 --> 02:29:39,960
And then I'd also say, look, I would say number one,

4565
02:29:39,960 --> 02:29:42,210
I believe a lot of it, I'll talk about the parts

4566
02:29:42,210 --> 02:29:43,920
I don't believe, but I believe a lot of it.

4567
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:47,166
And then the other part is, look, I benefit every day.

4568
02:29:47,166 --> 02:29:48,060
I always describe it as I work

4569
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:51,960
in the United Nations, like my own firm and our founders

4570
02:29:51,960 --> 02:29:54,120
and our companies and the industry

4571
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:58,380
and my friends, you know, are just this like amazing,

4572
02:29:58,380 --> 02:30:00,930
you know, panoply, cornucopia

4573
02:30:00,930 --> 02:30:03,300
of people from all over the world.

4574
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:05,580
And you know, I've worked, I dunno at this point

4575
02:30:05,580 --> 02:30:06,906
where people from, it's gotta be,

4576
02:30:06,906 --> 02:30:08,010
I don't know, 80 countries or something.

4577
02:30:08,010 --> 02:30:09,150
And hopefully, over time,

4578
02:30:09,150 --> 02:30:10,380
it'll be, you know, the rest as well.

4579
02:30:10,380 --> 02:30:12,270
And you know, it's been amazing

4580
02:30:12,270 --> 02:30:13,830
and they've done many of the most important things

4581
02:30:13,830 --> 02:30:16,180
in my industry and it's been really remarkable.

4582
02:30:17,220 --> 02:30:18,750
So that's all good.

4583
02:30:18,750 --> 02:30:20,220
And then, you know, there's just the practical version

4584
02:30:20,220 --> 02:30:22,290
of the argument, which is we are the main place

4585
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:24,300
these people get educated anyway, right?

4586
02:30:24,300 --> 02:30:25,133
The best and the brightest tend

4587
02:30:25,133 --> 02:30:26,160
to come here to get educated.

4588
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:26,993
And so, you know,

4589
02:30:26,993 --> 02:30:29,070
this is the old kind of Mitt Romney, staple a green card

4590
02:30:29,070 --> 02:30:30,930
to every, you know, at least, you know,

4591
02:30:30,930 --> 02:30:32,460
maybe not every university degree,

4592
02:30:32,460 --> 02:30:34,560
but every technical degree.

4593
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:36,570
Maybe the sociologist we could quibble about,

4594
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:39,300
but you know, the roboticist for sure, for sure.

4595
02:30:39,300 --> 02:30:40,682
For sure, we can all agree that-

4596
02:30:40,682 --> 02:30:42,390
- At least I won you over on something today.

4597
02:30:42,390 --> 02:30:44,490
- Well, no, I'm exaggerating for effect, so-

4598
02:30:44,490 --> 02:30:45,323
- Oh.

4599
02:30:45,323 --> 02:30:48,030
(Marc laughing) And I lost you, I had you for half a second.

4600
02:30:48,030 --> 02:30:49,763
- I haven't gotten to the other side of the argument yet.

4601
02:30:49,763 --> 02:30:51,610
- [Lex] Okay, thank you. - So surely, we can all agree

4602
02:30:52,530 --> 02:30:54,630
that we need to staple a green card.

4603
02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:55,920
- The rollercoaster is going up.

4604
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,960
- The rollercoaster is rationing slowly up.

4605
02:30:57,960 --> 02:31:00,000
So yeah, so surely we can all agree

4606
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:01,470
that the roboticists should all get green cards.

4607
02:31:01,470 --> 02:31:03,480
And again, like there's a lot of merit to that, obviously.

4608
02:31:03,480 --> 02:31:05,040
Like, look, we want the US to be the world leader

4609
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:06,180
in robotics.

4610
02:31:06,180 --> 02:31:07,620
What step one to being the world leader

4611
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:09,510
in robotics is have all the great robotics people, right?

4612
02:31:09,510 --> 02:31:12,103
Like, you know, very, unlike the underpants.

4613
02:31:12,103 --> 02:31:13,886
No, it's like a very straightforward formula, right?

4614
02:31:13,886 --> 02:31:14,719
- Yeah.

4615
02:31:14,719 --> 02:31:15,810
- All right, that's all well and good, all right,

4616
02:31:15,810 --> 02:31:17,880
but it gets a little bit more complicated

4617
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:20,310
because there is a kind of argument

4618
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:21,300
that's sort of right underneath

4619
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:23,157
that you also hear from, you know, these same people,

4620
02:31:23,157 --> 02:31:25,170
and I have made this argument myself many times,

4621
02:31:25,170 --> 02:31:26,580
which is, we need to do this

4622
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:28,200
because we don't have enough people in the US

4623
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:30,120
who can do it otherwise, right?

4624
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:32,332
We have all these unfilled jobs, we've got all these,

4625
02:31:32,332 --> 02:31:33,510
you know, all these companies that wouldn't exist.

4626
02:31:33,510 --> 02:31:34,590
We don't have enough good founders,

4627
02:31:34,590 --> 02:31:35,640
we don't have enough engineers,

4628
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:37,350
we don't have enough scientists.

4629
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:38,760
Or then the next version of the argument below

4630
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:41,400
that is our education system is not good enough

4631
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:42,663
to generate those people,

4632
02:31:44,190 --> 02:31:45,390
which is a weird argument by the way,

4633
02:31:45,390 --> 02:31:47,130
'cause like our education system is good enough

4634
02:31:47,130 --> 02:31:49,260
for foreigners to be able to come here preferentially

4635
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:51,450
in like a very large number of cases,

4636
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:52,920
but somehow not good enough to educate

4637
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:54,240
our own native-born people.

4638
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:56,970
So there's like a weird, there's little cracks in the matrix

4639
02:31:56,970 --> 02:31:58,320
that you can kind of stick your fingernail

4640
02:31:58,320 --> 02:31:59,637
into and kind of wonder about,

4641
02:31:59,637 --> 02:32:01,410
and we'll come back to that one.

4642
02:32:01,410 --> 02:32:03,840
But like, at least, yes, our education system has its flaws.

4643
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:06,420
And then underneath that is the argument that, you know,

4644
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:08,490
Vivek made, which is, you know,

4645
02:32:08,490 --> 02:32:10,323
we have cultural rot in the country

4646
02:32:10,323 --> 02:32:12,510
and, you know, native-born people in the country,

4647
02:32:12,510 --> 02:32:13,560
you know, don't work hard enough,

4648
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:15,387
and spend too much time watching TV and TikTok

4649
02:32:15,387 --> 02:32:17,460
and don't spend enough time studying differential,

4650
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:18,460
you know, equations.

4651
02:32:19,410 --> 02:32:20,650
And again, it's like, all right, like, you know,

4652
02:32:20,650 --> 02:32:22,080
yeah, there's a fair amount to that.

4653
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:25,200
Like there's a lot of American culture that is, you know,

4654
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:28,162
there's a lot of frivolity, there's a lot of, you know,

4655
02:32:28,162 --> 02:32:29,930
like, I mean, we have well-documented social issues

4656
02:32:29,930 --> 02:32:30,960
in many fronts,

4657
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:32,820
many things that cut against having a culture

4658
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:34,950
of just like straightforward high achievement

4659
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:36,213
and effort and striving.

4660
02:32:37,320 --> 02:32:39,450
Anyway, like, you know, those are the basic arguments.

4661
02:32:39,450 --> 02:32:41,640
But then I have this kind of other side of my, you know,

4662
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:43,890
kind of personality and thought process, which is, well,

4663
02:32:43,890 --> 02:32:45,420
I grew up in a small farming town

4664
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:46,920
of rural Wisconsin, the rural Midwest.

4665
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:49,380
And you know, it's interesting, there's not a lot of people

4666
02:32:49,380 --> 02:32:52,233
who make it from rural Wisconsin to, you know, high tech.

4667
02:32:54,090 --> 02:32:56,673
And so it's like, all right, why is that exactly, right?

4668
02:32:56,673 --> 02:32:57,840
And then I know this, I'm an aberration.

4669
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,850
Like I was the only one from anybody I ever knew

4670
02:32:59,850 --> 02:33:01,200
who ever did this, right?

4671
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:02,400
I know what an aberration I am,

4672
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:03,597
and I know exactly how that aberration happened,

4673
02:33:03,597 --> 02:33:05,997
and it's a very unusual, you know, set of steps,

4674
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:09,840
including, you know, many that were just luck.

4675
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:12,900
But like, there is in no sense a talent flow

4676
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:14,880
from rural Wisconsin into high tech,

4677
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:17,433
like, not at all.

4678
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:21,060
There is also like, in no sense a talent flow from the rest

4679
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:22,140
of the Midwest into high tech.

4680
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:24,450
There is no talent flow from the South into high tech.

4681
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:26,520
There is no flow from the Sunbelt into high tech.

4682
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:28,560
There's no flow from, you know,

4683
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:30,595
the Deep South into high tech.

4684
02:33:30,595 --> 02:33:32,490
Just like, literally it's like the blank.

4685
02:33:32,490 --> 02:33:35,040
There's this whole section of the country

4686
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:37,170
that just where the people just like for some reason

4687
02:33:37,170 --> 02:33:38,460
don't end up in tech.

4688
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:40,830
Now, that's a little bit strange,

4689
02:33:40,830 --> 02:33:43,740
'cause these are the people who put a man on the moon.

4690
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:46,770
These are the people who built the World War II War Machine.

4691
02:33:46,770 --> 02:33:47,820
These are the people,

4692
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:49,320
at least their ancestors are the people

4693
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:51,270
who built the Second Industrial Revolution,

4694
02:33:51,270 --> 02:33:52,260
and built the railroads

4695
02:33:52,260 --> 02:33:54,360
and built the telephone network,

4696
02:33:54,360 --> 02:33:56,280
and built, you know, logistics and transportation

4697
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:58,114
in the auto in, I mean, the auto industry was built

4698
02:33:58,114 --> 02:33:59,460
in Cleveland and Detroit.

4699
02:33:59,460 --> 02:34:02,160
And so at least these people's parents and grandparents

4700
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:04,260
and great grandparents somehow had the wherewithal

4701
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:06,090
to like build all of this like amazing things,

4702
02:34:06,090 --> 02:34:07,530
invent all these things.

4703
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:09,540
And then there's many, many, many, many stories

4704
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:10,950
in the history of American invention

4705
02:34:10,950 --> 02:34:13,365
and innovation and capitalism where you had people

4706
02:34:13,365 --> 02:34:15,600
who grew up in the middle of nowhere, Philo Farnsworth,

4707
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:17,370
who invented the television, and just like, you know,

4708
02:34:17,370 --> 02:34:20,250
tons and tons of others, endless stories like this.

4709
02:34:20,250 --> 02:34:22,110
Now you have a, like a puzzle, right?

4710
02:34:22,110 --> 02:34:23,340
And the conundrum, which is like, okay,

4711
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:26,400
like what is happening on the blank spot of the map?

4712
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:28,230
And then of course, you also can't help noticing

4713
02:34:28,230 --> 02:34:30,780
that the blank spot on the map, the Midwest, the South,

4714
02:34:30,780 --> 02:34:32,913
you've also just defined Trump country,

4715
02:34:34,530 --> 02:34:35,430
the Trump voter base, right?

4716
02:34:35,430 --> 02:34:36,840
And it's like, "Oh, well, that's interesting.

4717
02:34:36,840 --> 02:34:38,697
Like how did that happen?" Right?

4718
02:34:38,697 --> 02:34:40,710
And so either you really, really, really have

4719
02:34:40,710 --> 02:34:42,330
to believe the very, very strong version

4720
02:34:42,330 --> 02:34:43,440
of like the Vivek thesis

4721
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:44,970
or something where you have to believe that like,

4722
02:34:44,970 --> 02:34:48,450
that basically culture, the whole sort of civilization

4723
02:34:48,450 --> 02:34:49,457
in the middle of the country

4724
02:34:49,457 --> 02:34:51,960
and the south of the country is so like, deeply flawed,

4725
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:53,880
either inherently flawed or culturally flawed,

4726
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:55,500
such that for whatever reason,

4727
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:57,930
they are not able to do the things that their, you know,

4728
02:34:57,930 --> 02:34:59,007
parents and grandparents were able to do,

4729
02:34:59,007 --> 02:35:00,420
and that their peers are able to do.

4730
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:02,070
Or something else is happening.

4731
02:35:02,070 --> 02:35:03,840
Would you care to guess on what else is happening?

4732
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:05,460
- You mean what, affirmative action?

4733
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:06,510
- Affirmative action.

4734
02:35:08,850 --> 02:35:10,733
Okay. (laughs) This is very, think about this,

4735
02:35:10,733 --> 02:35:11,820
this is very entertaining, right?

4736
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:12,750
What are the three things that we know

4737
02:35:12,750 --> 02:35:14,430
about affirmative action?

4738
02:35:14,430 --> 02:35:16,383
It is absolutely 100% necessary.

4739
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:20,190
However, it cannot explain the success

4740
02:35:20,190 --> 02:35:21,290
of any one individual.

4741
02:35:22,590 --> 02:35:23,423
- Right.

4742
02:35:23,423 --> 02:35:25,366
- Nor does it have any victims at all.

4743
02:35:25,366 --> 02:35:27,630
- That could explain maybe disproportionate,

4744
02:35:27,630 --> 02:35:29,790
but like, surely it doesn't explain

4745
02:35:29,790 --> 02:35:32,360
why you're probably the only person

4746
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:34,740
in Silicon Valley from Wisconsin.

4747
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:36,540
- What educational institution in the last 60 years

4748
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:38,700
has wanted farm boys from Wisconsin?

4749
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:41,490
- But what institution rejected farm boys from Wisconsin?

4750
02:35:41,490 --> 02:35:43,177
- All of them. - All of them.

4751
02:35:43,177 --> 02:35:44,010
- Of course.

4752
02:35:44,010 --> 02:35:45,540
Okay, so we know this, we know this.

4753
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:46,887
The reason we know this is because of the Harvard

4754
02:35:46,887 --> 02:35:49,560
and UNC Supreme Court cases.

4755
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:51,450
So this was like three years ago,

4756
02:35:51,450 --> 02:35:52,544
these were big court cases.

4757
02:35:52,544 --> 02:35:54,060
And you know, 'cause the idea of affirmative action

4758
02:35:54,060 --> 02:35:55,920
has been litigated for many, many, many years

4759
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:57,030
and through many court cases.

4760
02:35:57,030 --> 02:35:59,130
And the Supreme Court repeatedly in the past had upheld

4761
02:35:59,130 --> 02:36:02,190
that it was a completely legitimate thing to do.

4762
02:36:02,190 --> 02:36:03,360
And there's basically two categories

4763
02:36:03,360 --> 02:36:05,970
of affirmative action that like really matter, right?

4764
02:36:05,970 --> 02:36:08,820
One is the admissions into educational institutions,

4765
02:36:08,820 --> 02:36:10,470
and then the other is jobs, right?

4766
02:36:10,470 --> 02:36:11,303
Getting hired.

4767
02:36:11,303 --> 02:36:12,810
Like, those are the two biggest areas.

4768
02:36:12,810 --> 02:36:14,610
The education one is like super potent,

4769
02:36:14,610 --> 02:36:15,990
has been a super potent political issue

4770
02:36:15,990 --> 02:36:16,980
for a very long time,

4771
02:36:16,980 --> 02:36:18,270
for all, you know, people have written

4772
02:36:18,270 --> 02:36:19,410
and talked about this for many decades.

4773
02:36:19,410 --> 02:36:20,310
I don't need to go through it.

4774
02:36:20,310 --> 02:36:22,080
There's many arguments for why it's important,

4775
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:24,330
there's many arguments as to how it could backfire.

4776
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:25,163
It's been this thing.

4777
02:36:25,163 --> 02:36:27,670
But the Supreme Court upheld it for a very long time.

4778
02:36:28,830 --> 02:36:29,940
The most recent ruling,

4779
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:31,500
I'm not a lawyer, I don't have the exact reference

4780
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:36,270
in my head, but there was a case in 2003 that said that

4781
02:36:36,270 --> 02:36:39,060
Sandra Day O'Connor famously wrote that, you know,

4782
02:36:39,060 --> 02:36:40,980
although it had been 30 years of affirmative action,

4783
02:36:40,980 --> 02:36:43,170
and although it was not working remotely

4784
02:36:43,170 --> 02:36:46,360
as it had been intended, she said that, you know,

4785
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:48,780
well, basically we need to try it for another 25 years.

4786
02:36:48,780 --> 02:36:50,280
But she said basically as a message

4787
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:51,660
to future Supreme Court justices,

4788
02:36:51,660 --> 02:36:54,360
if it hasn't resolved basically the issues it's intended

4789
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:55,860
to resolve within 25 years,

4790
02:36:55,860 --> 02:36:57,630
then we should probably call it off.

4791
02:36:57,630 --> 02:37:00,603
By the way, we're coming up on the 25 years, right?

4792
02:37:00,603 --> 02:37:02,340
It's a couple years away.

4793
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:04,863
The Supreme Court just had these cases is,

4794
02:37:04,863 --> 02:37:06,217
it's a Harvard case

4795
02:37:06,217 --> 02:37:07,800
and I think a University of North Carolina case.

4796
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:09,590
And what's interesting about those cases

4797
02:37:09,590 --> 02:37:11,970
is the lawyers in those cases put a tremendous amount

4798
02:37:11,970 --> 02:37:13,560
of evidence into the record

4799
02:37:13,560 --> 02:37:17,460
of how the admissions decisions actually happen at Harvard

4800
02:37:17,460 --> 02:37:18,690
and happen at UNC.

4801
02:37:18,690 --> 02:37:21,960
And it is like every bit as cartoonishly garish

4802
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:24,690
and racist as you could possibly imagine,

4803
02:37:24,690 --> 02:37:27,270
because it's a ring of power.

4804
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:29,580
And if you're an admissions officer at a private university

4805
02:37:29,580 --> 02:37:30,413
or an administrator,

4806
02:37:30,413 --> 02:37:32,670
you have unlimited power to do what you want,

4807
02:37:32,670 --> 02:37:35,460
and you can justify any of it under any of these rules

4808
02:37:35,460 --> 02:37:37,050
or systems.

4809
02:37:37,050 --> 02:37:39,600
And up until these cases, it had been a black box

4810
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:41,040
where you didn't have to explain yourself

4811
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:41,873
and show your work.

4812
02:37:41,873 --> 02:37:43,680
And what the Harvard and UNC cases did

4813
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:46,410
is they basically required showing the work.

4814
02:37:46,410 --> 02:37:48,990
And there was like all kinds of like phenomenal detail.

4815
02:37:48,990 --> 02:37:50,760
I mean, number one is there were text messages in there

4816
02:37:50,760 --> 02:37:52,560
that will just curl your hair of people,

4817
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:53,393
of students being spoken of

4818
02:37:53,393 --> 02:37:55,050
and just like crude racial stereotypes

4819
02:37:55,050 --> 02:37:57,150
that would just make you want to jump out the window.

4820
02:37:57,150 --> 02:37:57,990
It's horrible stuff.

4821
02:37:57,990 --> 02:38:01,080
But also, there was statistical information.

4822
02:38:01,080 --> 02:38:02,550
And of course, the big statistical kicker

4823
02:38:02,550 --> 02:38:04,650
to the whole thing is that at top institutions,

4824
02:38:04,650 --> 02:38:06,510
it's common for different ethnic groups

4825
02:38:06,510 --> 02:38:10,050
to have different cutoffs for SAT that are as wide

4826
02:38:10,050 --> 02:38:12,600
as 400 points, right?

4827
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:13,600
So different groups.

4828
02:38:15,201 --> 02:38:16,560
So a specifically Asians need

4829
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:20,520
to perform at 400 SAT points higher than other ethnicities

4830
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:22,072
in order to actually get admitted into these.

4831
02:38:22,072 --> 02:38:23,070
I mean, this is not even about, I mean,

4832
02:38:23,070 --> 02:38:24,000
white people are a part of this,

4833
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,590
but like Asians are like a very big part of this.

4834
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:27,600
And actually the Harvard case is actually brought

4835
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:28,770
by an activist on behalf

4836
02:38:28,770 --> 02:38:31,920
of actually the Asian students who were being turned away.

4837
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:33,930
And it's basically, I mean it's the cliche now

4838
02:38:33,930 --> 02:38:35,700
in the valley and in the medical community,

4839
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:37,080
which is like if you want a super genius,

4840
02:38:37,080 --> 02:38:38,910
you hire an Asian from Harvard

4841
02:38:38,910 --> 02:38:41,430
'cause they are guaranteed to be freaking Einstein.

4842
02:38:41,430 --> 02:38:42,263
'Cause if they weren't,

4843
02:38:42,263 --> 02:38:43,830
they were never getting admitted, right?

4844
02:38:43,830 --> 02:38:46,223
Almost all the qualified Asians get turned away.

4845
02:38:47,550 --> 02:38:50,370
So they've been running this, it's a very, very explicit,

4846
02:38:50,370 --> 02:38:52,260
very, very clear program.

4847
02:38:52,260 --> 02:38:53,970
This, of course, has been a third rail of things

4848
02:38:53,970 --> 02:38:55,500
that people are not supposed to discuss

4849
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:57,030
under any circumstances.

4850
02:38:57,030 --> 02:38:59,060
The thing that has really changed the tenor on this

4851
02:38:59,060 --> 02:39:00,240
is I think two things.

4852
02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:01,860
Number one, those Supreme Court cases,

4853
02:39:01,860 --> 02:39:05,370
the Supreme Court ruled that they can no longer do that.

4854
02:39:05,370 --> 02:39:06,203
I will tell you,

4855
02:39:06,203 --> 02:39:08,070
I don't believe there's a single education institution

4856
02:39:08,070 --> 02:39:11,520
in America that is conforming with the Supreme Court ruling.

4857
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:13,047
I think they're all flagrantly ignoring it.

4858
02:39:13,047 --> 02:39:14,598
And we could talk about that.

4859
02:39:14,598 --> 02:39:16,380
- Mostly 'cause of momentum probably, or what?

4860
02:39:16,380 --> 02:39:18,090
- They are trying to make the world a better place.

4861
02:39:18,090 --> 02:39:20,400
They're trying to solve all these social problems.

4862
02:39:20,400 --> 02:39:22,890
They are trying to have diverse student populations.

4863
02:39:22,890 --> 02:39:24,030
They are trying to live up

4864
02:39:24,030 --> 02:39:25,410
to the expectations of their donors.

4865
02:39:25,410 --> 02:39:27,360
They're trying to make their faculty happy.

4866
02:39:27,360 --> 02:39:29,820
They are trying to have their friends

4867
02:39:29,820 --> 02:39:31,620
and family think that they're good people.

4868
02:39:31,620 --> 02:39:32,880
- [Lex] Right.

4869
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:34,290
- They're trying to have the press write nice things

4870
02:39:34,290 --> 02:39:35,123
about them.

4871
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,559
Like it's nearly impossible for them.

4872
02:39:38,559 --> 02:39:40,620
And you know, to be clear, like nobody has been fired

4873
02:39:40,620 --> 02:39:43,680
from an admissions office for, you know, 25 years of prior,

4874
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:44,513
what we now,

4875
02:39:44,513 --> 02:39:46,710
the Supreme Court now is ruled to be illegality.

4876
02:39:46,710 --> 02:39:48,060
And so they're all the same people

4877
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:49,890
under the exact same pressures.

4878
02:39:49,890 --> 02:39:51,660
And so like I, you know,

4879
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:53,100
the numbers are moving a little bit,

4880
02:39:53,100 --> 02:39:54,481
but like,

4881
02:39:54,481 --> 02:39:55,530
I don't know anybody in the system

4882
02:39:55,530 --> 02:39:57,060
who thinks that they're compliant with the Supreme Court.

4883
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:58,590
Like who's in charge,

4884
02:39:58,590 --> 02:40:00,900
in the rank ordering of who rules who,

4885
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:02,850
the university's rule of the Supreme Court way more than

4886
02:40:02,850 --> 02:40:05,220
the Supreme Court rules the universities, right?

4887
02:40:05,220 --> 02:40:06,120
Well, another example of that is,

4888
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:07,710
I think that every sitting member

4889
02:40:07,710 --> 02:40:09,510
of the Supreme Court right now went to either Harvard

4890
02:40:09,510 --> 02:40:11,040
or Yale, right?

4891
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:13,650
Like the level of incestuousness here is...

4892
02:40:13,650 --> 02:40:15,590
Anyway, so there's that.

4893
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:17,490
And so this has been running for a very long time.

4894
02:40:17,490 --> 02:40:19,470
So one is the Harvard and USC cases kind of gave up

4895
02:40:19,470 --> 02:40:20,460
the game, number one,

4896
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:22,590
or at least showed what the mechanism was.

4897
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:24,510
And then number two, the other thing is obviously

4898
02:40:24,510 --> 02:40:26,580
the aftermath of October 7th, right?

4899
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:29,910
And what we discovered was happening with Jewish applicants

4900
02:40:29,910 --> 02:40:31,800
and what was happening at all the top institutions

4901
02:40:31,800 --> 02:40:33,960
for Jewish applicants was they were being managed down,

4902
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:36,640
either being actively managed down as a percentage

4903
02:40:37,850 --> 02:40:39,120
of the base.

4904
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:41,490
And let's say I've heard reports

4905
02:40:41,490 --> 02:40:44,650
of like extremely explicit, basically plans

4906
02:40:45,603 --> 02:40:46,980
to manage the Jewish admissions down

4907
02:40:46,980 --> 02:40:49,080
to their representative percentage of the US population,

4908
02:40:49,080 --> 02:40:50,300
which is 2%.

4909
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:52,133
And you know, there's a whole backstory here,

4910
02:40:52,133 --> 02:40:53,910
which is 100 years ago, Jews were not admitted

4911
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:55,170
into a lot of these institutions,

4912
02:40:55,170 --> 02:40:57,090
and then there was a big campaign to get them in.

4913
02:40:57,090 --> 02:40:57,930
Once they could get in,

4914
02:40:57,930 --> 02:41:00,210
they immediately became 30% of these institutions

4915
02:41:00,210 --> 02:41:02,460
'cause there's so many smart, talented Jews.

4916
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:04,710
So it went from 0% to 30%.

4917
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:05,970
And then the most recent generation

4918
02:41:05,970 --> 02:41:07,830
of leadership has been trying to get it done to 2%.

4919
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:09,639
And a lot of Jewish people,

4920
02:41:09,639 --> 02:41:12,000
at least a lot of Jewish people I know sort of,

4921
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,200
they kind of knew this was happening,

4922
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:15,150
but they discovered it the hard way

4923
02:41:15,150 --> 02:41:15,983
after October 7th, right?

4924
02:41:15,983 --> 02:41:18,690
And so all of a sudden, so basically,

4925
02:41:18,690 --> 02:41:20,190
the Supreme Court case meant

4926
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:23,100
that you could address this in terms of the Asian victims.

4927
02:41:23,100 --> 02:41:24,510
The October 7th meant

4928
02:41:24,510 --> 02:41:26,910
that you could address it in terms of the Jewish victims.

4929
02:41:26,910 --> 02:41:28,290
And for sure, both of those groups

4930
02:41:28,290 --> 02:41:30,060
are being systematically excluded, right?

4931
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:31,500
And then, of course,

4932
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:33,570
there's the thing that you basically can't talk about,

4933
02:41:33,570 --> 02:41:36,300
which is all the white people are being excluded.

4934
02:41:36,300 --> 02:41:39,927
And then it turns out it's also happening to Black people,

4935
02:41:39,927 --> 02:41:41,310
and this is the thing

4936
02:41:41,310 --> 02:41:44,010
that like blew my freaking mind when I found out about it.

4937
02:41:44,010 --> 02:41:47,250
So I just assumed that like, this was great news

4938
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:48,930
for like American Blacks,

4939
02:41:48,930 --> 02:41:51,990
because like, you know, obviously if you know Whites, Asians

4940
02:41:51,990 --> 02:41:54,060
and Jews are being excluded, then, you know, the whole point

4941
02:41:54,060 --> 02:41:56,400
of this in the beginning was to get the Black population up.

4942
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:58,590
And so this must be great for American Blacks.

4943
02:41:58,590 --> 02:42:02,190
So then I discovered this New York Times article from 2004

4944
02:42:02,190 --> 02:42:04,140
called Blacks are Being Admitted

4945
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:06,390
into Top Schools at Greater Numbers,

4946
02:42:06,390 --> 02:42:08,793
but which ones? (laughs)

4947
02:42:08,793 --> 02:42:09,626
- [Lex] Uh-oh.

4948
02:42:09,626 --> 02:42:11,460
- And again, and by the way, this is in The New York Times,

4949
02:42:11,460 --> 02:42:12,720
this is not in like, you know,

4950
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:16,557
whatever, National Review, this is New York Times, 2004.

4951
02:42:16,557 --> 02:42:18,660
And the two authorities that were quoted in the story

4952
02:42:18,660 --> 02:42:20,100
are Henry Louis Gates,

4953
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:22,320
who's the dean of the African-American Studies, you know,

4954
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:23,580
community in the United States,

4955
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:24,630
super brilliant guy.

4956
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:25,730
And then Lani Guinier,

4957
02:42:28,235 --> 02:42:30,570
she was a potential Supreme Court appointee under,

4958
02:42:30,570 --> 02:42:32,460
I think she was a close friend of Hillary Clinton.

4959
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:33,480
And there was, for a long time,

4960
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:34,920
she was on the shortlist for Supreme Court.

4961
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:37,290
So one of the top, you know, jurists,

4962
02:42:37,290 --> 02:42:38,160
lawyers in the country,

4963
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:42,330
but both Black was sort of legendarily successful

4964
02:42:42,330 --> 02:42:45,210
in the academic and legal worlds and Black.

4965
02:42:45,210 --> 02:42:47,490
And they are quoted as the authorities in this story

4966
02:42:47,490 --> 02:42:49,736
and the story that they tell,

4967
02:42:49,736 --> 02:42:52,500
(laughs) it's actually very, it's amazing.

4968
02:42:52,500 --> 02:42:54,150
And by the way, it's happening today

4969
02:42:54,150 --> 02:42:56,940
in education institutions and it's happening in companies,

4970
02:42:56,940 --> 02:42:57,773
and you can see it all over the place,

4971
02:42:57,773 --> 02:43:02,550
and the government, which is at least at that time,

4972
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:05,040
the number was half of the Black admits

4973
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:07,740
into a place like Harvard were not American-born Blacks.

4974
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:09,240
They were foreign-born Blacks,

4975
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:15,080
specifically, Northern African off generally Nigerian

4976
02:43:15,450 --> 02:43:18,477
or West Indian, right?

4977
02:43:18,477 --> 02:43:20,670
And by the way, many Nigerians

4978
02:43:20,670 --> 02:43:21,990
and Northern Africans have come to the US

4979
02:43:21,990 --> 02:43:23,610
and have been very successful Nigerian-Americans

4980
02:43:23,610 --> 02:43:25,170
as a group like way outperformed,

4981
02:43:25,170 --> 02:43:27,540
they're, you know, this a super smart cohort of people.

4982
02:43:27,540 --> 02:43:28,860
And then West Indian Blacks in the US

4983
02:43:28,860 --> 02:43:30,570
are incredibly successful.

4984
02:43:30,570 --> 02:43:32,940
Most recently, by the way, Kamala Harris,

4985
02:43:32,940 --> 02:43:34,020
as well as Colin Powell,

4986
02:43:34,020 --> 02:43:36,480
like just two sort of examples of that.

4987
02:43:36,480 --> 02:43:38,430
And so basically what Henry Louis Gates

4988
02:43:38,430 --> 02:43:40,470
and Lani Guinier said in the story is Harvard

4989
02:43:40,470 --> 02:43:43,530
is basically struggling to either, whatever it was,

4990
02:43:43,530 --> 02:43:45,570
identify or recruit, make successful,

4991
02:43:45,570 --> 02:43:48,360
whatever it was, American-born native Blacks,

4992
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:51,270
and so therefore they were using high-skill immigration,

4993
02:43:51,270 --> 02:43:54,120
as an escape hatch to go get Blacks from other countries.

4994
02:43:55,628 --> 02:43:56,940
And then this was 2004

4995
02:43:56,940 --> 02:43:59,070
when you could discuss such things.

4996
02:43:59,070 --> 02:44:00,330
Obviously that is a topic

4997
02:44:00,330 --> 02:44:01,950
that nobody has discussed since,

4998
02:44:01,950 --> 02:44:03,750
it has sailed on.

4999
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:04,940
All of the DEI programs

5000
02:44:04,940 --> 02:44:08,400
in the last 20 years have had this exact characteristic.

5001
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:10,200
There's large numbers of Black people in America

5002
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:11,587
who are fully aware of this and are like,

5003
02:44:11,587 --> 02:44:14,283
"It's obviously not us that are getting these slots,

5004
02:44:15,156 --> 02:44:15,989
we're literally competing with people

5005
02:44:15,989 --> 02:44:17,520
who are being imported."

5006
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:19,140
And you know, if you believe in the basis

5007
02:44:19,140 --> 02:44:20,700
of affirmative action, you are trying to make up

5008
02:44:20,700 --> 02:44:23,220
for historical injustice of American Black slavery.

5009
02:44:23,220 --> 02:44:25,800
So the idea that you're import somebody from, you know,

5010
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:29,010
Nigeria that never experienced that, you know,

5011
02:44:29,010 --> 02:44:32,550
is like tremendously insulting to Black Americans.

5012
02:44:32,550 --> 02:44:34,140
Anyway, so you can see where I'm heading with this.

5013
02:44:34,140 --> 02:44:37,680
We have been in a 60-year social engineering experiment

5014
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:39,360
to exclude native-born people

5015
02:44:39,360 --> 02:44:41,790
from the educational slots and jobs

5016
02:44:41,790 --> 02:44:42,735
that high-skill immigration

5017
02:44:42,735 --> 02:44:45,450
has been funneling foreigners into, right?

5018
02:44:45,450 --> 02:44:47,899
And so it turns out it's not a victim-free thing,

5019
02:44:47,899 --> 02:44:49,080
there's like 100%, there's victims.

5020
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:49,950
'Cause why?

5021
02:44:49,950 --> 02:44:51,090
There's only so many, for sure.

5022
02:44:51,090 --> 02:44:52,380
There's only so many education slots.

5023
02:44:52,380 --> 02:44:53,700
And then for sure, there's only so many

5024
02:44:53,700 --> 02:44:55,380
of these jobs, right?

5025
02:44:55,380 --> 02:44:57,030
You know, Google only hires so many, you know,

5026
02:44:57,030 --> 02:44:59,337
whatever level seven engineers, right?

5027
02:44:59,337 --> 02:45:01,677
And so that's the other side of it, right?

5028
02:45:01,677 --> 02:45:05,520
And so you're a farm boy in Wisconsin, right?

5029
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:08,100
You know, Black American whose ancestors arrived here,

5030
02:45:08,100 --> 02:45:11,280
you know, on a slave ship, 300 years ago, in Louisiana

5031
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:14,740
or a, you know, Cambodian immigrant in, you know, the Bronx

5032
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:18,620
and you are a kid or a Jewish immigrant or a, you know,

5033
02:45:18,620 --> 02:45:21,090
or from a very successful Jewish family

5034
02:45:21,090 --> 02:45:23,790
and you know, your entire, you know, for three generations,

5035
02:45:23,790 --> 02:45:25,800
you and your parents and grandparents went to Harvard.

5036
02:45:25,800 --> 02:45:28,200
And what all of those groups know is the system

5037
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:31,710
that has been created is not for them, right?

5038
02:45:31,710 --> 02:45:34,050
It's designed specifically to exclude them.

5039
02:45:34,050 --> 02:45:35,280
And then what happens is

5040
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:36,750
all of these tech people show up in public

5041
02:45:36,750 --> 02:45:39,627
and say, "Yeah, let's bring in more foreigners," right?

5042
02:45:39,627 --> 02:45:42,210
And so anyway, so the short version of it is,

5043
02:45:42,210 --> 02:45:43,920
you can't anymore, I don't think,

5044
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:47,670
just have the, quote, "high-skill immigration,"

5045
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:49,320
conversation for either education

5046
02:45:51,403 --> 02:45:54,700
or for employment without also having the DEI conversation.

5047
02:45:55,954 --> 02:45:57,080
And then DEI is just another word for affirmative action,

5048
02:45:57,080 --> 02:45:59,100
so it's the affirmative action conversation.

5049
02:45:59,100 --> 02:46:01,500
And you need to actually deal with this at substance

5050
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:02,730
and to see what's actually happening to people.

5051
02:46:02,730 --> 02:46:04,330
you needed to join these topics.

5052
02:46:05,347 --> 02:46:06,390
And I think it is much harder

5053
02:46:06,390 --> 02:46:09,340
to make the moral claim for high-skilled immigration given

5054
02:46:10,380 --> 02:46:13,980
the extent to which DEI took over both the education process

5055
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:16,103
and the hiring process. - Okay, so first of all,

5056
02:46:16,103 --> 02:46:19,770
that was brilliantly laid out, the nuance of it.

5057
02:46:19,770 --> 02:46:22,440
So just to understand, it's not so much a criticism

5058
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:25,230
of H-1B, high-skilled immigration,

5059
02:46:25,230 --> 02:46:28,470
it's that there needs to be more people saying,

5060
02:46:28,470 --> 02:46:31,710
yay, we need more American-born hires.

5061
02:46:31,710 --> 02:46:33,300
- So I spent the entire Christmas holiday

5062
02:46:33,300 --> 02:46:35,370
reading every message on this and not saying anything,

5063
02:46:35,370 --> 02:46:36,394
and what I was...

5064
02:46:36,394 --> 02:46:37,230
(Lex laughing)

5065
02:46:37,230 --> 02:46:38,850
Which you know me well enough to know

5066
02:46:38,850 --> 02:46:40,488
that's a serious level of-

5067
02:46:40,488 --> 02:46:41,670
- Yeah, that was very Zen.

5068
02:46:41,670 --> 02:46:42,870
- Yes, thank you, thank you.

5069
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:44,910
No, it wasn't, there was tremendous rage

5070
02:46:44,910 --> 02:46:47,160
on the other side of it, but I suppressed it.

5071
02:46:48,210 --> 02:46:52,437
So I was waiting for the dog that didn't bark, right?

5072
02:46:52,437 --> 02:46:54,750
And the dog that didn't bark was, I did not,

5073
02:46:54,750 --> 02:46:55,740
and you tell me if you saw one,

5074
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:57,090
I did not see a single example

5075
02:46:57,090 --> 02:46:58,020
of somebody pounding the table

5076
02:46:58,020 --> 02:46:59,370
for more high-skilled immigration,

5077
02:46:59,370 --> 02:47:00,510
who was also pounding the table

5078
02:47:00,510 --> 02:47:03,000
to go get more smart kids who are already here

5079
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,790
into these educational institutions and into these jobs.

5080
02:47:05,790 --> 02:47:07,590
I didn't see a single one.

5081
02:47:07,590 --> 02:47:08,423
- That's true.

5082
02:47:08,423 --> 02:47:10,290
I think I agree with that.

5083
02:47:10,290 --> 02:47:12,983
There really was a divide. - But it was like literally,

5084
02:47:12,983 --> 02:47:14,880
it was like the proponents of high-skilled immigrant.

5085
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:17,006
And again, this was me for a very long time.

5086
02:47:17,006 --> 02:47:18,300
I mean, I kind of took myself by surprise on this

5087
02:47:18,300 --> 02:47:21,240
because I was on, you know, I had the much, say,

5088
02:47:21,240 --> 02:47:22,740
simpler version of this story for a very...

5089
02:47:22,740 --> 02:47:25,350
And like I said, I've been in Washington many times

5090
02:47:25,350 --> 02:47:26,700
under past presidents, lobbying for this.

5091
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:27,990
By the way, never made any progress,

5092
02:47:27,990 --> 02:47:28,823
which we could talk about.

5093
02:47:28,823 --> 02:47:30,273
Like it never actually worked.

5094
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:33,150
But you know, I've been on the other side of this one,

5095
02:47:33,150 --> 02:47:34,980
but I was literally sitting there being like, all right,

5096
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:37,950
which of these like super geniuses who, you know,

5097
02:47:37,950 --> 02:47:39,300
many of whom by the way are very, you know,

5098
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:40,380
successful high-skilled immigrants

5099
02:47:40,380 --> 02:47:42,810
or children of high-skilled immigrants, you know,

5100
02:47:42,810 --> 02:47:44,760
which of these super geniuses are gonna like,

5101
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:47,460
say actually we have this like incredible talent source here

5102
02:47:47,460 --> 02:47:48,293
in the country?

5103
02:47:48,293 --> 02:47:49,126
Which again, to be clear,

5104
02:47:49,126 --> 02:47:49,959
I'm not talking about white people.

5105
02:47:49,959 --> 02:47:51,780
I'm talking about native-born Americans, whites, Asians,

5106
02:47:51,780 --> 02:47:53,730
Jews, Blacks, for sure.

5107
02:47:53,730 --> 02:47:54,690
For sure, for sure.

5108
02:47:54,690 --> 02:47:55,620
Those four groups.

5109
02:47:55,620 --> 02:47:56,850
- But also- - Yes.

5110
02:47:56,850 --> 02:47:57,683
- White people.

5111
02:47:57,683 --> 02:47:59,220
- Yeah, and also white people.

5112
02:47:59,220 --> 02:48:03,070
- People that are making the case for American-born hires

5113
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:07,710
are usually not also supporting H-1B.

5114
02:48:07,710 --> 02:48:09,360
It's an extreme divide,

5115
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:11,610
and those people, they're making that case are often

5116
02:48:11,610 --> 02:48:15,333
not making it in a way that's like,

5117
02:48:16,920 --> 02:48:19,180
making it in quite a radical way.

5118
02:48:19,180 --> 02:48:20,013
- Yeah. - Let's put it this way.

5119
02:48:20,013 --> 02:48:21,120
- Yeah, but you have this interesting thing,

5120
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:22,800
you have a split between the sides that I've noticed,

5121
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:24,990
which is one side has all of the experts.

5122
02:48:24,990 --> 02:48:25,823
- Right.

5123
02:48:25,823 --> 02:48:28,440
- Right, and I'm using air quote for people listening

5124
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:30,270
to audio. I'm making quotes in the air with my fingers

5125
02:48:30,270 --> 02:48:31,680
as vigorously as I can. - Yep.

5126
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:33,990
- One side has all the certified experts.

5127
02:48:33,990 --> 02:48:35,880
The other side just has a bunch of people who are like,

5128
02:48:35,880 --> 02:48:36,900
they know that something is wrong

5129
02:48:36,900 --> 02:48:39,306
and they don't quite know how to explain it.

5130
02:48:39,306 --> 02:48:41,370
And what was so unusual about the Harvard UNC cases,

5131
02:48:41,370 --> 02:48:42,420
by the way, in front of Supreme Court,

5132
02:48:42,420 --> 02:48:44,280
is they actually had sophisticated lawyers

5133
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:45,360
for the first time in a long time,

5134
02:48:45,360 --> 02:48:46,590
actually put all this evidence together

5135
02:48:46,590 --> 02:48:48,750
and actually put it in the public record,

5136
02:48:48,750 --> 02:48:50,959
they actually had experts,

5137
02:48:50,959 --> 02:48:51,792
which is just really rare.

5138
02:48:51,792 --> 02:48:53,190
Generally what you get is you get,

5139
02:48:53,190 --> 02:48:54,510
'cause if you don't have experts, what do you have?

5140
02:48:54,510 --> 02:48:56,188
You know, something is wrong,

5141
02:48:56,188 --> 02:48:58,020
but you have primarily an emotional response.

5142
02:48:58,020 --> 02:49:00,780
You feel it, but can you put it, you know,

5143
02:49:00,780 --> 02:49:03,390
can you put it in the words and tables

5144
02:49:03,390 --> 02:49:05,667
and charts, you know, that a certified expert can?

5145
02:49:05,667 --> 02:49:08,310
And no, you can't, like, you know, that's not who you are.

5146
02:49:08,310 --> 02:49:09,360
That doesn't mean that you're wrong,

5147
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:10,193
and it also doesn't mean

5148
02:49:10,193 --> 02:49:12,720
that you have less of a moral stance.

5149
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:14,430
Yeah, and so it's just like, all right, now,

5150
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:15,750
by the way, look,

5151
02:49:15,750 --> 02:49:17,160
I think there are ways to square the circle,

5152
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:19,170
I think there's a way to have our cake and eat it too,

5153
02:49:19,170 --> 02:49:21,540
like I think there'd be many ways to resolve this.

5154
02:49:21,540 --> 02:49:23,280
I think, again, I think the way to do it

5155
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:25,620
is to look at these issues combined,

5156
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:28,520
look at DEI combined with high-skilled immigration.

5157
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:32,670
It so happens that DEI is under much more scrutiny today

5158
02:49:32,670 --> 02:49:34,950
than it has been for probably 20 years,

5159
02:49:34,950 --> 02:49:36,480
affirmative action is.

5160
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:38,490
The Supreme Court did just rule

5161
02:49:38,490 --> 02:49:41,730
that it is not legal for universities to do that,

5162
02:49:41,730 --> 02:49:44,613
they are still doing it, but they should stop.

5163
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:48,090
And then, there are more and more,

5164
02:49:48,090 --> 02:49:49,350
you've seen more companies

5165
02:49:49,350 --> 02:49:51,663
now also ditching their DEI programs,

5166
02:49:52,770 --> 02:49:54,600
in part, that's happening for a bunch of reasons,

5167
02:49:54,600 --> 02:49:55,433
but it's happening in part

5168
02:49:55,433 --> 02:49:57,900
because a lot of corporate lawyers will tell you

5169
02:49:57,900 --> 02:50:00,300
that the Supreme Court rulings in education

5170
02:50:00,300 --> 02:50:02,550
either already apply to businesses,

5171
02:50:02,550 --> 02:50:04,800
or it just as a clear foreshadowing

5172
02:50:04,800 --> 02:50:06,240
the Supreme Court will rule on new cases

5173
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:07,800
that will ban in businesses.

5174
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:10,980
And so there is a moment here to be able

5175
02:50:10,980 --> 02:50:13,473
to look at this on both sides.

5176
02:50:14,400 --> 02:50:15,513
Let add one more nuance to it

5177
02:50:15,513 --> 02:50:17,474
that makes it even more complicated.

5178
02:50:17,474 --> 02:50:18,307
- Yeah.

5179
02:50:18,307 --> 02:50:20,130
- So the cliche is we're gonna brain drain the world, right?

5180
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:20,963
You've heard that?

5181
02:50:20,963 --> 02:50:22,440
We're gonna take all the smart people

5182
02:50:22,440 --> 02:50:23,910
from all over the world, we're gonna bring them here,

5183
02:50:23,910 --> 02:50:24,780
we're gonna educate them, and then we're gonna keep them,

5184
02:50:24,780 --> 02:50:26,520
and then they're gonna raise their families here,

5185
02:50:26,520 --> 02:50:28,410
create businesses here, create jobs here, right?

5186
02:50:28,410 --> 02:50:30,720
- In the cliche, that's a super positive thing.

5187
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:31,553
- Yeah.

5188
02:50:31,553 --> 02:50:34,143
Okay, so what happens to the rest of the world?

5189
02:50:35,070 --> 02:50:36,090
- They lose?

5190
02:50:36,090 --> 02:50:39,213
- Well, how fungible are people?

5191
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:45,090
How many highly ambitious, highly conscientious,

5192
02:50:45,090 --> 02:50:48,030
highly energetic, high-achieving, high-IQ,

5193
02:50:48,030 --> 02:50:50,550
super geniuses are there in the world?

5194
02:50:50,550 --> 02:50:53,130
And if there's a lot, that's great,

5195
02:50:53,130 --> 02:50:56,640
but if there just aren't that many and they all come here

5196
02:50:56,640 --> 02:50:59,370
and they all aren't where they would be otherwise,

5197
02:50:59,370 --> 02:51:01,283
what happens to all those other places?

5198
02:51:02,370 --> 02:51:04,500
So it's almost impossible for us here to have

5199
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:05,333
that conversation,

5200
02:51:05,333 --> 02:51:07,470
in part because we become incredibly uncomfortable

5201
02:51:07,470 --> 02:51:08,970
as a society talking about the fact

5202
02:51:08,970 --> 02:51:11,520
that people aren't just simply all the same,

5203
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:13,110
which is a whole thing we could talk about.

5204
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:16,200
But it also, we are purely the beneficiary

5205
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:17,280
of this effect, right?

5206
02:51:17,280 --> 02:51:20,010
We are brain draining the world, not the other way around.

5207
02:51:20,010 --> 02:51:21,210
There's only four.

5208
02:51:21,210 --> 02:51:22,920
So if you look at the flow of high-skilled immigration

5209
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:25,470
over time, there's only four permanent sinks

5210
02:51:25,470 --> 02:51:28,080
of high-skilled immigration places people go.

5211
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:30,180
It's the US, Canada, the UK and Australia.

5212
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:32,280
- Oh, Australia.

5213
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:33,780
- It's four of the five, five eyes.

5214
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:35,160
It's the major Anglosphere countries.

5215
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:37,410
And so for those countries,

5216
02:51:37,410 --> 02:51:38,940
this seems like a no-lose proposition,

5217
02:51:38,940 --> 02:51:41,040
it's all the other countries that,

5218
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:43,230
basically, what we four countries have been doing

5219
02:51:43,230 --> 02:51:44,790
is draining all the smart people out.

5220
02:51:44,790 --> 02:51:45,750
It's actually much easier

5221
02:51:45,750 --> 02:51:47,970
for people in Europe to talk about this I've discovered

5222
02:51:47,970 --> 02:51:49,680
because the Eurozone is, whatever, you know,

5223
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:51,720
28 countries, and within the Eurozone,

5224
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:53,700
the high-skilled people over time have been migrating

5225
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:55,860
to originally the UK,

5226
02:51:55,860 --> 02:51:58,410
but also specifically I think it's the Netherlands,

5227
02:51:58,410 --> 02:51:59,610
Germany, and France.

5228
02:51:59,610 --> 02:52:01,380
But specifically, they've been migrating out

5229
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:03,330
of the peripheral Eurozone countries.

5230
02:52:03,330 --> 02:52:05,460
And the one where this really hit the fan was

5231
02:52:05,460 --> 02:52:06,810
in Greece, right?

5232
02:52:06,810 --> 02:52:09,090
So, you know, Greece falls into chaos, disaster,

5233
02:52:09,090 --> 02:52:10,680
and then, you know, you're running the government in Greece

5234
02:52:10,680 --> 02:52:11,513
and you're trying to figure out

5235
02:52:11,513 --> 02:52:13,733
how to put an economic development plan together.

5236
02:52:14,610 --> 02:52:16,800
All of your smart young kids have left.

5237
02:52:16,800 --> 02:52:19,530
Like, what are you gonna do, right?

5238
02:52:19,530 --> 02:52:21,810
By the way, this is a potential...

5239
02:52:21,810 --> 02:52:23,670
I know you care a lot about Ukraine,

5240
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:25,230
this is a potential crisis for Ukraine.

5241
02:52:25,230 --> 02:52:26,777
Not because, in part, because of this,

5242
02:52:26,777 --> 02:52:29,640
'cause we enthusiastically recruit Ukrainians, of course,

5243
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:32,520
and so we've been brain draining Ukraine for a long time.

5244
02:52:32,520 --> 02:52:34,080
But also, of course, you know, war does tend

5245
02:52:34,080 --> 02:52:35,610
to cause people to migrate out.

5246
02:52:35,610 --> 02:52:38,250
And so, you know, when it comes time for Ukraine to rebuild

5247
02:52:38,250 --> 02:52:41,700
as a peaceful country, is it gonna have the talent base

5248
02:52:41,700 --> 02:52:43,020
even that it had five years ago

5249
02:52:43,020 --> 02:52:45,000
is like a very big and important question.

5250
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,190
By the way, Russia, like we have brain drained a lot

5251
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:48,390
of really smart people outta Russia,

5252
02:52:48,390 --> 02:52:49,920
a lot of them are here, right?

5253
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:52,140
Over the last, you know, 30 years.

5254
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:54,360
And so there's this thing,

5255
02:52:54,360 --> 02:52:55,540
it's actually really funny if you think about it.

5256
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:58,020
Like, the one thing that we know to be the height

5257
02:52:58,020 --> 02:53:01,830
of absolute evil that the West ever did was colonization

5258
02:53:01,830 --> 02:53:03,150
and resource extraction, right?

5259
02:53:03,150 --> 02:53:05,130
So we know the height of absolute evil

5260
02:53:05,130 --> 02:53:06,990
was when the Portuguese and the English and you know,

5261
02:53:06,990 --> 02:53:09,240
everybody else went and had these colonies and then went in

5262
02:53:09,240 --> 02:53:10,440
and we, you know, took all the oil

5263
02:53:10,440 --> 02:53:12,360
and we took all the diamonds, or we took all the whatever,

5264
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:14,760
lithium or whatever it is, right?

5265
02:53:14,760 --> 02:53:17,010
Well, for some reason we realized that's a deeply evil thing

5266
02:53:17,010 --> 02:53:18,510
to do when it's a physical resource,

5267
02:53:18,510 --> 02:53:21,300
when it's a non-conscious physical matter.

5268
02:53:21,300 --> 02:53:23,730
For some reason, we think it's completely morally acceptable

5269
02:53:23,730 --> 02:53:25,890
to do it with human capital.

5270
02:53:25,890 --> 02:53:28,650
In fact, we think it's glorious and beautiful and wonderful

5271
02:53:28,650 --> 02:53:31,230
and you know, the great flowering of peace

5272
02:53:31,230 --> 02:53:33,450
and harmony and moral justice of our time to do it.

5273
02:53:33,450 --> 02:53:35,730
And we don't think for one second what we're doing

5274
02:53:35,730 --> 02:53:38,640
to the countries that we're pulling all these people out of.

5275
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:40,713
And this is one of these things like, I don't know,

5276
02:53:40,713 --> 02:53:42,090
like maybe we're just gonna live

5277
02:53:42,090 --> 02:53:43,530
in this delusional state forever

5278
02:53:43,530 --> 02:53:44,460
and we'll just keep doing it

5279
02:53:44,460 --> 02:53:45,510
and it'll keep benefiting us

5280
02:53:45,510 --> 02:53:46,740
and we just won't care what happens,

5281
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:49,324
but like, I think there may come,

5282
02:53:49,324 --> 02:53:50,460
this is like one of these submarines

5283
02:53:50,460 --> 02:53:51,510
10 feet under the waterline.

5284
02:53:51,510 --> 02:53:53,790
Like, I think it's just a matter of time

5285
02:53:53,790 --> 02:53:55,560
until people suddenly realize, "Oh, my God,

5286
02:53:55,560 --> 02:53:56,820
what are we doing?"

5287
02:53:56,820 --> 02:53:59,430
'Cause like, we need the rest of the world

5288
02:53:59,430 --> 02:54:00,540
to succeed too, right?

5289
02:54:00,540 --> 02:54:02,820
Like we need these other countries to like flourish.

5290
02:54:02,820 --> 02:54:04,680
Like we don't wanna be the only successful country

5291
02:54:04,680 --> 02:54:07,380
in the middle of just like complete chaos and disaster,

5292
02:54:07,380 --> 02:54:09,570
and we just extract and we extract and we extract,

5293
02:54:09,570 --> 02:54:11,310
and we don't think twice about it.

5294
02:54:11,310 --> 02:54:14,400
- Well, this is so deeply profound, actually.

5295
02:54:14,400 --> 02:54:18,240
So what is the cost "winning" quote, unquote,

5296
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:21,303
if these countries are drained in terms of human capital,

5297
02:54:23,453 --> 02:54:25,680
on the level of geopolitics, what does that lead to?

5298
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:27,960
Even if we talk about wars and conflict

5299
02:54:27,960 --> 02:54:31,950
and all of this, we actually want them to be strong

5300
02:54:31,950 --> 02:54:36,540
in the way we understand strong, not just in every way.

5301
02:54:36,540 --> 02:54:38,460
So that cooperation

5302
02:54:38,460 --> 02:54:40,440
and competition can build a better world

5303
02:54:40,440 --> 02:54:41,682
for all of humanity.

5304
02:54:41,682 --> 02:54:42,515
- Yep.

5305
02:54:42,515 --> 02:54:43,400
- It's interesting,

5306
02:54:45,360 --> 02:54:48,300
this is one of those truths where you just speak

5307
02:54:48,300 --> 02:54:51,490
and it resonates, and I didn't even think about it.

5308
02:54:51,490 --> 02:54:52,530
- [Marc] Yeah, exactly.

5309
02:54:52,530 --> 02:54:56,040
- So you were sitting during the holiday season,

5310
02:54:56,040 --> 02:54:57,210
just boiling over.

5311
02:54:57,210 --> 02:54:59,400
So all that said- - Yeah.

5312
02:54:59,400 --> 02:55:03,300
- There's still to use some good to the H-1B?

5313
02:55:03,300 --> 02:55:04,770
- Okay, so then you get this other...

5314
02:55:04,770 --> 02:55:05,880
Okay, so then there's-

5315
02:55:05,880 --> 02:55:06,870
- Come all the way around. (laughs)

5316
02:55:06,870 --> 02:55:07,703
- There's another nuance.

5317
02:55:07,703 --> 02:55:08,536
So there's another nuance,

5318
02:55:08,536 --> 02:55:09,900
there's another nuance, which is mostly the valley,

5319
02:55:09,900 --> 02:55:12,870
we don't use H-1Bs anymore, mostly we use O-1s.

5320
02:55:14,116 --> 02:55:16,193
So there's a separate class of these,

5321
02:55:16,193 --> 02:55:18,060
and the O-1 is like this,

5322
02:55:18,060 --> 02:55:20,700
it turns out the O-1 is the super genius visa.

5323
02:55:20,700 --> 02:55:22,710
So the O-1 is the basically our founder,

5324
02:55:22,710 --> 02:55:25,470
like when we have somebody from anywhere in the world

5325
02:55:25,470 --> 02:55:27,240
and they've like invented a breakthrough new technology,

5326
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:29,340
and they wanna come to the US to start a company,

5327
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:31,760
they come in through an O-1 visa.

5328
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:34,050
And that actually is like a, it's a fairly high bar.

5329
02:55:34,050 --> 02:55:35,010
It's a high acceptance rate,

5330
02:55:35,010 --> 02:55:37,260
but it's like a pretty high bar. And they do a lot of work

5331
02:55:37,260 --> 02:55:39,327
and there's like a, you have to put real work into it

5332
02:55:39,327 --> 02:55:40,677
and really prove your case.

5333
02:55:41,550 --> 02:55:44,490
Mostly what's happened with the H-1B visa program

5334
02:55:44,490 --> 02:55:47,220
is that it has gone to basically two categories

5335
02:55:47,220 --> 02:55:48,053
of employers.

5336
02:55:48,053 --> 02:55:50,400
One is the basically a small set of big tech companies

5337
02:55:50,400 --> 02:55:51,570
that hire in volume,

5338
02:55:51,570 --> 02:55:54,150
which is exactly the companies that you would think.

5339
02:55:54,150 --> 02:55:55,530
And then the other is, it goes to these,

5340
02:55:55,530 --> 02:55:57,957
they call kind of the mills, the consulting mills, right?

5341
02:55:57,957 --> 02:56:00,120
And so there's these set of companies with names,

5342
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:01,860
I don't wanna pick on companies, but you know,

5343
02:56:01,860 --> 02:56:03,420
names like Cognizant that, you know,

5344
02:56:03,420 --> 02:56:06,240
hire, basically have their business model

5345
02:56:06,240 --> 02:56:10,290
is bring in primarily Indians in large numbers,

5346
02:56:10,290 --> 02:56:11,910
and you know, they often have, you know,

5347
02:56:11,910 --> 02:56:13,950
offices next to company-owned housing.

5348
02:56:13,950 --> 02:56:15,420
And they'll have, you know, organizations that are,

5349
02:56:15,420 --> 02:56:16,800
you know, they'll have, you know, organizations

5350
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:18,690
that are literally thousands of Indians, you know,

5351
02:56:18,690 --> 02:56:19,740
living and working in the US

5352
02:56:19,740 --> 02:56:24,540
and they do basically call it mid-tier, like IT consulting.

5353
02:56:24,540 --> 02:56:27,600
So you know, these folks, they're making good wages,

5354
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:28,433
but they're making 60 or 80 a year

5355
02:56:28,433 --> 02:56:30,747
or $100,000 a year, not the, you know,

5356
02:56:30,747 --> 02:56:32,793
300,000 that you'd make in the Valley.

5357
02:56:34,110 --> 02:56:35,730
And so, like in practice,

5358
02:56:35,730 --> 02:56:38,250
the startups, basic like little tech as we call it,

5359
02:56:38,250 --> 02:56:40,950
or the startup world, mainly doesn't use H-1Bs

5360
02:56:40,950 --> 02:56:42,870
at this point and mainly can't,

5361
02:56:42,870 --> 02:56:44,040
'cause the system is kind of rigged

5362
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:45,540
in a way that we really can't.

5363
02:56:46,650 --> 02:56:47,490
And then again,

5364
02:56:47,490 --> 02:56:49,140
you get to the sort of underlying morality here,

5365
02:56:49,140 --> 02:56:50,850
which is, it's like, well, you know,

5366
02:56:50,850 --> 02:56:53,280
Amazon, like Amazon's a in like I love Amazon,

5367
02:56:53,280 --> 02:56:55,170
but like they're a big powerful company.

5368
02:56:55,170 --> 02:56:56,820
You know, they've got, you know, more money than God.

5369
02:56:56,820 --> 02:56:58,140
They've got resources,

5370
02:56:58,140 --> 02:57:00,120
they've got long-term planning horizon, they do big,

5371
02:57:00,120 --> 02:57:03,210
you know, profound things over, you know, decades at a time.

5372
02:57:03,210 --> 02:57:04,890
You know, they could, you know,

5373
02:57:04,890 --> 02:57:05,910
or any of these other companies

5374
02:57:05,910 --> 02:57:08,100
could launch massively effective programs

5375
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:09,990
to go recruit the best and brightest

5376
02:57:09,990 --> 02:57:11,490
from all throughout the country.

5377
02:57:11,490 --> 02:57:13,087
And you know, you'll notice they don't do that.

5378
02:57:13,087 --> 02:57:15,150
You know, they bring in, you know,

5379
02:57:15,150 --> 02:57:17,727
10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year.

5380
02:57:17,727 --> 02:57:19,980
And so you've got a question there.

5381
02:57:19,980 --> 02:57:22,020
And then these mills, like, there's lots of questions

5382
02:57:22,020 --> 02:57:23,640
around them and whether they should, you know,

5383
02:57:23,640 --> 02:57:25,740
whether that's even a ethical way to, you know,

5384
02:57:25,740 --> 02:57:27,270
I don't wanna say they're unethical, but there's questions

5385
02:57:27,270 --> 02:57:30,153
around like exactly what the trade-offs are there.

5386
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:34,230
Yeah, and this is like a Pandora's box

5387
02:57:34,230 --> 02:57:36,990
that really, you know, nobody really wanted to be opened,

5388
02:57:36,990 --> 02:57:39,390
you know, to play devil's advocate on all this

5389
02:57:39,390 --> 02:57:41,430
in terms of like national immigration issues, you know,

5390
02:57:41,430 --> 02:57:42,587
none of this is like a top end issue just

5391
02:57:42,587 --> 02:57:44,940
'cause the numbers are small, right?

5392
02:57:44,940 --> 02:57:45,867
And so, you know, I don't think, you know,

5393
02:57:45,867 --> 02:57:47,247
the administration has said like,

5394
02:57:47,247 --> 02:57:50,010
this is not like a priority of theirs for right now.

5395
02:57:50,010 --> 02:57:51,690
But I guess what I would say is like,

5396
02:57:51,690 --> 02:57:54,390
there is actually a lot of complexity and nuance here.

5397
02:57:55,650 --> 02:57:57,210
I have a lot of friends, like I said, I have a lot

5398
02:57:57,210 --> 02:57:58,497
of friends and colleagues who are, you know,

5399
02:57:58,497 --> 02:58:01,080
who came over on H-1Bs, or O-1s, green cards,

5400
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:02,190
many are now citizens

5401
02:58:02,190 --> 02:58:04,230
and you know, every single one that one of them

5402
02:58:04,230 --> 02:58:05,130
was not every single one,

5403
02:58:05,130 --> 02:58:06,847
a lot of them were enthusiastic to,

5404
02:58:06,847 --> 02:58:07,680
you know, defend the honor

5405
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:09,390
of immigrants throughout this whole period.

5406
02:58:09,390 --> 02:58:10,920
And they said to me, it's like, "Well, Marc,

5407
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:12,900
you know, how can we more clearly express,

5408
02:58:12,900 --> 02:58:14,340
you know, the importance of high-skilled immigration

5409
02:58:14,340 --> 02:58:15,173
to the US?"

5410
02:58:15,173 --> 02:58:16,860
And I was like, I think you can do it by advocating

5411
02:58:16,860 --> 02:58:20,070
for also developing our native-born talent

5412
02:58:20,070 --> 02:58:22,230
and be like, do you wanna inflame the issue

5413
02:58:22,230 --> 02:58:24,540
or do you wanna diffuse the issue, right?

5414
02:58:24,540 --> 02:58:27,630
And I think the answer is to diffuse the issue.

5415
02:58:27,630 --> 02:58:31,698
Let me give you one more positive scenario,

5416
02:58:31,698 --> 02:58:33,803
and then I'll also beat up on the university some more.

5417
02:58:35,370 --> 02:58:37,233
Do you know about the National Merit Scholarship System?

5418
02:58:37,233 --> 02:58:38,533
Have you heard about this?

5419
02:58:40,151 --> 02:58:40,984
- Not really, can you explain?

5420
02:58:40,984 --> 02:58:43,320
- So there's a system that was created during the Cold War

5421
02:58:43,320 --> 02:58:44,820
called the National Merit Scholars.

5422
02:58:44,820 --> 02:58:47,910
And it is a, basically, it was created,

5423
02:58:47,910 --> 02:58:50,100
I forget, in the late '50s or '60s when...

5424
02:58:50,100 --> 02:58:51,660
It was when people in government actually wanted

5425
02:58:51,660 --> 02:58:53,760
to identify the best and the brightest,

5426
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:56,640
as heretical an ideas that sounds today.

5427
02:58:56,640 --> 02:58:59,130
And so it's basically a national talent search

5428
02:58:59,130 --> 02:59:00,543
for basically, IQ.

5429
02:59:02,479 --> 02:59:04,380
Its goal is to identify basically the top 0.5%

5430
02:59:04,380 --> 02:59:07,740
of the IQ in the country, by the way,

5431
02:59:07,740 --> 02:59:09,390
completely regardless of other characteristics.

5432
02:59:09,390 --> 02:59:11,403
So there's no race, gender, or any other aspect to it.

5433
02:59:11,403 --> 02:59:13,980
It's just going for straight intelligence.

5434
02:59:13,980 --> 02:59:15,960
It uses the first, the PSAT,

5435
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:19,266
which is the preparatory SAT that you take,

5436
02:59:19,266 --> 02:59:20,670
and then the SAT.

5437
02:59:20,670 --> 02:59:23,250
So it uses those scores, that is the scoring.

5438
02:59:23,250 --> 02:59:25,860
It's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system.

5439
02:59:25,860 --> 02:59:29,283
So they use the SAT as a proxy for IQ, which it is.

5440
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:32,850
They run this every year,

5441
02:59:32,850 --> 02:59:33,683
they identify,

5442
02:59:35,036 --> 02:59:37,290
they get down to like 1% of the population of the kids,

5443
02:59:37,290 --> 02:59:39,420
18 year olds any given year who scored highest on the PSAT,

5444
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:42,115
and then they get down to like further qualify down

5445
02:59:42,115 --> 02:59:45,000
to the 0.5% that also replicate on the SAT.

5446
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:46,890
And then it's like, the scholarship amount

5447
02:59:46,890 --> 02:59:48,720
is like $2,500, right?

5448
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:50,910
So it was a lot of money 50 years ago,

5449
02:59:50,910 --> 02:59:51,743
not as much today.

5450
02:59:51,743 --> 02:59:54,000
But it's a national system being run,

5451
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,460
literally, to find the best and the brightest.

5452
02:59:56,460 --> 02:59:59,160
How many of our great and powerful universities use this

5453
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:00,630
as a scouting system?

5454
03:00:00,630 --> 03:00:02,880
Like our universities all have sports teams,

5455
03:00:02,880 --> 03:00:06,510
they all have national scouting, they have full-time scouts

5456
03:00:06,510 --> 03:00:08,100
who go out and they go to every high school

5457
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:09,690
and they try to find all the great basketball players

5458
03:00:09,690 --> 03:00:13,080
and bring them into the NCAA, into all these leagues.

5459
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:14,340
How many of our great and powerful

5460
03:00:14,340 --> 03:00:16,860
and enlightened universities use the National Merit system

5461
03:00:16,860 --> 03:00:18,630
to go do a talent search

5462
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:21,270
for the smartest kids and just bring them in?

5463
03:00:21,270 --> 03:00:22,380
- Let me guess, very few.

5464
03:00:22,380 --> 03:00:24,900
Zero. - Zero. (laughs)

5465
03:00:24,900 --> 03:00:26,820
- As you say it, that's brilliant,

5466
03:00:26,820 --> 03:00:28,890
there should be that same level of scouting

5467
03:00:28,890 --> 03:00:30,750
for talent internally.

5468
03:00:30,750 --> 03:00:32,130
- Go get the smartest ones.

5469
03:00:32,130 --> 03:00:34,080
I'll give you one more kicker on this topic

5470
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:35,970
if I haven't beaten it to death.

5471
03:00:35,970 --> 03:00:37,470
You know, the SAT has changed.

5472
03:00:38,760 --> 03:00:41,740
So the SAT used to be a highly accurate proxy for IQ

5473
03:00:43,080 --> 03:00:45,540
that caused a bunch of problems.

5474
03:00:45,540 --> 03:00:48,180
People really don't like the whole idea of IQ.

5475
03:00:48,180 --> 03:00:50,760
And so the SAT has been actively managed

5476
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:53,160
over the last 50 years by the college board that runs it.

5477
03:00:53,160 --> 03:00:55,293
And it has been essentially like everything else,

5478
03:00:55,293 --> 03:00:57,000
it's been dumbed down.

5479
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:00,870
And so the in two ways, number one,

5480
03:01:00,870 --> 03:01:04,050
it's been dumbed down where an 800 from 40 years ago

5481
03:01:04,050 --> 03:01:05,790
does not mean what an 800 means today.

5482
03:01:05,790 --> 03:01:09,573
And 40 years ago, it was almost impossible to get an 800.

5483
03:01:11,401 --> 03:01:12,330
Today, there's so many 800s

5484
03:01:12,330 --> 03:01:13,740
that you could stock the entire Ivy League

5485
03:01:13,740 --> 03:01:14,997
with 800s, right?

5486
03:01:14,997 --> 03:01:18,090
And so, it's been deliberately dumbed down.

5487
03:01:18,090 --> 03:01:19,980
And then two is they have tried

5488
03:01:19,980 --> 03:01:21,900
to pull out a lot of what's called the g-loading.

5489
03:01:21,900 --> 03:01:25,350
And so they've tried to detach it from being an IQ proxy

5490
03:01:25,350 --> 03:01:26,970
'cause IQ is such an inflammatory concept.

5491
03:01:26,970 --> 03:01:28,320
And the consequence of that is,

5492
03:01:28,320 --> 03:01:29,670
and this is sort of perverse,

5493
03:01:29,670 --> 03:01:32,700
they've made it more coachable, right?

5494
03:01:32,700 --> 03:01:34,590
So the SAT 40 years ago,

5495
03:01:34,590 --> 03:01:35,670
coaching didn't really work.

5496
03:01:35,670 --> 03:01:37,380
And more recently, it has really started to work.

5497
03:01:37,380 --> 03:01:39,360
And one of the things you see is the Asian spike,

5498
03:01:39,360 --> 03:01:41,040
you see this like giant leap upward

5499
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:42,207
in Asian performance over the last decade.

5500
03:01:42,207 --> 03:01:43,860
And I think looking at the data,

5501
03:01:43,860 --> 03:01:46,200
I think a lot of that is because it's more coachable now.

5502
03:01:46,200 --> 03:01:48,000
And the Asians do the most coaching.

5503
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:50,627
So there's a bunch of issues with this.

5504
03:01:50,627 --> 03:01:52,530
And so the coaching thing is really difficult

5505
03:01:52,530 --> 03:01:54,390
'cause the coaching thing is a subsidy

5506
03:01:54,390 --> 03:01:57,360
then to the kids whose parents can afford coaching, right?

5507
03:01:57,360 --> 03:01:58,710
And I don't know about you, but where I grew up,

5508
03:01:58,710 --> 03:01:59,850
there was no SAT coaching.

5509
03:01:59,850 --> 03:02:01,770
So there's like an issue there.

5510
03:02:01,770 --> 03:02:03,923
I didn't even know what the SAT was until the day I took it,

5511
03:02:03,923 --> 03:02:04,950
much less that there was coaching,

5512
03:02:04,950 --> 03:02:06,030
much less that it could work,

5513
03:02:06,030 --> 03:02:08,130
so much less we could afford it.

5514
03:02:08,130 --> 03:02:09,720
So, number one, there's issues there,

5515
03:02:09,720 --> 03:02:11,550
but the other issue there is think about what's happened

5516
03:02:11,550 --> 03:02:15,060
by the dumbing down, 800 no longer captures

5517
03:02:15,060 --> 03:02:18,180
all the smart, 800 is too crude of a test.

5518
03:02:18,180 --> 03:02:20,160
It's like the AI benchmarking problem.

5519
03:02:20,160 --> 03:02:22,500
It's the same problem they have AI benchmarking right now.

5520
03:02:22,500 --> 03:02:24,303
800 is too low of a threshold.

5521
03:02:25,440 --> 03:02:27,570
There are too many kids scoring 800.

5522
03:02:27,570 --> 03:02:29,700
'Cause what you want is you want, whatever,

5523
03:02:29,700 --> 03:02:31,793
if it's gonna be 100,000 kids, I don't know what it is,

5524
03:02:31,793 --> 03:02:33,360
it's gonna be 50,000 kids a year scoring 800.

5525
03:02:33,360 --> 03:02:35,413
You also then want kids to be able to score 900

5526
03:02:35,413 --> 03:02:37,137
and 1,000, and 1,100, and 1,200,

5527
03:02:37,137 --> 03:02:39,720
and you wanna ultimately get to, you know,

5528
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:41,940
you'd like to ultimately identify the top 100 kids

5529
03:02:41,940 --> 03:02:44,160
and make sure that you get them in MIT.

5530
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:46,890
And the resolution of the test has been reduced,

5531
03:02:46,890 --> 03:02:49,350
so that it actually is not useful for doing that.

5532
03:02:49,350 --> 03:02:51,150
And again, I would say this is like part

5533
03:02:51,150 --> 03:02:52,470
of the generalized corruption

5534
03:02:52,470 --> 03:02:54,120
that's taken place throughout this entire system

5535
03:02:54,120 --> 03:02:56,700
where we have been heading in the reverse direction

5536
03:02:56,700 --> 03:02:58,620
from wanting to actually go get the best and brightest

5537
03:02:58,620 --> 03:03:00,807
and actually put them in the places where they should be.

5538
03:03:00,807 --> 03:03:02,430
And then just the final comment would be,

5539
03:03:02,430 --> 03:03:04,560
the great thing about standardized testing

5540
03:03:04,560 --> 03:03:06,660
and the National Merit System is it's comp, like I said,

5541
03:03:06,660 --> 03:03:08,760
it's completely race blind, it's gender blind,

5542
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:10,230
it's blind on every other characteristic.

5543
03:03:10,230 --> 03:03:12,480
It's only done on test scores.

5544
03:03:12,480 --> 03:03:13,680
You know, and you can make an argument about whether

5545
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:16,830
that's good or bad, but it is, you know, for sure,

5546
03:03:16,830 --> 03:03:18,000
you know, it's the closest thing

5547
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:19,950
that we had to get to merit.

5548
03:03:19,950 --> 03:03:21,240
It was the thing that they did

5549
03:03:21,240 --> 03:03:23,130
when they thought they needed merit to win the Cold War.

5550
03:03:23,130 --> 03:03:26,310
And of course, we could choose to do that anytime we want.

5551
03:03:26,310 --> 03:03:27,143
And I just say,

5552
03:03:27,143 --> 03:03:28,980
I find it like incredibly striking

5553
03:03:28,980 --> 03:03:31,320
and an enormous moral indictment of the current system

5554
03:03:31,320 --> 03:03:33,900
that there are no universities that do this today.

5555
03:03:33,900 --> 03:03:35,400
So back to the immigration thing, just real quick.

5556
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:36,233
It's like, okay,

5557
03:03:36,233 --> 03:03:37,800
we aren't even trying to go get the smart kids

5558
03:03:37,800 --> 03:03:39,090
out of the center of- - Yeah.

5559
03:03:39,090 --> 03:03:40,200
- And even if they think

5560
03:03:40,200 --> 03:03:42,330
that they can get into these places, they get turned down.

5561
03:03:42,330 --> 03:03:43,710
And the same thing for the smart Asians

5562
03:03:43,710 --> 03:03:44,820
and the same thing for the smart Jews,

5563
03:03:44,820 --> 03:03:46,080
and the same thing for the smart Black people.

5564
03:03:46,080 --> 03:03:51,080
And like, it's just like, I don't know how, like,

5565
03:03:51,270 --> 03:03:52,350
I don't know how that's moral.

5566
03:03:52,350 --> 03:03:54,360
Like I don't get it at all.

5567
03:03:54,360 --> 03:03:56,430
- As you said about the 800,

5568
03:03:56,430 --> 03:03:58,740
so I took the SAT and the ACT many times

5569
03:03:58,740 --> 03:04:01,743
and I've always gotten perfect on math, 800.

5570
03:04:03,180 --> 03:04:05,973
And I'm not that I'm not special like,

5571
03:04:08,400 --> 03:04:10,590
it doesn't identify genius.

5572
03:04:10,590 --> 03:04:13,590
I think you wanna search for genius

5573
03:04:13,590 --> 03:04:17,160
and you wanna create measures that find genius

5574
03:04:17,160 --> 03:04:20,250
of all different kinds, speaking of diversity.

5575
03:04:20,250 --> 03:04:23,820
And I guess we should reiterate

5576
03:04:23,820 --> 03:04:28,080
and say over and over and over, defend immigrants.

5577
03:04:28,080 --> 03:04:29,010
Yes.

5578
03:04:29,010 --> 03:04:32,790
But say we should hire more and more native-born.

5579
03:04:32,790 --> 03:04:34,710
- Well, you asked me in the beginning like

5580
03:04:34,710 --> 03:04:36,390
what's the most optimistic forecast, right,

5581
03:04:36,390 --> 03:04:37,223
that we could have?

5582
03:04:37,223 --> 03:04:38,580
And the most optimistic forecast would be, my God,

5583
03:04:38,580 --> 03:04:41,083
what if we did both? (laughs)

5584
03:04:43,980 --> 03:04:46,290
- So that's the reasonable, the rational,

5585
03:04:46,290 --> 03:04:47,940
the smart thing to say here.

5586
03:04:47,940 --> 03:04:50,250
In fact, we don't have to have a war.

5587
03:04:50,250 --> 03:04:52,380
- Well, it would diffuse the entire issue.

5588
03:04:52,380 --> 03:04:53,213
- [Lex] Yeah.

5589
03:04:53,213 --> 03:04:54,780
- If everybody in the center in the South of the country

5590
03:04:54,780 --> 03:04:56,040
and every Jewish family, Asian family,

5591
03:04:56,040 --> 03:04:57,450
Black family knew they were getting a fair shake,

5592
03:04:57,450 --> 03:04:59,050
like it would diffuse the issue.

5593
03:05:00,450 --> 03:05:01,530
Like how about diffusing the issue?

5594
03:05:01,530 --> 03:05:03,330
Like what a crazy radical...

5595
03:05:03,330 --> 03:05:04,560
Sorry, I don't mean to really get out

5596
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:05,710
over my skis here, but-

5597
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:10,740
- I think your profile on X states, "It's time to build."

5598
03:05:10,740 --> 03:05:13,953
It feels like 2025 is a good year to build.

5599
03:05:14,940 --> 03:05:18,693
So I wanted to ask your advice,

5600
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:24,740
and maybe for advice for anybody who's trying to build,

5601
03:05:25,620 --> 03:05:28,170
who's trying to build something useful in the world

5602
03:05:29,405 --> 03:05:30,630
or maybe launch a startup

5603
03:05:30,630 --> 03:05:34,650
or maybe just launch apps, services, whatever,

5604
03:05:34,650 --> 03:05:37,620
ship software products.

5605
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:40,593
So maybe, by way of advice,

5606
03:05:41,490 --> 03:05:44,160
how do you actually get to shipping?

5607
03:05:44,160 --> 03:05:45,750
- So I mean, a big part of the answer I think

5608
03:05:45,750 --> 03:05:47,820
is we're in the middle of a legit revolution.

5609
03:05:47,820 --> 03:05:49,500
And I know you've been talking about this on your show,

5610
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:53,160
but like AI coding, I mean, this is the biggest earthquake

5611
03:05:53,160 --> 03:05:55,293
to hit software in certainly my life,

5612
03:05:56,220 --> 03:05:58,320
maybe since the investment of software.

5613
03:05:58,320 --> 03:05:59,970
And I'm sure you, and you know, we're involved in various

5614
03:05:59,970 --> 03:06:02,340
of these companies, but you know, these tools,

5615
03:06:02,340 --> 03:06:03,630
you know, from a variety of companies

5616
03:06:03,630 --> 03:06:07,060
are just like absolutely revolutionary

5617
03:06:08,190 --> 03:06:10,140
and they're getting better by leaps and bounds every day.

5618
03:06:10,140 --> 03:06:11,640
And you know, all this,

5619
03:06:11,640 --> 03:06:13,230
but like the thing with coding,

5620
03:06:13,230 --> 03:06:14,610
like there's like open questions

5621
03:06:14,610 --> 03:06:16,140
of whether AI can get better at like,

5622
03:06:16,140 --> 03:06:17,520
I don't know, understanding philosophy

5623
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:18,990
or whatever, creative writing or whatever.

5624
03:06:18,990 --> 03:06:21,150
But like for sure, we can make it much better

5625
03:06:21,150 --> 03:06:22,350
at coding, right?

5626
03:06:22,350 --> 03:06:24,870
Because you can validate the results of coding.

5627
03:06:24,870 --> 03:06:26,730
And so, you know, there's all these methods of, you know,

5628
03:06:26,730 --> 03:06:27,900
synthetic data and self-training

5629
03:06:27,900 --> 03:06:29,130
and reinforcement learning that,

5630
03:06:29,130 --> 03:06:30,540
for sure, you can do with coding.

5631
03:06:30,540 --> 03:06:32,280
And so everybody I know

5632
03:06:32,280 --> 03:06:33,750
who works in the field says AI coding

5633
03:06:33,750 --> 03:06:36,240
is gonna get to be phenomenally good.

5634
03:06:36,240 --> 03:06:37,470
And it's already great.

5635
03:06:37,470 --> 03:06:39,300
And you can, I mean anybody wants to see this,

5636
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:41,040
just go on YouTube and look at AI coding demos,

5637
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:43,140
you know, little kids making apps in 10 minutes,

5638
03:06:43,140 --> 03:06:44,547
working with an AI coding system.

5639
03:06:44,547 --> 03:06:46,384
And so I think it's the golden age.

5640
03:06:46,384 --> 03:06:47,217
I mean I think this is an area

5641
03:06:47,217 --> 03:06:48,240
where it's clearly the golden age,

5642
03:06:48,240 --> 03:06:50,190
the tool set is extraordinary.

5643
03:06:50,190 --> 03:06:52,260
You know, in a day as a coder, for sure,

5644
03:06:52,260 --> 03:06:54,870
in a day you can retrain yourself, you know,

5645
03:06:54,870 --> 03:06:56,970
start using these things, get a huge boost in productivity,

5646
03:06:56,970 --> 03:06:57,803
as a non-coder,

5647
03:06:57,803 --> 03:07:00,150
you can learn much more quickly than you could before.

5648
03:07:00,150 --> 03:07:03,000
- That's actually a tricky one in terms of learning

5649
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:04,800
as a non-coder to build stuff.

5650
03:07:04,800 --> 03:07:06,870
It's still, I feel like you still need to learn

5651
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:10,620
how to code, it becomes a superpower.

5652
03:07:10,620 --> 03:07:12,510
It helps you be much more productive.

5653
03:07:12,510 --> 03:07:17,490
Like you could legitimately be a one person company

5654
03:07:17,490 --> 03:07:19,020
and get quite far.

5655
03:07:19,020 --> 03:07:20,880
- I agree with that, up to a point.

5656
03:07:20,880 --> 03:07:24,627
So I think, for sure, for quite a long time,

5657
03:07:24,627 --> 03:07:25,920
the people who are good at coding

5658
03:07:25,920 --> 03:07:28,620
are gonna be the best at actually having AI's code things,

5659
03:07:28,620 --> 03:07:30,600
'cause they're gonna understand what I mean, very basic.

5660
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:32,037
They're gonna understand what's happening, right?

5661
03:07:32,037 --> 03:07:33,870
And they're gonna be able be able to evaluate the work

5662
03:07:33,870 --> 03:07:34,920
and they're gonna be able to, you know,

5663
03:07:34,920 --> 03:07:37,170
literally like manage AIs better.

5664
03:07:37,170 --> 03:07:38,790
Like even if they're not literally handwriting the code,

5665
03:07:38,790 --> 03:07:39,810
they're just gonna have a much better sense

5666
03:07:39,810 --> 03:07:40,643
of what's going on.

5667
03:07:40,643 --> 03:07:42,720
So I definitely think like 100% my nine-year-old

5668
03:07:42,720 --> 03:07:44,310
is like doing all kinds of coding classes,

5669
03:07:44,310 --> 03:07:47,430
and he'll keep doing that for certainly through 18.

5670
03:07:47,430 --> 03:07:48,480
We'll see after that.

5671
03:07:49,590 --> 03:07:52,320
And so like for sure that's the case.

5672
03:07:52,320 --> 03:07:53,220
But look, having said that,

5673
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:55,620
one of the things you can do with an AI is say,

5674
03:07:55,620 --> 03:07:58,083
teach me how to code, right?

5675
03:07:59,160 --> 03:08:01,170
And you know, there's a whole bunch of,

5676
03:08:01,170 --> 03:08:03,690
you know, I'll name names, you know, Khan Academy,

5677
03:08:03,690 --> 03:08:05,040
like there's a whole bunch of work

5678
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:06,600
that they're doing at Khan Academy for free.

5679
03:08:06,600 --> 03:08:08,910
And then we, you know, we have this company, Replit,

5680
03:08:08,910 --> 03:08:10,830
which is was originally specifically built for kids

5681
03:08:10,830 --> 03:08:13,230
for coding, that has AI built in,

5682
03:08:13,230 --> 03:08:15,450
that's just absolutely extraordinary now.

5683
03:08:15,450 --> 03:08:16,980
And then, you know, there's a variety

5684
03:08:16,980 --> 03:08:18,280
of other systems like this

5685
03:08:19,230 --> 03:08:21,420
and yeah, that, I mean, the AI's gonna be able to teach you

5686
03:08:21,420 --> 03:08:23,580
to code, AI, by the way, is as you know,

5687
03:08:23,580 --> 03:08:27,030
spectacularly good at explaining code, right?

5688
03:08:27,030 --> 03:08:30,030
And so, you know, the tools have these features now

5689
03:08:30,030 --> 03:08:31,350
where you can talk to the code base

5690
03:08:31,350 --> 03:08:32,640
and so you can like literally

5691
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:34,940
like ask the code base questions about itself.

5692
03:08:35,820 --> 03:08:37,080
And you can also just do the simple form,

5693
03:08:37,080 --> 03:08:39,709
which is you can copy and paste code into ChatGPT

5694
03:08:39,709 --> 03:08:41,520
and just ask it to explain it what's going on, rewrite it,

5695
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:43,620
improve it, make recommendations.

5696
03:08:43,620 --> 03:08:46,610
And so yeah, there's dozens of ways to do this.

5697
03:08:46,610 --> 03:08:47,730
By the way, you can also,

5698
03:08:47,730 --> 03:08:49,380
I mean even more broadly than code.

5699
03:08:49,380 --> 03:08:51,000
Like, okay, you wanna make a video game,

5700
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:54,510
okay, now you can do AI, art generation, sound generation,

5701
03:08:54,510 --> 03:08:56,597
dialogue generation, voice generation, right?

5702
03:08:56,597 --> 03:08:59,309
And so all of a sudden, like, you don't need designers,

5703
03:08:59,309 --> 03:09:00,450
you know, you don't need, you know,

5704
03:09:00,450 --> 03:09:03,390
voice actors, you know, so yeah.

5705
03:09:03,390 --> 03:09:04,980
So there's just like unlimited

5706
03:09:04,980 --> 03:09:06,030
and then, you know, a big is, you know,

5707
03:09:06,030 --> 03:09:07,650
a big part of coding is so-called glue,

5708
03:09:07,650 --> 03:09:10,260
you know, it's interfacing into other systems.

5709
03:09:10,260 --> 03:09:11,460
So it's interfacing into, you know,

5710
03:09:11,460 --> 03:09:13,397
Stripe to take payments or something like that.

5711
03:09:13,397 --> 03:09:15,947
And, you know, AI's fantastic at writing glue code.

5712
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:18,240
So, you know, really, really good at making sure

5713
03:09:18,240 --> 03:09:20,010
that you can plug everything together,

5714
03:09:20,010 --> 03:09:23,370
really good at helping you figure out how to deploy,

5715
03:09:23,370 --> 03:09:25,643
you know, it'll even write a business plan for you.

5716
03:09:26,490 --> 03:09:28,560
So it's just this, it's like everything happening

5717
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:29,393
with AI right now, it's just,

5718
03:09:29,393 --> 03:09:30,810
it's like this latent superpower

5719
03:09:30,810 --> 03:09:32,940
and there's this incredible spectrum of people

5720
03:09:32,940 --> 03:09:35,760
who have really figured out massive performance increases,

5721
03:09:35,760 --> 03:09:37,170
productivity increases with it already.

5722
03:09:37,170 --> 03:09:39,660
There's other people who aren't even aware it's happening.

5723
03:09:39,660 --> 03:09:43,350
And there's some gearing to whether you're a coder or not,

5724
03:09:43,350 --> 03:09:45,300
but I think there are lots of non-coders

5725
03:09:45,300 --> 03:09:46,133
that are off to the races.

5726
03:09:46,133 --> 03:09:47,910
And I think there are lots of professional coders

5727
03:09:47,910 --> 03:09:49,160
who are still like, eh...

5728
03:09:50,160 --> 03:09:52,260
You know, the blacksmiths were not necessarily in favor of,

5729
03:09:52,260 --> 03:09:55,260
you know, the car business.

5730
03:09:55,260 --> 03:09:57,817
So yeah, there's the old William Gibson quote,

5731
03:09:57,817 --> 03:10:00,120
"The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed yet."

5732
03:10:00,120 --> 03:10:02,880
And this is maybe the most potent version of that

5733
03:10:02,880 --> 03:10:03,880
that I've ever seen.

5734
03:10:04,920 --> 03:10:06,870
- Yeah, there's, you know, the old meme

5735
03:10:09,082 --> 03:10:09,915
with the bell curve,

5736
03:10:09,915 --> 03:10:12,517
the people on both extremes say,

5737
03:10:12,517 --> 03:10:14,097
"AI coding is the future."

5738
03:10:15,150 --> 03:10:16,410
- Right. - It is very common.

5739
03:10:16,410 --> 03:10:17,670
The programmers to say, you know,

5740
03:10:17,670 --> 03:10:18,990
if you're any good of a programmer,

5741
03:10:18,990 --> 03:10:21,124
you're not going to be using it,

5742
03:10:21,124 --> 03:10:22,440
that's just not true.

5743
03:10:22,440 --> 03:10:24,780
I consider myself reasonably good programmer,

5744
03:10:24,780 --> 03:10:27,810
and my productivity has been just skyrocketed,

5745
03:10:27,810 --> 03:10:31,200
and the joy of programming skyrocketed,

5746
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:34,113
every aspect of programming is more efficient,

5747
03:10:35,490 --> 03:10:38,655
more productive, more fun, all that kind of stuff.

5748
03:10:38,655 --> 03:10:40,660
- I would also say code is, you know,

5749
03:10:40,660 --> 03:10:42,570
code has of anything in like industrial society,

5750
03:10:42,570 --> 03:10:45,030
code has the highest elasticity,

5751
03:10:45,030 --> 03:10:47,689
which is to say the easier it is to make it,

5752
03:10:47,689 --> 03:10:48,522
the more of it gets made.

5753
03:10:48,522 --> 03:10:51,812
Like I think effectively there's unlimited demand for code.

5754
03:10:51,812 --> 03:10:54,450
Like, in other words, like there's always some other idea

5755
03:10:54,450 --> 03:10:56,700
for a thing that you can do, a feature that you can add

5756
03:10:56,700 --> 03:10:58,350
or a thing that you can optimize.

5757
03:11:00,400 --> 03:11:02,160
And so, like overwhelmingly, you know,

5758
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:03,290
the amount of code that exists in the world

5759
03:11:03,290 --> 03:11:05,460
is a fraction of even the ideas we have today.

5760
03:11:05,460 --> 03:11:07,727
And then we come up with new ideas all the time.

5761
03:11:07,727 --> 03:11:10,340
And so I think that like, (laughs) you know,

5762
03:11:11,229 --> 03:11:12,540
I was in the late '80s, early '90s,

5763
03:11:12,540 --> 03:11:14,100
when sort of automated coding systems started

5764
03:11:14,100 --> 03:11:16,350
to come out, expert systems, a big deal in those days,

5765
03:11:16,350 --> 03:11:18,210
and there was a famous book called

5766
03:11:18,210 --> 03:11:20,520
the "Decline and Fall of the American Programmer," you know,

5767
03:11:20,520 --> 03:11:22,110
that predicted that these new coding systems

5768
03:11:22,110 --> 03:11:23,700
were gonna mean we wouldn't have programmers in the future.

5769
03:11:23,700 --> 03:11:25,470
And of course, the number of programming jobs exploded

5770
03:11:25,470 --> 03:11:27,000
by like a factor of 100.

5771
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:30,750
Like, my guess is we'll have more coding jobs probably

5772
03:11:30,750 --> 03:11:33,000
by like an order magnitude 10 years from now.

5773
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:35,700
That will be different, they'll be different jobs.

5774
03:11:35,700 --> 03:11:39,750
They'll involve orchestrating AI, but there will be,

5775
03:11:39,750 --> 03:11:41,400
we will be creating so much more software

5776
03:11:41,400 --> 03:11:43,900
that the whole industry will just explode in size.

5777
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:47,550
- Are you seeing the size of companies decrease

5778
03:11:47,550 --> 03:11:49,230
in terms of startups?

5779
03:11:49,230 --> 03:11:51,390
What's the landscapes of little tech?

5780
03:11:51,390 --> 03:11:52,280
- All we're seeing right now

5781
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:54,423
is the AI hiring boom of all time.

5782
03:11:55,440 --> 03:11:57,137
- [Lex] Oh, for the big tech?

5783
03:11:57,137 --> 03:11:58,050
- And little tech. - And little tech.

5784
03:11:58,050 --> 03:12:00,150
- Everybody's trying to hire as many engineers

5785
03:12:00,150 --> 03:12:02,520
as they can to build AI systems,

5786
03:12:02,520 --> 03:12:03,443
it's 100%.

5787
03:12:03,443 --> 03:12:06,000
I mean, there's a handful of company, you know,

5788
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,310
there's a little bit, there's customer service,

5789
03:12:08,310 --> 03:12:10,560
you know, we have some companies and others

5790
03:12:10,560 --> 03:12:11,490
'cause I think it's Klarna that's publicizing

5791
03:12:11,490 --> 03:12:16,260
a lot of this in Europe where, you know,

5792
03:12:16,260 --> 03:12:17,730
there are jobs that can be optimized

5793
03:12:17,730 --> 03:12:19,500
and jobs that can be automated.

5794
03:12:19,500 --> 03:12:21,933
But like for engineering jobs, like,

5795
03:12:21,933 --> 03:12:23,680
it's just an explosion of hiring

5796
03:12:25,050 --> 03:12:26,490
that at least, so far, there's no trace

5797
03:12:26,490 --> 03:12:28,380
of any sort of diminishing effect.

5798
03:12:28,380 --> 03:12:30,780
Now, having said that, I am looking forward to the day,

5799
03:12:30,780 --> 03:12:33,993
I am waiting for the first company to walk in saying, yes,

5800
03:12:34,850 --> 03:12:36,450
like the more radical form of it.

5801
03:12:36,450 --> 03:12:37,283
So basically,

5802
03:12:37,283 --> 03:12:38,880
the companies that we see are basically one of two kinds.

5803
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:39,900
We see the companies

5804
03:12:39,900 --> 03:12:43,770
that are basically sometimes use weak form, strong form.

5805
03:12:43,770 --> 03:12:46,924
So the weak form companies, I sometimes use the term,

5806
03:12:46,924 --> 03:12:48,990
it's call it the sixth bullet point.

5807
03:12:48,990 --> 03:12:51,425
AI is the sixth bullet point on whatever they're doing.

5808
03:12:51,425 --> 03:12:52,380
- (laughs) Sure.

5809
03:12:52,380 --> 03:12:53,460
- Right? And it's on the slide,

5810
03:12:53,460 --> 03:12:54,293
right? - Yeah.

5811
03:12:54,293 --> 03:12:55,198
- So they've got the, you know, whatever,

5812
03:12:55,198 --> 03:12:56,031
da, da, da, da, da,

5813
03:12:56,031 --> 03:12:56,864
and then AI is the sixth thing.

5814
03:12:56,864 --> 03:12:57,697
And the reason AI is the sixth thing is,

5815
03:12:57,697 --> 03:12:59,010
'cause they had already previously written the slide

5816
03:12:59,010 --> 03:13:00,420
before the AI revolution started,

5817
03:13:00,420 --> 03:13:02,970
and so they just added the six bullet point in the slide,

5818
03:13:02,970 --> 03:13:04,230
which is how you're getting all these products

5819
03:13:04,230 --> 03:13:06,390
that have like the AI button up in the corner, right?

5820
03:13:06,390 --> 03:13:07,380
The little sparkly button.

5821
03:13:07,380 --> 03:13:08,250
- Yep. - Right?

5822
03:13:08,250 --> 03:13:09,900
And all of a sudden Gmail is offering

5823
03:13:09,900 --> 03:13:12,240
to summarize your email, which I'm like, I don't need that.

5824
03:13:12,240 --> 03:13:15,459
Like, I need you to answer my email, not summarize it.

5825
03:13:15,459 --> 03:13:16,620
Like what the hell?

5826
03:13:16,620 --> 03:13:18,420
Okay, so we see those and that's fine.

5827
03:13:18,420 --> 03:13:19,860
That's like, I don't know,

5828
03:13:19,860 --> 03:13:22,110
putting sugar on the cake or something.

5829
03:13:22,110 --> 03:13:24,120
But then we see the strong form, which is the companies

5830
03:13:24,120 --> 03:13:26,850
that are building from scratch for AI, right?

5831
03:13:26,850 --> 03:13:27,683
And they're building it.

5832
03:13:27,683 --> 03:13:28,890
I actually just met with a company

5833
03:13:28,890 --> 03:13:30,810
that is building literally an AI email system,

5834
03:13:30,810 --> 03:13:31,710
as an example, so just-

5835
03:13:31,710 --> 03:13:33,353
- Oh, nice.

5836
03:13:33,353 --> 03:13:34,530
I can't wait.

5837
03:13:34,530 --> 03:13:35,540
- Yeah, they're gonna completely.

5838
03:13:35,540 --> 03:13:38,133
So the very obvious idea, very smart team, you know,

5839
03:13:38,133 --> 03:13:39,133
it's gonna be great.

5840
03:13:40,380 --> 03:13:42,150
And then, you know, Notion, just, you know,

5841
03:13:42,150 --> 03:13:43,200
another, not one of our companies,

5842
03:13:43,200 --> 03:13:45,270
but just came out with a product. And so now companies

5843
03:13:45,270 --> 03:13:46,410
are gonna basically come through,

5844
03:13:46,410 --> 03:13:47,243
sweep through,

5845
03:13:47,243 --> 03:13:48,960
and they're gonna do basically AI-first versions

5846
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:50,610
of basically everything.

5847
03:13:50,610 --> 03:13:52,000
And those are like companies built, you know,

5848
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:53,850
AI is the first bullet point.

5849
03:13:53,850 --> 03:13:55,200
It's the strong form of the argument.

5850
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:56,790
- Yeah, Cursor is an example of that.

5851
03:13:56,790 --> 03:14:00,060
They basically said, okay, we're gonna rebuild the thing

5852
03:14:00,060 --> 03:14:01,590
with AI as the first citizen.

5853
03:14:01,590 --> 03:14:04,232
- What if we knew from scratch that we could build on this?

5854
03:14:04,232 --> 03:14:05,310
And again, this is like, this is part

5855
03:14:05,310 --> 03:14:08,250
of the Full Employment Act for startups and VCs is,

5856
03:14:08,250 --> 03:14:11,550
it just like if a technology transformation

5857
03:14:11,550 --> 03:14:12,900
is sufficiently powerful,

5858
03:14:12,900 --> 03:14:13,733
then you actually need

5859
03:14:13,733 --> 03:14:16,080
to start the product development process over from scratch,

5860
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:17,550
'cause you need to reconceptualize the product,

5861
03:14:17,550 --> 03:14:20,550
and then usually what that means is you need a new company

5862
03:14:20,550 --> 03:14:22,650
'cause most incumbents just won't do that.

5863
03:14:23,720 --> 03:14:24,553
And so, yeah.

5864
03:14:24,553 --> 03:14:25,860
So that's underway across many categories.

5865
03:14:25,860 --> 03:14:28,380
What I'm waiting for is the company where it's like,

5866
03:14:28,380 --> 03:14:31,500
no, our org chart is redesigned as a result of AI, right?

5867
03:14:31,500 --> 03:14:33,330
So I'm looking at, I'm waiting for the company

5868
03:14:33,330 --> 03:14:36,120
where it's like, no, we're gonna have, like, you know,

5869
03:14:36,120 --> 03:14:38,550
and the cliche, here's a thought experiment, right?

5870
03:14:38,550 --> 03:14:39,810
The cliche would be we're gonna have

5871
03:14:39,810 --> 03:14:41,250
like the human executive team,

5872
03:14:41,250 --> 03:14:42,930
and then we're gonna have the theis be the workers, right?

5873
03:14:42,930 --> 03:14:45,970
So we'll have a VP of engineering supervising 100 instances

5874
03:14:47,041 --> 03:14:48,090
of coding agents, right?

5875
03:14:48,090 --> 03:14:50,160
Okay, maybe, right by the way,

5876
03:14:50,160 --> 03:14:53,553
or maybe the VP of engineering should be the AI,

5877
03:14:54,570 --> 03:14:56,100
maybe supervising human coders

5878
03:14:56,100 --> 03:14:57,750
who are supervising AIs, right?

5879
03:14:57,750 --> 03:15:00,060
'Cause one of the things that AI should be pretty good at

5880
03:15:00,060 --> 03:15:02,643
is managing 'cause it's like not, you know,

5881
03:15:02,643 --> 03:15:04,980
it's like a process-driven, it's the kind of thing

5882
03:15:04,980 --> 03:15:06,510
that AI's actually pretty good at, right?

5883
03:15:06,510 --> 03:15:08,160
Performance evaluation, coaching.

5884
03:15:09,228 --> 03:15:11,373
And so should it be an AI executive team?

5885
03:15:12,685 --> 03:15:13,860
You know, and then, of course, the ultimate question,

5886
03:15:13,860 --> 03:15:16,923
which is AI CEO, right?

5887
03:15:18,201 --> 03:15:20,190
You know, and then maybe the most futuristic version

5888
03:15:20,190 --> 03:15:22,020
of it would be an actual AI agent

5889
03:15:22,020 --> 03:15:23,880
that actually goes fully autonomous.

5890
03:15:23,880 --> 03:15:25,650
Yeah, what if you really set one of these things loose

5891
03:15:25,650 --> 03:15:27,903
and let it basically build itself a business?

5892
03:15:28,939 --> 03:15:31,380
And so I will say like we're not yet seeing those,

5893
03:15:31,380 --> 03:15:33,480
and I think there's a little bit of,

5894
03:15:33,480 --> 03:15:35,850
the systems aren't quite ready for that yet.

5895
03:15:35,850 --> 03:15:37,500
And then I think it's a little bit of,

5896
03:15:37,500 --> 03:15:39,180
you really do need, at that point,

5897
03:15:39,180 --> 03:15:40,500
like a founder who's really willing

5898
03:15:40,500 --> 03:15:44,699
to break all the rules and really willing to take the swing.

5899
03:15:44,699 --> 03:15:46,620
And those people exist, and so I'm sure we'll see that.

5900
03:15:46,620 --> 03:15:49,500
- And some of it is, as you know, with all the startups,

5901
03:15:49,500 --> 03:15:50,460
this is the execution.

5902
03:15:50,460 --> 03:15:54,810
The idea that you have a AI-first email client,

5903
03:15:54,810 --> 03:15:55,950
seems like an obvious idea,

5904
03:15:55,950 --> 03:15:58,860
but actually creating one, executing it,

5905
03:15:58,860 --> 03:16:01,890
and then taking on Gmail is really difficult.

5906
03:16:01,890 --> 03:16:02,940
I mean, Gmail,

5907
03:16:02,940 --> 03:16:07,173
it's fascinating to see Google can't do it, because why?

5908
03:16:08,445 --> 03:16:09,278
Because of momentum,

5909
03:16:09,278 --> 03:16:12,459
because it's hard to re-engineer the entirety of the system.

5910
03:16:12,459 --> 03:16:15,240
'Cause feels like Google's perfectly positioned to do it.

5911
03:16:15,240 --> 03:16:19,680
Same with like, you have Perplexity, which I love,

5912
03:16:19,680 --> 03:16:22,020
like Google could technically take on Perplexity

5913
03:16:22,020 --> 03:16:25,260
and do it much better, but they haven't, not yet.

5914
03:16:25,260 --> 03:16:29,207
So it's fascinating why that is for large companies.

5915
03:16:29,207 --> 03:16:31,470
I mean that is an advantage for little tech,

5916
03:16:31,470 --> 03:16:33,150
they could be agile.

5917
03:16:33,150 --> 03:16:34,860
- Yeah, that's right. - They can move fast.

5918
03:16:34,860 --> 03:16:35,693
- Yeah.

5919
03:16:35,693 --> 03:16:36,526
Little companies can break glass

5920
03:16:36,526 --> 03:16:38,070
in a way big companies can't- - Right.

5921
03:16:38,070 --> 03:16:39,300
- This is sort of the big breakthrough

5922
03:16:39,300 --> 03:16:41,340
that Clay Christensen had in "The Innovator's Dilemma,"

5923
03:16:41,340 --> 03:16:43,500
which is sometimes when big companies don't do things,

5924
03:16:43,500 --> 03:16:44,730
it's because they're screwing up.

5925
03:16:44,730 --> 03:16:46,230
And that certainly happens.

5926
03:16:46,230 --> 03:16:47,850
But a lot of times they don't do things

5927
03:16:47,850 --> 03:16:49,140
because it would break too much glass.

5928
03:16:49,140 --> 03:16:50,240
It would specifically,

5929
03:16:51,278 --> 03:16:52,950
it would interfere with their existing customers

5930
03:16:52,950 --> 03:16:54,360
and their existing businesses.

5931
03:16:54,360 --> 03:16:55,500
And they just simply won't do that.

5932
03:16:55,500 --> 03:16:59,640
And by the way, responsibly, they shouldn't do that, right?

5933
03:16:59,640 --> 03:17:01,373
And so they just get,

5934
03:17:01,373 --> 03:17:02,970
this is Clay Christensen's big thing

5935
03:17:02,970 --> 03:17:04,890
is they often don't adapt

5936
03:17:04,890 --> 03:17:07,500
because they're well-run, not because they're poorly run.

5937
03:17:07,500 --> 03:17:09,680
But they're optimizing machines.

5938
03:17:09,680 --> 03:17:12,050
They're optimizing against the existing business.

5939
03:17:12,050 --> 03:17:13,590
And as you kind of just said,

5940
03:17:13,590 --> 03:17:15,270
this is like a permanent state of affairs

5941
03:17:15,270 --> 03:17:16,920
for large organizations.

5942
03:17:16,920 --> 03:17:18,000
Like every once in a while,

5943
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:19,530
one breaks the pattern and actually does it.

5944
03:17:19,530 --> 03:17:20,430
But for the most part,

5945
03:17:20,430 --> 03:17:22,560
like this is a very predictable form of human behavior,

5946
03:17:22,560 --> 03:17:24,810
and this fundamentally is why startups exist.

5947
03:17:26,010 --> 03:17:28,800
- It feels like 2025 is when the race for dominance

5948
03:17:28,800 --> 03:17:31,410
in AI will see some winners.

5949
03:17:31,410 --> 03:17:32,970
Like, it's a big year.

5950
03:17:32,970 --> 03:17:35,059
So who do you think wins the race?

5951
03:17:35,059 --> 03:17:37,947
OpenAI, Meta, Google, xAI.

5952
03:17:37,947 --> 03:17:39,150
Who do you think wins the AI race?

5953
03:17:39,150 --> 03:17:40,410
- I would say, I'm not gonna predict,

5954
03:17:40,410 --> 03:17:43,080
I'm gonna say there's questions all over the place.

5955
03:17:43,080 --> 03:17:44,820
And then we have this category question we call

5956
03:17:44,820 --> 03:17:46,410
the trillion-dollar question, which is like,

5957
03:17:46,410 --> 03:17:48,210
literally depending on how it's answered,

5958
03:17:48,210 --> 03:17:49,650
people make or lose a trillion dollars,

5959
03:17:49,650 --> 03:17:51,240
and I think there's like, I don't know,

5960
03:17:51,240 --> 03:17:53,700
5 or $6 trillion questions right now

5961
03:17:53,700 --> 03:17:54,533
that are hanging out there,

5962
03:17:54,533 --> 03:17:56,260
which is an unusually large number.

5963
03:17:56,260 --> 03:17:57,093
- [Lex] Yeah.

5964
03:17:57,093 --> 03:17:57,957
- And I'll just hit a few of them

5965
03:17:57,957 --> 03:17:58,980
and we can talk about them.

5966
03:17:58,980 --> 03:18:01,260
So one is big models versus small models.

5967
03:18:01,260 --> 03:18:03,630
Another is open models versus closed models.

5968
03:18:03,630 --> 03:18:06,900
Another is whether you can use synthetic data or not.

5969
03:18:06,900 --> 03:18:08,310
Another is chain of thought.

5970
03:18:08,310 --> 03:18:09,720
How far can you push that?

5971
03:18:09,720 --> 03:18:11,130
And reinforcement learning.

5972
03:18:11,130 --> 03:18:14,580
And then another one is political trillion-dollar questions.

5973
03:18:14,580 --> 03:18:16,350
You know, policy questions, which, you know,

5974
03:18:16,350 --> 03:18:19,377
the US and the EU have both been flunking dramatically

5975
03:18:19,377 --> 03:18:22,113
and the US hopefully is about to really succeed at.

5976
03:18:23,640 --> 03:18:24,900
Yeah, and then there's probably another, you know,

5977
03:18:24,900 --> 03:18:26,417
half dozen big important questions after that.

5978
03:18:26,417 --> 03:18:30,120
And so these are all just like, say, this is an industry

5979
03:18:30,120 --> 03:18:33,210
that's in flux in a way that I even more dramatic,

5980
03:18:33,210 --> 03:18:35,430
I think, than the ones I've seen before.

5981
03:18:35,430 --> 03:18:37,530
And look, the most obvious example of the flux

5982
03:18:37,530 --> 03:18:41,070
is you know, sitting here less than three years ago,

5983
03:18:41,070 --> 03:18:43,080
sitting here in December of '22,

5984
03:18:43,080 --> 03:18:44,000
we would've said that OpenAI

5985
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:46,560
is just running away with everything.

5986
03:18:46,560 --> 03:18:48,240
And sitting here today, it's like, you know,

5987
03:18:48,240 --> 03:18:49,680
there's at least six, you know,

5988
03:18:49,680 --> 03:18:51,660
world-class God model companies

5989
03:18:51,660 --> 03:18:54,000
and teams that are, by the way,

5990
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:56,070
generating remarkably similar results.

5991
03:18:56,070 --> 03:18:57,810
That's actually been one of the most shocking things to me,

5992
03:18:57,810 --> 03:19:00,180
is like, it turns out that once you know that it's possible

5993
03:19:00,180 --> 03:19:03,450
to build one incredibly smart Turning-test-passing

5994
03:19:03,450 --> 03:19:05,490
large language model, which was a complete shock

5995
03:19:05,490 --> 03:19:08,610
and surprise to the world, it turns out within, you know,

5996
03:19:08,610 --> 03:19:10,980
a year, you can have five more.

5997
03:19:10,980 --> 03:19:12,450
There's also a money component thing to it,

5998
03:19:12,450 --> 03:19:15,390
which is to get the money to scale one of these things

5999
03:19:15,390 --> 03:19:16,380
into the billions of dollars.

6000
03:19:16,380 --> 03:19:18,300
There's basically right now only two sources of money

6001
03:19:18,300 --> 03:19:19,320
that will do that for you.

6002
03:19:19,320 --> 03:19:22,020
One is the hyperscalers giving you the money,

6003
03:19:22,020 --> 03:19:24,450
which you turn around and roundtrip back to them.

6004
03:19:24,450 --> 03:19:26,940
Or, you know, foreign sovereigns, other, you know,

6005
03:19:26,940 --> 03:19:29,280
country sovereign wealth funds, which can be,

6006
03:19:29,280 --> 03:19:32,230
you know, difficult in some cases, for companies to access.

6007
03:19:33,660 --> 03:19:36,300
So there's maybe another trillion-dollar question

6008
03:19:36,300 --> 03:19:38,040
is the financing question.

6009
03:19:38,040 --> 03:19:38,880
Here's one.

6010
03:19:38,880 --> 03:19:40,500
So Sam Altman has been public about the fact

6011
03:19:40,500 --> 03:19:41,820
that he wants to transition OpenAI

6012
03:19:41,820 --> 03:19:43,970
from being a nonprofit, being a for-profit.

6013
03:19:44,820 --> 03:19:46,530
The way that is legally done

6014
03:19:46,530 --> 03:19:48,180
is that, and there is a way to do it.

6015
03:19:48,180 --> 03:19:50,400
There is a way in US law to do it.

6016
03:19:50,400 --> 03:19:52,680
The IRS and and other legal entities,

6017
03:19:52,680 --> 03:19:54,270
government entities, scrutinizes very carefully,

6018
03:19:54,270 --> 03:19:57,480
'cause the US takes foundation nonprofit law very seriously

6019
03:19:57,480 --> 03:19:58,930
because of the tax exemption.

6020
03:20:00,178 --> 03:20:01,290
And so the way that historically,

6021
03:20:01,290 --> 03:20:03,240
the way that you do it is you start a for-profit

6022
03:20:03,240 --> 03:20:05,670
and then you raise money with the for-profit

6023
03:20:05,670 --> 03:20:08,470
to buy the assets of the nonprofit at fair market value.

6024
03:20:09,720 --> 03:20:13,059
And, you know, the last financing round at OpenAI was,

6025
03:20:13,059 --> 03:20:14,490
you know, 150 some billion dollars.

6026
03:20:14,490 --> 03:20:18,210
And so logically, if the flip is going to happen,

6027
03:20:18,210 --> 03:20:20,477
the for-profit has to go raise $150 billion

6028
03:20:20,477 --> 03:20:23,070
out of the chute to buy the assets.

6029
03:20:23,070 --> 03:20:25,773
You know, raising 150 billion is a challenge.

6030
03:20:27,360 --> 03:20:28,980
So, you know, is that even possible?

6031
03:20:28,980 --> 03:20:31,560
If that is possible, then OpenAI maybe is off to the races

6032
03:20:31,560 --> 03:20:32,580
as a for-profit company.

6033
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:34,467
If not, you know, I don't know.

6034
03:20:34,467 --> 03:20:37,320
And then, you know, obviously the Elon lawsuit.

6035
03:20:37,320 --> 03:20:38,970
So just because they're the market leader today, you know,

6036
03:20:38,970 --> 03:20:41,040
there's big important questions there.

6037
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:43,110
You know, Microsoft has this kind of love-hate relationship

6038
03:20:43,110 --> 03:20:43,943
with them.

6039
03:20:43,943 --> 03:20:44,776
Where does that go?

6040
03:20:44,776 --> 03:20:46,800
Apple's, you know, lagging badly behind,

6041
03:20:46,800 --> 03:20:48,420
but you know, they're very good at catching up.

6042
03:20:48,420 --> 03:20:50,880
Amazon, you know, is primarily hyperscaler,

6043
03:20:50,880 --> 03:20:52,530
but they now have their own models.

6044
03:20:52,530 --> 03:20:53,730
- And then there's the other questions,

6045
03:20:53,730 --> 03:20:54,930
like you laid out brilliantly,

6046
03:20:54,930 --> 03:20:58,230
briefly and brilliantly, open versus closed,

6047
03:20:58,230 --> 03:21:00,480
big versus little models, synthetic data.

6048
03:21:00,480 --> 03:21:02,310
That's a huge, huge question.

6049
03:21:02,310 --> 03:21:06,000
And then test on compute with chain of thought.

6050
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:06,833
They're all of that.

6051
03:21:06,833 --> 03:21:08,190
And it's just fascinating.

6052
03:21:08,190 --> 03:21:09,510
And these are,

6053
03:21:09,510 --> 03:21:11,400
I think it's fair to say, trillion-dollar questions.

6054
03:21:11,400 --> 03:21:13,680
- Yeah, these are big, like look, you know, it's like,

6055
03:21:13,680 --> 03:21:14,513
okay, here's a trillion-dollar question,

6056
03:21:14,513 --> 03:21:15,346
which is kind of embedded in that,

6057
03:21:15,346 --> 03:21:16,920
which is just hallucinations, right?

6058
03:21:16,920 --> 03:21:20,310
Like, so if you are trying to use these tools creatively,

6059
03:21:20,310 --> 03:21:22,770
you're thrilled because they can draw new images

6060
03:21:22,770 --> 03:21:23,820
and they can make new music

6061
03:21:23,820 --> 03:21:26,280
and they can do all this incredible stuff, right?

6062
03:21:26,280 --> 03:21:27,113
They're creative.

6063
03:21:27,113 --> 03:21:29,070
The flip side of that is if you need them to be correct,

6064
03:21:29,070 --> 03:21:30,240
they can't be creative.

6065
03:21:30,240 --> 03:21:32,640
And that's, you know, the term hallucination.

6066
03:21:32,640 --> 03:21:34,470
And these things do hallucinate.

6067
03:21:34,470 --> 03:21:38,190
And you know, there have been, you know, court cases already

6068
03:21:38,190 --> 03:21:39,840
where lawyers have submitted legal briefs

6069
03:21:39,840 --> 03:21:42,720
that contain made-up court citations, case citations.

6070
03:21:42,720 --> 03:21:44,550
The judge is like, "Wait a minute, this doesn't exist."

6071
03:21:44,550 --> 03:21:47,250
And the very next is, "Did you write this yourself?"

6072
03:21:47,250 --> 03:21:49,920
And the lawyer goes, "Er-" (laughs)

6073
03:21:49,920 --> 03:21:51,422
- I mean that's why with Elon,

6074
03:21:51,422 --> 03:21:52,830
with Grok- - Yes.

6075
03:21:52,830 --> 03:21:53,730
- Looking for truth.

6076
03:21:53,730 --> 03:21:56,610
I mean, that's an open technical question.

6077
03:21:56,610 --> 03:21:58,830
How close can you get to truth with LLMs?

6078
03:21:58,830 --> 03:22:00,057
- Yeah, that's right.

6079
03:22:00,057 --> 03:22:03,540
And my sense is this very contentious topic at the industry,

6080
03:22:03,540 --> 03:22:06,823
my sense is if to the extent

6081
03:22:06,823 --> 03:22:08,520
that there is a domain in which there is a definitive

6082
03:22:08,520 --> 03:22:10,020
and checkable provable answer,

6083
03:22:10,020 --> 03:22:11,970
and you might say, math satisfies that,

6084
03:22:11,970 --> 03:22:12,803
coding satisfies that,

6085
03:22:12,803 --> 03:22:14,250
and maybe some other fields,

6086
03:22:14,250 --> 03:22:17,040
then you should be able to generate synthetic data.

6087
03:22:17,040 --> 03:22:18,540
You should be able to do chain of thought reasoning.

6088
03:22:18,540 --> 03:22:19,890
You should be able to do reinforcement learning,

6089
03:22:19,890 --> 03:22:21,480
and you should be able to ultimately, you know,

6090
03:22:21,480 --> 03:22:22,730
eliminate hallucinations.

6091
03:22:24,990 --> 03:22:25,823
But by the way,

6092
03:22:25,823 --> 03:22:26,656
that's a trillion-dollar question right there

6093
03:22:26,656 --> 03:22:28,230
as to whether that's true.

6094
03:22:28,230 --> 03:22:29,570
But then there's question of like, okay,

6095
03:22:29,570 --> 03:22:31,980
is that gonna work in the more general domain?

6096
03:22:31,980 --> 03:22:34,140
Like, so for example, one possibility is these things

6097
03:22:34,140 --> 03:22:36,420
are gonna get truly superhuman like math and coding.

6098
03:22:36,420 --> 03:22:40,290
But at like discussing philosophy, they're gonna just,

6099
03:22:40,290 --> 03:22:42,300
they're basically as smart as they're ever gonna be.

6100
03:22:42,300 --> 03:22:44,310
And they're gonna be kind of, you know,

6101
03:22:44,310 --> 03:22:46,320
say mid-wit grad student level.

6102
03:22:46,320 --> 03:22:47,760
And the theory there would just be

6103
03:22:47,760 --> 03:22:48,900
they're already outta training data.

6104
03:22:48,900 --> 03:22:51,187
Like they literally, if, you know,

6105
03:22:51,187 --> 03:22:52,980
you talk to these people, like literally the big models,

6106
03:22:52,980 --> 03:22:54,960
the big models are like within a factor of 2X

6107
03:22:54,960 --> 03:22:57,000
of consuming all the human-generated training data

6108
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:57,833
to the point that some

6109
03:22:57,833 --> 03:22:59,610
of these big companies are literally hiring people

6110
03:22:59,610 --> 03:23:00,660
like doctors and lawyers to sit

6111
03:23:00,660 --> 03:23:02,610
and write new training data by hand.

6112
03:23:02,610 --> 03:23:04,290
And so does this mean that like you have to,

6113
03:23:04,290 --> 03:23:05,850
if you want your model to better philosophy,

6114
03:23:05,850 --> 03:23:07,410
you have to go hire like a thousand philosophers

6115
03:23:07,410 --> 03:23:08,520
and have them write new content,

6116
03:23:08,520 --> 03:23:10,650
and is anybody gonna do that?

6117
03:23:10,650 --> 03:23:11,760
And so, you know,

6118
03:23:11,760 --> 03:23:13,470
maybe these things are topping out in certain ways

6119
03:23:13,470 --> 03:23:15,600
and they're gonna leap way ahead in other ways.

6120
03:23:15,600 --> 03:23:19,358
And so anyway, so we just don't, you know, this is...

6121
03:23:19,358 --> 03:23:21,750
Actually, maybe my main main conclusion is,

6122
03:23:21,750 --> 03:23:22,860
anybody telling, you know,

6123
03:23:22,860 --> 03:23:25,440
anybody telling you these big sweeping conclusions,

6124
03:23:25,440 --> 03:23:26,580
you know, this whole super, you know,

6125
03:23:26,580 --> 03:23:28,800
all of these abstract generalized super intelligence

6126
03:23:28,800 --> 03:23:29,670
AGI stuff like,

6127
03:23:29,670 --> 03:23:31,620
you know, maybe it's the engineer in me,

6128
03:23:31,620 --> 03:23:32,813
but like, no, like,

6129
03:23:34,540 --> 03:23:37,563
that's to abstract like, it's gotta actually work.

6130
03:23:39,195 --> 03:23:40,028
And then by the way,

6131
03:23:40,028 --> 03:23:41,723
it has to actually have to be able to pay for it.

6132
03:23:42,690 --> 03:23:44,820
I mean, this is a problem right now with the, you know,

6133
03:23:44,820 --> 03:23:46,650
the big models that are like really good at coding and math,

6134
03:23:46,650 --> 03:23:49,020
they're like actually very expensive to run, you know,

6135
03:23:49,020 --> 03:23:49,970
they're quite slow.

6136
03:23:51,360 --> 03:23:53,700
Another trillion-dollar question, future chips,

6137
03:23:53,700 --> 03:23:55,830
which I know you've talked a lot about.

6138
03:23:55,830 --> 03:23:57,960
Another trillion-dollar question,

6139
03:23:57,960 --> 03:23:59,760
yeah, I mean, all the global issue.

6140
03:23:59,760 --> 03:24:03,510
Oh, another trillion-dollar question censorship, right?

6141
03:24:03,510 --> 03:24:07,116
Like, and all the, as they say,

6142
03:24:07,116 --> 03:24:09,573
all the human feedback training process.

6143
03:24:10,440 --> 03:24:11,760
Exactly, what are you training these things to do?

6144
03:24:11,760 --> 03:24:13,560
What are they allowed to talk about?

6145
03:24:14,700 --> 03:24:16,230
How long did they give you these...

6146
03:24:16,230 --> 03:24:17,431
How often do they give you

6147
03:24:17,431 --> 03:24:19,531
these incredibly preaching moral lectures?

6148
03:24:21,420 --> 03:24:22,410
Here's a trillion-dollar question.

6149
03:24:22,410 --> 03:24:25,200
How many other countries want their country

6150
03:24:25,200 --> 03:24:28,530
to run its education system, healthcare system, new system,

6151
03:24:28,530 --> 03:24:30,150
political system, on the basis of an AI

6152
03:24:30,150 --> 03:24:31,050
that's been trained according

6153
03:24:31,050 --> 03:24:36,030
to the most extreme left-wing California politics, right?

6154
03:24:36,030 --> 03:24:38,162
'Cause that's kind of what they have on offer right now.

6155
03:24:38,162 --> 03:24:40,470
And I think the answer to that is not very many.

6156
03:24:40,470 --> 03:24:44,070
So there's like massive open questions there about

6157
03:24:44,070 --> 03:24:46,530
like what, you know, and by the way, like what morality

6158
03:24:46,530 --> 03:24:48,810
of these things are gonna get trained on as a-

6159
03:24:48,810 --> 03:24:51,960
- And that one we're cracking wide open

6160
03:24:51,960 --> 03:24:55,140
with what's been happening over the past few months.

6161
03:24:55,140 --> 03:24:58,320
Censorship on every level of these companies,

6162
03:24:58,320 --> 03:25:01,140
and just the very idea what truth means

6163
03:25:01,140 --> 03:25:04,980
and what it means to be expand the Overton window of LLMs

6164
03:25:04,980 --> 03:25:08,040
or the Overton window of human discourse.

6165
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:09,227
- So what I experienced, you know, going back

6166
03:25:09,227 --> 03:25:11,280
to how we started, what I experienced was, all right,

6167
03:25:11,280 --> 03:25:13,330
social media censorship regime from hell,

6168
03:25:14,164 --> 03:25:17,100
debanking at like large scale,

6169
03:25:17,100 --> 03:25:20,850
and then the war on the crypto industry, trying to kill it.

6170
03:25:20,850 --> 03:25:22,980
And then basically declared intent to do the same thing

6171
03:25:22,980 --> 03:25:26,460
to AI and to put AI under the same kind of censorship

6172
03:25:26,460 --> 03:25:29,430
and control regime as social media and the banks.

6173
03:25:29,430 --> 03:25:32,340
And I think this election tipped, in America,

6174
03:25:32,340 --> 03:25:34,920
I think this election tipped us from a timeline

6175
03:25:34,920 --> 03:25:37,320
in which things were going to get really bad on that front

6176
03:25:37,320 --> 03:25:38,153
to a timeline in which I think things

6177
03:25:38,153 --> 03:25:40,020
are gonna be quite good.

6178
03:25:40,020 --> 03:25:42,450
But look, those same questions also apply outside the US

6179
03:25:42,450 --> 03:25:45,116
and you know, the EU is doing their thing,

6180
03:25:45,116 --> 03:25:46,890
they're being extremely draconian

6181
03:25:46,890 --> 03:25:48,930
and they're trying to lock in a political censorship regime

6182
03:25:48,930 --> 03:25:50,610
on AI right now that's so harsh

6183
03:25:50,610 --> 03:25:52,260
that even American AI companies are not even willing

6184
03:25:52,260 --> 03:25:55,080
to launch new products in the EU right now.

6185
03:25:55,080 --> 03:25:56,220
Like, that's not gonna last,

6186
03:25:56,220 --> 03:25:58,170
but like, what happens there, right?

6187
03:25:58,170 --> 03:25:59,610
And what are the trade-offs?

6188
03:25:59,610 --> 03:26:01,140
You know, what levels of censorship

6189
03:26:01,140 --> 03:26:03,000
are American companies gonna have to sign up for

6190
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:04,260
if they wanna operate in the EU?

6191
03:26:04,260 --> 03:26:05,790
Or is the EU still capable

6192
03:26:05,790 --> 03:26:08,100
of generating its own AI companies

6193
03:26:08,100 --> 03:26:12,900
or have we brain drained them, (laughs) so that they can't?

6194
03:26:12,900 --> 03:26:14,133
So big questions.

6195
03:26:15,660 --> 03:26:16,500
- Quick questions.

6196
03:26:16,500 --> 03:26:18,210
So you're very active on X.

6197
03:26:18,210 --> 03:26:20,283
A very unique character,

6198
03:26:22,770 --> 03:26:25,953
flamboyant, exciting, bold.

6199
03:26:26,820 --> 03:26:28,170
You post a lot.

6200
03:26:28,170 --> 03:26:30,570
I think there's a meme, I don't remember it exactly,

6201
03:26:30,570 --> 03:26:34,440
but that Elon posted something like inside Elon,

6202
03:26:34,440 --> 03:26:35,700
there are two wolves.

6203
03:26:35,700 --> 03:26:38,910
One is please be kind or more positive.

6204
03:26:38,910 --> 03:26:42,153
And the other one is, I think, you know, doing the,

6205
03:26:43,560 --> 03:26:46,593
I take a big step back and fuck yourself in the face guy.

6206
03:26:47,610 --> 03:26:51,060
How many wolves are inside your mind when you're tweeting?

6207
03:26:51,060 --> 03:26:52,140
- To be clear,

6208
03:26:52,140 --> 03:26:54,067
a reference from the comedy classic "Tropic Thunder."

6209
03:26:54,067 --> 03:26:55,590
- "Tropic Thunder," yeah.

6210
03:26:55,590 --> 03:26:56,423
Legendary movie.

6211
03:26:56,423 --> 03:26:59,370
- Yes. (Lex laughing)

6212
03:26:59,370 --> 03:27:01,380
Any Zoomers listening to this who haven't seen

6213
03:27:01,380 --> 03:27:02,850
that movie, go watch it immediately.

6214
03:27:02,850 --> 03:27:04,440
- Yeah, there's nothing offensive about it.

6215
03:27:04,440 --> 03:27:06,240
- Nothing offensive about it at all.

6216
03:27:08,310 --> 03:27:10,785
So Tom Cruise's greatest performance.

6217
03:27:10,785 --> 03:27:13,050
(Lex laughing)

6218
03:27:13,050 --> 03:27:14,243
So- - Yeah.

6219
03:27:15,120 --> 03:27:17,010
- Yeah, no, look, I should start by saying like,

6220
03:27:17,010 --> 03:27:19,260
I'm not supposed to be tweeting at all, so-

6221
03:27:19,260 --> 03:27:20,736
- Yeah. - Yes, yes, yes.

6222
03:27:20,736 --> 03:27:22,702
So, but, you know.

6223
03:27:22,702 --> 03:27:24,055
- So how do you approach that?

6224
03:27:24,055 --> 03:27:25,830
Like how do you approach what to tweet?

6225
03:27:25,830 --> 03:27:30,180
- I mean, I don't.

6226
03:27:30,180 --> 03:27:31,380
I don't well enough.

6227
03:27:31,380 --> 03:27:34,020
It's mostly an exercise in frustration.

6228
03:27:34,020 --> 03:27:35,157
Look, there's a glory to it

6229
03:27:35,157 --> 03:27:37,320
and there's an issue with it, and the glory of it is like,

6230
03:27:37,320 --> 03:27:40,710
you know, instantaneous global communication, you know,

6231
03:27:40,710 --> 03:27:42,120
X in particular is, you know,

6232
03:27:42,120 --> 03:27:44,040
the town square on all these, you know, social issues,

6233
03:27:44,040 --> 03:27:46,980
political issues, everything else, current events.

6234
03:27:46,980 --> 03:27:48,600
But I mean, look, there's no question of the format.

6235
03:27:48,600 --> 03:27:50,670
The format of at least the original tweet is,

6236
03:27:50,670 --> 03:27:52,650
you know, prone to be inflammatory.

6237
03:27:52,650 --> 03:27:54,495
You know, I'm the guy who at one point,

6238
03:27:54,495 --> 03:27:57,060
the entire nation of India hated me

6239
03:27:57,060 --> 03:27:58,080
because I was tweeted something.

6240
03:27:58,080 --> 03:28:00,510
It turned out that it's still politically sensitive

6241
03:28:00,510 --> 03:28:01,980
in the entire continent.

6242
03:28:01,980 --> 03:28:03,540
I stayed up all night that night

6243
03:28:03,540 --> 03:28:05,070
as I became front page headline

6244
03:28:05,070 --> 03:28:08,400
and leading television news in each time zone in India

6245
03:28:08,400 --> 03:28:09,233
for a single tweet.

6246
03:28:09,233 --> 03:28:11,370
So like, the single tweet outta context

6247
03:28:11,370 --> 03:28:12,670
is a very dangerous thing.

6248
03:28:13,800 --> 03:28:17,670
Obviously, X now has the middle ground where they,

6249
03:28:17,670 --> 03:28:20,070
you know, they now have the longer form essays.

6250
03:28:20,070 --> 03:28:21,960
And so, you know, probably the most productive thing

6251
03:28:21,960 --> 03:28:25,563
I can do is longer form things.

6252
03:28:26,670 --> 03:28:27,930
- You're not gonna do it though, are you?

6253
03:28:27,930 --> 03:28:29,163
- [Marc] I do, I do, from time-to-time. I do.

6254
03:28:29,163 --> 03:28:30,870
- Sometimes. - I should do more of them.

6255
03:28:30,870 --> 03:28:32,217
And then, yeah, I mean, look, but, and yeah,

6256
03:28:32,217 --> 03:28:34,050
and obviously, X is doing great.

6257
03:28:34,050 --> 03:28:35,940
And then, like I said, like Substack, you know,

6258
03:28:35,940 --> 03:28:38,070
has become the center for a lot, you know, a lot of the,

6259
03:28:38,070 --> 03:28:40,380
I think the best kind of, you know, deeply thought

6260
03:28:40,380 --> 03:28:44,010
through, you know, certainly intellectual content, you know,

6261
03:28:44,010 --> 03:28:46,680
tons of current events stuff there as well.

6262
03:28:46,680 --> 03:28:48,148
And then, yeah, so,

6263
03:28:48,148 --> 03:28:49,110
and then there's a bunch of other, you know,

6264
03:28:49,110 --> 03:28:50,370
a bunch of new systems that are very exciting.

6265
03:28:50,370 --> 03:28:52,020
So I think one of the things we can look forward

6266
03:28:52,020 --> 03:28:53,340
to in the next four years is number one,

6267
03:28:53,340 --> 03:28:56,160
just like a massive reinvigoration of social media

6268
03:28:56,160 --> 03:28:57,270
as a consequence of the changes

6269
03:28:57,270 --> 03:28:58,320
that are happening right now.

6270
03:28:58,320 --> 03:29:00,002
I'm very excited

6271
03:29:00,002 --> 03:29:02,300
to see what's gonna happen with that.

6272
03:29:02,300 --> 03:29:03,133
And it's happened on X,

6273
03:29:03,133 --> 03:29:05,760
but it's now gonna happen on other platforms.

6274
03:29:05,760 --> 03:29:07,110
And then the other

6275
03:29:07,110 --> 03:29:10,950
is crypto's gonna come right back to life.

6276
03:29:10,950 --> 03:29:12,930
And actually that's very exciting, actually,

6277
03:29:12,930 --> 03:29:13,763
that's worth noting

6278
03:29:13,763 --> 03:29:15,450
is that's another trillion-dollar question on AI,

6279
03:29:15,450 --> 03:29:18,900
which is in a world of pervasive AI,

6280
03:29:18,900 --> 03:29:20,490
and especially in a world of AI agents,

6281
03:29:20,490 --> 03:29:21,630
and imagine a world of billions

6282
03:29:21,630 --> 03:29:23,520
or trillions of AI agents running around,

6283
03:29:23,520 --> 03:29:24,753
they need an economy.

6284
03:29:25,920 --> 03:29:27,960
And crypto, in our view,

6285
03:29:27,960 --> 03:29:29,747
happens to be the ideal economic system for that, right?

6286
03:29:29,747 --> 03:29:31,320
'Cause it's a programmable money,

6287
03:29:31,320 --> 03:29:33,420
it's a very easy way to plug in and do that.

6288
03:29:33,420 --> 03:29:35,100
And there's this transaction processing system

6289
03:29:35,100 --> 03:29:35,933
that can do that.

6290
03:29:35,933 --> 03:29:38,400
And so I think the crypto AI intersection, you know,

6291
03:29:38,400 --> 03:29:40,293
is potentially a very, very big deal.

6292
03:29:41,490 --> 03:29:45,060
And so that was gonna be impossible under the prior regime,

6293
03:29:45,060 --> 03:29:46,200
and I think under the new regime,

6294
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:48,330
hopefully, it'll be something we can do.

6295
03:29:48,330 --> 03:29:49,230
- Almost for fun.

6296
03:29:49,230 --> 03:29:52,140
Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun,

6297
03:29:52,140 --> 03:29:55,121
what are your top 10 favorite things about Yann LeCun?

6298
03:29:55,121 --> 03:29:57,450
(Marc laughing)

6299
03:29:57,450 --> 03:30:00,540
I think he's a brilliant guy.

6300
03:30:00,540 --> 03:30:01,463
I think he's important to the world.

6301
03:30:01,463 --> 03:30:04,800
I think you guys disagree on a lot of things,

6302
03:30:04,800 --> 03:30:07,200
but I personally like vigorous disagreement.

6303
03:30:07,200 --> 03:30:09,150
I, as a person in the stands,

6304
03:30:09,150 --> 03:30:12,544
like to watch the gladiators go at it, and-

6305
03:30:12,544 --> 03:30:13,377
- No, he's a super genius.

6306
03:30:13,377 --> 03:30:15,180
I mean, look, I wouldn't say we're super close,

6307
03:30:15,180 --> 03:30:16,440
but you know, casual friends.

6308
03:30:16,440 --> 03:30:17,560
I worked with him at Meta, you know,

6309
03:30:17,560 --> 03:30:19,890
he is the chief scientist at Meta for a long time

6310
03:30:19,890 --> 03:30:21,743
and is still, you know, works with us.

6311
03:30:24,193 --> 03:30:25,890
And obviously is a legendary figure in the field

6312
03:30:25,890 --> 03:30:29,100
and one of the main people responsible for what's happening.

6313
03:30:29,100 --> 03:30:30,270
My serious observation would be

6314
03:30:30,270 --> 03:30:33,420
that it's the thing I keep, I've talked to him about

6315
03:30:33,420 --> 03:30:34,800
for a long time, and I keep trying to read

6316
03:30:34,800 --> 03:30:38,880
and follow everything he does is he's probably, he is the,

6317
03:30:38,880 --> 03:30:42,180
I think, see if you agree with this, he is the smartest

6318
03:30:42,180 --> 03:30:45,570
and most credible critic of LLMs is the path for AI.

6319
03:30:45,570 --> 03:30:46,440
- [Lex] Yeah.

6320
03:30:46,440 --> 03:30:48,630
- And he's not, you know, there's certain,

6321
03:30:48,630 --> 03:30:49,770
I would say troll-like characters

6322
03:30:49,770 --> 03:30:51,030
who are just like crapping everything.

6323
03:30:51,030 --> 03:30:53,430
But like Yann has like very deeply thought through,

6324
03:30:53,430 --> 03:30:55,827
basically, theories as to why LLMs

6325
03:30:55,827 --> 03:30:57,303
are an evolutionary dead end.

6326
03:30:58,560 --> 03:31:02,490
And I actually, like, I try to do this thing

6327
03:31:02,490 --> 03:31:04,350
where I try to model, you know, I try to have a mental model

6328
03:31:04,350 --> 03:31:05,697
of like the two different sides of a serious argument.

6329
03:31:05,697 --> 03:31:07,890
And so I've tried to like internalize that argument

6330
03:31:07,890 --> 03:31:09,630
as much as I can, which is difficult

6331
03:31:09,630 --> 03:31:11,160
'cause like we're investing it behind LLMs

6332
03:31:11,160 --> 03:31:11,993
as aggressively as we can.

6333
03:31:11,993 --> 03:31:15,210
And so if he's right, like that could be a big problem.

6334
03:31:15,210 --> 03:31:17,190
But like, we should also know that.

6335
03:31:17,190 --> 03:31:19,200
And then I sort of use his ideas

6336
03:31:19,200 --> 03:31:22,110
to challenge all the bullish people, you know,

6337
03:31:22,110 --> 03:31:24,630
to really kind of test their level of knowledge.

6338
03:31:24,630 --> 03:31:26,070
So I like to kind of grill people.

6339
03:31:26,070 --> 03:31:31,070
Like, you know, I was got my CS degree 35 years ago,

6340
03:31:32,040 --> 03:31:33,540
so I'm not like deep in the technology,

6341
03:31:33,540 --> 03:31:36,840
but like to the extent I can understand Yann's points,

6342
03:31:36,840 --> 03:31:38,897
I can use them to, you know, to really surface a lot

6343
03:31:38,897 --> 03:31:41,010
of the questions for the people who are more bullish.

6344
03:31:41,010 --> 03:31:43,410
And that's been, I think, very, very productive.

6345
03:31:44,640 --> 03:31:45,840
Yeah, just, and it's very striking

6346
03:31:45,840 --> 03:31:47,040
that you have somebody who is like

6347
03:31:47,040 --> 03:31:48,540
that central in the space,

6348
03:31:48,540 --> 03:31:51,363
who is actually like a full-on skeptic.

6349
03:31:52,548 --> 03:31:54,390
And again, this could go different ways.

6350
03:31:54,390 --> 03:31:56,340
He could end up being very wrong.

6351
03:31:56,340 --> 03:31:57,660
He could end up being totally right,

6352
03:31:57,660 --> 03:32:00,330
or it could be that he will provoke the evolution

6353
03:32:00,330 --> 03:32:03,094
of these systems to be much better than they would've been.

6354
03:32:03,094 --> 03:32:04,590
- Yeah, he could be both right and wrong.

6355
03:32:04,590 --> 03:32:06,930
First of all, I do agree with that.

6356
03:32:06,930 --> 03:32:09,420
He's one of the most legit and rigorous

6357
03:32:09,420 --> 03:32:13,980
and deep critics of the LLM path to AGI, you know,

6358
03:32:13,980 --> 03:32:16,500
his basic notions that there needs AI needs

6359
03:32:16,500 --> 03:32:20,610
to have some physical understanding of the physical world,

6360
03:32:20,610 --> 03:32:22,960
and that's very difficult to achieve with LLMs.

6361
03:32:24,088 --> 03:32:25,590
And that is a really good way

6362
03:32:25,590 --> 03:32:28,500
to challenge the limitations of LLMs and so on.

6363
03:32:28,500 --> 03:32:31,590
He's also been a vocal

6364
03:32:31,590 --> 03:32:32,700
and a huge proponent

6365
03:32:32,700 --> 03:32:33,810
of open source. - Yes.

6366
03:32:33,810 --> 03:32:34,920
- Which is a whole nother- - Yes.

6367
03:32:34,920 --> 03:32:35,790
- Which you have been as well.

6368
03:32:35,790 --> 03:32:37,131
- [Marc] Which is very useful. Yeah.

6369
03:32:37,131 --> 03:32:38,888
- And that's been just fascinating to watch.

6370
03:32:38,888 --> 03:32:39,721
- [Marc] And anti-doomer.

6371
03:32:39,721 --> 03:32:41,310
- Anti-doomer? - Yeah.

6372
03:32:41,310 --> 03:32:43,140
- Yeah, he's- - He's very anti-doomer.

6373
03:32:43,140 --> 03:32:44,160
- He embodies...

6374
03:32:44,160 --> 03:32:46,506
He also has many wolves inside.

6375
03:32:46,506 --> 03:32:47,702
- [Marc] Yes, he does. Yes, does.

6376
03:32:47,702 --> 03:32:48,535
Yes, he does. Yes, does.

6377
03:32:48,535 --> 03:32:50,370
- So it's been really, really fun to watch.

6378
03:32:50,370 --> 03:32:51,203
- The other two.

6379
03:32:51,203 --> 03:32:52,530
Okay, here's my other wolf coming out.

6380
03:32:52,530 --> 03:32:53,363
- [Lex] Yeah.

6381
03:32:53,363 --> 03:32:54,720
- The other two of the three godfathers of AI

6382
03:32:54,720 --> 03:32:57,375
are like radicals,

6383
03:32:57,375 --> 03:33:01,470
like full-on left, you know, far left, you know, like,

6384
03:33:01,470 --> 03:33:04,170
I would say like either Marxists or borderline Marxists.

6385
03:33:04,170 --> 03:33:05,010
And they're like,

6386
03:33:05,010 --> 03:33:07,320
I think, quite extreme in their social political views.

6387
03:33:07,320 --> 03:33:09,900
And I think that feeds into their doomerism,

6388
03:33:09,900 --> 03:33:10,950
and I think, you know,

6389
03:33:10,950 --> 03:33:13,410
they are lobbying for like draconian government,

6390
03:33:13,410 --> 03:33:15,390
I think what would be ruinously destructive government

6391
03:33:15,390 --> 03:33:17,177
legislation and regulation.

6392
03:33:17,177 --> 03:33:18,900
And so it's actually super helpful,

6393
03:33:18,900 --> 03:33:19,830
super, super helpful

6394
03:33:19,830 --> 03:33:22,590
to have Yann as a counterpoint to those two.

6395
03:33:22,590 --> 03:33:25,680
- Another fun question, our mutual friend Andrew Huberman.

6396
03:33:25,680 --> 03:33:26,513
- [Marc] Yes.

6397
03:33:26,513 --> 03:33:28,470
- First maybe, what do you love most about Andrew?

6398
03:33:28,470 --> 03:33:31,676
And second, what score on a scale of 1 to 10

6399
03:33:31,676 --> 03:33:34,830
do you think he would give you on your approach to health?

6400
03:33:34,830 --> 03:33:36,030
- Oh, three.

6401
03:33:36,030 --> 03:33:37,080
- Physical three.

6402
03:33:37,080 --> 03:33:38,580
You think you'd score that high, huh?

6403
03:33:38,580 --> 03:33:39,880
Okay. - (laughs) Exactly.

6404
03:33:40,937 --> 03:33:42,420
- That's good. (laughs) - Exactly.

6405
03:33:42,420 --> 03:33:45,063
Well, so he convinced me to stop drinking alcohol,

6406
03:33:46,020 --> 03:33:47,100
which was a big- - Successfully?

6407
03:33:47,100 --> 03:33:48,930
- Well, it was like other than my family,

6408
03:33:48,930 --> 03:33:49,763
it was my favorite thing

6409
03:33:49,763 --> 03:33:50,596
in the world. - Yeah.

6410
03:33:50,596 --> 03:33:52,410
- And so it was a major, major reduction.

6411
03:33:52,410 --> 03:33:53,730
Like having like a glass of scotch

6412
03:33:53,730 --> 03:33:55,307
at night, it was like a major, like,

6413
03:33:55,307 --> 03:33:56,580
it was like the thing I would do to relax.

6414
03:33:56,580 --> 03:33:58,530
And so he has profoundly negatively impacted

6415
03:33:58,530 --> 03:33:59,505
my emotional health.

6416
03:33:59,505 --> 03:34:01,149
(Lex laughing)

6417
03:34:01,149 --> 03:34:02,190
I blame him- - Yeah.

6418
03:34:02,190 --> 03:34:03,810
- For making me much less happy as a person.

6419
03:34:03,810 --> 03:34:05,850
But much, much, much healthier.

6420
03:34:05,850 --> 03:34:07,380
- Yeah. - Physically healthier.

6421
03:34:07,380 --> 03:34:09,750
So that I credit him with that.

6422
03:34:09,750 --> 03:34:10,980
I'm glad I did that.

6423
03:34:10,980 --> 03:34:11,947
But then his sleep stuff like,

6424
03:34:11,947 --> 03:34:14,130
yeah, I'm not doing any of that.

6425
03:34:14,130 --> 03:34:14,963
- [Lex] Yeah.

6426
03:34:14,963 --> 03:34:16,893
- I have no interest in his sleep shit. Like, no.

6427
03:34:17,760 --> 03:34:19,050
This whole light, natural light,

6428
03:34:19,050 --> 03:34:19,883
no, we're not doing it.

6429
03:34:19,883 --> 03:34:21,453
- You're too hardcore for this?

6430
03:34:23,067 --> 03:34:24,630
- I don't see any natural light in here.

6431
03:34:24,630 --> 03:34:26,370
- [Lex] It's all covered.

6432
03:34:26,370 --> 03:34:27,210
It's all horrible.

6433
03:34:27,210 --> 03:34:28,950
- And I'm very happy.

6434
03:34:28,950 --> 03:34:30,660
I would be very happy living and working here

6435
03:34:30,660 --> 03:34:32,520
'cause I'm totally happy without natural light.

6436
03:34:32,520 --> 03:34:34,170
- In darkness. - Yes.

6437
03:34:34,170 --> 03:34:35,287
- It must be a metaphor for something.

6438
03:34:35,287 --> 03:34:36,480
- Yes, it's a test.

6439
03:34:36,480 --> 03:34:37,410
Look, it's a test of manhood

6440
03:34:37,410 --> 03:34:39,030
as to whether you can have a blue screen in your face

6441
03:34:39,030 --> 03:34:40,290
for three hours and then go right to sleep.

6442
03:34:40,290 --> 03:34:41,220
Like, I don't understand

6443
03:34:41,220 --> 03:34:43,533
why you should wanna take shortcuts.

6444
03:34:45,090 --> 03:34:48,033
- I now understand what they mean by toxic masculinity.

6445
03:34:48,930 --> 03:34:50,017
All right.

6446
03:34:50,017 --> 03:34:52,020
(both laughing)

6447
03:34:52,020 --> 03:34:54,660
So let's see.

6448
03:34:54,660 --> 03:34:59,070
You're exceptionally successful by most measures,

6449
03:34:59,070 --> 03:35:01,803
but what to you is the definition of success?

6450
03:35:02,940 --> 03:35:06,283
- I would probably say it is a combination of two things,

6451
03:35:06,283 --> 03:35:10,143
I think it is contribution.

6452
03:35:11,850 --> 03:35:13,140
So, you know, have you done something

6453
03:35:13,140 --> 03:35:14,390
that mattered ultimately,

6454
03:35:17,308 --> 03:35:19,260
you know, and specifically it mattered to people?

6455
03:35:19,260 --> 03:35:20,370
And then the other thing is,

6456
03:35:20,370 --> 03:35:22,650
I think happiness is either overrated

6457
03:35:22,650 --> 03:35:23,950
or almost a complete myth.

6458
03:35:25,418 --> 03:35:26,400
And in fact, interesting,

6459
03:35:26,400 --> 03:35:27,960
Thomas Jefferson did not mean happiness the way

6460
03:35:27,960 --> 03:35:28,793
that we understand it.

6461
03:35:28,793 --> 03:35:30,180
When he said, "Pursuit of happiness"

6462
03:35:30,180 --> 03:35:31,920
in the "Declaration of Independence,"

6463
03:35:31,920 --> 03:35:33,873
he meant it more of the Greek meaning,

6464
03:35:34,740 --> 03:35:38,133
which is closer to satisfaction or fulfillment.

6465
03:35:39,120 --> 03:35:41,730
And so I think about happiness

6466
03:35:41,730 --> 03:35:45,780
as the first ice cream cone makes you super happy.

6467
03:35:45,780 --> 03:35:48,090
The first mile of the walk in the park

6468
03:35:48,090 --> 03:35:50,310
during sunset makes you super happy.

6469
03:35:50,310 --> 03:35:52,050
The first kiss makes you super happy.

6470
03:35:52,050 --> 03:35:55,623
The thousandth ice cream cone, not so much.

6471
03:35:56,700 --> 03:35:59,150
The thousandth mile of the walk through the park.

6472
03:36:00,030 --> 03:36:01,530
The thousandth kiss can still be good,

6473
03:36:01,530 --> 03:36:03,230
but maybe just not right in a row.

6474
03:36:04,800 --> 03:36:07,950
Right, and so happiness is this very fleeting concept,

6475
03:36:07,950 --> 03:36:09,660
and the people who anchor on happiness seem

6476
03:36:09,660 --> 03:36:11,730
to go off the rails pretty often.

6477
03:36:11,730 --> 03:36:14,013
So did the deep sense of having been,

6478
03:36:15,720 --> 03:36:17,170
I dunno how to put it useful.

6479
03:36:20,550 --> 03:36:23,558
- So that's a good place to arrive at in life.

6480
03:36:23,558 --> 03:36:24,724
- Yeah, I think so.

6481
03:36:24,724 --> 03:36:26,730
Yeah, I mean, like, can you sit, yeah.

6482
03:36:26,730 --> 03:36:28,832
You know, who was it who said,

6483
03:36:28,832 --> 03:36:29,880
the source of all the ills in the world

6484
03:36:29,880 --> 03:36:31,110
is man's inability to sit in a room

6485
03:36:31,110 --> 03:36:32,523
by himself doing nothing.

6486
03:36:34,200 --> 03:36:35,160
But like, if you're sitting in a room

6487
03:36:35,160 --> 03:36:36,690
by yourself and you're like, all right.

6488
03:36:36,690 --> 03:36:39,633
Or you know, four in the morning, it's like, all right,

6489
03:36:39,633 --> 03:36:42,240
have I lived up to my expectation of myself?

6490
03:36:42,240 --> 03:36:44,010
Like if you have, you know, the people I know who feel

6491
03:36:44,010 --> 03:36:45,900
that way are pretty centered

6492
03:36:45,900 --> 03:36:50,100
and, you know, generally seem very, I dunno how to put it,

6493
03:36:50,100 --> 03:36:54,513
pleased with, you know, proud, calm, at peace.

6494
03:36:55,980 --> 03:36:58,803
The people who are, you know, sensation seekers,

6495
03:37:00,390 --> 03:37:02,130
you know, some of the sensations by the way, some sense,

6496
03:37:02,130 --> 03:37:03,750
you know, there's certain entrepreneurs, for example,

6497
03:37:03,750 --> 03:37:05,880
who are like into every form of extreme sport

6498
03:37:05,880 --> 03:37:08,700
and they get, you know, huge satisfaction out of that.

6499
03:37:08,700 --> 03:37:09,990
Or, you know, there's sensation seeking

6500
03:37:09,990 --> 03:37:11,550
in sort of useful and productive ways.

6501
03:37:11,550 --> 03:37:12,960
You know, Larry Ellison was always like that.

6502
03:37:12,960 --> 03:37:14,160
Zuckerberg is like that.

6503
03:37:15,380 --> 03:37:16,620
And then, you know, there's a lot of entrepreneurs

6504
03:37:16,620 --> 03:37:18,713
who end up, you know, drugs, (laughs) you know,

6505
03:37:20,766 --> 03:37:22,316
like you know, sexual escapades

6506
03:37:23,790 --> 03:37:25,980
that seem like they'll be fun at first and then backfire.

6507
03:37:25,980 --> 03:37:27,090
- Yeah, but at the end of the day,

6508
03:37:27,090 --> 03:37:28,810
if you're able to be at peace

6509
03:37:29,670 --> 03:37:31,800
by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM-

6510
03:37:31,800 --> 03:37:33,600
- [Marc] Yeah. - And I would even say happy,

6511
03:37:33,600 --> 03:37:36,300
but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson

6512
03:37:36,300 --> 03:37:40,020
didn't mean it the way, maybe I mean it,

6513
03:37:40,020 --> 03:37:42,522
but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM-

6514
03:37:42,522 --> 03:37:43,355
- Yeah. - With a blue screen.

6515
03:37:43,355 --> 03:37:44,820
- That's good. Exactly.

6516
03:37:44,820 --> 03:37:46,713
- Staring at cursor. - Exactly.

6517
03:37:49,590 --> 03:37:51,150
- As a small tangent,

6518
03:37:51,150 --> 03:37:53,340
a quick shout out to an amazing interview you did

6519
03:37:53,340 --> 03:37:55,650
with Bari Weiss and just to her in general,

6520
03:37:55,650 --> 03:37:58,170
Bari Weiss of the Free Press.

6521
03:37:58,170 --> 03:38:00,450
She has a podcast called, "Honestly, with Bari Weiss."

6522
03:38:00,450 --> 03:38:01,283
She's great.

6523
03:38:01,283 --> 03:38:02,880
People should go listen.

6524
03:38:02,880 --> 03:38:06,093
You were asked if you believe in God.

6525
03:38:08,100 --> 03:38:09,120
One of the joys...

6526
03:38:09,120 --> 03:38:10,350
See, we talked about happiness.

6527
03:38:10,350 --> 03:38:11,730
One of the things that makes me happy

6528
03:38:11,730 --> 03:38:13,200
is making you uncomfortable.

6529
03:38:13,200 --> 03:38:14,390
- [Marc] Thank you.

6530
03:38:14,390 --> 03:38:16,230
- So this question is designed for many

6531
03:38:16,230 --> 03:38:18,720
of the questions today were designed for that.

6532
03:38:18,720 --> 03:38:20,280
You were asked if you believe in God,

6533
03:38:20,280 --> 03:38:23,880
and you said after a pause that you're not sure.

6534
03:38:23,880 --> 03:38:27,510
So it felt like the pause, the uncertainty,

6535
03:38:27,510 --> 03:38:32,430
there was some kind of ongoing search for wisdom

6536
03:38:32,430 --> 03:38:33,263
and meaning.

6537
03:38:34,770 --> 03:38:37,920
Are you, in fact, searching for wisdom and meaning?

6538
03:38:37,920 --> 03:38:38,753
- I guess I'd put it this way.

6539
03:38:38,753 --> 03:38:43,530
There's a lot to just understand about people

6540
03:38:43,530 --> 03:38:46,323
that I feel like I'm only starting to understand.

6541
03:38:49,320 --> 03:38:52,080
And that's certainly a simpler concept than God. (laughs)

6542
03:38:52,080 --> 03:38:55,590
So that's what I've spent a lot of the last, you know,

6543
03:38:55,590 --> 03:38:56,940
15 years trying to figure out.

6544
03:38:56,940 --> 03:38:58,710
I feel like I spent my first like whatever,

6545
03:38:58,710 --> 03:39:00,270
30 years figuring out machines,

6546
03:39:00,270 --> 03:39:02,040
and then now I'm spending 30 years figuring out people,

6547
03:39:02,040 --> 03:39:05,010
which turns out to be quite a bit more complicated.

6548
03:39:05,010 --> 03:39:06,480
And then, I don't know, maybe God's the last 30 years

6549
03:39:06,480 --> 03:39:07,313
or something.

6550
03:39:10,290 --> 03:39:11,700
And then, you know, look, I mean just, you know,

6551
03:39:11,700 --> 03:39:12,810
like Elon, it's just like, okay,

6552
03:39:12,810 --> 03:39:15,240
the known universe is like very, you know, complicated

6553
03:39:15,240 --> 03:39:17,430
and, you know, mystifying.

6554
03:39:17,430 --> 03:39:19,260
I mean, every time I, you know, pull up an astronomy,

6555
03:39:19,260 --> 03:39:20,310
my kid super in astronomy,

6556
03:39:20,310 --> 03:39:21,247
and it's like, you know,

6557
03:39:21,247 --> 03:39:23,186
"Daddy, how many galaxies are there in the universe?"

6558
03:39:23,186 --> 03:39:24,019
And you know,

6559
03:39:24,019 --> 03:39:26,250
how many galaxies are there in the universe?

6560
03:39:26,250 --> 03:39:29,459
- 100 billion? - Okay. Like how?

6561
03:39:29,459 --> 03:39:30,570
(Lex laughing)

6562
03:39:30,570 --> 03:39:31,865
- Yeah.

6563
03:39:31,865 --> 03:39:32,698
- Like- - Yeah.

6564
03:39:32,698 --> 03:39:34,650
- Like how that freaking possible?

6565
03:39:34,650 --> 03:39:38,893
Like it's such a staggering concept that I-

6566
03:39:38,893 --> 03:39:41,010
- I actually wanted to show you a tweet

6567
03:39:41,010 --> 03:39:43,383
that blew my mind from Elon from a while back.

6568
03:39:44,730 --> 03:39:45,563
Elon, said,

6569
03:39:45,563 --> 03:39:48,180
"As a friend called it, this is the ultimate skill tree.

6570
03:39:48,180 --> 03:39:51,930
This is a wall of galaxies,

6571
03:39:51,930 --> 03:39:54,450
a billion light years across." - Yeah.

6572
03:39:54,450 --> 03:39:56,300
- So these are all galaxies. - Yeah.

6573
03:39:57,902 --> 03:39:59,550
Like how was it that big?

6574
03:39:59,550 --> 03:40:01,270
Like how the hell, and like, you know,

6575
03:40:01,270 --> 03:40:03,060
I can read the textbook and the this and the that

6576
03:40:03,060 --> 03:40:04,860
and the whatever, 8 billion years and the Big Bang

6577
03:40:04,860 --> 03:40:05,693
and the whole thing.

6578
03:40:05,693 --> 03:40:07,200
And then it's just like, all right, wow.

6579
03:40:07,200 --> 03:40:08,520
And then it's like, all rights, the Big Bang.

6580
03:40:08,520 --> 03:40:13,500
All right, like what was before the Big Bang? (laughs)

6581
03:40:13,500 --> 03:40:17,820
- Do you think we humans will ever colonize like a galaxy

6582
03:40:17,820 --> 03:40:19,320
and maybe even go beyond?

6583
03:40:19,320 --> 03:40:21,450
- Sure. Yeah, I mean, in the fullness of time.

6584
03:40:21,450 --> 03:40:22,283
Yeah.

6585
03:40:22,283 --> 03:40:23,370
- So you have that kind of optimism.

6586
03:40:23,370 --> 03:40:24,900
You have that kind of hope that extends

6587
03:40:24,900 --> 03:40:26,566
across a thousand of- - In the fullness of time.

6588
03:40:26,566 --> 03:40:27,399
I mean, yeah, you know,

6589
03:40:27,399 --> 03:40:28,657
all the problem, all the challenges with it that I do,

6590
03:40:28,657 --> 03:40:30,093
but like, yeah, why not?

6591
03:40:31,081 --> 03:40:32,220
I mean, again, in the fullness of time,

6592
03:40:32,220 --> 03:40:33,240
it'll take a long time.

6593
03:40:33,240 --> 03:40:34,500
- You don't think we'll destroy ourselves?

6594
03:40:34,500 --> 03:40:36,507
- No, I doubt it. I doubt it.

6595
03:40:36,507 --> 03:40:38,863
And you know, fortunately we have Elon giving us,

6596
03:40:38,863 --> 03:40:39,780
(Lex laughing)

6597
03:40:39,780 --> 03:40:41,310
giving us the backup plan.

6598
03:40:41,310 --> 03:40:42,573
So I don't know, like, I grew up, you know,

6599
03:40:42,573 --> 03:40:44,340
real Midwest, sort of just like conventionally

6600
03:40:44,340 --> 03:40:46,620
kind of Protestant Christian.

6601
03:40:46,620 --> 03:40:47,910
It never made that much sense to me.

6602
03:40:47,910 --> 03:40:49,350
Got trained as an engineer and a scientist.

6603
03:40:49,350 --> 03:40:51,060
I'm like, "Oh, that definitely doesn't make sense."

6604
03:40:51,060 --> 03:40:52,410
I'm like, "I know I'll spend my life

6605
03:40:52,410 --> 03:40:53,820
as an empirical, you know, rationalist

6606
03:40:53,820 --> 03:40:54,900
and I'll figure everything out."

6607
03:40:54,900 --> 03:40:56,490
And then, you know, and then again,

6608
03:40:56,490 --> 03:40:59,070
you walk up against these things, you know,

6609
03:40:59,070 --> 03:41:00,720
you bump up against these things

6610
03:41:00,720 --> 03:41:01,770
and you're just like, "All right,"

6611
03:41:01,770 --> 03:41:04,140
I like, "Okay, I guess there's a scientific explanation

6612
03:41:04,140 --> 03:41:06,537
for this, but like, wow."

6613
03:41:07,710 --> 03:41:08,543
And then there's like,

6614
03:41:08,543 --> 03:41:10,320
"All right, where did that come from?"

6615
03:41:10,320 --> 03:41:11,940
Right, and then how far back can you go

6616
03:41:11,940 --> 03:41:13,090
on the causality chain?

6617
03:41:14,520 --> 03:41:16,740
Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean, and even just, you know,

6618
03:41:16,740 --> 03:41:18,967
experiences that we all have on earth,

6619
03:41:18,967 --> 03:41:19,890
it's hard to rationally explain it all.

6620
03:41:19,890 --> 03:41:21,510
And then, you know, so yeah,

6621
03:41:21,510 --> 03:41:24,330
I guess I just say I'm kind of radically open-minded,

6622
03:41:24,330 --> 03:41:27,300
at peace with the fact that I'll probably never know.

6623
03:41:27,300 --> 03:41:28,380
The other thing though, that's happened,

6624
03:41:28,380 --> 03:41:30,210
and maybe the more practical answer to the question

6625
03:41:30,210 --> 03:41:32,600
is I think I have a much better understanding now

6626
03:41:32,600 --> 03:41:35,073
of the role that religion plays in society

6627
03:41:35,073 --> 03:41:37,620
that I didn't have when I was younger.

6628
03:41:37,620 --> 03:41:40,140
And my partner, Ben has a great...

6629
03:41:40,140 --> 03:41:41,250
I think he quotes his father on this.

6630
03:41:41,250 --> 03:41:43,410
He's like, "If a man does not have a real religion,

6631
03:41:43,410 --> 03:41:44,560
he makes up a fake one,

6632
03:41:46,021 --> 03:41:48,510
and the fake ones go very, very badly."

6633
03:41:48,510 --> 03:41:52,593
And so there's this class, it's actually really funny.

6634
03:41:53,853 --> 03:41:54,759
There's this class of intellectual

6635
03:41:54,759 --> 03:41:55,592
that has what appears

6636
03:41:55,592 --> 03:41:57,367
to be a very patronizing point of view, which is,

6637
03:41:57,367 --> 03:41:59,400
"Yes, I'm an atheist, but it's very important

6638
03:41:59,400 --> 03:42:01,890
that the people believe in something."

6639
03:42:01,890 --> 03:42:03,090
Right?

6640
03:42:03,090 --> 03:42:04,920
And Marx had like the negative view on that,

6641
03:42:04,920 --> 03:42:06,420
which is religions the opiate of the masses.

6642
03:42:06,420 --> 03:42:08,070
But there's a lot of like right-wing intellectuals

6643
03:42:08,070 --> 03:42:08,940
who are themselves, I think,

6644
03:42:08,940 --> 03:42:10,020
pretty atheist or agnostic,

6645
03:42:10,020 --> 03:42:11,100
that are like, it's deeply important

6646
03:42:11,100 --> 03:42:14,490
that the people be Christian or something like that.

6647
03:42:14,490 --> 03:42:15,420
And on the one hand it's like,

6648
03:42:15,420 --> 03:42:16,710
wow, that's arrogant and presumptive.

6649
03:42:16,710 --> 03:42:18,090
But on the other hand, you know,

6650
03:42:18,090 --> 03:42:20,730
maybe it's right because, you know,

6651
03:42:20,730 --> 03:42:22,920
what have we learned in the last 100 years

6652
03:42:22,920 --> 03:42:24,600
is in the absence of a real religion,

6653
03:42:24,600 --> 03:42:26,100
people will make up fake ones.

6654
03:42:27,300 --> 03:42:29,430
There's this writer, there's this political philosopher

6655
03:42:29,430 --> 03:42:31,707
who's super interesting on this named Eric Voegelin.

6656
03:42:31,707 --> 03:42:35,100
And he wrote in the sort of mid-part of the century,

6657
03:42:35,100 --> 03:42:37,230
mid-late-part of the 20th century,

6658
03:42:37,230 --> 03:42:38,130
he was like born in, I think,

6659
03:42:38,130 --> 03:42:39,930
like 1900, and like died in like '85.

6660
03:42:39,930 --> 03:42:43,150
So he saw the complete run of communism and Nazism

6661
03:42:44,850 --> 03:42:45,943
and himself, you know,

6662
03:42:45,943 --> 03:42:48,720
I think he fled Europe and you know, the whole thing.

6663
03:42:48,720 --> 03:42:52,260
And you know, his sort of big conclusion was basically

6664
03:42:52,260 --> 03:42:54,476
that both communism and Nazism, fascism,

6665
03:42:54,476 --> 03:42:56,730
were basically religions,

6666
03:42:56,730 --> 03:42:59,250
but like in the deep way of religions.

6667
03:42:59,250 --> 03:43:01,110
Like, you know, we call 'em political religions,

6668
03:43:01,110 --> 03:43:02,610
but they were like actual religions.

6669
03:43:02,610 --> 03:43:05,760
And you know, they were what Nietzsche forecasted

6670
03:43:05,760 --> 03:43:07,020
when he said, you know, "God is dead.

6671
03:43:07,020 --> 03:43:09,510
We've killed him, and we won't wash the blood off our hands

6672
03:43:09,510 --> 03:43:11,490
for 1,000 years," right?

6673
03:43:11,490 --> 03:43:13,050
Is we will come up with new religions

6674
03:43:13,050 --> 03:43:15,450
that will just cause just mass murder and death.

6675
03:43:16,470 --> 03:43:17,607
And like, you read his stuff now

6676
03:43:17,607 --> 03:43:20,040
and you're like, "Yep, (laughs) that happened."

6677
03:43:20,040 --> 03:43:22,050
Right? And then, of course, as fully, you know,

6678
03:43:22,050 --> 03:43:23,130
elite moderates, of course,

6679
03:43:23,130 --> 03:43:25,080
we couldn't possibly be doing that for ourselves right now,

6680
03:43:25,080 --> 03:43:27,210
but of course, we are.

6681
03:43:27,210 --> 03:43:29,910
And you know, I would argue that Eric Voegelin, for sure,

6682
03:43:29,910 --> 03:43:31,560
would argue that the last 10 years, you know,

6683
03:43:31,560 --> 03:43:33,843
we have been in a religious frenzy, you know,

6684
03:43:33,843 --> 03:43:36,690
that woke has been a full scale religious frenzy

6685
03:43:36,690 --> 03:43:39,030
and has had all of the characteristics of a religion,

6686
03:43:39,030 --> 03:43:40,710
including everything from patron saints

6687
03:43:40,710 --> 03:43:43,353
to holy texts, to, you know, sin.

6688
03:43:48,363 --> 03:43:49,196
Wokeness has said, every,

6689
03:43:49,196 --> 03:43:50,250
I think, has said every single aspect

6690
03:43:50,250 --> 03:43:54,390
of an actual religion other than redemption, right?

6691
03:43:54,390 --> 03:43:56,100
Which is maybe like the most dangerous religion

6692
03:43:56,100 --> 03:43:57,090
you could ever come up with,

6693
03:43:57,090 --> 03:44:00,171
is the one where there's no forgiveness, right?

6694
03:44:00,171 --> 03:44:01,230
And so I think if Voegelin were alive,

6695
03:44:01,230 --> 03:44:02,640
I think he would've zeroed right in on that,

6696
03:44:02,640 --> 03:44:04,140
would've said that.

6697
03:44:04,140 --> 03:44:06,180
And, you know, we just like sailed right off.

6698
03:44:06,180 --> 03:44:08,550
I mentioned earlier like we somehow rediscovered

6699
03:44:08,550 --> 03:44:09,960
the religions of the Indo-Europeans.

6700
03:44:09,960 --> 03:44:13,410
We're all into identity politics and environmentalism.

6701
03:44:13,410 --> 03:44:15,720
Like, I don't think that's an accident.

6702
03:44:15,720 --> 03:44:19,500
So anyway, like there is something very deep going on

6703
03:44:19,500 --> 03:44:22,290
in the human psyche, on religion,

6704
03:44:22,290 --> 03:44:27,290
that is not dismissible and needs to be taken seriously.

6705
03:44:29,220 --> 03:44:32,073
Even if one struggles with the specifics of it.

6706
03:44:33,150 --> 03:44:34,590
- I think I speak for a lot of people

6707
03:44:34,590 --> 03:44:36,420
that it's been a real joy

6708
03:44:36,420 --> 03:44:41,420
and for me, an honor to get to watch you seek to understand

6709
03:44:41,697 --> 03:44:43,500
the human psyche as you described.

6710
03:44:43,500 --> 03:44:45,603
You're in that 30-year part of your life,

6711
03:44:47,040 --> 03:44:49,320
and it's been an honor to talk with you today.

6712
03:44:49,320 --> 03:44:50,153
Thank you, Marc.

6713
03:44:50,153 --> 03:44:51,219
- Thank you, Lex.

6714
03:44:51,219 --> 03:44:52,052
Is that it?

6715
03:44:52,052 --> 03:44:54,570
That's only, how long is that?

6716
03:44:54,570 --> 03:44:56,820
- Four hours with Marc Andreessen

6717
03:44:56,820 --> 03:45:00,210
is like 40 hours of actual content so-

6718
03:45:00,210 --> 03:45:01,971
- I'll accept being one of the short ones.

6719
03:45:01,971 --> 03:45:03,401
(both laughing)

6720
03:45:03,401 --> 03:45:04,710
- For the listener.

6721
03:45:04,710 --> 03:45:07,623
Marc looks like he's ready to go for 20 more hours,

6722
03:45:08,820 --> 03:45:10,350
and I need a nap. (laughs)

6723
03:45:10,350 --> 03:45:11,220
Thank you, Marc.

6724
03:45:11,220 --> 03:45:12,810
- Thank you, Lex.

6725
03:45:12,810 --> 03:45:13,643
- Thanks for listening

6726
03:45:13,643 --> 03:45:15,990

6730
03:45:22,080 --> 03:45:23,703
from Thomas Sowell.

6731
03:45:24,967 --> 03:45:29,460
"It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent

6732
03:45:29,460 --> 03:45:31,047
of your own ignorance."

6733
03:45:32,100 --> 03:45:35,163
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
