1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,140
Let's be honest.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,900
It's the boring  that makes you rich.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,722
And the most unbelievable way for generating wealth and long-term economic security is.

4
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:09,150
..

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,560
And then, once you do that, you can become a super tax avoider.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,740
 That sounded awful.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,320
 Scott Galloway, one of the world's leading voices in business and finance is back.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,290
His mission is to help millions of people build incredible wealth and live a life of economic security.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,670
If you're trying to build wealth, you wanna lean into your advantages.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,000
Your advantages in your 20s are flexibility and time.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,840
So take risks, find your talent, not your passion

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,740
it has a 90-plus percent employment rate.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,089
Or become an owner, not an earner

14
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:42,000
and develop an army of capital that goes out and kills for you at night

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,290
and then invest it.

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,340
What if you're not young?

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,780
Focus on the things you can control.

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,030
One thing that is within your control is spending.

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,820
But 98% of us will spend everything we get our hands on.

20
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,320
It is very hard to have the discipline to take money that is within your grasp and invest it.

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,050
And we don't appreciate the power of investing and compound interest.

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,310
My team brought a bucket of sand to illuminate the power of compounding interest.

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,630
This is investing £1,000 a month over the course of 12 months

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,210
starting at the age of 25.

25
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,420
If you left it and kept investing at that rate

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,920
by the age of 65, it would look like this.

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,050
And the young man who says, "I have £500.

28
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,941
I gotta wait till I have a million before I start investing.

29
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,700
" The way you get a million pounds is by investing that 500.

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,510
And this notion that it's too late for me

31
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm in my 40s, I'm gonna ignore finances

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,400
ah, bull.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,700
So what is the set of steps?

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,900
Let me make it easy.

35
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,863
First thing .

36
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:31,910
..

37
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,380
Congratulations, Diary of a CEO gang.

38
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,620
We've made some progress.

39
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,140
63% of you that listen to this podcast regularly don't subscribe

40
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,080
which is down from 69%.

41
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,600
Our goal is 50%.

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,920
So if you've ever liked any of the videos we've posted

45
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,180

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,560
the bigger the guests get.

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,300
Thank you, and enjoy this episode.

48
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:05,040
Scott, you've written a book on wealth

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,140
money, finance.

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,489
Why?

51
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:11,620
And why does it, why does it matter?

52
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,080
Uh, this is kind of a memo to my 25-year-old self.

53
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,140
I've been rich three times.

54
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,600
And the first two times, I lost it.

55
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,609
And I didn't grow up with a lot of money.

56
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,130
It's been very important to me.

57
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,850
I think America, and mostly in Europe

58
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,680
but especially America, America becomes more like itself every day.

59
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,690
And that is, it's a generous, loving place if you have money.

60
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,030
It's a rapacious, violent place if you don't.

61
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,380
I think economic security is really important.

62
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,980
And I think there's a series of habits and character traits that

63
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,640
uh, can help you get to economic security.

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,600
You know that study that you become the average of your five closest friends?

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,730
Same body mass index, same politics, same sports team

66
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,930
same neighborhood?

67
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,230
Uh, what they don't talk about is that amongst those five people

68
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,320
even if they're all making about the same amount of money

69
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,080
one will end up much more economically well-off than the other four.

70
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:14,960
And I'm trying to understand the behaviors of that one person who becomes economically secure by the time they're my age without making a lot more money than their colleagues.

71
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,190
Do you think we're taught about money?

72
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,600
W- where d- where did those people, that one in five

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,200
where did, where did they learn about money?

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,540
Yeah, that's a really interesting question.

75
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,363
I think .

76
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:24,370
..

77
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,580
So, th- the honest answer is, I don't know.

78
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,800
What I would say, uh, sociologically is that rich people talk about money

79
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:39,060
and it's considered taboo for employees and middle class and lower class and women to talk about money.

80
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,320
Like, you're told not to talk about your salary at work.

81
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,730
Asymmetry of information will always benefit the person that has symmetry

82
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,490
that knows the information.

83
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,220
The boss of a company knows what everyone's making

84
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:57,660
but he tells his or her employees not to discuss their salary because Lisa might find out that Bob is making 30% more for doing the same work.

85
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,180
So there's a bit of a zeitgeist that tells people not to talk about money

86
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,360
that it's like talking about porn or that it's vulgar.

87
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,200
And I think you need to start talking about money and maintain a certain level of financial literacy from a very early age.

88
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,450
Because Roger Federer talks about tennis.

89
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,899
If you wanna be good at anything, most people wanna be good at money

90
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,660
and to be good at something you need to understand it

91
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,469
and to understand it, you need to talk about it.

92
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,680
So I'm very transparent with how much money I make

93
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,720
what I do with it.

94
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,560
But talk to your friends about mortgage rates

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,320
talk to your friends about how much money they make

96
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,710
what they're doing with it, where they lost money.

97
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,660
And people aren't transparent about it, especially

98
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,780
I think, about men.

99
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,260
We're supposed to be just, like, accidentally wealthy.

100
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,400
And to ever talk about our financial problems is to admit that we're not ballers or that we're not masculine.

101
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,000
And so I encourage people from a young age to start talking about money and understand it and be transparent about it.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,780
Where did you learn about money?

103
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,220
W- 'cause I think about my own life

104
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,720
and I think there's key moments of, quite frankly

105
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,460
luck.

106
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,690
Yeah.

107
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,700
Where I was exposed to information because I was invited into a room

108
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,700
physically, literally into a room, or I was

109
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,320
through no decision of my own, someone came into my life.

110
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,800
Yeah.

111
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,380
Um, or in my case, maybe one of the biggest blessings I ever had is when I went off

112
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,480
dropped outta university and pursued entrepreneurship- Yeah.

113
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,490
.

114
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:14,490
..

115
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,300
my brother decided to go be an investment banker for 11 years in London.

116
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,120
Yep.

117
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,080
And then, when I had my first exit

118
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,780
he messaged me one day and said, "Hey

119
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,490
I'll manage your money, and I'll quit my job and come work with you full-time.

120
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,500
" And that's my older brother.

121
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,940
So, like, life gave me the greatest gift anyone could ever have been given.

122
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,540
I- i- i- th- that, that, that rings so true.

123
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,660
So I think of three things as you said that.

124
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,540
The first is, the smartest thing I ever did was being born a white heterosexual male in California in the '60s.

125
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,190
Because it gave me unfair advantage.

126
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,150
It gave me access to free education in the University of California

127
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,330
and access, 76% admissions rate when I applied to UCLA.

128
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,440
The admissions rate this year is 9%.

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,260
I came of professional age in the '90s when the internet was coming online.

130
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,340
So I sorta had these winds at my back.

131
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,301
And also, uh, just to be blunt-.

132
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:02,570
..

133
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,580
everyone who was raising capital looked, smelled

134
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,000
and felt like me.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,500
They were all White heterosexual males.

136
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,909
And I didn't even realize at the time what privilege or unfair advantage I had.

137
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:14,760
So w- the first is just, just sheer luck.

138
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,640
The second is environmental.

139
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,200
I grew u- I was raised by a single immigrant mother who lived and died a secretary.

140
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:27,950
And people who don't grow up with mony- people who grow up with money just can't really truly empathize with what it's like to grow up without money.

141
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,650
I felt as if there was this ghost following me and my mom around

142
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,300
constantly whispering in our ear, "You're not worthy.

143
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,453
Your mom fucked up, which means y- you aren't worthy.

144
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:42,780
" And so I very early decided that I was

145
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,760
that economic security was really important to me.

146
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,710
And I wanna be clear, you can't make a decision to be wealthy

147
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,600
a lot of it is luck.

148
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,920
But I was gonna be very committed.

149
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,329
My goal in life from zero to 45 wasn't to be a good person

150
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:57,200
it wasn't to save the whales, it wasn't to

151
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,659
to have strong relationships, it was to get economic security.

152
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:03,250
So I started connecting the dots around money pretty early.

153
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,600
And then along the lines of what you were talking about

154
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,470
um, my mom had a boyfriend and

155
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,080
um, and people don't talk about this

156
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,850
you know how in certain dramas they reference a second family where a guy has an entirely other family despite the fact he's married?

157
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,930
My mom and I were that second family.

158
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,640
Her boyfriend for seven years was a wonderful man named Terry

159
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,030
really nice to me, spent every other weekend with us

160
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,520
super generous to me.

161
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,300
Uh, he was also married with another family

162
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,590
so we were that second family.

163
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,159
But he was a good man and he was

164
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,570
he was actually a good role model for me.

165
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,917
And one weekend I was asking him, "What is a stock?

166
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,140
" And I was 13.

167
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,710
And he said, "Here's $200.

168
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,820
" He gave me two crisp $100 bills and said

169
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,960
"Walk down to one of those stock brokerages

170
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,620
those fancy stock brokerages in Westwood Village, and buy some stock and if you don't buy it by Monday afternoon or by the time I'm back next weekend

171
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,320
I'm taking my money back.

172
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,400
" So at 13 I marched down to Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner Smith

173
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,760
was in the lobby, I was ignored

174
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,520
I got intimidated, I walked across the street to Dean Witter Reynolds

175
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,880
another brokerage, and this young guy named Si Cerro came walking out and said

176
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,500
"Hi, I'm Si Cerro," and he gave me my first lesson in the markets.

177
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,180
And I bought 14 shares of Columbia Pictures.

178
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,120
At 13 he gave you a lesson in the markets?

179
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,500
Yeah, at 13.

180
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:28,039
And every day, every weekday for the next three years from Emerson Junior High pay phone booth I put two dimes in and called Si and he would say

181
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,060
"'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' is a hit

182
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,058
which means that Columbia, uh, Studios is gonna make a lot of money

183
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,674
so people are buying more stock.

184
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:36,900
" And then I'd go into his office

185
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,159
I didn't, I didn't have a ton of friends

186
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,280
and so I would just swing by Dean Witter and he would always give me a lesson in the markets.

187
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,360
Had those two men not shown such generosity to you with their time and with that $200 bill

188
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,540
have you ever played out in your mind where you might be?

189
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,880
I think we all do that, like Sliding Doors

190
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,910
that movie, you know, things are s- th- eh

191
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,338
it's like, life is such a series of.

192
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:00,750
..

193
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:06,900
You know, I, I promised myself I was gonna approach this strange woman at the Raleigh Hotel in the middle of the day who was sitting by the pool

194
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,810
who was sitting there with another woman and another guy

195
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,020
and without the benefit of alcohol it's not easy to open

196
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,579
you know, a conversation with a strange woman.

197
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,480
And I walked out to get my car and I said

198
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,004
"I promised myself I was gonna speak to her

199
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,819
" I was very drawn to her, a beautiful woman.

200
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:21,960
So I went back in, I just rolled right up and I said

201
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,767
"Hi, I'm Scott, where are you guys from?

202
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,360
" And this was at the Raleigh Hotel.

203
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,310
Long story short, 18 months later our first son's middle name is Raleigh

204
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,040
right?

205
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,280
And what I tell people is that unless you're willing to take an uncomfortable risk

206
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,890
nothing wonderful is ever gonna happen to you.

207
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,350
I mean, a really uncomfortable risk.

208
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,920
What you're doing here is an uncomfortable risk

209
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,489
it's public failure if it doesn't work.

210
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,149
This podcast platform you're starting, you know

211
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,200
this, most people aren't willing to take these risks.

212
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,760
And a lot of this, not to get existential

213
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,600
a lot of this comes down to a huge unlock for me has been atheism.

214
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,140
I think I have a very solid grasp of the finite nature of life.

215
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,819
You're a young man, you're gonna be my age in an instant

216
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:59,960
and the thing you're gonna recognize is that

217
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,440
okay, in 30 or 40 years, everyone whose opinion you are worried about is gonna be dead.

218
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,610
And I have found that has been an enormous unlock for me

219
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,620
knowing that I'm gonna at some point sooner than I'd like look into my kids' eyes and know our relationship is coming to an end

220
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,700
so I'm comfortable expressing my emotions, or more comfortable.

221
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,860
I'm comfortable taking uncomfortable risks knowing that if I call someone and ask them to invest

222
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,420
if I approach a strange woman in a bar and introduce myself

223
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,380
if I call a, an employee who I would never think would consider working for me

224
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm not afraid of rejection because I realize everyone I'm worried about being shamed by is gonna be dead soon and so am I.

225
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,798
  And so why wouldn't you live out life.

226
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:40,030
..

227
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,370
w- wh- why wouldn't you live out loud?

228
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,700
Why wouldn't you squeeze so much juice from this

229
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,520
you know, uh, uh, lemon called life?

230
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
It's really been an enormous unlock for me

231
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,020
'cause the reality, Steve, is that most people are not willing to take uncomfortable risks that might result in public shaming.

232
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:02,970
It's embarrassing to get rejected by a pote- to express interest in someone and be sort of rejected.

233
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,470
It's embarrassing to try and raise money and be rejected.

234
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,270
It's embarrassing to start a business and not have it work.

235
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,579
The majority of people aren't willing to take those uncomfortable risks.

236
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:16,400
And the reason why you get outsized return as an entrepreneur

237
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,160
the reason why you get outsized returns when you're willing to approach strangers and ask for mentorship

238
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,500
friendship, express romantic interest, is because you are willing to endure rejection.

239
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,520
The most overcompensated people in any organization are the salespeople.

240
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,390
In terms of how hard and how smart they are

241
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,819
how hard they work and how smart they are relative to their compensation

242
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:45,020
hands down the most overcompensated people that everyone resents are the salespeople because they are willing to get out a big spoon and eat shit.

243
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,440
"Do not call me again.

244
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,680
Okay, so what you're saying is I should follow up in a couple weeks.

245
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,690
" Right?

246
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,880
 That type of rejection, that type of risk

247
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,819
that type of public failure, 99% of people are not willing to endure.

248
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,180
I ran for sophomore, junior, and senior class president in high school.

249
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:10,069
I lost all three times and based on my track record I decided I should run for student body president where I went o- went on to

250
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:11,347
wait for it, lose.

251
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:14,900
And it never really got in the way of my confidence

252
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,160
you know.

253
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,180
And that's the key.

254
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,050
If you want.

255
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,230
..

256
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,240
And unfortunately, young men are told, you know

257
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,170
"Don't try hard," or they feel like a loss of agency

258
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,655
or especially romantically, they're told, "Be careful in terms of expressing romantic interest.

259
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:34,820
" And if you don't know the difference between expressing interest and asking someone out for coffee and harassing them

260
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,500
you've got bigger problems.

261
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,180
But I think a lot of young men have feel like their agency has been taken away

262
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,770
they feel like the game is rigged so they're not trying

263
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,960
and quite frankly, they're spending much too

264
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,760
too much time on a screen or in their homes

265
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,790
so they're not putting themselves in a position to have something wonderful happen to them.

266
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:59,990
And then on a very basic level, I'm almost entirely sure that I can guarantee you that nothing really wonderful

267
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,060
I mean, really wonderful, is gonna happen to you inside of your home on a screen.

268
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,580
Your success is a function of your ability to endure rejection and increasingly

269
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,560
how much time you spend outside of your house off a screen.

270
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,020
What if you're not young?

271
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,840
Because what you described there, that h- all of that was me at 18.

272
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,140
Mm-hmm.

273
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,040
I had just dropped out of university after w- going to only one of the lectures.

274
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,160
And I had these four credit cards which had about

275
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,360
I think, combined about £1,000 on them.

276
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,480
Mm-hmm.

277
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,640
I'd maxed them all out.

278
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,960
My parents weren't speaking to me.

279
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm three hour, three hours away from home

280
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,460
roughly, up in Manchester.

281
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,440
More than that, six-hour round trip in Manchester.

282
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,680
And I'm 18, I've got no kids

283
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,190
no mortgage, no nothing and I'm in- Mm-hmm.

284
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,190
.

285
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,190
.

286
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,210
this room that I can't afford to pay for.

287
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,822
So in.

288
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:44,930
..

289
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,620
I was so clearly at the bottom with nothing to lose- Mm-hmm.

290
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:47,630
.

291
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:47,630
..

292
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,060
that every roll of the dice was a potential win.

293
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,070
Yeah.

294
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,300
So I was rolling that motherfucker.

295
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,420
But you kept rolling them.

296
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,410
Over and over and over- Yeah.

297
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:53,410
.

298
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:53,410
.

299
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,180
and over again.

300
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,440
Yeah.

301
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,020
But, but I, I, I wonder sometimes

302
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,760
'cause there's probably gonna be someone listening that's

303
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,200
you know, 47- Yep.

304
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,243
.

305
00:13:59,243 --> 00:13:59,250
..

306
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,960
three kids, mortgage- Yep.

307
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:00,970
.

308
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:00,970
..

309
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,870
comfortable job, just about cutting it every month

310
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,790
one holiday a year, experiencing the same dissatisfaction with their life

311
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,030
but- Yeah.

312
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,363
.

313
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:09,370
..

314
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,080
they can't roll like I could when I was 18.

315
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,860
Look, the reality is when you have kids

316
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,830
everything changes.

317
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,370
The, I think the, probably the darkest moment for me

318
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,400
maybe personally or professionally other than losing my mom

319
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,920
was the moment that was supposed to be the happiest and that was when my first son was born.

320
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,760
And you think that when this child, when you

321
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,120
you know, this child's introduced to the world

322
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,020
it's gonna be bright lights and angels singing.

323
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,340
For me, if, I felt humiliation and shame and fear because I had made a lot of money

324
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,240
but I had gone all in, and this is a lesson from the book

325
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,400
The Power of Diversification.

326
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,940
I'd gone all in on this one company

327
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,980
Red Envelope, which went public in 2002.

328
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,040
It was an e-commerce company I started.

329
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,380
And I thought and had been taught by the venture capital community that if you throw yourself at something and you're talented

330
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,000
and I thought, "I'm a baller, I'm really good at what I do

331
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,100
" you gotta go all in, and I kept investing every spare dollar I had and threw myself at this thing.

332
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,280
And then a strike at the port, a software glitch

333
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,320
and the credit crisis.

334
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,240
In 2008, our stock went from seven bucks to Chapter 11 in

335
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,300
like, three weeks.

336
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,180
And I ended up not being worth 10 or 12 million

337
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,620
but being worth, worth negative two million

338
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,320
'cause I was one of those idiots that borrowed against their stock to buy more stock.

339
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,240
Ah.

340
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,460
And then my child has the poor judgment

341
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,080
my oldest, to come marching out of my girlfriend

342
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,860
and the first thing I felt was failure on a massive level.

343
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,160
Like, my first emotion when my son was born was

344
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,990
"I have failed to live up to my core responsibility as a man

345
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,174
and that is to take care of my child.

346
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:40,720
" And it was just, it was just a really ugly emotion.

347
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,020
And that's a lesson in the book, and that is

348
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,080
the moment you aggregate anything resembling some sort of n- uh

349
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,710
decent amount of capital, you wanna look at it and you wanna diversify like crazy.

350
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:59,640
Because if I'd just taken a little bit of money off the table and invested in index funds or in real estate or bonds

351
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,920
I would've been so much better off.

352
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,260
But everyone's told, "You can have it all

353
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,580
you can, you, you know, y- y- you can be successful if you just go all in

354
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,805
never give up.

355
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:15,160
" Well, actually, the market will trump individual performance every time.

356
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,690
And last week, my, the investment I was most excited about

357
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,300
this healthcare tech startup, great CEO, tier one investors

358
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,320
elbowed my way into the deal.

359
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,140
I put five million bucks in.

360
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,720
I found out last Friday it's a zero.

361
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,760
It just didn't work.

362
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,980
Zero, shutting down.

363
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,640
But here's the thing.

364
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,920
I never invest more than 3% of my net worth now in any one thing.

365
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,400
So while it hurt, I have Kevlar in the form of diversification.

366
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,340
So I took a bullet to the chest

367
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,900
knocked me off my feet, I get up

368
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,580
I was bummed out for an hour, that was it

369
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,720
because I never go all in on something.

370
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,420
And people are taught, especially young people

371
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:59,580
especially men who are more risk aggressive, go all in on something because the people who are the wealthiest people in the world kind of went all in on something.

372
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,900
And what they don't tell you is the moment they have capital

373
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,990
they start diversifying like crazy.

374
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,140
So you wanna diversify.

375
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,319
You don't need to find the needle in haystack.

376
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,109
You can buy the whole haystack.

377
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,140
And especially, unfortunately, in the American economy

378
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,500
not as much in the UK economy, it continues to be up and to the right.

379
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:24,740
And the S&P and the NASDAQ are sort of self-filtering mechanisms because they kick out companies that aren't great and they bring in new ones.

380
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,530
They kick out Kodak and they bring in Salesforce.

381
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,630
If I had learned that diversification when I was a younger man

382
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,027
I would've saved myself.

383
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:32,250
..

384
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,520
Uh, not only would I be, have saved myself a lot of economic harm

385
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,180
I would've saved myself a lot of mental anguish.

386
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,920
So diversification, and that's one of the key components of my algebra of wealth

387
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,590
diversification, people don't recognize how powerful it is 'cause it sounds boring.

388
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,110
And you have people like Bill Ackman saying

389
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,300
"It's not concentration, it's conviction," you know

390
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,840
and then they beat on their chest, like

391
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,023
"Check out my shit.

392
00:17:57,023 --> 00:18:02,520
" No, diversify and get rich slowly, because here's the thing

393
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,868
life goes so goddamn fast, "Wow, life has gone slowly

394
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:08,120
" said no one ever.

395
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,660
Now, back to your person who's 40

396
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,727
45, they're gonna live another 40 years-They're probably gonna work another 30.

397
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,148
You wanna lean into your advantages.

398
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:20,328
Your advantages in your 20s are flexibility, you wanna workshop careers

399
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:22,808
find sone- find your talent, not your passion.

400
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:24,348
Start saving a little bit of money.

401
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:26,608
A little bit of money when you're young is a lot when you're older.

402
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:28,707
Try and develop that savings muscle.

403
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,068
A hundred bucks a month, a thousand bucks a month

404
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,687
oh my God, 25 hundred bucks a month

405
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,788
if you can do that in your 20s

406
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,498
you're gonna be fine when you're my age.

407
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:39,788
Even if you don't go double platinum or sell a book or be a baller in business

408
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:40,437
you're fine.

409
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:43,168
Your plan B is all set.

410
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:44,828
That's your advantage when you're in your 20s

411
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:45,588
is time.

412
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,528
When you get to your 40s, your advantage is the following.

413
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:54,668
One, hopefully you're in a relationship with a partner you can align with around financial

414
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,068
um, e- objectives, your approach to spending

415
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,368
your approach to earning.

416
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:00,408
Y- you can see the runway, "All right

417
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:03,508
I'm gonna retire in 30 years.

418
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:10,308
I need 15 to 25 times my, my nut to be in the bank to retire.

419
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:15,081
I spend about $120,000 a year, that 20 times that I would need 2.

420
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:16,341
4 million, I'm not.

421
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:16,519
..

422
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,028
" Now, work backwards.

423
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:21,148
How much would I need to save over the next 30 years to get to 2.

424
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:23,368
4 million, assuming 8% a year?

425
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:25,957
The landing lights are on, you can start to plan your life.

426
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:26,868
"I'm not gonna get there.

427
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:27,937
I can't save this much.

428
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:28,836
I got kids in college.

429
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,428
" Okay.

430
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:31,788
When do your kids go to college?

431
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:35,947
Can you take that burndown to 80 grand by moving to Mexico City or Costa Rica or to St.

432
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:36,848
Louis?

433
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:40,848
But you have the advantage of knowing your path.

434
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:45,408
Ideally, you have a career where you can make some money and start saving a little bit.

435
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:52,168
Ideally, you have a partner where you can get alignment around working together to get that financial security.

436
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:55,748
But most people in their 40s are under the impression their life is over.

437
00:19:55,748 --> 00:20:00,008
I mean, they're probably gonna live to be over a hundred

438
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:02,638
and i- it's so, okay, so you don't have 80 years

439
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:08,428
you only have 60 years left, but you still probably got another 30 years working and making money

440
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:11,088
and you kinda know what you need, right?

441
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,308
Uh, so I think there's advantages at every age

442
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:15,508
but this notion that it's too late for me

443
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:17,467
I'm in my 40s, I'm gonna ignore finances

444
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,408
no, bullshit.

445
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:21,268
You just need to have an adult conversation with yourself.

446
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:26,068
Do you think it makes sense then to go kind of risk on when you're young and then go diversified once you're older

447
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:28,207
'cause you just wanna highlight that for people that are

448
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,808
you know, uh, like I was when I was 18

449
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:33,808
to kinda go all in and to make those big bets when you have nothing to lose

450
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:35,248
and the minute you have something to lose

451
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:37,257
whether that's your mortgage, y- you know

452
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:40,348
you got children to take care of or now you've got wealth

453
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:41,328
to then go risk off.

454
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:43,308
Is that the kind of approach you would suggest to life?

455
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:49,168
I, I think generally speaking, you can't be as risk-aggressive when you have kids.

456
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:53,248
Um, when you're younger, look, if you screw up here

457
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:58,308
y- you're, you're, you're likable enough that you can probably find couches to live on f- for two years- .

458
00:20:58,308 --> 00:20:58,348
.

459
00:20:58,348 --> 00:20:58,388
..

460
00:20:58,388 --> 00:20:59,348
if you needed to.

461
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:02,408
If you like just got in over your skis

462
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:04,437
uh, you could find a way to dan- when you're young

463
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:05,798
you can dance between the raindrops.

464
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,507
I lived in New York, I had two

465
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:08,788
two roommates.

466
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:11,428
When I started my business, my girlfriend paid our rent

467
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:14,808
and I, because I didn't, I didn't have kids or dogs

468
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:18,788
there's just a certain level of responsibility and things you gotta take care of as you get older.

469
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:21,768
When you get a little bit older, don't go all in on anything.

470
00:21:21,768 --> 00:21:24,928
If you're gonna start a business, use other people's capital

471
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:27,376
ring-fence it, don't get seduced into.

472
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:27,628
..

473
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:32,908
The worst thing that can happen in your 30s and 40s is you start a business and you start failing slowly

474
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:33,967
you just don't know.

475
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:41,028
The worst type of business is one that gives you just enough green signals that you keep investing more time and more money.

476
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:43,748
The red envelope, people, that's what people know me for

477
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:45,707
that's the worst thing that can happen to somebody

478
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:47,088
'cause it failed slowly.

479
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:50,088
It failed over 11 years.

480
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:53,288
I started an e-commerce incubator in New York backed by Goldman Sachs

481
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:58,447
Maveron, um, JPMorgan, it was out of business in eight months 'cause of the dot-com meltdown.

482
00:21:58,447 --> 00:21:59,388
That's a blessing.

483
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:01,428
The best thing that can happen is success

484
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:06,548
the second-best thing is fast failure, the worst thing that can happen to you is slow failure.

485
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:09,447
You can't have slow failure when you're 30s and 40s.

486
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,648
So, you wanna make sure that if you go in on something

487
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:13,908
you ring-fence it, "I'm leaving my job

488
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:15,568
I'm gonna try and start my own business

489
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,278
I'm gonna spend two years doing it.

490
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:19,598
A certain amount of capital, no more than maybe 10

491
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:26,518
20% of my capital," because hitting a wall and failing at 50 is

492
00:22:26,518 --> 00:22:30,277
is much more devastating than hitting a wall or failing at 25 or 30.

493
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:31,318
You can get up again.

494
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:32,207
You're fine.

495
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:35,148
You can press the restart button a bunch of times

496
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:39,628
so you wanna take advantage of that in your 20s and 30s and workshop a bunch of things.

497
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:41,678
I'm not saying hop around.

498
00:22:41,678 --> 00:22:43,268
I'm not saying, "Well, oh, I don't love this

499
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:46,348
it's not my passion," no, that probably means it's just work

500
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:50,608
but if you're not making progress, if you're not making money

501
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:53,507
if you're not getting roles in films, if you're not

502
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:56,788
if everything's just really hard, really hard

503
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:58,248
you're in a position at that age to say

504
00:22:58,248 --> 00:22:59,268
"You know what?

505
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:02,962
I'm gonna leave Milan and move to Munich or I'm going to Dubai.

506
00:23:02,962 --> 00:23:06,648
" You have flexibility when you're young, you have geographic flexibility.

507
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:08,428
Lean into your advantage.

508
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:13,987
It's a heck of a lot easier right now to make money in Dubai than it is in Curaças

509
00:23:13,987 --> 00:23:14,487
right?

510
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:20,548
You'd rather be good in a great economy than outstanding in a mediocre economy.

511
00:23:20,548 --> 00:23:22,328
You have geographic flexibility.

512
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:25,707
Lean into your advantages, your flexibility, your ability to recover

513
00:23:25,707 --> 00:23:27,328
your ability to workshop.

514
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:29,447
What would you do if one of your sons said to you

515
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:30,447
how many sons have you got now?

516
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:31,007
I got two.

517
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:31,618
You got two sons, right?

518
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,187
That I know of.

519
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:33,568
 that you know of.

520
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:35,007
One of your sons comes to you and says

521
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:37,428
"Dad, I would like to be a

522
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:39,868
I've read your book, um, all of your books

523
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:41,358
and I think they're great, but Dad

524
00:23:41,358 --> 00:23:45,337
I'd love to be a professional actor-" Yeah.

525
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:45,337
.

526
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:45,337
.

527
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:46,628
and then your other son came to you and said

528
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:49,106
"I wanna be a musician.

529
00:23:49,106 --> 00:23:51,728
" I don't wanna crush anybody's dreams.

530
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:54,348
Uh, I'd go for it, I'll be supportive

531
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:57,768
um, but this industry, let's just look at the economics.

532
00:23:57,768 --> 00:24:01,828
Musician and acting has a 99% unemployment rate

533
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:07,848
so you gotta be in the 1%, and I want you to set up benchmarks for determining what it means to be in the top 1%

534
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:08,428
right?

535
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:13,510
80, uh, the most talented actors in the world are in a union called SAG-AFTRA.

536
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,871
And by the way, it's not easy to get your union card.

537
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,411
You gotta be in a Broadway play, you gotta be recognized.

538
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:19,472
That's a big moment.

539
00:24:19,472 --> 00:24:21,562
It's like getting your PGA golf tour card

540
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:22,331
right?

541
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:24,794
You get your SAG-AFTRA card, it means you're one of the 180

542
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:27,371
000 most talented creatives in the world.

543
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:33,007
Last year, 83% of them didn't have health insurance 'cause they didn't make more than $23

544
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,012
000.

545
00:24:34,012 --> 00:24:37,572
So, you not only need to be in the top 17% just to have health insurance

546
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:39,472
you probably need to be in the top 10%

547
00:24:39,472 --> 00:24:42,012
realistically the top 1%.

548
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:43,472
I know a lot of working actors.

549
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:45,389
If I said, "This is the guy from this show

550
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:48,122
" you'd be like, "Oh my God, that guy's amazing?

551
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:50,212
" He's not making a lot of money.

552
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:52,012
I mean, everybody talks about Tom Cruise.

553
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:53,972
The majority of working actors, you would say

554
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:55,232
"Oh, I know that woman, I know that man.

555
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:56,129
They're great.

556
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:57,972
" They make an okay living.

557
00:24:57,972 --> 00:25:01,532
If they had achieved that level of excellence in almost any other industry

558
00:25:01,532 --> 00:25:07,572
they'd be, they'd own a house and a second house in Ibiza.

559
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,640
So, if you wanna be an athlete

560
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,522
an actor, a model, an artist, open a restaurant

561
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:15,432
open a nightclub, have a jewelry line

562
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:18,591
be a fashion designer, I don't wanna crush anyone's dreams

563
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:25,381
but let's have a sober conversation that if you aren't getting bright green lights that you're in the top 1% really quickly

564
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:28,972
and we put some guardrails on it, we're gonna do this for two years

565
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:32,502
three years, can't pay your rent in two or three years

566
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:34,512
Dad's gonna stop paying your rent at some point

567
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:36,431
or maybe I'll continue to pay your rent

568
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:39,472
but I need you to start workshopping another career.

569
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:45,712
Because here's the thing, people of- young people oftentimes mistake their hobbies for their passions.

570
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,212
And what I would suggest is, and what I can guarantee you

571
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:52,351
is being successful at anything, passion comes from mastery.

572
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,192
Mastery comes from being a ninja at something.

573
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:58,292
I'm renovating a house and there's this guy installing our soapstone

574
00:25:58,292 --> 00:25:59,341
who's the soapstone guy.

575
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:01,931
He's an Iraqi immigrant, dropped out of high school.

576
00:26:01,931 --> 00:26:04,202
He knows everything about so- soapstone.

577
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:08,111
He can talk to you about the vein in the soapstone and which quarries.

578
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:09,033
And, and he makes.

579
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:09,141
..

580
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,012
I've been very open with him.

581
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:11,592
I've talked about it in my book, he made 1.

582
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:13,702
3 million pounds last year.

583
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,181
He's the soapstone guy.

584
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:17,202
I can't imagine when he was a kid

585
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,742
he and I bonded over football.

586
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:19,822
I would bet, I don't know this

587
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:24,261
I would bet he dreamt of being a football star and playing for Iraq in the World Cup at some point.

588
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:25,821
I doubt at the age of 17, he thought

589
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:26,571
"My.

590
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:26,922
..

591
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:33,412
I'm hoping in 15 years I'm installing soapstone and renovations for American douchebags in Marylebone.

592
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:35,732
" I can't imagine that was his dream

593
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:36,611
right?

594
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:37,401
But here's the thing.

595
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:40,472
He has an amazing life, he takes care of his kids

596
00:26:40,472 --> 00:26:46,512
he takes care of his parents, he gets to take amazing vacations with his wife

597
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:50,452
which makes him passionate about soapstone.

598
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:53,712
So yeah, go be a fashion designer.

599
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:57,891
But let's be honest, if you're not making enough money to pay your rent within two years

600
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:00,041
and you're not making enough money to say

601
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:03,952
form a family in five years, we're gonna workshop something else.

602
00:27:03,952 --> 00:27:07,212
This requires such a mindset shift in the current world

603
00:27:07,212 --> 00:27:10,681
because obviously the slot machine, the casino

604
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:14,621
the Las Vegas of validation is Instagram and TikTok.

605
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:14,702
That's right.

606
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:18,472
Now, if I announce on Instagram that I'm a tax lawyer

607
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,562
for the next f- 10 years- Not a great Instagram page.

608
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:20,562
.

609
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:20,562
.

610
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:22,131
it's not gonna increase my chance of getting laid either.

611
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:25,532
But if I say that I am, I don't know

612
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:29,032
if I say that I'm part of Chelsea Football Club

613
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:31,380
I'm in the, you know, the Junior Academy- Yeah.

614
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,387
.

615
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:31,401
..

616
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,212
or if I say that I'm starting a business

617
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:36,871
I'm probably gonna get laid more in the next 10 years.

618
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:44,812
Well, the only pushback I would get is that you have to be one of the 10 best soccer players in the world that year to play for Chelsea.

619
00:27:44,812 --> 00:27:48,151
That is really hard.

620
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:49,164
That is really.

621
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:49,282
..

622
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:51,232
That means you're the best player in Senegal

623
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:52,792
and then you go.

624
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:53,192
..

625
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:57,172
I mean, you just have to be godlike talented.

626
00:27:57,172 --> 00:28:04,712
The best 10% of tax lawyers, that's tens of thousands of them

627
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:08,472
fly private and get laid more than you think

628
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:10,788
because they fly private and they can afford.

629
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:10,982
..

630
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:15,172
They can find someone and give them a wonderful life.

631
00:28:15,172 --> 00:28:17,741
So, uh, I mean, look, in a capitalist.

632
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:17,802
..

633
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:19,631
I'm not saying this is how the world should be.

634
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,262
I'm saying this is how the world is.

635
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:27,192
Economic security provides you with all sorts of opportunities for experiences

636
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:36,652
for relationships, for romantic opportunities, and it is sexy to be great at anything and get economic security from anything.

637
00:28:36,652 --> 00:28:42,631
And I can't tell you, I love taking care of my kids 'cause at one point I was worried about my ability to take care of my kids

638
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:46,411
and not worry about it, and this is where happiness comes from.

639
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:49,152
It's great to be in a prestige industry and be a baller.

640
00:28:49,152 --> 00:28:51,272
I get reward from some of the fame I have right now.

641
00:28:51,272 --> 00:29:04,131
I'm sure you get reward from it, but the thing that is really rewarding as you get older is I can lean into my relationships with my sons and I don't have that economic fear I had the first time my son came marching out on my girlfriend.

642
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:05,572
That is so rewarding.

643
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,391
I can take care of my dad.

644
00:29:07,391 --> 00:29:08,692
I don't have to worry about it.

645
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:13,431
My, my dad's 90, gonna be 94 in a few weeks

646
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:15,331
and he lives in a really nice home

647
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:19,272
and he has a full-time kind of health aide

648
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:22,492
and it's about a quarter of a million dollars a year to take care of my dad.

649
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:25,052
And if you look at, okay, that's post-tax

650
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:27,050
there's no tax credit for it, so it's about $400

651
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,052
000 in pre-tax income.

652
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:32,472
My sister, who does really well, but not as well as me

653
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:33,402
we have a great partnership.

654
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:36,492
She handles it logistically, I handle the money

655
00:29:36,492 --> 00:29:40,631
and being able to do that and not have it be a source of stress in my life

656
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:43,641
and know that my dad is taken care of well

657
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:46,732
okay, i- i- uh, it'd be great to be a football player

658
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:48,242
trust me, when you get to my age

659
00:29:48,242 --> 00:29:50,072
that feels really good.

660
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:52,052
That feels really nice.

661
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:54,792
And the m- the, the, the means to the ends

662
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,154
the means.

663
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:55,222
..

664
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:56,431
Money is a means.

665
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:57,532
It's really important.

666
00:29:57,532 --> 00:30:00,492
It's hard to be happy in a capitalist society with economic stress.

667
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:10,601
The standing blood- the resting blood pressure of kids in low-income homes is higher than kids in middle and upper mid because they sense the anxiety from Mom and Dad.

668
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:18,732
I remember, you know, losing my jacket when I was in the eighth grade and it was gonna be just a horrible day 'cause I had to go home and tell my mom jackets cost 33 bucks

669
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:21,364
all in my head, very upsetting.

670
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:21,594
..

671
00:30:21,594 --> 00:30:25,100
. the ability to take care of your kids

672
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,060
your parents, do wonderful things.

673
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:34,100
Money a- affords you so many wonderful things that getting to a certain level of economic security is the means.

674
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:43,240
But the ends, the reason you get to economic securities is so you can free up and be free of anxiety and have some additional time so you can focus on the ends.

675
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,350
And the ends is deep and meaningful relationships.

676
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,300
I spend the majority of my money on travel and experiences with my family and friends.

677
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,020
I spend a shit ton of money, and I absolutely love it.

678
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,000
There's no reason to hoard money.

679
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,740
Once I hit my number, I hit my number seven years ago

680
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,858
and I started thinking, "I could be a billionaire.

681
00:31:03,858 --> 00:31:05,260
" What was your number?

682
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,720
Uh, my number was 100 million.

683
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,269
Mm-hmm.

684
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:10,290
Uh, by the way, my number when I got out of college was a million

685
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,820
and then by my 30s, I thought

686
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,168
"Well, if I had 10 million, I'm done.

687
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:16,630
" And then things got so expensive and my greed glands kept going

688
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,710
and my number was 100 million.

689
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,260
Why have a number?

690
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,340
Why did, why do people listening need to create a number?

691
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,660
What's the value of having that sort of line in the sand?

692
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,800
Well, you need a goal, and you need to be thoughtful about how much money you're gonna need.

693
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,570
So if you figure out I'm gonna need a

694
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,960
I'm gonna need 80,000 pounds a year to live.

695
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,800
Uh, uh, the definition of rich is having a ton of shit and impress your friends.

696
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:49,260
The definition of wealth is knowing that the passive income that you would get from growth from your stocks or dividends or incomes or rental income is greater than your burn.

697
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,840
So you work, you work out of d- out of

698
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,660
uh, a option, or you work because you want to

699
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,490
not 'cause you need to.

700
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,540
That's the definition of wealth.

701
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,550
So having a number is just backward integrating into

702
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:08,720
okay, um, I want to have at least $3 million a l- a year to live the life I wanna live.

703
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,120
All right?

704
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,060
Assuming a 4% return, that means I need $75 million.

705
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,040
So I round it up to 100 million

706
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,840
right?

707
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,540
I got exceptionally lucky to get there.

708
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,420
By the way, see above.

709
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,360
In 2008, I was broke.

710
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,550
I was broke at the age of 42

711
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,160
43.

712
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,680
That did not feel good.

713
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,200
I got very lucky, started a company

714
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,320
bull market the last 16 years, right place

715
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,010
right time, exceptionally lucky.

716
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,220
But you should be able, you should have a number.

717
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,560
You should say, "This is the amount of money I need

718
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,851
and once I get to this number, enjoy it and start giving it away.

719
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:43,441
" We, we really need to.

720
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:43,609
..

721
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:45,500
'Cause I'm thinking about.

722
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:45,920
..

723
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,680
The lens that I kind of think about this conversation through is

724
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,520
like, different stages in my own journey and the advice that I would have wanted from you at different steps in my journey.

725
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,840
And I, I just flashed back to working in those call centers

726
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,588
where I was making just about enough money to.

727
00:32:57,588 --> 00:32:57,900
..

728
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,820
Well, to be fair, if I'm being completely honest

729
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,380
I did have disposable income.

730
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,980
But I, when I was poor, I was reckless with my money.

731
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,440
Mm-hmm.

732
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,020
So I would get the 500 pound disposable income on payday

733
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,930
leave the call center, go and buy a 400- Magical.

734
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:10,930
.

735
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:10,930
.

736
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,920
pound TV- Yeah.

737
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:11,930
.

738
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:11,930
..

739
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:15,780
flat-screen TV, and put it in a room where the TV was as big as the wall of my room.

740
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,420
Right.

741
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,410
And I, I'm trying to, I'm really trying to zoom in on that person who is so far away from nine figures- Yeah.

742
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:21,410
.

743
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:21,410
.

744
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,575
and they're like, "Okay, Scott, I wanna be Scott Galloway.

745
00:33:23,575 --> 00:33:23,630
" Yeah.

746
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,630
So what is the set of steps or the mindset

747
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,609
the fishing rod I need- Got it.

748
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:26,609
.

749
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:26,609
.

750
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:29,820
in my mind to become Scott Galloway, nine figures?

751
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,680
Well, the first is, the first is

752
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,060
some of it is luck.

753
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,729
A l- again, a lot of my success in.

754
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:34,790
..

755
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,380
If I had been born in Europe, I don't think I'd have that number.

756
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,549
Europe's not as forgiving of entrepreneurs that have failed.

757
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:40,860
I've had a lot of failure.

758
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,000
If I lived in China, I think there's a decent chance I'd be in jail.

759
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,600
So the smartest, again, the smartest thing I've ever done was being born in California in the '60s.

760
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,530
So you're saying to move?

761
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,420
Does that matter?

762
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:49,960
What's that?

763
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,820
Should I move city?

764
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,180
Like- Oh, if you're young, the first thing you want to do is to get to one of 20 supercities.

765
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,767
If you're.

766
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:55,889
..

767
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,420
I'm just talking about someone who wants to be an economic animal

768
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:58,980
right?

769
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,600
Uh, you might-  Who doesn't?

770
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,320
Okay, but it's, uh, some people might say

771
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,970
"Scott, it's your way or it's not the right way.

772
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,659
I wanna teach, coach football in my little village outside

773
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,300
uh, in the Amalfi Coast.

774
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,380
I can make 55,000 euros working, running a small bakery and have a really nice life.

775
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,940
" Or- I don't think they would have clicked.

776
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,810
More power to you.

777
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,560
That's not the majority of the people I hang out with.

778
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,620
Majority of the young people I hear from realize that capitalism

779
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,250
that wealth equals relevance and love in a capitalist society

780
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,909
and they wanna be economically very secure.

781
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:35,670
The easiest thing, the best piece of advice is

782
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,150
one, get credentialed.

783
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,969
We live in a LinkedIn economy.

784
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:43,489
What you did, your success is especially impressive because on average

785
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:48,219
people who get a college degree earn 50 to 100% more over the course of their life.

786
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:54,460
There's an entire set of industries that are off-limits to people that don't have credentialing.

787
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,370
I went to work for Morgan Stanley.

788
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,590
We not only didn't hire people without college degrees

789
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,380
we didn't hire people that didn't go to one of eight universities when I applied.

790
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,760
Eight.

791
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,560
You had to g- not only go to college

792
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,100
you had to go to one of eight colleges to get a job at Morgan Stanley at that time.

793
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,080
So if you can, get credentialing.

794
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,220
The second thing, not everyone's cut out for college.

795
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,680
I get that.

796
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,540
The second thing is get to a supercity.

797
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,710
Two thirds of all economic growth over the next 30 years is gonna take place in one of 20 cities.

798
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,220
So if you're really in that small town in Italy

799
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,510
you wanna get to Milan as quickly as possible

800
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:31,730
and then, if you can, you wanna get to London as quickly as possible or Munich or a bigger city.

801
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,820
And then, quite frankly, if you have total geographic agility and flexibility

802
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,720
ignoring the ridiculous INS of the US, you wanna get to New York or San Francisco

803
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,100
because to be good in San Francisco is much better than being amazing in Stuttgart.

804
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,515
 The amount of economic.

805
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:49,670
..

806
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,520
Here's the thing.

807
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,020
I'm, I'm a mediocre, I'm a mediocre surfer.

808
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,600
I've even, actually even given it up.

809
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,900
But when I was young and I used to go to Hawaii and the waves were perfect

810
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,950
I started believing I was a good surfer.

811
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,160
Or I go to Aspen after a fresh coat of snow and I'm like

812
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,297
"I'm a decent skier.

813
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,230
" No, you're not.

814
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,260
The snow and the waves are fucking amazing.

815
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,000
Anyone could be a good skier in this shit.

816
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,380
Get to where the waves and the snow are amazing

817
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,420
and that's, generally speaking, in cities.

818
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,480
And when you're young, you can be in a city 'cause you can live in a 400-square-foot apartment.

819
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,960
You can be out of the house all day.

820
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,630
You can dance between the raindrops and make money.

821
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,852
But when you are in a city.

822
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:25,969
..

823
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:28,680
You know how when you play tennis, if you play with someone much better than you

824
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,980
it elevates your game?

825
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,300
Mm-hmm.

826
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,850
When you're in a city, you're playing against Serena Williams every day.

827
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,826
Everyone is smart.

828
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:38,546
Everyone is well-dressed.

829
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:40,356
Everyone is working hard.

830
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:45,626
Everyone is taking chances, and you are surrounded by people who are very successful

831
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:49,676
and you are gonna bump off professional and personal opportunity every day.

832
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:52,786
Do it while you're young, 'cause when you start collecting dogs and kids

833
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:57,486
as I did in my 30s, I could no longer afford to stay in New York.

834
00:36:57,486 --> 00:36:59,796
So I had to move to Delray Beach in Florida.

835
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:02,296
When I say have to, we had a wonderful life down there.

836
00:37:02,296 --> 00:37:07,416
There's not a fraction of the opportunities in Delray Beach for someone in their 20s and 30s.

837
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:11,456
Now, I already had professional momentum, but Sunday to Thursday night

838
00:37:11,456 --> 00:37:14,236
I was commuting to New York, 'cause that's where the action was.

839
00:37:14,236 --> 00:37:18,916
So one, credentialing, but two, absolutely get to one of 20 supercities.

840
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,276
When you say 20 supercities, I- I thinking now

841
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:26,296
we're having this conversation in a world where AI seems to be the biggest topic of conversation.

842
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:26,306
Yeah.

843
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:28,636
It seems to be ripping up m- many industries.

844
00:37:28,636 --> 00:37:30,216
But, uh, I also reflect on that and I go

845
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:32,256
where is the AI opportunity gonna be?

846
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:35,696
If that is the biggest wave coming into shore in terms of opportunity

847
00:37:35,696 --> 00:37:39,196
um, should I be playing my sort of geographical

848
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:42,576
um, decision-making based on artificial intelligence?

849
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:44,646
'Cause everyone's raving about how big of an opportunity that is.

850
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:48,496
And technology generally over the next 10 years seems like it's really gonna eat up a lot of

851
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:49,936
uh, industry.

852
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:50,136
Yeah.

853
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:52,976
I don't, I don't know if it'd be possible to determine geography based on AI.

854
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:55,386
What I would say is, okay, you know

855
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:55,828
every.

856
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:55,946
..

857
00:37:55,946 --> 00:37:58,516
Literally, uh, a third of my class

858
00:37:58,516 --> 00:38:02,746
NYU, they get on a plane for San Francisco the day they graduate.

859
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:07,456
There's just, uh, within a seven-mile radius of San Francisco International Airport

860
00:38:07,456 --> 00:38:13,076
there's been more wealth created I think in the last six months than

861
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:16,376
than Germany's created in the last decade.

862
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:19,556
NVIDIA is worth more than the entire UK stock market.

863
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:21,556
NVIDIA is, they make the, they're basically

864
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:23,516
they make the brains for artificial intelligence.

865
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:28,536
They make a GPU, which is essentially a microchip that powers all of AI right now.

866
00:38:28,536 --> 00:38:31,216
And no one can buy them fast enough.

867
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:33,166
Now, they have 30,000 people.

868
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:37,406
I would bet 10 or 15,000 of them are worth at least $10 million now.

869
00:38:37,406 --> 00:38:38,536
Right?

870
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:39,206
Because?

871
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:42,176
Because the 30,000 employees got stock options.

872
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:46,616
And when a company goes from, from 300 billion to three trillion

873
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,876
it means everyone is getting rich.

874
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:53,976
That doesn't happen that often in Dortmund.

875
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:56,096
 It doesn't happen that often.

876
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:57,116
It doesn't happen.

877
00:38:57,116 --> 00:38:58,516
I'm being kind.

878
00:38:58,516 --> 00:38:58,756
Right?

879
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:01,136
You grow up in Ingolstadt, you either go to work for Audi

880
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:03,336
nothing wrong with that, make a good living.

881
00:39:03,336 --> 00:39:06,918
But if you're young and you think, "I really want to get in front of the biggest waves

882
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:08,756
" you wanna go to one of several cities.

883
00:39:08,756 --> 00:39:10,396
You wanna have the winds at your back.

884
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,136
So if you're young, what do you have?

885
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:14,116
You have agility geographically.

886
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:16,576
But going back, you initially asked me

887
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:17,436
"What's the algorithm?

888
00:39:17,436 --> 00:39:18,110
What are the steps?

889
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,094
" And I tried to.

890
00:39:19,094 --> 00:39:19,306
..

891
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:20,636
Uh, the book's called The Algebra of Wealth.

892
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:22,296
I tried to distill it down to a

893
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:25,596
uh, a small number of, of features.

894
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,596
The first is focus.

895
00:39:27,596 --> 00:39:29,356
Go all in on something.

896
00:39:29,356 --> 00:39:30,976
Once you find, you workshop in your 20s

897
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:33,156
once you find something you're really good at

898
00:39:33,156 --> 00:39:35,236
that you could be in the top 1% at

899
00:39:35,236 --> 00:39:37,166
and here's the key part, as we referenced before

900
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,576
that has a 90-plus percent employment rate.

901
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:43,526
And 90% of industries have that.

902
00:39:43,526 --> 00:39:47,556
But if you can be in the top 10% of an industry that has a 90-plus percent employment rate

903
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:49,696
you're gonna make really good money.

904
00:39:49,696 --> 00:39:51,016
First thing, focus.

905
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:52,556
Try not to have side hustles.

906
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,816
If you have a side hustle, it means your main hustle isn't working.

907
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:57,396
Use side hustle to workshop new main hustles.

908
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,616
But once you find something you're really good at

909
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:01,996
go all in on it.

910
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:03,456
Can I pause there just as we keep going?

911
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:08,056
'Cause I want to just provide counterarguments just in case that certain people are objecting in their own minds.

912
00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:12,216
Uh, I think about me in the Southwest of England as I grew up

913
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:14,486
and I was in Plymouth working in a McDonald's.

914
00:40:14,486 --> 00:40:15,396
I worked there for two days.

915
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:15,836
Mm-hmm.

916
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:18,876
But I worked in retail and shops and stuff.

917
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:20,596
What I had at that moment, I

918
00:40:20,596 --> 00:40:23,516
in hindsight, was a void of information.

919
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:26,488
So.

920
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:28,416
..

921
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,845
M- I could only work at, like

922
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:34,336
a clothing store and a McDonald's because I didn't have any other information.

923
00:40:34,336 --> 00:40:36,536
And if a kid hasn't gone to university or if someone listening to this haven't

924
00:40:36,536 --> 00:40:39,196
hasn't got the information and they've stumbled across

925
00:40:39,196 --> 00:40:40,876
across this podcast, but they're working in

926
00:40:40,876 --> 00:40:43,236
I don't know, like a equivalent of a Wendy's or a Burger King

927
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:44,316
for example- Mm-hmm.

928
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:44,339
.

929
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:44,345
..

930
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:47,276
and they just, like, "How do I get out of this Burger King

931
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:49,136
Scott?

932
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:51,272
I'm a cashier at Burger King.

933
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:51,716
" Yeah.

934
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:52,568
Look, I, I don't.

935
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:52,646
..

936
00:40:52,646 --> 00:40:55,296
Uh, I, I want to be clear.

937
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:00,756
I think there is a certain downside to the notion that we live in a meritocracy

938
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:02,896
and it creates a lot of rage and shame among young people

939
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:05,196
and that is the notion that, in America especially

940
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,476
anyone can be anything.

941
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:07,676
Well, not really, boss.

942
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:11,496
'Cause the problem with thinking we live in a meritocracy is that if you don't make it

943
00:41:11,496 --> 00:41:12,646
you fucked up.

944
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:13,636
It's your fault.

945
00:41:13,636 --> 00:41:14,376
Yeah.

946
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:16,276
And there's dignity in every work.

947
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:21,716
What I would say to someone working at a Burger King or in fast food that wants something bigger

948
00:41:21,716 --> 00:41:22,888
work really.

949
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:22,966
..

950
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:24,536
I was on the board of Panera Bread

951
00:41:24,536 --> 00:41:26,376
which is a fast food chain or quick service.

952
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:27,186
They call it QSR.

953
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:36,676
They don't like the term f- Someone who is hardworking and showed up at work every day on time and worked with their colleagues and acted like they owned the place

954
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:41,596
probably within two years could be managing the place and making 60 or 80 grand a year.

955
00:41:41,596 --> 00:41:43,186
Now, I'm not suggesting you go all

956
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:46,356
all in on food, but there's always dignity in work.

957
00:41:46,356 --> 00:41:54,476
There's always opportunity for people who work hard and act like owners and are good people and try and look out for other people and are good managers.

958
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:56,776
That might just be for you a means to an end

959
00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:59,806
where you're workshopping other stuff to say, "How do I get to

960
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:00,436
to school?

961
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:02,126
How do I get to training?

962
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:03,886
How do I find a better job?

963
00:42:03,886 --> 00:42:08,326
How do I save for a one-year apprenticeship program to become an electrician?

964
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,689
How do I start meeting people?

965
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:11,136
" You gotta pay your bills.

966
00:42:11,136 --> 00:42:12,566
There's dignity in all work.

967
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:15,476
I coach a lot of young men, and the first thing I say is

968
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:16,424
"You gotta start making some money.

969
00:42:16,424 --> 00:42:18,931
" And they're like, "I'm not gonna work at CVS or at McDonald's.

970
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:22,521
" I'm like, "Yeah, you are, 'cause you need a taste for flesh.

971
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:26,036
" The best way to make a lot of money is to start making a little bit of money.

972
00:42:26,036 --> 00:42:27,436
But have a plan.

973
00:42:27,436 --> 00:42:29,726
"I want to be the assistant manager of this McDonald's.

974
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:33,256
I want to save enough money so I can go back to school.

975
00:42:33,256 --> 00:42:39,428
I want to save enough money so I can move to Dubai or move to London and get a job there that might be higher paying.

976
00:42:39,428 --> 00:42:47,216
" Is there anything about the CVS or the Burger King or the whatever that I should be looking at to check that it has room for me to grow there?

977
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:48,046
Is there anything that.

978
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:48,146
..

979
00:42:48,146 --> 00:42:50,516
You know, if we're starting by making a little bit of money- Yeah.

980
00:42:50,516 --> 00:42:50,526
.

981
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:50,526
..

982
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:55,156
is there any good place to make a little bit of money versus a bad place to make a little bit of money?

983
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,036
Well, growth sort of solves all problems.

984
00:42:58,036 --> 00:43:01,460
So if you're working at a Chipotle-Doug McMillon

985
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,819
who is the CEO of Walmart, started st-

986
00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:05,319
uh, loading trucks.

987
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:07,400
He worked in the loading docks.

988
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,840
But he was also working for the retailer that grew faster than any retailer in history.

989
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,580
So is your company growing?

990
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,740
Uh, first thing, growth kind of solves all problems

991
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,250
right?

992
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:25,000
If you were mediocre at Google, you did a lot better than if you were great at General Motors the last 20 years

993
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,080
because one was growing, one wasn't.

994
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,190
So is it growing?

995
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,350
Two, is more situational.

996
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:34,140
Do I have someone who is emotionally invested in my success here?

997
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,340
Is the manager of the store like me and saying

998
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,395
"Keep doing this, I'm gonna get you an assistant manager job at the store down the street?

999
00:43:40,395 --> 00:43:42,810
" Am I learning, right?

1000
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,500
Am I getting skills that challenge me?

1001
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,980
Is this a little bit hard?

1002
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,900
That's okay.

1003
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,040
Is it stressful?

1004
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,819
That's okay too.

1005
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:50,480
You don't want stress?

1006
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,020
Go be a security guard in a parking lot.

1007
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,560
No stress, no upside.

1008
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,080
The market is really good at trading up.

1009
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,420
The more stressful and intense, and like

1010
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,840
"God, I can't keep up here," that probably means you're learning

1011
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,348
that probably means you're gonna make more money.

1012
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,040
So am I learning?

1013
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,569
Do I have senior level sponsorship?

1014
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:07,319
Am I at a company that's growing?

1015
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,380
Am I in a city where there's economic vitality?

1016
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,380
Do I have flow?

1017
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:17,630
Flow of interesting people, flow of interesting friends that I might start another business with

1018
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,380
flow of potential rem- One in three relationships begin at work

1019
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,819
and every HR has hairs on fi- HR manager's hair is on fire right now.

1020
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:26,980
One in three relationships begin at work.

1021
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,480
We don't talk about that.

1022
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,420
A third of all relationships begin at work

1023
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,460
and 99% of them are consensual, right?

1024
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,380
Young people have to find a place to

1025
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,680
to find other mates, if you will.

1026
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,440
But there's a ser- And then, more importantly

1027
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,460
I think than all of this, is assembling a kitchen cabinet of people that will

1028
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,259
you can be really honest with.

1029
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:50,740
"I'm working at Burger King, I think I'm doing pretty well there.

1030
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,614
They wanna make me.

1031
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:51,824
..

1032
00:44:51,824 --> 00:44:54,580
" Managers at In-N-Out Burger make about 110

1033
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,400
$120,000 a year in, in the US

1034
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,880
and they're even given a chance to participate in profit sharing.

1035
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,660
And I'm not suggesting being in fast food the rest of your life

1036
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,950
but have a plan.

1037
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,100
And then you gotta have a kitchen cabinet.

1038
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,558
Put together a group of three, four people who know you

1039
00:45:10,558 --> 00:45:13,140
who you trust you, and you can be totally transparent

1040
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,160
"This is how much money I'm making.

1041
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,189
These are my opportunities.

1042
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:17,020
These are, this is what I'm good at

1043
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,220
what I'm not good at.

1044
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,177
What do you think I should do?

1045
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:20,680
" And who are those people in terms of

1046
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,360
are they people that are ahead of you in

1047
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,210
in the race of life?

1048
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:23,937
Or are they.

1049
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:24,129
..

1050
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:27,080
First off, don't approach someone and say

1051
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,835
"I find you h- I want you to be my mentor

1052
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:29,480
" right?

1053
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,400
'Cause that's a high bar and a lot of people are really busy.

1054
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,310
It's like, "Hey, uh, I- I'm

1055
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,235
uh, y- I think you're really impressive.

1056
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:37,720
" A neighbor, someone who's made.

1057
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:37,849
..

1058
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:39,420
Uh, it doesn't have to be a baller

1059
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,960
but someone who's living a virtuous life, who seems smart and nice to you.

1060
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,160
"Can I get some advice from you?

1061
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,060
Can I, would you mind?

1062
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,000
I just have questions.

1063
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,259
Can we do a call?

1064
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:48,934
Can we have a coffee?

1065
00:45:48,934 --> 00:45:54,660
" There are a lot of people out there who want to help younger people and take it as a compliment.

1066
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,277
"Can I get your advice?

1067
00:45:56,277 --> 00:45:57,500
" Ask them for advice.

1068
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,040
Don't make big decisions without talking to other people.

1069
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,060
It is really hard to read the label from inside of the bottle

1070
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,299
really hard, right?

1071
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,400
Check in with people.

1072
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,180
Save, save yourself from yourself.

1073
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,080
So that kitchen cabinet.

1074
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,090
And if you're like, if you're a young woman working at a Burger King

1075
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,259
and yo- hopefully you meet some people and say

1076
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:22,845
"Hey, uh, can I just get some advice from you?

1077
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:24,730
" And by the way, it might be someone else working at Burger King

1078
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,880
and you're like, "This person has her act together.

1079
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,774
This person just has her act to- She's just smart.

1080
00:46:28,774 --> 00:46:29,860
" We all know those people.

1081
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,200
Mm-hmm.

1082
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,110
We meet them and we work with them

1083
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,480
like, "You know, this person just-" Yeah.

1084
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:32,490
.

1085
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:32,490
..

1086
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,400
"kind of switched on.

1087
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,292
They just seem to have better judgment around certain issues.

1088
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:38,040
" So, uh, what I would say is

1089
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,520
have a plan, don't be afraid to make changes

1090
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,259
put together a kitchen cabinet, realize there's dignity in all work.

1091
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,380
And any company, even something that seems low-brow

1092
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:53,680
like fast food, those organizations need talented people to go up the ranks and make money

1093
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,950
because the turnover is enormous.

1094
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:56,460
Mm-hmm.

1095
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,180
So I think there's opportunity and dignity in any work.

1096
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,830
You said something really interesting, which I

1097
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,650
I don't think I've ever had anybody talk about before

1098
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:06,228
which is, you said, "Don't ask someone to be your mentor.

1099
00:47:06,228 --> 00:47:09,490
" And I frank- I get asked to be someone's mentor several times a week

1100
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,420
as I'm sure you do.

1101
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:10,860
Yeah.

1102
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,360
And I've never given people advice on why that isn't the right

1103
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,040
right approach.

1104
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,150
But you said there that you don't think that's the right approach

1105
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,800
so I wanted to just pause and ask you why.

1106
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,620
Well, you don't go up to a strange person and say

1107
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,884
"Do you wanna have sex?

1108
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:25,640
" You go up and say, "Do you wanna have a con- Do you wanna have a conversation?

1109
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,779
Do you wanna have another drink?

1110
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:27,819
Do you wanna grab coffee?

1111
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:29,660
Do you wanna go to the movies?

1112
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,359
Can I ask you a question?

1113
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,040
Can I get some advice from you?

1114
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,069
" You ease into the relationship.

1115
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:35,620
Yeah.

1116
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,900
Because to ask someone to be your mentor is just very intimidating.

1117
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:44,840
The person has to go, "Do I wanna meet with this person every month for the next five years and then break up with them if it

1118
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,217
you know, if I'm not enjoying this relationship?

1119
00:47:46,217 --> 00:47:48,059
" So you don't need to say, "Will you be my mentor?

1120
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:49,009
" That sounds like a lot.

1121
00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:50,940
Just, "Can I get your advice on something?

1122
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,130
I really respect you.

1123
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,630
I, I think you're so smart about this stuff.

1124
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,779
I'm, I'm facing some issues in my life

1125
00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:56,350
some questions.

1126
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:58,090
I'd love to just get your advice.

1127
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,507
Can we grab coffee or can we do a five or 10 minute call?

1128
00:48:00,507 --> 00:48:03,265
" If someone emails me and says, "I'm thinking of.

1129
00:48:03,265 --> 00:48:03,308
..

1130
00:48:03,308 --> 00:48:05,040
" I get a lot, "I'm thinking about starting a business.

1131
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,779
I'm thinking about going to business school.

1132
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:07,554
Can I get some time?

1133
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,319
" I try to say yes, and I say

1134
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,052
"I can do, I can do a 15-minute Zoom call with you.

1135
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:13,750
" If someone asks me to be their mentor

1136
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:14,520
there's just no way.

1137
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,558
I don't, I don't have time to.

1138
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:15,810
..

1139
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,690
You know, I can barely mentor me right now.

1140
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:18,939
 I do the, the.

1141
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:19,029
..

1142
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,940
I just don't have time to commit to being someone's mentor.

1143
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,742
But if someone emails me and says, "I need advice around this specific issue

1144
00:48:25,742 --> 00:48:27,400
" and then what happens?

1145
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,920
You hear that they're, you know, raised by a single mother like me

1146
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,460
they're a good person, they're struggling, their sister's got an eating disorder and they're struggling with it

1147
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,040
and they're trying to, they're thinking about starting a business and you're like

1148
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,540
"Oh, no, no, don't do that right now.

1149
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,556
You've got a good job.

1150
00:48:41,556 --> 00:48:46,230
" Like, you just make some, you just help them with some common sense decisions.

1151
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,460
Common sense.

1152
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,350
And then what happens?

1153
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:54,520
You become emotionally invested in their success and then they email you a month later and you're like

1154
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,275
"What's going on?

1155
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:56,819
" And you wanna do another call.

1156
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:58,319
You know, ease into it.

1157
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:02,279
So anyways, I think it's much easier to just ask someone for help and for advice

1158
00:49:02,279 --> 00:49:04,722
and I think there's a lot of people out there.

1159
00:49:04,722 --> 00:49:05,063
..

1160
00:49:05,063 --> 00:49:07,364
It doesn't have to be a baller like Steven Bartlett.

1161
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:10,444
There's a lot of smart people out there that can give you good advice.

1162
00:49:10,444 --> 00:49:12,243
'Cause I think this is really important, I

1163
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:13,343
I don't think I've, as I said

1164
00:49:13,343 --> 00:49:14,884
I don't think I've had anyone talk about this

1165
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:18,404
but you get a lot of messages.

1166
00:49:18,404 --> 00:49:23,723
Have you been able to figure out exactly why some of them perk your interest

1167
00:49:23,723 --> 00:49:26,644
so much so that you give them 15 minutes on a Zoom call?

1168
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:32,424
Is there, is there a sort of psychological formula that gets to you?

1169
00:49:32,424 --> 00:49:34,044
Well, the first is, okay, first off

1170
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:35,343
brevity.

1171
00:49:35,343 --> 00:49:37,013
When I get like a long, you know

1172
00:49:37,013 --> 00:49:39,763
a novel, I'm just not gonna get through it.

1173
00:49:39,763 --> 00:49:42,243
Uh, obviously, and this is hard to control

1174
00:49:42,243 --> 00:49:45,134
but they reference someone you know, or they w- they

1175
00:49:45,134 --> 00:49:48,623
they make a connection, "We're both graduates of Berkeley

1176
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:51,710
" or, "I met you, I came up to you and said hi to you at Cannes

1177
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:55,073
" or, "We have a mutual friend," or

1178
00:49:55,073 --> 00:49:56,400
"I too was raised by a single.

1179
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:56,462
..

1180
00:49:56,462 --> 00:49:58,944
" They make some sort of personal connection

1181
00:49:58,944 --> 00:50:02,968
and they make the ask very crisply, "I'm writing 'cause I'd love some advice around this.

1182
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:04,470
" "I'm writing 'cause I'd like an introduction.

1183
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:09,606
" "I'm writing 'cause I'm applying for your position for managing editor for Prop G Media.

1184
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,783
" Just like get to the point, what's the ask

1185
00:50:12,783 --> 00:50:14,874
and try and make some sort of personal connection.

1186
00:50:14,874 --> 00:50:16,303
And the other thing I would say, although I hate

1187
00:50:16,303 --> 00:50:17,763
you know, and I don't wanna encourage people to do this

1188
00:50:17,763 --> 00:50:21,663
be persistent, 'cause a lot of times I get an email and I think

1189
00:50:21,663 --> 00:50:22,424
"Oh, that's a good kid.

1190
00:50:22,424 --> 00:50:24,196
I should really set up a call or something

1191
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:27,183
" and then I go on to the next 85 emails I have

1192
00:50:27,183 --> 00:50:29,004
and I don't even remember getting that email.

1193
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:32,823
So, I would say don't be afraid to hit again and just say

1194
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:34,843
"Hey, just putting it in the top of your inbox.

1195
00:50:34,843 --> 00:50:36,163
Know you're busy.

1196
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:37,364
If I can grab 10 minutes of your time

1197
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:38,925
I'd be really appreciative.

1198
00:50:38,925 --> 00:50:42,163
" And also, don't get discouraged if they don't get back to you.

1199
00:50:42,163 --> 00:50:43,203
That's okay.

1200
00:50:43,203 --> 00:50:45,064
It's not a reflection on you.

1201
00:50:45,064 --> 00:50:45,904
Go onto the next.

1202
00:50:45,904 --> 00:50:46,913
Just don't.

1203
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:47,183
..

1204
00:50:47,183 --> 00:50:48,044
Write it off.

1205
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:48,823
That's okay.

1206
00:50:48,823 --> 00:50:50,904
D- don't worry about it, don't worry about it.

1207
00:50:50,904 --> 00:50:53,343
I have a, I have a bubbling thesis on this that

1208
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:56,114
um, if you just taught kids, you know

1209
00:50:56,114 --> 00:50:59,624
your kids, my k- future kids how to ask for things in life

1210
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:04,584
the impact that that would have on their long-term trajectory is unbelievably profound.

1211
00:51:04,584 --> 00:51:07,424
Because I c- if I think back through my life

1212
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:10,283
when I was 18 years old stealing those pizzas in Manchester

1213
00:51:10,283 --> 00:51:13,283
or every step along the way, some of my big

1214
00:51:13,283 --> 00:51:16,363
pivotal moments in my trajectory were sending an email.

1215
00:51:16,363 --> 00:51:16,803
Yeah.

1216
00:51:16,803 --> 00:51:23,104
And yeah, pretty, like, yeah, pretty much all of them started with sending an email.

1217
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:25,024
But we don't teach people how to send an email

1218
00:51:25,024 --> 00:51:25,924
and you're- Right.

1219
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:25,933
.

1220
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:25,933
..

1221
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:28,064
you're on the receiving end of thousands of emails every month

1222
00:51:28,064 --> 00:51:32,263
or, or whatever, so you can see bad and good from a bird's-eye view.

1223
00:51:32,263 --> 00:51:34,384
And the things you've just said there, I completely agree with

1224
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:36,504
the, the size of the, the message

1225
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:38,223
um, s- being specific in the ask

1226
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:41,183
as you said, um, playing to ego in some way

1227
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,644
letting them know that you've read something you've done

1228
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:43,593
or you're interested in them- Yeah.

1229
00:51:43,593 --> 00:51:43,603
.

1230
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:43,624
..

1231
00:51:43,624 --> 00:51:45,053
or you know someone, all those things

1232
00:51:45,053 --> 00:51:47,163
has such a big, such a big impact.

1233
00:51:47,163 --> 00:51:48,863
And I think if you think about your life and you go

1234
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,984
"Okay, I'm gonna live for a h- I'm gonna live 100 years

1235
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:53,833
and I'm probably gonna ask for things 10

1236
00:51:53,833 --> 00:52:02,384
000 times," if I can increase my success rate of those asks by 10% because I'm just more thoughtful in how I ask for things

1237
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:04,814
my life could end up in a completely different place.

1238
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:05,323
Mm-hmm.

1239
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:08,564
Kind of like what you said about you only need a couple of wins to really be successful in life

1240
00:52:08,564 --> 00:52:10,004
you only need, if you send 10 e- 10 emails

1241
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:11,323
you only need like one person to say

1242
00:52:11,323 --> 00:52:12,456
"Yes, I'll invest.

1243
00:52:12,456 --> 00:52:12,553
" That's it.

1244
00:52:12,553 --> 00:52:16,303
And, and be willing to endure the rejection of the nine.

1245
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:19,064
I had a kid, this young kid come up to me

1246
00:52:19,064 --> 00:52:21,314
I was just in Cannes, um, "I'm a big fan.

1247
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:22,591
Can I take a picture with you, a selfie?

1248
00:52:22,591 --> 00:52:23,129
" "Yeah.

1249
00:52:23,129 --> 00:52:25,763
" Boom, 10 seconds, take a selfie.

1250
00:52:25,763 --> 00:52:28,163
Sent me an email yesterday with a picture of the selfie and said

1251
00:52:28,163 --> 00:52:28,584
"We met.

1252
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:30,524
We didn't have a chance to say hi.

1253
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:31,344
I'm struggling with.

1254
00:52:31,344 --> 00:52:31,377
..

1255
00:52:31,377 --> 00:52:33,703
" Um, and he was quite vulnerable.

1256
00:52:33,703 --> 00:52:35,303
He told me about some of the stuff he was going through and said

1257
00:52:35,303 --> 00:52:36,390
"I'm struggling.

1258
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:39,216
" And, uh, "Would you mind doing a 10 or 15-minute call with me?

1259
00:52:39,216 --> 00:52:41,274
" And he includes a picture of me and him.

1260
00:52:41,274 --> 00:52:42,944
How the fuck am I gonna say no to that

1261
00:52:42,944 --> 00:52:43,844
right?

1262
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:46,504
Anyway, there, you know, there's all sorts of tricks and trades

1263
00:52:46,504 --> 00:52:51,124
but the willingness to take that risk, the willingness to reach out to strangers

1264
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:52,803
that's the key to success.

1265
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,823
That's, I mean, it's the reason I have kids.

1266
00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:57,183
It's the reason I'm wealthy.

1267
00:52:57,183 --> 00:52:59,933
Um, nothing wonderful is gonna happen to you without

1268
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:02,703
um, uh, taking an uncomfortable risk.

1269
00:53:02,703 --> 00:53:05,004
So, I think about this with my boys.

1270
00:53:05,004 --> 00:53:08,854
I used to force them or ask them to speak to a stranger every time we were outside of the house.

1271
00:53:08,854 --> 00:53:11,884
My oldest one has no problem, my youngest one doesn't like it.

1272
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:13,033
Really hard.

1273
00:53:13,033 --> 00:53:15,223
"Okay, we just sit outside the door for 10 minutes.

1274
00:53:15,223 --> 00:53:17,874
Just go ask them what breed their dog is over there.

1275
00:53:17,874 --> 00:53:19,719
Just go over there, just ask them about their dog.

1276
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:22,323
" 'Cause he, I think a good strategy

1277
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:28,144
especially for young men who, uh, for some reason seem to be sequestering and becoming much more isolated

1278
00:53:28,144 --> 00:53:31,763
whenever you're in a line, talk to the person in front of you and behind you.

1279
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:33,194
Just talk to them.

1280
00:53:33,194 --> 00:53:35,044
Just get used to opening.

1281
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:37,163
Just get used to eye contact.

1282
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:39,984
Just get used to being friendly and having a conversation.

1283
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:42,763
'Cause I think people are spending so much time indoors and behind screens

1284
00:53:42,763 --> 00:53:48,524
they're losing the ability to establish professional and personal connection

1285
00:53:48,524 --> 00:53:51,433
so I think a certain cognitive behavior or

1286
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:56,124
or training around how to be friendly and how to endure rejection.

1287
00:53:56,124 --> 00:54:02,723
One of the most revealing things I've, I've noticed about you as a person is what you just said about that kid that emailed you yesterday.

1288
00:54:02,723 --> 00:54:03,863
Mm-hmm.

1289
00:54:03,863 --> 00:54:06,964
Because as you said it, I could see the emotion in your face.

1290
00:54:06,964 --> 00:54:08,194
Yeah, look, what do you want?

1291
00:54:08,194 --> 00:54:10,044
As a species, you wanna feel certain things

1292
00:54:10,044 --> 00:54:10,504
right?

1293
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:11,773
You wanna feel.

1294
00:54:11,773 --> 00:54:12,113
..

1295
00:54:12,113 --> 00:54:15,124
You know, the most rewarding things are sensations and feelings.

1296
00:54:15,124 --> 00:54:17,084
And I get really moved by these kids sometimes

1297
00:54:17,084 --> 00:54:18,044
you know, you relate to them.

1298
00:54:18,044 --> 00:54:21,354
I relate to young men who are struggling 'cause I was one of them.

1299
00:54:21,354 --> 00:54:24,863
And so this stuff really, sometimes, i- you know

1300
00:54:24,863 --> 00:54:27,584
y- what you want in life is a

1301
00:54:27,584 --> 00:54:31,484
a group of people who are emotionally invested in your success

1302
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:38,084
and then as you get older, the most rewarding thing is to let other people let you be emotionally invested in their success

1303
00:54:38,084 --> 00:54:39,294
right?

1304
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:43,834
I want my boys to love me, but what is the most rewarding thing is that they let me love them.

1305
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:45,533
That's the most rewarding thing, right?

1306
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:47,734
They are these vessels that I get to pour this like

1307
00:54:47,734 --> 00:54:48,743
affection into.

1308
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,513
That's the most rewarding thing as you get older.

1309
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:53,594
So yeah, I think about this stuff a lot

1310
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:56,263
and I get- Why did he move you?

1311
00:54:56,263 --> 00:54:57,453
Well, just the picture.

1312
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:59,024
And I, I, I don't wanna divulge

1313
00:54:59,024 --> 00:54:59,904
but he's struggling.

1314
00:54:59,904 --> 00:55:02,973
He's really going through some issues, uh

1315
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:05,189
uh, with addiction and self-harm.

1316
00:55:05,189 --> 00:55:05,387
..

1317
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:06,836
. and depression.

1318
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:10,796
And, and also, by the way, is obviously a very talented kid

1319
00:55:10,796 --> 00:55:13,334
is very smart, is working in.

1320
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:13,506
..

1321
00:55:13,506 --> 00:55:17,716
You know, has a high-profile job, and is struggling with addiction and self-harm.

1322
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:19,336
I mean, and, and you think, "Jesus

1323
00:55:19,336 --> 00:55:20,556
this shit is real," right?

1324
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:23,668
"This is really, really tough for this kid.

1325
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:27,696
" And, uh, you just realize, I think so many young people

1326
00:55:27,696 --> 00:55:29,508
we're raising.

1327
00:55:29,508 --> 00:55:29,606
..

1328
00:55:29,606 --> 00:55:31,915
My colleague at NYU wrote this book that's

1329
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:34,576
this is the book we wish we'd written.

1330
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:36,656
Uh, The Anxious Generation, Jonathan Haidt.

1331
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:37,575
Oh, yeah.

1332
00:55:37,575 --> 00:55:43,176
It's literally the most inf- he's now the most influential scholar probably globally.

1333
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:47,776
And the takeaway is we're raising, despite our prosperity in the US

1334
00:55:47,776 --> 00:55:51,185
we're raising the most anxious, depressed, obese

1335
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:53,915
and addicted generation in history.

1336
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:56,066
And you can just sense it.

1337
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:59,935
There's so many young people out there that are really struggling

1338
00:55:59,935 --> 00:56:05,196
that aren't happy, that don't have the opportunities that my generation had

1339
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:08,136
and then 200 time- 210 times a day

1340
00:56:08,136 --> 00:56:14,196
they're reminded that they're not doing well as someone else vomits their faux success and experiences all over them.

1341
00:56:14,196 --> 00:56:16,966
That, "Oh wait, I didn't make, I didn't

1342
00:56:16,966 --> 00:56:21,096
I didn't make a million dollars in NVIDIA and I'm not partying in Saint-Tropez

1343
00:56:21,096 --> 00:56:22,506
I'm a failure?

1344
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:23,116
" Right?

1345
00:56:23,116 --> 00:56:28,236
And there, there are opportunities for professional and romantic success are going down.

1346
00:56:28,236 --> 00:56:29,475
People aren't dating.

1347
00:56:29,475 --> 00:56:32,856
One out of three men under the age of 30 has a girlfriend.

1348
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:33,826
Yeah, I mean, there's just so many.

1349
00:56:33,826 --> 00:56:33,886
..

1350
00:56:33,886 --> 00:56:36,606
You can just tell young people are really

1351
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:37,765
really struggling.

1352
00:56:37,765 --> 00:56:39,776
And I think about that a lot, and

1353
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:40,915
uh, you know what?

1354
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:46,136
It moves me because a few fortunate decisions

1355
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:50,955
a few random emails, you know, things could have been much different for me.

1356
00:56:50,955 --> 00:56:54,286
And I, I, so I really, I do relate to these

1357
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,245
especially the young men.

1358
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,256
I relate to the struggles they're facing.

1359
00:56:58,256 --> 00:57:02,736
You s- you talked about making decisions in The Algebra of Wealth.

1360
00:57:02,736 --> 00:57:04,955
Um, I get asked this a lot

1361
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:10,875
um, uh, kids come up to me at the end of a talk that I do or some other event and will ask me about decisions

1362
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:11,455
like- Yeah.

1363
00:57:11,455 --> 00:57:11,466
.

1364
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:11,466
..

1365
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:13,116
jump-off points in their life.

1366
00:57:13,116 --> 00:57:21,036
As you zoom out on life, is there anything that I can know about how to be a great decision-maker over the context of 50 years of life?

1367
00:57:21,036 --> 00:57:21,045
Yeah.

1368
00:57:21,045 --> 00:57:24,156
Is there anything about how to make a decision?

1369
00:57:24,156 --> 00:57:26,475
Greatness is in the agency of others.

1370
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:27,128
You're, you're not.

1371
00:57:27,128 --> 00:57:27,245
..

1372
00:57:27,245 --> 00:57:34,756
This bus- the business you built is not gonna get beyond a certain point unless you have the ability to attract and retain really talented people.

1373
00:57:34,756 --> 00:57:37,156
Great decisions are in the agency of others.

1374
00:57:37,156 --> 00:57:38,816
We have some weird notion of leadership.

1375
00:57:38,816 --> 00:57:41,696
I used to think leadership, when I was a younger man

1376
00:57:41,696 --> 00:57:45,384
was quickly assessing the situation, deciding what we should do

1377
00:57:45,384 --> 00:57:48,316
and then advocating for my course of action.

1378
00:57:48,316 --> 00:57:49,506
That was leadership.

1379
00:57:49,506 --> 00:57:52,096
And it was more important to be, to be right than effective

1380
00:57:52,096 --> 00:57:56,656
or to get people to agree with my decision than to make the right decision.

1381
00:57:56,656 --> 00:58:03,375
What you want is you wanna get to the correct decision that has the best outcome for everybody and be open to change and evolving.

1382
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:09,576
And the way you do that, I don't make a big decision now without speaking to at least three people.

1383
00:58:09,576 --> 00:58:11,375
So you wanna make better decisions?

1384
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:15,495
Then slow the process down, you're slow and fast thinking

1385
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:18,596
and get the benefit of other people and expertise.

1386
00:58:18,596 --> 00:58:21,076
Is there any decision that I should make slow versus fast?

1387
00:58:21,076 --> 00:58:23,831
Is there a framework for how to know what.

1388
00:58:23,831 --> 00:58:23,966
..

1389
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:30,395
You know, sometimes I think, I find in business that the cost is the time I waste trying to make the decision.

1390
00:58:30,395 --> 00:58:33,236
And then sometimes in business, the cost is the outcome of the decision.

1391
00:58:33,236 --> 00:58:34,556
Well, yeah, there's been books written about this

1392
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:38,395
but basically every day there's thousands or hundreds of decisions you have to make instantly.

1393
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:39,756
Like, do I go on the red light?

1394
00:58:39,756 --> 00:58:40,475
Do I not go?

1395
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:40,770
Do I.

1396
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:40,884
..

1397
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:41,616
You know.

1398
00:58:41,616 --> 00:58:43,796
There's a ton of things you have to do

1399
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:45,435
saying "Thank you," "Pardon me," whatever.

1400
00:58:45,435 --> 00:58:47,605
There's a ton of decisions you have to make every day.

1401
00:58:47,605 --> 00:58:54,685
So we get into a framework of sometimes where we don't slow down and have the luxury of making a good decision.

1402
00:58:54,685 --> 00:58:56,045
The other thing is, that I've tried to do

1403
00:58:56,045 --> 00:58:58,986
is I try to screen out unimportant decisions.

1404
00:58:58,986 --> 00:59:02,076
And this is a luxury, but as I've gotten a little bit of money

1405
00:59:02,076 --> 00:59:04,515
I don't make decisions around anything.

1406
00:59:04,515 --> 00:59:05,136
I mean, this sounds weird.

1407
00:59:05,136 --> 00:59:06,856
I don't order, when I'm in a restaurant

1408
00:59:06,856 --> 00:59:08,026
I don't order.

1409
00:59:08,026 --> 00:59:10,576
I basically ask the waiter to order for me.

1410
00:59:10,576 --> 00:59:12,086
I have a uniform at work.

1411
00:59:12,086 --> 00:59:14,216
I don't pick out my own clothes.

1412
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:16,369
I have a group of people who manage.

1413
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:16,665
..

1414
00:59:16,665 --> 00:59:17,076
You know what I'm saying?

1415
00:59:17,076 --> 00:59:18,515
You're in charge of all decisions here.

1416
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:24,685
I try to focus only on the decisions I can bring a lot of value to so I can spend a lot of time being really thoughtful about them.

1417
00:59:24,685 --> 00:59:29,216
Um, but generally speaking, for a young person that's not in a position of outsourcing a lot of decision-making

1418
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:31,665
what I would say is get a kit- again

1419
00:59:31,665 --> 00:59:33,196
goes back to the notion of a kitchen cabinet.

1420
00:59:33,196 --> 00:59:35,374
Get a group of people who will.

1421
00:59:35,374 --> 00:59:35,446
..

1422
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,716
You might end up at the same place

1423
00:59:36,716 --> 00:59:38,276
but they'll say, "Have you thought about this?

1424
00:59:38,276 --> 00:59:39,898
" Or, "Why wouldn't you just do.

1425
00:59:39,898 --> 00:59:40,286
..

1426
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:41,786
Why wouldn't you just have, you know

1427
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,829
do X, Y, or Z?

1428
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,895
" Or I think, you know, who have the leadership skills and know you well enough to go

1429
00:59:46,895 --> 00:59:49,194
"You know, Steven, I think you're making a mistake here.

1430
00:59:49,194 --> 00:59:51,745
" When I was 26, I started a company called Prophet Brand Strategy

1431
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:52,975
a strategy firm.

1432
00:59:52,975 --> 00:59:55,596
Six years later, when I was 33

1433
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:59,136
I was offered 55 million for it, uh

1434
00:59:59,136 --> 01:00:02,415
from SapientNitro and another firm called Cyient.

1435
01:00:02,415 --> 01:00:03,836
55 million.

1436
01:00:03,836 --> 01:00:07,836
I owned 60, 70% of the company.

1437
01:00:07,836 --> 01:00:11,326
So I would've been done, but I was under the about

1438
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:12,496
"No, this is the internet.

1439
01:00:12,496 --> 01:00:13,356
It's gonna be huge.

1440
01:00:13,356 --> 01:00:14,564
Uh, we're gonna be worth a billion.

1441
01:00:14,564 --> 01:00:17,176
" I, if I just had a board

1442
01:00:17,176 --> 01:00:20,455
if I just called a couple people, they would

1443
01:00:20,455 --> 01:00:23,452
I know they would've said, "What the fuck are you thinking?

1444
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:26,935
" I was doing three million a year in consulting

1445
01:00:26,935 --> 01:00:29,625
and this firm offered me $55 million.

1446
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:33,676
If I had just talked to someone, they would kind of go

1447
01:00:33,676 --> 01:00:34,108
"Let me get the.

1448
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:34,145
..

1449
01:00:34,145 --> 01:00:40,909
Okay, so Scott, you've been offered 18 times revenues for a small strategy services company?

1450
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:44,975
" Also, around relationships, right?

1451
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:49,816
When I talk to some of my friends or younger men I know who are really upset with their spouse

1452
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:52,455
I'm like, "Be clear.

1453
01:00:52,455 --> 01:00:56,616
Yeah, this is an issue, but you're not bringing a lot of generosity and forgiveness to the relationship.

1454
01:00:56,616 --> 01:01:01,922
And if you don't bring those things, your marriage to this person or anyone else is not gonna survive.

1455
01:01:01,922 --> 01:01:04,305
" I didn't figure this out till I was older.

1456
01:01:04,305 --> 01:01:08,625
But you will always naturally inflate your own contribution to the relationship and some- and

1457
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,219
and diminish theirs.

1458
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:10,506
..

1459
01:01:10,506 --> 01:01:13,880
. and the relationship is never gonna be in perfect harmony or balance

1460
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,320
so in those periods of deficit, you've got to bring forgiveness.

1461
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,300
You've gotta bring patience.

1462
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,870
Otherwise, no long-term relationship is gonna survive.

1463
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:26,260
And also, be pretty clear, if you split up right now

1464
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,580
just know you're gonna lose 70% of your net worth

1465
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,220
maybe 60 but plan on 70.

1466
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,340
You split everything, and then the cost of lawyers.

1467
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:33,490
..

1468
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,440
And I can guarantee you, if you have to sell a house

1469
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,360
that'll be the exact wrong moment to sell it.

1470
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,020
It's just karma.

1471
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:41,540
Just karma.

1472
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:48,150
So, just keep in mind, there's a lot of good reasons to stay together in a marriage and try and figure it out.

1473
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,720
Is marriage good for wealth?

1474
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,590
Oh, yeah.

1475
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:50,920
Really?

1476
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,410
Oh, yeah.

1477
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,960
'Cause I don't wanna lose 50, 70% of my money or whatever.

1478
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,240
Well, you'll have that guy on, who's on TikTok all over the place saying it's a failed technology.

1479
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,029
The majority of really wealthy people, uh

1480
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:04,200
have long-term relationships and are in a monogamous relationship.

1481
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,440
They're married because the team is a fantastic way to build wealth.

1482
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,310
But if, if the stats are true and

1483
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,680
you know, 50-whatever, 50-whatever percent of people are getting divorces

1484
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,140
doesn't that mean if I'm building wealth there's a 50-odd percent chance that I'm gonna lose half of it if I'm married

1485
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:20,800
or more?

1486
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,520
Well, first off, if you have wealth going in

1487
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,680
get a prenup.

1488
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:23,880
Yeah.

1489
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,134
But what I would say is, um.

1490
01:02:26,134 --> 01:02:26,450
..

1491
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:31,900
And first off, that number's a bit misleading because marriage is becoming a luxury item.

1492
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:38,210
Two, uh, it used to be 95% of wealthy people got married and 85% of middle class and poor people got married.

1493
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:40,510
It's dropped to less than half among poor people.

1494
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:43,240
The bottom line is no one wants to mate with poor men

1495
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,840
and, uh, wealthy people attract a lot of mates.

1496
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,343
And generally speaking, really wealthy people.

1497
01:02:48,343 --> 01:02:48,630
..

1498
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:49,760
I mean, there's all this, you know

1499
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,652
there's all these.

1500
01:02:50,652 --> 01:02:50,830
..

1501
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:53,020
It's fun to do TikToks about Jeff Bezos on a

1502
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,380
on a yacht with his new girlfriend and everything

1503
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,560
but the majority of wealthy people are actually

1504
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,900
uh, uh, stay married, and the team is really powerful.

1505
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,150
You know, we're both working together.

1506
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,300
We're both making a lot of money.

1507
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,400
That is really powerful in sharing one set of expenses.

1508
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,460
You're gonna focus on the logistics of our life or our family

1509
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:15,000
and my wife's the professional baller, right?

1510
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,940
The team, the team is powerful.

1511
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,145
So this notion that you shouldn't get married or.

1512
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:21,389
..

1513
01:03:21,389 --> 01:03:24,080
I'm not s- I'm not suggesting that marriage is for anybody or stay

1514
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,480
stay married no matter what.

1515
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,630
I'm not suggesting that at all, but there's just no getting around it.

1516
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,180
The team is much more powerful than the individual

1517
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:35,000
and if you, if you break down the numbers of people who are wealthy

1518
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,220
they, generally speaking, invest a lot in their relationships.

1519
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,360
Wealth is a whole-person project.

1520
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,870
There's a myth that rich people are bad people.

1521
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:48,670
The Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, that billionaires crawled over other people to get there.

1522
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:50,120
It's just not true.

1523
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:55,220
What you generally find among wealthy people, especially people who've made their own money

1524
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:55,767
is that the rea-.

1525
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:55,810
..

1526
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:58,610
One of the reasons they're wealthy is they've collected allies along the way.

1527
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:04,400
And just as compounding is so powerful with small investments when you're young

1528
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,580
bringing some generosity to people when they need help

1529
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,300
being a good friend, occasionally checking in

1530
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,531
"How are you doing?

1531
01:04:09,531 --> 01:04:11,760
" Helping people find jobs when they lose a job

1532
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,140
being kind.

1533
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,440
Those little investments you make as a young person really add up

1534
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,440
and you're gonna find this.

1535
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:23,680
I have all these great friendships now with people who I was never great friends with.

1536
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,900
But because we made small investments in each other over 20 or 30 years

1537
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,310
just checked in, "How you doing?

1538
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:31,240
Congrats on how you're doing this.

1539
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,291
Congrats on your wedding.

1540
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:33,760
" Maybe not even close friends.

1541
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,960
You wake up in your 50s, and you have millions of dollars in terms of a relationship.

1542
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,010
You feel close to these people.

1543
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:45,240
You feel like a real nice sense of comity with them.

1544
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,796
You really.

1545
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:47,190
..

1546
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,680
Uh, a- and, and this is very true of wealthy people.

1547
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,640
You want to be put in a room of opportunity

1548
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,160
even when you're not there.

1549
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,800
So Google did a study.

1550
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,680
When they put out a job opening for a product manager

1551
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,260
they'll get 200 resumes within a few hours.

1552
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,240
They invite the 20 best in.

1553
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:14,160
80% of the time, the offer that's made is made to somebody who has a evangelist/advocate friend in the company.

1554
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,580
So this is who you need to be.

1555
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,220
You need to be that person who's like

1556
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:22,200
"Oh, there's a job opening here?

1557
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,030
I have this woman who would be great

1558
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,880
" and then connects them.

1559
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,980
You need to be in a room.

1560
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,550
You wanna be a, a successful professionally

1561
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:31,800
be successful personally.

1562
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,560
Go out.

1563
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,730
Make friends.

1564
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,760
Be kind.

1565
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,710
Invest in them.

1566
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,390
Help them when there's no obvious reason to help them

1567
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,500
and those investments pay off.

1568
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,487
And generally speaking, and this isn't.

1569
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:43,570
..

1570
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:47,780
Not a popular narrative, the majority of very wealthy people I have met

1571
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,260
and I've met a lot of them, are kind.

1572
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:55,300
They're generous, very civic-minded, very good mates.

1573
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:02,620
So this trope of, you know, of Monty Burns lighting cigars with the $100 bills and owning the

1574
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,560
the nuclear power plant and pouring, you know

1575
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,800
radioactive waste into the river, that's a cartoon.

1576
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:12,300
The majority of self-made people who are really wealthy are good

1577
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:17,720
kind people, because you have to have allies along the way to be really successful.

1578
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,520
Can anyone start a, a company, in your view?

1579
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,820
Can anyone become a successful entrepreneur?

1580
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,160
Oh, no.

1581
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,780
Y- There's, there's certain attributes that most people don't have.

1582
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,280
What are those traits?

1583
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,900
First and foremost, you have to be really risk-aggressive and have that willingness to fail.

1584
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,840
You're willing to take huge risks.

1585
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,080
I speak to people all the time who say

1586
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,730
"Well, I'm gonna go get a job at Google or JP Morgan for a few years

1587
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,121
and then I'll have the credibility to start a business.

1588
01:06:42,121 --> 01:06:44,030
" I'm like, "You're not an entrepreneur.

1589
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:45,528
" Most entrepreneurs.

1590
01:06:45,528 --> 01:06:45,690
..

1591
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:50,840
70% of entrepreneurs are immigrants that don't have access to corporate Britain or corporate America.

1592
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,050
By the way, if you have access to Google.

1593
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:54,250
..

1594
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,580
All these kids come to my office hours.

1595
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,560
When I say kids, I mean students

1596
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,600
and they wanna ask.

1597
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:58,730
..

1598
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:00,140
They don't wanna talk about brand strategy.

1599
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:01,520
They wanna talk about careers, and they say

1600
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,040
"Oh, I have an offer from JP Morgan or Google

1601
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,640
but I'm thinking about starting my own business

1602
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,163
and I know you've started a lot of business.

1603
01:07:07,163 --> 01:07:09,267
" And they think I'm gonna say, "Go for it.

1604
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:10,860
" I'm like, "Don't be a fucking idiot.

1605
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,302
Go to work for Google.

1606
01:07:12,302 --> 01:07:22,414
"On a risk-adjusted basis, the most unbelievable platform for generating wealth and opportunity and long-term economic security is the American corporation.

1607
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:31,244
These are unbelievable platforms to get rich with some certainty slowly and sometimes quickly in the tech community.

1608
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:36,984
If you have access to those platforms, unless you hate it and are terrible at it

1609
01:07:36,984 --> 01:07:38,684
you should go that way.

1610
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:41,304
The majority of entrepreneurs are immigrants.

1611
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:42,244
And why, why is that?

1612
01:07:42,244 --> 01:07:43,564
Because they didn't have any choice.

1613
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:46,324
They didn't have access to corporate America.

1614
01:07:46,324 --> 01:07:47,744
They had to open a dry cleaner.

1615
01:07:47,744 --> 01:07:50,644
They had to start a soapstone company.

1616
01:07:50,644 --> 01:07:54,754
Entrepreneurship, you have to be risk-aggressive, willing to take risks.

1617
01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:57,164
Two, to be really successful at it

1618
01:07:57,164 --> 01:08:00,644
you have to be, um, a great salesperson.

1619
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,964
You have to be willing to convince people to invest

1620
01:08:02,964 --> 01:08:04,004
buy your products.

1621
01:08:04,004 --> 01:08:06,154
You have to be willing, most importantly

1622
01:08:06,154 --> 01:08:09,164
to sell people on your vision and believe that you're a good person

1623
01:08:09,164 --> 01:08:11,774
and that if you're successful, they're gonna be successful.

1624
01:08:11,774 --> 01:08:13,984
What's the best way to train that muscle

1625
01:08:13,984 --> 01:08:16,144
if I'm young?

1626
01:08:16,144 --> 01:08:17,143
Gosh, I don't know.

1627
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:19,077
For me it was, um .

1628
01:08:19,077 --> 01:08:20,384
..

1629
01:08:20,384 --> 01:08:24,524
Look, I, I think the core competence you would want any kid

1630
01:08:24,524 --> 01:08:28,576
your kid to inherit, if I could give my kids any skill.

1631
01:08:28,576 --> 01:08:28,874
..

1632
01:08:28,874 --> 01:08:31,804
I remember in the toniest preschools and, or I'm sorry

1633
01:08:31,804 --> 01:08:33,584
high schools, they had Mandarin.

1634
01:08:33,584 --> 01:08:35,604
And that was just stupid.

1635
01:08:35,604 --> 01:08:36,703
Or computer science.

1636
01:08:36,703 --> 01:08:40,863
I believe that replacing history and civics class with computer science

1637
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:46,724
you get Mark Zuckerberg, you get these mendacious fucks who are billionaires but don't care about the health of the commonwealth.

1638
01:08:46,724 --> 01:08:53,924
The greatest skill you can develop or that you would want your kids to have that will stand the test of time is storytelling.

1639
01:08:53,924 --> 01:08:56,823
The ability to craft a narrative and then convince people

1640
01:08:56,823 --> 01:08:58,804
get people engaged in your narrative and think

1641
01:08:58,804 --> 01:09:01,106
"Oh, your company makes sense.

1642
01:09:01,106 --> 01:09:02,073
" You're not gonna come in and say

1643
01:09:02,073 --> 01:09:03,209
"I'm starting a software company.

1644
01:09:03,209 --> 01:09:05,444
" You're gonna say, "This is the technology.

1645
01:09:05,444 --> 01:09:06,584
This is the marketplace.

1646
01:09:06,584 --> 01:09:08,662
This is why society needs this.

1647
01:09:08,662 --> 01:09:10,063
These are our unique skill set.

1648
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:13,884
" And you can craft it into a story that is compelling

1649
01:09:13,884 --> 01:09:14,874
right?

1650
01:09:14,874 --> 01:09:18,684
It's the key, it's the key to scoring above your weight class romantically

1651
01:09:18,684 --> 01:09:18,964
right?

1652
01:09:18,964 --> 01:09:23,662
Communicating a plan, communicating kindness, communicating empathy

1653
01:09:23,662 --> 01:09:26,823
communicating, um, humor, right?

1654
01:09:26,823 --> 01:09:29,884
Any industry, Jeff Bezos' 1997 shareholder letter

1655
01:09:29,884 --> 01:09:32,504
you read that letter, you just wanna buy stock.

1656
01:09:32,504 --> 01:09:34,544
I don't care how overvalued it is.

1657
01:09:34,544 --> 01:09:39,424
When you listen to Jensen Huang talk about the future of AI and biology and healthcare

1658
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:44,470
you're like, "Well, maybe I should buy it even though it's trading at 110 times earnings.

1659
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:45,703
" If you wanna be a great CEO

1660
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:46,346
you gotta be a great s- .

1661
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:46,354
..

1662
01:09:46,354 --> 01:09:49,624
I don't care if you're Maya Angelou, Rishi Sunak

1663
01:09:49,624 --> 01:10:01,204
or you know, Jensen Huang, the core competence of any really successful person or the core competence that's gonna get you real influence and economic security is storytelling.

1664
01:10:01,204 --> 01:10:03,324
So, uh, th- the, it's so interesting because

1665
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:10,924
um, I completely agree with everything you've said about how at the very heart of wealth creation as an entrepreneur

1666
01:10:10,924 --> 01:10:14,484
but, but more generally in life, whether you wanna be a president or prime minister or a philanthropist

1667
01:10:14,484 --> 01:10:17,284
is this idea to craft narrative, but

1668
01:10:17,284 --> 01:10:21,854
um, the average, how does the average person develop that skill when they don't

1669
01:10:21,854 --> 01:10:24,634
they're not a lecturer, they don't have students that they can speak in front of

1670
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:28,394
they don't have a podcast necessarily that people are gonna listen to?

1671
01:10:28,394 --> 01:10:30,684
But if we both agree that it's such an integral skill

1672
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:32,584
a transformative life skill.

1673
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:33,894
Oh, there's a million ways.

1674
01:10:33,894 --> 01:10:36,534
The f- w- the first thing I assign my students

1675
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:39,844
my kids in the class is, pick a medium.

1676
01:10:39,844 --> 01:10:41,524
It can be Instagram.

1677
01:10:41,524 --> 01:10:41,744
Mm-hmm.

1678
01:10:41,744 --> 01:10:44,304
It can be X, it can be threads

1679
01:10:44,304 --> 01:10:48,004
it can be Pinterest, LinkedIn, public presentations

1680
01:10:48,004 --> 01:10:50,644
speaking, radio podcasting.

1681
01:10:50,644 --> 01:10:53,824
Identify what it would mean to be in the top 1%.

1682
01:10:53,824 --> 01:10:54,684
You can go online.

1683
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,004
What are the top 1% of followers on Instagram?

1684
01:10:57,004 --> 01:10:59,944
How many followers do you need to be in the top 1% on Instagram?

1685
01:10:59,944 --> 01:11:05,704
By the end of this semester, you need to be a top 1% storyteller on a medium.

1686
01:11:05,704 --> 01:11:07,884
I'm really good at this.

1687
01:11:07,884 --> 01:11:09,134
You're really good at podcasting.

1688
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:11,824
I'm really good in front of a large crowd.

1689
01:11:11,824 --> 01:11:13,604
I'm not very good on the phone.

1690
01:11:13,604 --> 01:11:15,484
I'm pretty terrible one-on-one.

1691
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:15,924
Hmm.

1692
01:11:15,924 --> 01:11:18,684
I come across as aloof yet insecure at the same time

1693
01:11:18,684 --> 01:11:19,754
which isn't easy to do.

1694
01:11:19,754 --> 01:11:23,584
 So I know the medium, I'm not good on the phone.

1695
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:26,114
I'm, I've become a proficient writer.

1696
01:11:26,114 --> 01:11:27,953
I, I aspire to be a great writer.

1697
01:11:27,953 --> 01:11:28,694
I'm good now.

1698
01:11:28,694 --> 01:11:30,354
Someday I'll be great.

1699
01:11:30,354 --> 01:11:34,384
But I know my mediums and I practice storytelling every day.

1700
01:11:34,384 --> 01:11:37,604
I'm either writing, I'm either speaking, I'm either podcasting.

1701
01:11:37,604 --> 01:11:40,904
If you're young, oh my God, the mediums

1702
01:11:40,904 --> 01:11:42,024
are you good on TikTok?

1703
01:11:42,024 --> 01:11:44,764
Get a smartphone, get a, you know

1704
01:11:44,764 --> 01:11:51,464
iMovie, start editing, and every day make small iterations and changes and commit to being a s- great storyteller.

1705
01:11:51,464 --> 01:11:59,684
And the wonderful things about these mediums in the economy and these technologies is you can be a great storyteller anywhere

1706
01:11:59,684 --> 01:12:01,984
from any background and from any location.

1707
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:07,584
I'm not suggesting that you, that everybody has the same opportunities

1708
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:11,444
but the opportunities, the reason why Hollywood is struggling

1709
01:12:11,444 --> 01:12:16,194
the reason why the writers for striking for four months only got a 5% increase in pay

1710
01:12:16,194 --> 01:12:17,244
is that there are 1.

1711
01:12:17,244 --> 01:12:21,454
7 billion people on TikTok, and 850 million of them are creators

1712
01:12:21,454 --> 01:12:24,144
which is a fancy term for storyteller.

1713
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:27,664
And assume 1% of them are outstanding storytellers

1714
01:12:27,664 --> 01:12:32,544
all of a sudden, eight and a half million new storytellers have come into the media market

1715
01:12:32,544 --> 01:12:38,604
and the half a million in LA who think their work is so fucking precious and are trying to figure out why their industry is in decline

1716
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:49,204
like, you're competing against eight and a half million new storytellers that aren't asking for pet bereavement leave or for a trailer with catered food.

1717
01:12:49,204 --> 01:12:51,604
The ability to tell, craft a narrative

1718
01:12:51,604 --> 01:12:55,069
find your medium and then say, "I'm gonna be in the top 1%.

1719
01:12:55,069 --> 01:12:59,084
" What is the algebra to storytelling, if there had to be one?

1720
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:00,034
If you, I know you've not had time to think about this.

1721
01:13:00,034 --> 01:13:00,784
Oh, that's really interesting.

1722
01:13:00,784 --> 01:13:01,524
I'm thought about that.

1723
01:13:01,524 --> 01:13:05,562
I think of it as, one, you just have to be a compelling.

1724
01:13:05,562 --> 01:13:05,864
..

1725
01:13:05,864 --> 01:13:07,864
I mean, it sounds terrible, but y- I

1726
01:13:07,864 --> 01:13:09,764
I have a handsome voice.

1727
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:10,064
Mm-hmm.

1728
01:13:10,064 --> 01:13:11,924
I was, I have a face for podcasting.

1729
01:13:11,924 --> 01:13:12,964
I've had five TV shows.

1730
01:13:12,964 --> 01:13:15,184
They've all been canceled within like four weeks.

1731
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:16,464
Podcasting is my medium.

1732
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:18,424
Television is, television is not.

1733
01:13:18,424 --> 01:13:19,525
You've done really well.

1734
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:19,661
..

1735
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:19,797
..

1736
01:13:19,797 --> 01:13:21,986
. on podcasting and video, right?

1737
01:13:21,986 --> 01:13:23,316
That says something.

1738
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:28,356
I would say that more than anything, it's tapping into people's emotions.

1739
01:13:28,356 --> 01:13:30,146
Like, how do you make someone feel something?

1740
01:13:30,146 --> 01:13:32,836
I mean, you wanna be smart, you wanna say interesting things

1741
01:13:32,836 --> 01:13:36,816
but how do you really connect with someone and make them feel something?

1742
01:13:36,816 --> 01:13:40,416
The white space I'm trying to occupy is

1743
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:46,316
I'm trying to be a white heterosexual male in his 50s who's open about his emotions.

1744
01:13:46,316 --> 01:13:48,135
That's a white space.

1745
01:13:48,135 --> 01:13:50,086
Guys my age don't talk about their failures

1746
01:13:50,086 --> 01:13:52,016
they don't talk about the way they feel about their kids

1747
01:13:52,016 --> 01:13:56,126
they don't talk about, you know, how devastated they were when their mother died.

1748
01:13:56,126 --> 01:14:00,306
That shit's just not talked about among men of my demographic.

1749
01:14:00,306 --> 01:14:02,816
That's the white space I'm occupying.

1750
01:14:02,816 --> 01:14:10,976
So you need to say, okay, what am I gonna make people feel that other people aren't spending a lot of time evoking

1751
01:14:10,976 --> 01:14:13,276
getting people to understand those emotions?

1752
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:16,255
It's, uh, I think the specific crowds out the general

1753
01:14:16,255 --> 01:14:19,076
you wanna focus on a niche, own something.

1754
01:14:19,076 --> 01:14:21,096
All right, I'm gonna be in the top 1% of this medium

1755
01:14:21,096 --> 01:14:22,865
and I'm gonna develop domain expertise.

1756
01:14:22,865 --> 01:14:28,096
I'm gonna be the person that understands Ethiopian cuisine

1757
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:30,336
and I'm gonna bring romance and make people feel something

1758
01:14:30,336 --> 01:14:34,156
and I'm gonna connect it to family, and I'm gonna connect it to African culture

1759
01:14:34,156 --> 01:14:37,816
and I'm gonna connect it to maternal love and c- whatever it is.

1760
01:14:37,816 --> 01:14:40,776
But think about it, what emotions do you want people to feel?

1761
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,976
And then every day, it's just hand-to-hand combat

1762
01:14:43,976 --> 01:14:45,076
every day.

1763
01:14:45,076 --> 01:14:46,666
You know, w- before when we were off mic

1764
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:48,342
you said we were both kind of.

1765
01:14:48,342 --> 01:14:48,666
..

1766
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:51,755
In the last two years, both of our careers have sort of hit a tipping point.

1767
01:14:51,755 --> 01:14:54,336
I feel like I've worked my ass off for 35 years

1768
01:14:54,336 --> 01:14:56,635
and all of a sudden, I'm an overnight success.

1769
01:14:56,635 --> 01:14:58,381
And you said, "What was the one thing?

1770
01:14:58,381 --> 01:15:00,255
" And I can't point to any one thing.

1771
01:15:00,255 --> 01:15:01,896
It was a series of little things.

1772
01:15:01,896 --> 01:15:02,755
It's kinda the Mr.

1773
01:15:02,755 --> 01:15:05,456
Beast secret sauce.

1774
01:15:05,456 --> 01:15:06,496
It's iteration.

1775
01:15:06,496 --> 01:15:08,016
Every day, they test things.

1776
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:09,956
They make things just a tiny bit better.

1777
01:15:09,956 --> 01:15:12,026
So commit to excellence.

1778
01:15:12,026 --> 01:15:14,836
You put out a podcast, you put out a Medium post

1779
01:15:14,836 --> 01:15:17,376
you put out a PowerPoint presentation lever- about AI

1780
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:23,976
whatever it is, try and find a mechanism for feedback and commit to just being a little bit better the next time you do it.

1781
01:15:23,976 --> 01:15:26,036
 I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

1782
01:15:26,036 --> 01:15:28,945
What is in the Diary of a CEO cup

1783
01:15:28,945 --> 01:15:31,396
this cup that sits in front of me when I interview these people

1784
01:15:31,396 --> 01:15:34,696
sometimes for three hours, and sometimes three people a day?

1785
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,936
And the answer is this, Perfecta.

1786
01:15:36,936 --> 01:15:38,856
I invested in the company on Dragons' Den

1787
01:15:38,856 --> 01:15:44,736
and since then, they've gone from an idea to the fastest-growing energy drink in the UK.

1788
01:15:44,736 --> 01:15:49,036
It is a matcha energy drink, and it is absolutely delicious.

1789
01:15:49,036 --> 01:15:51,056
But that's not why I choose to drink it on this podcast.

1790
01:15:51,056 --> 01:15:55,226
The reason I choose to drink it is because it gives me what I call all-day energy.

1791
01:15:55,226 --> 01:15:55,321
It.

1792
01:15:55,321 --> 01:15:55,366
..

1793
01:15:55,366 --> 01:15:58,255
I don't get the same crashes that I used to get with other energy drinks.

1794
01:15:58,255 --> 01:16:02,096
If you're in the middle of a conversation or you're in the middle of a talk on stage or in the boardroom

1795
01:16:02,096 --> 01:16:05,016
the last thing you wanna do is have a crash.

1796
01:16:05,016 --> 01:16:07,616
You don't want jitters and you need focus.

1797
01:16:07,616 --> 01:16:10,175
And that is why they now sponsor this podcast.

1798
01:16:10,175 --> 01:16:14,135
Not only is it delicious, but it gives me a significant competitive advantage.

1799
01:16:14,135 --> 01:16:15,936
If you haven't tried it, go down to a Tesco

1800
01:16:15,936 --> 01:16:20,925
go to a Waitrose, or go online and use the code DIARY10 at checkout

1801
01:16:20,925 --> 01:16:22,096
and you'll get 10% off.

1802
01:16:22,096 --> 01:16:24,255
And when you do try it, let me know how you get on.

1803
01:16:24,255 --> 01:16:28,576
 I'm very keen to understand how you invest your money.

1804
01:16:28,576 --> 01:16:30,396
So say I'm, uh, I'm working at McDonald's

1805
01:16:30,396 --> 01:16:31,816
like, m- or Burger King, or whatever

1806
01:16:31,816 --> 01:16:34,496
and I say these places not to sort of diminish the

1807
01:16:34,496 --> 01:16:39,436
the value of the work, because I worked four or five years of my life in places like call centers and the McDonald's

1808
01:16:39,436 --> 01:16:39,925
et cetera.

1809
01:16:39,925 --> 01:16:42,416
But just as that's the, the jump-off point for many people

1810
01:16:42,416 --> 01:16:45,796
I get up to manager or position, I have a little bit of disposable income now.

1811
01:16:45,796 --> 01:16:46,036
Mm-hmm.

1812
01:16:46,036 --> 01:16:48,336
Should I be going all in on crypto?

1813
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:50,776
Or my friend has this company, he said it's gonna work

1814
01:16:50,776 --> 01:16:52,266
should I be betting my money there?

1815
01:16:52,266 --> 01:16:55,896
Over the, uh, long-term time horizon, where have you invested your money and made the most returns

1816
01:16:55,896 --> 01:16:57,566
and where should I?

1817
01:16:57,566 --> 01:16:59,786
Well, just do as I say, not as I do.

1818
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:01,706
I always went all in on things.

1819
01:17:01,706 --> 01:17:03,486
And when you go all in on something

1820
01:17:03,486 --> 01:17:05,196
if it hits the ground or blows up

1821
01:17:05,196 --> 01:17:07,566
you're kinda done, and you don't have any capital

1822
01:17:07,566 --> 01:17:08,534
and you can end up.

1823
01:17:08,534 --> 01:17:08,706
..

1824
01:17:08,706 --> 01:17:10,766
I ended up broke at, uh.

1825
01:17:10,766 --> 01:17:10,946
..

1826
01:17:10,946 --> 01:17:12,896
In '99, I was looking at jets.

1827
01:17:12,896 --> 01:17:15,536
By 2000, after the dot bomb ex- implosion

1828
01:17:15,536 --> 01:17:17,996
I was broke, crawled my way back

1829
01:17:17,996 --> 01:17:21,675
was wealthy again by 2007, all in on tech.

1830
01:17:21,675 --> 01:17:24,416
By the end of 2008, I was broke again.

1831
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:26,056
And what I have learned since then is

1832
01:17:26,056 --> 01:17:29,005
I've crawled my way back, gotten very lucky

1833
01:17:29,005 --> 01:17:32,956
the markets have boomed, but now I diversify like crazy

1834
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:35,135
and the- What does diversify mean?

1835
01:17:35,135 --> 01:17:39,896
You're never more than a certain amount of your net worth in any one thing

1836
01:17:39,896 --> 01:17:43,206
and you try and make sure those things aren't correlated to each other.

1837
01:17:43,206 --> 01:17:46,606
It's harder when you're young because you may have to go all in on a house.

1838
01:17:46,606 --> 01:17:49,586
You may have to put every penny you have to buy your first home.

1839
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:51,376
When you start a business when you're young

1840
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:52,796
you don't have the luxury of diversifying.

1841
01:17:52,796 --> 01:17:53,118
You have to.

1842
01:17:53,118 --> 01:17:53,146
..

1843
01:17:53,146 --> 01:17:56,596
I bet you kinda went all in on this business at some point.

1844
01:17:56,596 --> 01:18:01,021
But as soon as you have the opportunity to diversify.

1845
01:18:01,021 --> 01:18:01,306
..

1846
01:18:01,306 --> 01:18:06,556
I'm about to put money in an aircraft maintenance company in El Salvador.

1847
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:07,146
I love it.

1848
01:18:07,146 --> 01:18:09,646
It's totally different than anything I do.

1849
01:18:09,646 --> 01:18:13,916
That way, if my world goes to shit again in tech

1850
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:17,896
I have someone making money fixing planes in El Salvador.

1851
01:18:17,896 --> 01:18:23,376
I do a bunch of just different weird businesses that aren't related

1852
01:18:23,376 --> 01:18:26,656
because over time, because of demographics and technology

1853
01:18:26,656 --> 01:18:30,056
productivity does grow up in our economy and the markets go up.

1854
01:18:30,056 --> 01:18:32,856
The best advice I can give any young person

1855
01:18:32,856 --> 01:18:35,936
in terms of the actual investment, is a low-cost ETF.

1856
01:18:35,936 --> 01:18:37,175
You don't want fees to eat up.

1857
01:18:37,175 --> 01:18:39,096
You don't want to day trade.

1858
01:18:39,096 --> 01:18:42,956
80 to 95% of people who day trade lose money.

1859
01:18:42,956 --> 01:18:46,005
You wanna be in a low-cost diversified, um

1860
01:18:46,005 --> 01:18:46,736
ETF.

1861
01:18:46,736 --> 01:18:47,896
What's an ETF?

1862
01:18:47,896 --> 01:18:49,076
Exchange-traded fund.

1863
01:18:49,076 --> 01:18:55,908
So they basically say, "Okay, we're gonna create a synthetic of the entire market and all healthcare stocks.

1864
01:18:55,908 --> 01:19:00,385
" So like I could, I could invest in a tech E- ETF or a solar ETF or- That's right.

1865
01:19:00,385 --> 01:19:00,385
.

1866
01:19:00,385 --> 01:19:00,385
.

1867
01:19:00,385 --> 01:19:02,796
or a, I don't know, a AI ETF?

1868
01:19:02,796 --> 01:19:03,715
Let me make it easy.

1869
01:19:03,715 --> 01:19:04,816
Go to Vanguard.

1870
01:19:04,816 --> 01:19:07,236
Um, I don't have a relationship with Vanguard.

1871
01:19:07,236 --> 01:19:10,916
SPY, that's the index that tracks the S&P 500.

1872
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:11,326
Mm-hmm.

1873
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:12,659
And so people.

1874
01:19:12,659 --> 01:19:12,786
..

1875
01:19:12,786 --> 01:19:17,576
The email I get most is from young men looking for guidance and mothers looking for guidance for their

1876
01:19:17,576 --> 01:19:18,396
for their sons.

1877
01:19:18,396 --> 01:19:22,196
The second most frequent email is the following

1878
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:24,684
"Is it too late to invest in Nvidia?

1879
01:19:24,684 --> 01:19:26,760
"And the honest answer is, I don't know.

1880
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,600
I can imagine a scenario where it gets cut by 80%.

1881
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,260
I can c- imagine a scenario where it triples.

1882
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,620
So this is what you do.

1883
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:38,800
You invest in SPY, because about 20% on the dollar will go into the Magnificent Seven

1884
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,000
because they're about 20% of the market cap of the S&P.

1885
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,600
SPY is, again, a basket of different stocks.

1886
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,360
It's, it's a index fund that mimics the S&P.

1887
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,620
So there are 500 companies in the S&P.

1888
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,220
NVIDIA's probably 3 or 5% of the total value of the S&P

1889
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:57,100
so five cents on your dollar goes into NVIDIA.

1890
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:57,460
Mm.

1891
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:57,719
Right?

1892
01:19:57,719 --> 01:19:58,866
About 20%.

1893
01:19:58,866 --> 01:19:59,160
..

1894
01:19:59,160 --> 01:19:59,520
Is that right?

1895
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,320
24, 25% is the Magnificent Seven, the tech companies we talk about.

1896
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,860
25 cents on your dollar will go to them.

1897
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:10,800
So assume those companies double, great, you participate.

1898
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:16,180
But assume the other 493 companies finally get their time in the sun and those companies go down a half

1899
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,580
you're still fine.

1900
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,710
You're still fine.

1901
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:22,049
Again, you don't need to find the needle in the haystack and stop believing

1902
01:20:22,049 --> 01:20:24,560
in a very American way, that you can figure it out.

1903
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:29,000
I know the brightest people in finance, and what I

1904
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,700
the, the, my net conclusion is that none of them have any fucking idea.

1905
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:38,100
Some have a little bit more of an idea

1906
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,220
but if you look at the entire alternative investments industry

1907
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,740
hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds

1908
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:50,180
anyone on CNBC, if you took all of their returns and aggregate

1909
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,960
they're less than the S&P by the amount of their fees.

1910
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,620
It's one of the greatest grifts in the modern economy

1911
01:20:55,620 --> 01:21:02,540
is believing that some guy who looks old and unhappy and has suspenders and went to Harvard knows more about the markets than you.

1912
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:07,560
All you need to know is diversification, right

1913
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,670
SPY, start saving young, and then the next best piece of advice is

1914
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:17,820
if you can, if you can, forced savings.

1915
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:22,400
98% of us will spend everything we get our hands on.

1916
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:27,450
It is very hard to have the discipline to take money that is within your grasp and invest it.

1917
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,120
Forced savings plan.

1918
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:34,109
Find out at work if they have profit-sharing or IRAs or Roths

1919
01:21:34,109 --> 01:21:35,232
whatever the, the.

1920
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,309
..

1921
01:21:35,309 --> 01:21:38,050
I forget what it's called here, where if you put some money aside

1922
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,369
the government matches it.

1923
01:21:39,369 --> 01:21:40,400
Pensions?

1924
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,820
Well, not only pensions, but there's something here

1925
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:42,380
I forget what it's called.

1926
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:44,780
If you save 5,000 pounds through your work

1927
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,440
the government, I think, will match it

1928
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,540
uh, put in 1,000 pounds.

1929
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:51,020
There's all sorts of saving schemes at work.

1930
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:56,380
Acorns, the apps that round up to the nearest dollar and then immediately shoot it into SPY.

1931
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:03,720
Try as hard as you can to put yourself in a position where you invest despite your best efforts not to.

1932
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:07,630
  'Cause the majority of us will get that money and go buy a flat-screen TV.

1933
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,460
And when you're saying investing, I think

1934
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:13,040
because it can s- sometimes sound complicated from someone that's so far away from it

1935
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,850
there's apps on our phones now- Yeah.

1936
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:14,850
.

1937
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:14,850
.

1938
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,140
where we can, in a couple of minutes

1939
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,709
invest in the exact thing you've just said.

1940
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:22,380
From, we can make ac- an account in a couple of minutes that'll probably ask for our passport

1941
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,740
take a photo of our passport.

1942
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:27,340
There's so many different apps where you can go in and invest in the S&P 500.

1943
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:27,850
You don't need- That's right.

1944
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:27,850
.

1945
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:27,850
.

1946
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,490
to call someone or know someone.

1947
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:30,360
And you can invest.

1948
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,850
What's the minimum you can invest, $50?

1949
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:32,690
A dollar.

1950
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:32,770
A dollar.

1951
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:33,954
Public, go to public.

1952
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:34,340
com.

1953
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:36,520
Y- I mean, start with a basic

1954
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:39,360
a basic low-cost ETF or index fund.

1955
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:44,040
S- SPY if you wanna get, take a little bit more risk and you wanna be in tech

1956
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,380
there's all sorts of ETFs and index funds around tech.

1957
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,680
Uh, uh, you're gonna, every young person

1958
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,580
especially a young man, is under the impression they're smarter than they are and that they can beat the market.

1959
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,820
So okay, take 30% of your money

1960
01:22:55,820 --> 01:23:00,060
have some fun, buy Starbucks, NVIDIA, Unilever

1961
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,760
Novo Nordisk, whatever you think you have insight into

1962
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,390
so you can learn a life lesson that over the long term you don't know what you're doing

1963
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:08,880
and just put it in an index fund.

1964
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,060
'Cause the marvelous thing about the human race is we become more productive

1965
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:16,620
and the Western economies, generally speaking, over the medium and long term are up and to the right.

1966
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:19,980
And again, and I'll go back to my algorithm

1967
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,960
or equation, focus.

1968
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,700
Find something you could be good at, maybe great

1969
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,720
that has a 90-plus percent employment rate.

1970
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,560
Stoicism, we haven't talked about that.

1971
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,720
Realize there's some things you can't control.

1972
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,180
Focus on the things you can control.

1973
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:36,620
One thing that is within your control is spending.

1974
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,640
Try and find a partner.

1975
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,800
Try and gamify spending.

1976
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,440
I spent $78 a week my summer between my junior and senior year

1977
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,020
including rent, because I needed $3,300 to go back to school.

1978
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:50,900
I partnered with five other guys in my fraternity and we gamified who could spend the least amount of money.

1979
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:55,940
Find a partner who's aligned with you around spending and saving

1980
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:56,220
right?

1981
01:23:56,220 --> 01:24:00,340
Realize no one's as impressed or thinking about your shit as much as you are

1982
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:00,730
right?

1983
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:03,960
F- try and find reward from exercise, from relationships

1984
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,700
not from signaling wealth with kind of stupid shit

1985
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,360
right?

1986
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,420
 I call that stoicism.

1987
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,780
It's really more about discipline.

1988
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:12,200
Develop a savings muscle.

1989
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,540
One, an appreciation for time and how fast it's gonna go.

1990
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,660
I was stupid.

1991
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,069
I remember my best friend, Lee Lotus

1992
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:20,110
picking me up to go to the beach when I was college

1993
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:24,830
and he was scrambling to find $2,000 to put it into something called an IRA Roth

1994
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:27,120
where his company, a bank he was working for

1995
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,817
he was just outta college, if he found $2

1996
01:24:28,817 --> 01:24:30,586
000, they would match it with another 2

1997
01:24:30,586 --> 01:24:30,960
000.

1998
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,400
I thought, I said to him these exact words

1999
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,720
"If 2,000 bucks means anything to me when I'm older

2000
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,857
shoot me.

2001
01:24:37,857 --> 01:24:42,620
" I have made so much more, much more money than Lee Lotus

2002
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,430
and he is a multimillionaire now.

2003
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:45,130
So am I.

2004
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:47,660
But I've endured a lot more risk and a lot more ups and downs

2005
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:51,415
'cause he was that lame guy scraping together $2

2006
01:24:51,415 --> 01:24:53,500
000 when he was 23.

2007
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:56,190
I went out and spent my first bonus check at Morgan Stanley.

2008
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:58,580
I got $28,000 my first year out of college

2009
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:01,280
Morgan Stanley, $28,000 check.

2010
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,735
I go out and I buy a $35

2011
01:25:02,735 --> 01:25:07,630
000 BMW, hung swim goggles from the rear view mirror thinking that would impress people.

2012
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:08,920
I don't know what I was doing.

2013
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,788
I figured out if I had bought a Hyundai for 9

2014
01:25:11,788 --> 01:25:15,240
000 bucks, which you could get in 1987 or whatever it is

2015
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,440
and invested the other 20 in SPY, never looked at it again

2016
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,200
I would have enough money now to buy 11 Ferraris

2017
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,940
including that new electric Ferrari that for some reason appeals to me

2018
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,710
which makes no sense, an electric Ferrari.

2019
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,640
Anyways-You're gonna love this.

2020
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,909
I tell the people who work for me that I drive up in a Ferrari and I say

2021
01:25:31,909 --> 01:25:35,433
"If you work really hard, someday, someday I'll have two Ferraris.

2022
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:36,740
"   Anyways.

2023
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:40,720
Uh, I don't have a Ferrari, by the way.

2024
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,440
 I- I- my other joke about a Ferrari is

2025
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:45,210
Ferrari is like having a long consistent erection.

2026
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:46,610
I don't have a Ferrari.

2027
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:50,780
 Anyways,  anyways, where were we going?

2028
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:54,010
Uh, realize people aren't as impressed with your shit as you are.

2029
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:55,730
Recognize the power of time.

2030
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,410
And then the thing where I really screwed up

2031
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:59,870
Steven, diversification.

2032
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,920
Take some money off the table.

2033
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,770
Invest in.

2034
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:02,950
..

2035
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:06,000
I'm hearing from employees in Nvidia, we talked about this

2036
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,130
diversify.

2037
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:07,913
You get.

2038
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:08,250
..

2039
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:12,600
it's such a bulletproof Kevlar for your mental health.

2040
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,340
You get risk-free return.

2041
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:16,800
Nobody knows, anything can happen.

2042
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,180
Amazon 1999, again, lost 90% of its value.

2043
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:27,400
Do you know the kind of mental anguish when you go into a stock like Amazon and you lose 90% of your

2044
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,880
of your investments?

2045
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,080
So if you want to have some fun

2046
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:34,100
ring fence it to 30% of your, of your savings

2047
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,560
pick some stuff, and it'll be a good life lesson for you.

2048
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,520
You may get lucky.

2049
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,860
More power to you.

2050
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:43,432
Over time, you're going to realize nothing beats over the long term.

2051
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:43,510
..

2052
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:46,360
Warren Buffett, what, the third wealthiest man in the world?

2053
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,100
I'm giving you the same answer he gives.

2054
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,960
If someone has 10,000 bucks, how do they invest?

2055
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,460
And he's like, low-cost index funds.

2056
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:55,690
It's a two-and-a-half-hour conversation.

2057
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:59,720
  That concludes it.

2058
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,980
 Put it in the S&P 500.

2059
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:04,220
Low, low-cost index fund.

2060
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:06,800
 I know, it's, it's the boring shit that makes you rich.

2061
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:07,430
Yeah.

2062
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:09,490
It's also, I, I, I buy a lot of CEOs.

2063
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,320
It's the boring incremental stuff that moves shareholder value.

2064
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:12,980
Mm-hmm.

2065
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,680
No, it's so true.

2066
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:19,090
So one of the things that stopped me when I was young from doing exactly what you just said is

2067
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:24,700
I didn't think that the $500 I had or the 500 pounds that I had was enough to get started.

2068
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:25,760
So I said to myself, in my head

2069
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,280
I thought, "Okay, when I get a million

2070
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,518
I'll become an investor.

2071
01:27:28,518 --> 01:27:31,660
" And I think a lot of people actually listen to these kind of conversations and go

2072
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,676
"Okay, once I've, once I've got 5

2073
01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:37,280
000 pounds disposable income a month, then I'll do what Scott said.

2074
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:40,168
But there's no point in doing it with a small amount of money.

2075
01:27:40,168 --> 01:27:40,270
" No.

2076
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:43,970
I wanted to use this little bucket of sand here as an analogy for this because

2077
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:51,820
um, my team brought a bucket of sand to illuminate the power of compounding interest when you invest in these S&P 500 companies.

2078
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:58,729
And this glass represents investing 1,000 a month in the S&P 500 over the course of 12 months

2079
01:27:58,729 --> 01:28:00,420
starting at the age of 25.

2080
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:01,000
Right.

2081
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,400
But if you left it and kept investing at that rate

2082
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,020
by the age of 65, it would look like this.

2083
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:09,540
You have Zuma Beach.

2084
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,500
Zuma.

2085
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:11,550
Ah.

2086
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:12,440
 Oh, my God.

2087
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,100
Thank God that's you.

2088
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:15,000
Jesus Christ.

2089
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,760
It would look like that.

2090
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:23,760
And this is really what you're saying when you're talking about ETFs?

2091
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,940
Well, when you asked that question about the young man who says

2092
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:27,059
"I'm gonna wait till I get.

2093
01:28:27,059 --> 01:28:27,289
..

2094
01:28:27,289 --> 01:28:30,116
I have 500 pounds, I'm gonna wait till I have a million before I start investing.

2095
01:28:30,116 --> 01:28:32,900
" The way you get a million pounds is by investing that 500.

2096
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,200
We don't believe we're gonna get old.

2097
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,400
We don't recognize how fast time is gonna go.

2098
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,820
We don't appreciate the power of compound interest.

2099
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:42,300
Don't focus on your investments.

2100
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:46,900
Put it in low-cost, low-energy ETFs.

2101
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,289
Start early.

2102
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:51,760
You have ti- Your advantage when you're young is time

2103
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,160
and you're gonna get that bucket of sand.

2104
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,630
By the way, this right here isn't a lesson in investing.

2105
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,690
This is a lesson in storytelling.

2106
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,400
A bucket of sand?

2107
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,569
I mean, who thinks of this?

2108
01:29:00,569 --> 01:29:02,860
Oh, my gosh.

2109
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:04,380
I'm moving it out the way.

2110
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,200
No, but it is, it is.

2111
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:12,680
Uh, uh, I've, I, um, I discovered the art and the science of compounding interest too late in my life.

2112
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:12,690
Yeah, most people do.

2113
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:16,240
And I just wish someone had slapped me in the face with it at 18.

2114
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:17,220
Yeah, it's crazy.

2115
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,720
Honestly, I probably started at 28.

2116
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:25,340
That's still earlier than most people, but it goes to the notion of back to the advice for a young person.

2117
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:29,840
Most young people don't have the discipline to invest any money they get their hands on

2118
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,105
'cause the capitalist economy is a.

2119
01:29:32,105 --> 01:29:32,330
..

2120
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:37,310
The, the smartest people in the world with the most godlike technology are presenting you with amazing

2121
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:40,630
irresistible offers to upgrade from economy to economy comfort

2122
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:46,970
to add, to add flourless chocolate cake to your order from Balthazar boulangerie in one minute or less.

2123
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:47,900
I'm like, "Oh, my God.

2124
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:50,660
Oh, wait, there's three other people looking at this room

2125
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,300
this hotel room, and it's going on sale

2126
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:56,770
and I better bu-" It's so difficult to hold onto any money.

2127
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:58,900
You want to find ways of forced savings.

2128
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,160
A house is forced savings to a certain extent

2129
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,460
'cause people don't want to be evicted from their house.

2130
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:07,770
Going to work for a company and getting options and getting equity that grows tax deferred

2131
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:09,690
that's sort of forced savings.

2132
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:10,980
But you want to, as a young person

2133
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:14,420
try and find as many ways as possible to have forced savings.

2134
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:20,360
An app that, that rounds up to the nearest dollar and then invests no matter what

2135
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:21,580
that is forced savings.

2136
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:24,920
It is very difficult to take money that is in

2137
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,540
ever comes through your hands, and invest it.

2138
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:31,740
So, uh, find forced savings mechanisms that are taken out of your check.

2139
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:38,660
Find out if your company offers any sort of investment or savings schemes that they match or that the government matches.

2140
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:42,080
And most corporations offer something.

2141
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,140
Real estate.

2142
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:47,270
I've had a lot of guests talk to me like Morgan Housel and others that have a sort of mixed view- Yeah.

2143
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,273
.

2144
01:30:47,273 --> 01:30:47,280
..

2145
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,140
on whether real estate is a good investment.

2146
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,580
What's your thoughts on it?

2147
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,300
Should I be investing in real estate?

2148
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,850
Well, you know, my brother said something to me when I was 25.

2149
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:59,800
He said, "Steve, if everybody is playing the game

2150
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,137
the returns probably aren't great from it.

2151
01:31:02,137 --> 01:31:03,500
" Goes back to sex appeal.

2152
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,780
Too much capital going in.

2153
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:12,680
L- look, uh, K Schiller, the brightest people in real estate will say if you really account for maintenance and upkeep

2154
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,510
that real estate has not outperformed other asset classes.

2155
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:17,300
The reason I like real estate is that

2156
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:20,400
one, in the United States it's very tax advantaged.

2157
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,700
There are very few asset classes you can lever up four to one.

2158
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,920
20% down payment?

2159
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,987
I can't buy Apple.

2160
01:31:26,987 --> 01:31:27,070
..

2161
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:30,448
I can't buy $100 worth of Apple stock for 20 bucks.

2162
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:32,873
So it's h- it's a huge leverage.

2163
01:31:32,873 --> 01:31:35,274
The interest on that is tax deductible.

2164
01:31:35,274 --> 01:31:37,164
In addition, if you sell a home

2165
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:38,874
and this is true in the US, I own in the US

2166
01:31:38,874 --> 01:31:40,434
uh, I don't know, in the UK

2167
01:31:40,434 --> 01:31:42,424
if you buy a home and sell it after

2168
01:31:42,424 --> 01:31:43,664
hold onto it for at least two years

2169
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:47,046
you get a $250,000 tax deduction, 500

2170
01:31:47,046 --> 01:31:48,624
000 for married.

2171
01:31:48,624 --> 01:31:51,224
So if you have, for example, any ability

2172
01:31:51,224 --> 01:31:54,564
get to know the, the homes in your area

2173
01:31:54,564 --> 01:31:58,954
find a nice home or a rental unit that you can maybe rent out or

2174
01:31:58,954 --> 01:32:06,814
or upgrade, maybe you're handy, to do that every few years and take advantage of the tax deduction and then roll into something bigger

2175
01:32:06,814 --> 01:32:08,764
and that is for savings.

2176
01:32:08,764 --> 01:32:11,464
You know that mortgage payment is coming every month.

2177
01:32:11,464 --> 01:32:16,864
Actually, the majority of savings for Baby Boomers right now is in their homes.

2178
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:18,124
It's the equity in their homes.

2179
01:32:18,124 --> 01:32:19,804
Now, unfortunately, that's, there's some bad things

2180
01:32:19,804 --> 01:32:22,944
we haven't improved housing permits as quickly as we should

2181
01:32:22,944 --> 01:32:25,604
which has made it more expensive for entrants.

2182
01:32:25,604 --> 01:32:31,144
Young people can't afford homes, the average home's gone from 290 to 420 through the pandemic in the US

2183
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:34,309
and if you look at interest rates, it means the average mortgage payment's gone from $1

2184
01:32:34,309 --> 01:32:36,484
100 to $2,300.

2185
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:39,064
So it used to be 2/3 of America could afford a home

2186
01:32:39,064 --> 01:32:39,974
now it's 1/3.

2187
01:32:39,974 --> 01:32:40,529
I- I.

2188
01:32:40,529 --> 01:32:40,814
..

2189
01:32:40,814 --> 01:32:44,844
a whole other talk show, but I just did a TED Talk on the war on the young

2190
01:32:44,844 --> 01:32:48,124
economically, but real estate is a very tax advantaged industry.

2191
01:32:48,124 --> 01:32:49,804
It is for savings.

2192
01:32:49,804 --> 01:32:52,344
Also, there is some, I think, psychic value

2193
01:32:52,344 --> 01:32:54,284
which I think is important to, to a home.

2194
01:32:54,284 --> 01:32:56,604
You start investing in it, fixing it up

2195
01:32:56,604 --> 01:33:00,094
it feels like, I don't know, it's just there's something rewarding about it.

2196
01:33:00,094 --> 01:33:04,504
But to what your brother said, when everyone's trying to buy homes in an area

2197
01:33:04,504 --> 01:33:08,604
that usually means it's probably getting overvalued, and like any other asset class

2198
01:33:08,604 --> 01:33:10,004
uh, it can lose money.

2199
01:33:10,004 --> 01:33:14,564
But the reason I like it is because it is a form of forced savings.

2200
01:33:14,564 --> 01:33:18,864
People, generally speaking, will make that mortgage payment or try and figure out a way.

2201
01:33:18,864 --> 01:33:24,314
Now you want to make sure that not more than 40% of your income goes into a house

2202
01:33:24,314 --> 01:33:28,864
otherwise it's just gonna be your anchor, it's just gonna be a source of stress for you

2203
01:33:28,864 --> 01:33:30,094
and I think a lot of people grow up thinking

2204
01:33:30,094 --> 01:33:36,304
"I have to have a home," and so they just become over levered in their home and they become kind of house poor.

2205
01:33:36,304 --> 01:33:39,004
They own a house and that's it, and they can't afford to do anything else.

2206
01:33:39,004 --> 01:33:40,624
And they mightn't be able to, able to move then

2207
01:33:40,624 --> 01:33:43,013
and you talked about geographical opportunity when you're young.

2208
01:33:43,013 --> 01:33:44,104
That's right, you get tied.

2209
01:33:44,104 --> 01:33:44,154
Yeah.

2210
01:33:44,154 --> 01:33:47,104
You get tied down, especially if your home goes down in value.

2211
01:33:47,104 --> 01:33:49,584
But I still think it's a, in the US at least

2212
01:33:49,584 --> 01:33:53,184
real estate's the most taxed advantage, and if you own commercial real estate in the US

2213
01:33:53,184 --> 01:33:55,304
you can depreciate it 2% or 3% a year.

2214
01:33:55,304 --> 01:33:57,984
You can't depreciate a stock 2% or 3% a year.

2215
01:33:57,984 --> 01:34:00,173
Is there someone that should and shouldn't buy a home then

2216
01:34:00,173 --> 01:34:01,204
in your view?

2217
01:34:01,204 --> 01:34:06,054
Is there a certain demographic or age or s- person with a certain talent that should and shouldn't buy a home?

2218
01:34:06,054 --> 01:34:07,854
I would say in general if it's a home

2219
01:34:07,854 --> 01:34:11,464
if you think that you're not gonna be able to hold onto it for at least seven years

2220
01:34:11,464 --> 01:34:12,953
if you hold onto a home for seven years

2221
01:34:12,953 --> 01:34:19,044
you should be able to ride out most economic cycles or e- economic down cycle.

2222
01:34:19,044 --> 01:34:21,504
Um, I think there's some wonderful things about renting.

2223
01:34:21,504 --> 01:34:25,044
You can slam your keys down and leave if you're planning to move.

2224
01:34:25,044 --> 01:34:29,704
Um, if you don't have somewhat reliable sources of income

2225
01:34:29,704 --> 01:34:34,144
um, a mortgage is probably a tough thing.

2226
01:34:34,144 --> 01:34:36,044
I don't know, I think o- I think home ownership

2227
01:34:36,044 --> 01:34:41,124
I- I'm talking my own book a little bit here because I've made good money in real estate and I've really enjoyed it

2228
01:34:41,124 --> 01:34:46,754
but I think it's situational, and it goes back to that notion of having a kitchen cabinet of people who can advise you on

2229
01:34:46,754 --> 01:34:48,584
on, on that asset class.

2230
01:34:48,584 --> 01:34:52,384
Unfortunately, that asset class has become so expensive that the

2231
01:34:52,384 --> 01:34:54,060
quote unquote, "American dream of owning a home

2232
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:56,524
" has become somewhat of a hallucination, if you will

2233
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,404
or a fantasy for a lot of young people.

2234
01:34:59,404 --> 01:35:01,704
The other thing I, I came to learn as I got money

2235
01:35:01,704 --> 01:35:04,824
and I, it was almost like someone pulled the curtain back for me

2236
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:09,684
is how wealthy individuals play the tax game.

2237
01:35:09,684 --> 01:35:10,444
Oh my gosh.

2238
01:35:10,444 --> 01:35:13,804
And it's a tax game that the average person has no idea is going on.

2239
01:35:13,804 --> 01:35:15,224
Got to talk about money.

2240
01:35:15,224 --> 01:35:18,284
Tax avoidance is a key skill to building wealth.

2241
01:35:18,284 --> 01:35:20,944
And by the way, people, we don't talk about

2242
01:35:20,944 --> 01:35:24,244
I, I speak openly about my, I won't call it tax avoidance

2243
01:35:24,244 --> 01:35:25,944
but my tax strategies.

2244
01:35:25,944 --> 01:35:27,384
If you're, you know, it's like they said

2245
01:35:27,384 --> 01:35:30,784
if you're a prisoner of war, you have an obligation to escape.

2246
01:35:30,784 --> 01:35:34,513
If you're trying to build wealth, you have an obligation to pay as little tax as possible.

2247
01:35:34,513 --> 01:35:35,953
Do it legally.

2248
01:35:35,953 --> 01:35:39,664
But Apple will issue their IP to Apple International in Ireland

2249
01:35:39,664 --> 01:35:45,364
and then they will use Apple Ireland, they will license their IP to America

2250
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:54,524
charge them tens of billions of dollars, thereby increasing the income of Apple Ireland at a lower tax rate and decreasing the income in the US

2251
01:35:54,524 --> 01:35:57,414
thereby lowering their overall tax rate.

2252
01:35:57,414 --> 01:36:00,684
That is pure tax avoidance.

2253
01:36:00,684 --> 01:36:05,024
Every organization, every corporation does this to the hilt

2254
01:36:05,024 --> 01:36:07,164
and so should you.

2255
01:36:07,164 --> 01:36:11,084
By the way, I will vote for people who have an alternative minimum tax.

2256
01:36:11,084 --> 01:36:13,234
We have to raise taxes on corporations.

2257
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:17,564
The 25 wealthiest Americans pay between 6% and 8% tax rate.

2258
01:36:17,564 --> 01:36:19,494
What are the tax games they're playing?

2259
01:36:19,494 --> 01:36:19,873
Oh.

2260
01:36:19,873 --> 01:36:20,644
This, the rich people?

2261
01:36:20,644 --> 01:36:21,764
There's a bunch of them.

2262
01:36:21,764 --> 01:36:24,764
First and foremost, it's you buy stocks

2263
01:36:24,764 --> 01:36:26,864
you never sell them, you borrow against them.

2264
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:28,574
Okay, explain that to me like I'm a 10-year-old.

2265
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:29,104
So- Sure.

2266
01:36:29,104 --> 01:36:30,884
You own $100 in Amazon stock.

2267
01:36:30,884 --> 01:36:31,064
Yeah.

2268
01:36:31,064 --> 01:36:33,064
You need money to buy something.

2269
01:36:33,064 --> 01:36:36,524
Instead of selling the stock, and let's say it's gone up 50%

2270
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:42,504
let's say it's doubled, you would have to realize a capital gain and pay long-term capital gains on that $50 gain.

2271
01:36:42,504 --> 01:36:47,544
No, just borrow against it and let the stock continue to grow

2272
01:36:47,544 --> 01:36:48,724
and you pay a little bit of interest

2273
01:36:48,724 --> 01:36:52,324
hopefully from your current income, but basically it's invest

2274
01:36:52,324 --> 01:36:54,124
borrow against it, and die.

2275
01:36:54,124 --> 01:36:58,804
Put it into a, a trust and then pass it on to your kids.

2276
01:36:58,804 --> 01:37:01,594
There's a lot of, um, state arbitrage.

2277
01:37:01,594 --> 01:37:04,804
Jeff Bezos just moved to Florida to spend more time with dad.

2278
01:37:04,804 --> 01:37:05,944
Isn't that sweet, Steven?

2279
01:37:05,944 --> 01:37:07,464
Isn't that nice?

2280
01:37:07,464 --> 01:37:08,964
No, it has nothing to do with his father.

2281
01:37:08,964 --> 01:37:10,464
Give me a fucking break.

2282
01:37:10,464 --> 01:37:13,904
He aggregated $160 billion in wealth.

2283
01:37:13,904 --> 01:37:19,404
He would pay about another 8% or 10% in state taxes in Washington because he's got to leverage the public school system

2284
01:37:19,404 --> 01:37:21,544
the University of Washington, the Seattle-Tacoma Airport

2285
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:22,984
the hospital system.

2286
01:37:22,984 --> 01:37:28,494
But in the US, you're allowed to peace out to Texas or Florida and pay no income tax.

2287
01:37:28,494 --> 01:37:34,684
So all the people shitposting California or New York-Show me someone who's crit- all of a sudden can't handle San Francisco politics

2288
01:37:34,684 --> 01:37:40,024
I'm gonna show you someone who needs to recognize a capital gain and has all of a sudden decided they like Texas politics.

2289
01:37:40,024 --> 01:37:43,084
It's really not very, it's very disingenuous.

2290
01:37:43,084 --> 01:37:47,464
There's, uh, the tax loophole I've leveraged.

2291
01:37:47,464 --> 01:37:51,104
In the US there's something called 1202, or Qualified Small Business.

2292
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:54,204
So when I started L2- What's L2?

2293
01:37:54,204 --> 01:37:56,384
L2 is my analytics company.

2294
01:37:56,384 --> 01:37:57,324
I started it.

2295
01:37:57,324 --> 01:38:00,464
I invested a small amount of money, um

2296
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:03,844
uh, because it was a business worth fi- fi- less than 50 million

2297
01:38:03,844 --> 01:38:07,684
your business would qualify in the US as QSB small business.

2298
01:38:07,684 --> 01:38:11,064
If you hold onto that stock in that company for longer than five years

2299
01:38:11,064 --> 01:38:13,394
when you sell it, the first 10 million

2300
01:38:13,394 --> 01:38:16,204
or 10 times the basis, are tax-free.

2301
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:20,164
So the first 10 million out of L2 was tax-free

2302
01:38:20,164 --> 01:38:21,304
zero.

2303
01:38:21,304 --> 01:38:22,684
That makes no sense.

2304
01:38:22,684 --> 01:38:24,624
If that sounds like we're screwing the middle class

2305
01:38:24,624 --> 01:38:26,084
trust your instincts.

2306
01:38:26,084 --> 01:38:29,764
I invested in a company, brought a company out of bankruptcy.

2307
01:38:29,764 --> 01:38:32,704
I invested two and a half million.

2308
01:38:32,704 --> 01:38:35,754
The first 25 million got very lucky, the company got sold for a lot of money

2309
01:38:35,754 --> 01:38:38,144
the first 25 million were tax-free.

2310
01:38:38,144 --> 01:38:41,564
These are, the tax code has gone from 400 pages to 4

2311
01:38:41,564 --> 01:38:47,664
000, and that extra 3,600 pages are to turn rich people into super rich people.

2312
01:38:47,664 --> 01:38:50,024
Now, the myth around taxes is the following

2313
01:38:50,024 --> 01:38:51,764
that rich people don't pay their taxes.

2314
01:38:51,764 --> 01:38:56,964
Actually, the sort of rich pay a disproportionate amount of taxes.

2315
01:38:56,964 --> 01:38:59,164
So if you make all of your money from current income

2316
01:38:59,164 --> 01:39:01,984
that is salary, and you make a lot

2317
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:03,944
you're actually paying more taxes than anyone.

2318
01:39:03,944 --> 01:39:05,224
So mom's a baller.

2319
01:39:05,224 --> 01:39:08,544
She's a partner in a prestigious law firm making a million bucks a year.

2320
01:39:08,544 --> 01:39:12,074
Dad's a chiropractor, has three people working for him.

2321
01:39:12,074 --> 01:39:13,811
He makes 600, $1.

2322
01:39:13,811 --> 01:39:16,814
6 million a year, total ballers.

2323
01:39:16,814 --> 01:39:18,034
In order to make that kind of money

2324
01:39:18,034 --> 01:39:21,084
they probably have to live in a urban center in a blue state

2325
01:39:21,084 --> 01:39:24,364
where at that level they're paying 45, 48

2326
01:39:24,364 --> 01:39:27,244
sometimes 52% tax rates.

2327
01:39:27,244 --> 01:39:35,004
But if Dad decides to raise capital and buy a bunch of chiropractic clinics and they become investments

2328
01:39:35,004 --> 01:39:39,344
and he sells them for $50 million, his tax rate plummets.

2329
01:39:39,344 --> 01:39:40,784
So you don't wanna be a super earner

2330
01:39:40,784 --> 01:39:45,164
you wanna earn enough money to invest so you can become a super owner.

2331
01:39:45,164 --> 01:39:49,564
The top 25 wealthiest Americans pay about 8% in tax

2332
01:39:49,564 --> 01:39:50,644
right?

2333
01:39:50,644 --> 01:39:54,064
So actually, the bottom half pay almost no tax.

2334
01:39:54,064 --> 01:39:58,644
They pay a lot of consumption taxes, but it's the super earners that get screwed

2335
01:39:58,644 --> 01:39:59,964
what I call the workhorses.

2336
01:39:59,964 --> 01:40:06,664
But once you make the jump to light speed and you own things and you make your money from buying and selling assets

2337
01:40:06,664 --> 01:40:09,204
your tax rate plummets.

2338
01:40:09,204 --> 01:40:13,124
The really sort of actionable thing there for the average person as well is probably the

2339
01:40:13,124 --> 01:40:17,084
the first point where you said a lot of what rich people do is they'll buy a stock.

2340
01:40:17,084 --> 01:40:20,324
So I'll, I'll spend 10K on Amazon stock

2341
01:40:20,324 --> 01:40:23,609
and then I go to a bank and the bank give me a $5

2342
01:40:23,609 --> 01:40:27,314
000 loan against my Amazon stock tax-free- Right.

2343
01:40:27,314 --> 01:40:27,327
.

2344
01:40:27,327 --> 01:40:27,334
..

2345
01:40:27,334 --> 01:40:28,664
and I just hold the Amazon stock.

2346
01:40:28,664 --> 01:40:30,404
Now I've got 5,000 c- tax-free.

2347
01:40:30,404 --> 01:40:31,953
If the Amazon stock goes to twe- uh

2348
01:40:31,953 --> 01:40:34,694
$20,000 in value, then I can

2349
01:40:34,694 --> 01:40:35,793
I can go to the bank and say

2350
01:40:35,793 --> 01:40:37,421
"It's gone up now, give me another $5

2351
01:40:37,421 --> 01:40:38,070
000.

2352
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:38,233
" Far more.

2353
01:40:38,233 --> 01:40:39,664
And I just spend and live off that money.

2354
01:40:39,664 --> 01:40:44,974
Now, if the Amazon stock collapses, I'm fine because the loan was against the stock.

2355
01:40:44,974 --> 01:40:48,374
So they'll sell the stock at a certain point as it's collapsing to get their money back.

2356
01:40:48,374 --> 01:40:50,944
Yeah, I mean, you don't wanna get into too much trouble

2357
01:40:50,944 --> 01:40:54,344
but, uh, leverage is how smart people go broke.

2358
01:40:54,344 --> 01:40:59,854
But the idea is that one of the great tax schemes in history is that stocks grow.

2359
01:40:59,854 --> 01:41:01,924
Think of yourself as a stock.

2360
01:41:01,924 --> 01:41:05,384
You, you go up in value a million bucks a year.

2361
01:41:05,384 --> 01:41:08,904
You're making a million dollars a year doing a very successful podcast.

2362
01:41:08,904 --> 01:41:12,384
Every year, the government in the UK is gonna take 40 cents of that

2363
01:41:12,384 --> 01:41:13,884
40% of it.

2364
01:41:13,884 --> 01:41:17,764
If you own a million dollars in stock and it goes to two million

2365
01:41:17,764 --> 01:41:20,304
you don't get taxed on it till you sell it.

2366
01:41:20,304 --> 01:41:21,254
Yeah, so just never sell it.

2367
01:41:21,254 --> 01:41:22,274
Never sell it.

2368
01:41:22,274 --> 01:41:24,544
And that's what Elon's doing with his company.

2369
01:41:24,544 --> 01:41:24,554
Never sell it.

2370
01:41:24,554 --> 01:41:26,314
People say he's got, you know, $200 billion

2371
01:41:26,314 --> 01:41:26,684
whatever.

2372
01:41:26,684 --> 01:41:29,774
In fact, he's borrowing tax-free against those companies.

2373
01:41:29,774 --> 01:41:32,164
And then when he finally needs to sell it to pay off some of those loans

2374
01:41:32,164 --> 01:41:37,084
he moves to Texas, despite the fact he built all his wealth in California.

2375
01:41:37,084 --> 01:41:37,424
Smart.

2376
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:39,364
I think, uh, one of the great advantages of life is

2377
01:41:39,364 --> 01:41:41,674
um, a- as it relates to wealth creation

2378
01:41:41,674 --> 01:41:48,953
is really getting good tax advice, 'cause I've sat here over and over again with people that have great tax advice and some people who didn't have any at all.

2379
01:41:48,953 --> 01:41:51,393
And the outcomes are quite frankly, um

2380
01:41:51,393 --> 01:41:52,143
shocking.

2381
01:41:52,143 --> 01:41:54,184
The variance in outcomes are quite frankly shocking

2382
01:41:54,184 --> 01:41:57,744
from one person going bankrupt to the other person becoming a multi-billionaire.

2383
01:41:57,744 --> 01:42:02,444
And it comes down to, some of it comes down to their tax strategy and how they thought about tax.

2384
01:42:02,444 --> 01:42:06,624
And how, you know, being around a lot of people now that are masters in tax

2385
01:42:06,624 --> 01:42:08,354
it was like- Yeah.

2386
01:42:08,354 --> 01:42:11,404
Yeah, I describe it as someone pulled back a curtain that I never knew was there

2387
01:42:11,404 --> 01:42:13,653
and all these people were doing magic behind this curtain

2388
01:42:13,653 --> 01:42:15,884
and no one ever told me that curtain existed- That's right.

2389
01:42:15,884 --> 01:42:15,894
.

2390
01:42:15,894 --> 01:42:15,894
..

2391
01:42:15,894 --> 01:42:17,044
and it's called tax.

2392
01:42:17,044 --> 01:42:18,074
Well- We don't all pay the same tax.

2393
01:42:18,074 --> 01:42:18,074
.

2394
01:42:18,074 --> 01:42:18,074
.

2395
01:42:18,074 --> 01:42:19,424
because we're not supposed to talk about it.

2396
01:42:19,424 --> 01:42:19,644
Yeah.

2397
01:42:19,644 --> 01:42:22,964
Again, not talking about it is rich people trying to keep poor people down.

2398
01:42:22,964 --> 01:42:23,544
Yeah.

2399
01:42:23,544 --> 01:42:25,424
Because rich people talk about their taxes all the time.

2400
01:42:25,424 --> 01:42:29,104
Brightest woman in my entire professional universe is a woman named Lucy Lee

2401
01:42:29,104 --> 01:42:32,054
who is my tax Yoda, who works at a big law firm

2402
01:42:32,054 --> 01:42:34,314
that I pay 1,800 bucks an hour to

2403
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:36,152
to figure out the smartest.

2404
01:42:36,152 --> 01:42:36,274
..

2405
01:42:36,274 --> 01:42:38,964
When I set up a company, I talk to my tax person.

2406
01:42:38,964 --> 01:42:42,424
When I'm about to get a big payment for my podcast distribution company

2407
01:42:42,424 --> 01:42:44,684
I talk to my tax person first.

2408
01:42:44,684 --> 01:42:50,404
This is, it is everything, but the key when you're young is to become an owner

2409
01:42:50,404 --> 01:42:51,364
not an earner.

2410
01:42:51,364 --> 01:42:52,744
You're an earner.

2411
01:42:52,744 --> 01:42:58,744
You want to bust a move out of earning and develop an army of capital that goes out and kills for you at night.

2412
01:42:58,744 --> 01:43:01,634
500 bucks is a lot of money when you're 21.

2413
01:43:01,634 --> 01:43:05,504
500 bucks when you're 21 is 10,000 when you're my age

2414
01:43:05,504 --> 01:43:05,884
right?

2415
01:43:05,884 --> 01:43:06,204
Mm-hmm.

2416
01:43:06,204 --> 01:43:08,104
And it's gonna go really fast.

2417
01:43:08,104 --> 01:43:12,024
So just start, and then once you become a super owner

2418
01:43:12,024 --> 01:43:13,909
you have 10,000, 50,000, 100

2419
01:43:13,909 --> 01:43:16,884
000, a million dollars in assets, then

2420
01:43:16,884 --> 01:43:22,704
then you can become a super tax avoider.

2421
01:43:22,704 --> 01:43:28,344
  That is so bad.

2422
01:43:28,344 --> 01:43:31,164
That sounded awful, didn't it?

2423
01:43:31,164 --> 01:43:31,574
 Yeah.

2424
01:43:31,574 --> 01:43:33,064
Sounded awful.

2425
01:43:33,064 --> 01:43:35,004
That sounded awful.

2426
01:43:35,004 --> 01:43:38,944
Sitting here with your bucket of sand.

2427
01:43:38,944 --> 01:43:41,392
  Oh, my God.

2428
01:43:41,392 --> 01:43:42,412
 Our budget melinas.

2429
01:43:42,412 --> 01:43:43,072
That's right.

2430
01:43:43,072 --> 01:43:45,952
Talk about, "This is how we fuck the middle class

2431
01:43:45,952 --> 01:43:46,912
Stephen.

2432
01:43:46,912 --> 01:43:51,500
This is how we really screw over the little guy.

2433
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:55,162
"  We have a cl-  We have a closing tradition on this podcast- Oh

2434
01:43:55,162 --> 01:43:55,432
there we go.

2435
01:43:55,432 --> 01:43:55,448
.

2436
01:43:55,448 --> 01:43:55,462
..

2437
01:43:55,462 --> 01:43:57,012
where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest.

2438
01:43:57,012 --> 01:43:57,532
 Yeah.

2439
01:43:57,532 --> 01:43:58,752
Not knowing who they're leaving it for.

2440
01:43:58,752 --> 01:44:05,932
 What is the last thing you learned how to do just because you wanted to learn how to do it?

2441
01:44:05,932 --> 01:44:06,412
Hm.

2442
01:44:06,412 --> 01:44:09,732
That's really interesting.

2443
01:44:09,732 --> 01:44:14,242
Um, you know, it sounds.

2444
01:44:14,242 --> 01:44:14,502
..

2445
01:44:14,502 --> 01:44:15,712
Oh, this is gonna sound so trite

2446
01:44:15,712 --> 01:44:18,721
but my boys and I are, uh

2447
01:44:18,721 --> 01:44:19,018
uh.

2448
01:44:19,018 --> 01:44:19,182
..

2449
01:44:19,182 --> 01:44:20,092
You know, when you get.

2450
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:20,392
..

2451
01:44:20,392 --> 01:44:24,068
When you're a dad, you, you, you.

2452
01:44:24,068 --> 01:44:24,282
..

2453
01:44:24,282 --> 01:44:26,318
I- If you're an e- egomaniac like me.

2454
01:44:26,318 --> 01:44:26,362
..

2455
01:44:26,362 --> 01:44:32,052
I just assumed my kids were gonna be super into World War II history and CrossFit

2456
01:44:32,052 --> 01:44:34,797
because I thought, "Oh, they would think I was such a hero that they'd w- get.

2457
01:44:34,797 --> 01:44:34,940
..

2458
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,432
" But you realize if you wanna be a good dad

2459
01:44:36,432 --> 01:44:40,632
you have to be engaged in what your kids are engaged in.

2460
01:44:40,632 --> 01:44:42,582
Otherwise, you're just not gonna engage.

2461
01:44:42,582 --> 01:44:44,812
I have no interest in sports.

2462
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:53,592
I have become a massive fan of Premier League football because my kids are so devoted to Chelsea and to Tottenham.

2463
01:44:53,592 --> 01:44:58,192
So I've taken up Arsenal so we can have a lot of fights in the house.

2464
01:44:58,192 --> 01:44:59,732
 But what have I learned?

2465
01:44:59,732 --> 01:45:01,942
I've learned to love football.

2466
01:45:01,942 --> 01:45:03,912
And the moment my sons are out of the house

2467
01:45:03,912 --> 01:45:06,292
I will learn to not care about it again.

2468
01:45:06,292 --> 01:45:08,352
So, I've learned to love Premier League football

2469
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,852
'cause it's a way I engage with my boys.

2470
01:45:10,852 --> 01:45:11,972
Well, next year, we'll go.

2471
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:12,522
Yeah.

2472
01:45:12,522 --> 01:45:13,822
I'm a Manchester United fan, so, uh

2473
01:45:13,822 --> 01:45:13,822
you know.

2474
01:45:13,822 --> 01:45:14,472
Man U?

2475
01:45:14,472 --> 01:45:14,672
Yeah, yeah.

2476
01:45:14,672 --> 01:45:16,632
How fucking predictable.

2477
01:45:16,632 --> 01:45:18,212
 Literally, Man U.

2478
01:45:18,212 --> 01:45:18,282
About to be another podcast .

2479
01:45:18,282 --> 01:45:20,052
You're such a poser.

2480
01:45:20,052 --> 01:45:21,192
You're such a- Cut there.

2481
01:45:21,192 --> 01:45:21,422
Cut there.

2482
01:45:21,422 --> 01:45:21,952
Oh, wait.

2483
01:45:21,952 --> 01:45:24,152
You, you grew up in Manchester, right?

2484
01:45:24,152 --> 01:45:25,112
Half my family did.

2485
01:45:25,112 --> 01:45:26,502
Okay, then- So, half my siblings were born there.

2486
01:45:26,502 --> 01:45:26,702
Yeah, yeah.

2487
01:45:26,702 --> 01:45:28,572
Then the only thing worse than that would have been Man City

2488
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:29,362
but you have- Yeah.

2489
01:45:29,362 --> 01:45:32,822
Okay, you have Man U rights then if you're from Manchester.

2490
01:45:32,822 --> 01:45:32,822
Yeah.

2491
01:45:32,822 --> 01:45:33,725
I have to tell people this all.

2492
01:45:33,725 --> 01:45:33,782
..

2493
01:45:33,782 --> 01:45:34,584
They're like, "Wha-" Like, they.

2494
01:45:34,584 --> 01:45:34,622
..

2495
01:45:34,622 --> 01:45:37,790
'Cause you get roasted, and then you have to indicate that the f-.

2496
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:37,802
..

2497
01:45:37,802 --> 01:45:40,552
Like, for me, the first place we lived in the UK was Manchester

2498
01:45:40,552 --> 01:45:42,232
so my older siblings were all born there

2499
01:45:42,232 --> 01:45:43,712
and then we moved to Devon in the Southwest

2500
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:44,918
which, countryside, but.

2501
01:45:44,918 --> 01:45:45,142
..

2502
01:45:45,142 --> 01:45:46,652
One of the strongest brands in the world.

2503
01:45:46,652 --> 01:45:49,491
My, my six-year-old son has a friend coming.

2504
01:45:49,491 --> 01:45:52,192
They're gonna take the train up just to do a tour of the stadium.

2505
01:45:52,192 --> 01:45:52,792
Oh, really?

2506
01:45:52,792 --> 01:45:54,232
How many times do you do that?

2507
01:45:54,232 --> 01:45:55,772
So I- When will they be coming?

2508
01:45:55,772 --> 01:45:57,292
Uh, I think it's in a few weeks.

2509
01:45:57,292 --> 01:45:57,584
We're going.

2510
01:45:57,584 --> 01:45:57,622
..

2511
01:45:57,622 --> 01:46:00,512
But, I mean, we're going to Germany for the European Championships.

2512
01:46:00,512 --> 01:46:00,622
Ah.

2513
01:46:00,622 --> 01:46:01,472
We're going to the World Cup.

2514
01:46:01,472 --> 01:46:04,892
Our whole family, our activity, is we explore Europe

2515
01:46:04,892 --> 01:46:07,512
we follow, uh, we go, you know

2516
01:46:07,512 --> 01:46:08,892
see FC Barcelona play.

2517
01:46:08,892 --> 01:46:10,262
I mean, this is a position of privilege.

2518
01:46:10,262 --> 01:46:11,061
Mm-hmm.

2519
01:46:11,061 --> 01:46:12,986
But football, for us.

2520
01:46:12,986 --> 01:46:13,542
..

2521
01:46:13,542 --> 01:46:15,592
When I stopped playing sports, uh, uh

2522
01:46:15,592 --> 01:46:19,792
as a college student, I didn't think about sports again for 25 years

2523
01:46:19,792 --> 01:46:21,099
and now we're just all in on footb-.

2524
01:46:21,099 --> 01:46:21,142
..

2525
01:46:21,142 --> 01:46:22,194
They, we plan our lives on.

2526
01:46:22,194 --> 01:46:22,262
..

2527
01:46:22,262 --> 01:46:25,092
Not, not around football, but every week we go to a game.

2528
01:46:25,092 --> 01:46:25,652
It's wonderful.

2529
01:46:25,652 --> 01:46:29,032
I'm convinced it's one of the few safe places that men can demonstrate emotion.

2530
01:46:29,032 --> 01:46:29,302
Yeah.

2531
01:46:29,302 --> 01:46:31,672
It's one of the few places men are allowed to hug each other

2532
01:46:31,672 --> 01:46:33,152
feel sad, feel joy.

2533
01:46:33,152 --> 01:46:33,892
100%.

2534
01:46:33,892 --> 01:46:34,593
But it's.

2535
01:46:34,593 --> 01:46:34,762
..

2536
01:46:34,762 --> 01:46:38,052
I've been to, because I'm in the corporate world

2537
01:46:38,052 --> 01:46:40,332
amazing sporting event, the best sporting events in the world

2538
01:46:40,332 --> 01:46:41,752
the Olympics, the Super Bowl.

2539
01:46:41,752 --> 01:46:43,732
Nothing matches Premier League football.

2540
01:46:43,732 --> 01:46:44,252
Mm-hmm.

2541
01:46:44,252 --> 01:46:44,892
Nothing.

2542
01:46:44,892 --> 01:46:47,281
It really is special.

2543
01:46:47,281 --> 01:46:48,792
That's what I learned to do.

2544
01:46:48,792 --> 01:46:49,072
Hey, man.

2545
01:46:49,072 --> 01:46:50,545
Hey, man, well, it's super interesting because I'm.

2546
01:46:50,545 --> 01:46:50,742
..

2547
01:46:50,742 --> 01:46:52,072
I read in your work about, like

2548
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,692
buying, people buying football clubs and stuff like that

2549
01:46:54,692 --> 01:46:56,272
and then they're never gonna make money, but the

2550
01:46:56,272 --> 01:46:58,602
the asset is basically valuable because someone else wants to buy it off you.

2551
01:46:58,602 --> 01:46:59,572
The greater fool theory.

2552
01:46:59,572 --> 01:47:01,042
And I'm getting loads of those offers now to

2553
01:47:01,042 --> 01:47:02,552
like, get involved in football clubs and stuff.

2554
01:47:02,552 --> 01:47:07,052
And, and actually, based on your thesis about men- Yeah.

2555
01:47:07,052 --> 01:47:07,061
.

2556
01:47:07,061 --> 01:47:07,061
..

2557
01:47:07,061 --> 01:47:07,664
it is act-.

2558
01:47:07,664 --> 01:47:07,781
..

2559
01:47:07,781 --> 01:47:10,272
For me, there's, there is a thesis there.

2560
01:47:10,272 --> 01:47:12,344
Well, the thesis is that there's.

2561
01:47:12,344 --> 01:47:12,482
..

2562
01:47:12,482 --> 01:47:16,292
The real thesis is that the number of billionaires in the US has gone from 500 to 2

2563
01:47:16,292 --> 01:47:17,212
500.

2564
01:47:17,212 --> 01:47:20,922
They're men who are in a massive mid-life crises.

2565
01:47:20,922 --> 01:47:25,582
The way to become the most interesting person in Cleveland is to buy the Cavaliers or the Browns.

2566
01:47:25,582 --> 01:47:28,012
Overnight, you're the sexiest man in Cleveland.

2567
01:47:28,012 --> 01:47:33,752
If you're worth $50 billion, why wouldn't you spend $5 billion to Yu- buy the Washington Commanders or

2568
01:47:33,752 --> 01:47:34,585
you know, to buy.

2569
01:47:34,585 --> 01:47:34,822
..

2570
01:47:34,822 --> 01:47:36,592
I think Tottenham's up for sale right now.

2571
01:47:36,592 --> 01:47:36,702
Yeah.

2572
01:47:36,702 --> 01:47:37,504
I've thought.

2573
01:47:37,504 --> 01:47:37,662
..

2574
01:47:37,662 --> 01:47:41,452
I got together the wealthiest, most famous Scottish people in the US

2575
01:47:41,452 --> 01:47:44,622
which is about 14 of us, and said

2576
01:47:44,622 --> 01:47:46,783
"Let's go buy Rangers.

2577
01:47:46,783 --> 01:47:49,912
" Rangers FC, it's a publicly traded company.

2578
01:47:49,912 --> 01:47:52,432
I had it all figured out, £10 mill- million convertible note.

2579
01:47:52,432 --> 01:47:53,136
I'm like, "We.

2580
01:47:53,136 --> 01:47:53,353
..

2581
01:47:53,353 --> 01:47:55,762
" And then this  guy, my friend of mine's a famous historian

2582
01:47:55,762 --> 01:47:56,138
a Scottish.

2583
01:47:56,138 --> 01:47:56,202
..

2584
01:47:56,202 --> 01:47:59,540
He's like, "You'd be the most hated person in the United Kingdom.

2585
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:00,792
" He goes, "They would hate you.

2586
01:48:00,792 --> 01:48:02,792
You knew nothing about football.

2587
01:48:02,792 --> 01:48:05,843
You'd be some American idiot over there.

2588
01:48:05,843 --> 01:48:07,132
" And I'm like, "Yeah, you're right.

2589
01:48:07,132 --> 01:48:08,900
" He's like, "Just go to Rangers games.

2590
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,022
"   Yeah, yeah.

2591
01:48:10,022 --> 01:48:10,878
He's like, "What are you thinking?

2592
01:48:10,878 --> 01:48:11,122
" Yeah.

2593
01:48:11,122 --> 01:48:15,592
There's a pain equation with buying sports teams because you're buying a tribe.

2594
01:48:15,592 --> 01:48:15,902
Yeah.

2595
01:48:15,902 --> 01:48:18,982
And the chances are you won't win most of the time.

2596
01:48:18,982 --> 01:48:20,462
And then you have to deal with, like

2597
01:48:20,462 --> 01:48:22,962
Dave from, I don't know, Southampton- Oh

2598
01:48:22,962 --> 01:48:22,962
yeah.

2599
01:48:22,962 --> 01:48:22,962
yeah.

2600
01:48:22,962 --> 01:48:22,962
yeah.

2601
01:48:22,962 --> 01:48:25,332
whose entire life is that football club that you've just bought

2602
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:26,572
and he is pissed.

2603
01:48:26,572 --> 01:48:28,172
And unless you win trophies from day one

2604
01:48:28,172 --> 01:48:28,762
you've screwed up.

2605
01:48:28,762 --> 01:48:29,532
And who does?

2606
01:48:29,532 --> 01:48:30,202
Yeah, nobody does.

2607
01:48:30,202 --> 01:48:31,492
So it's a horrible pain sport.

2608
01:48:31,492 --> 01:48:33,632
But anyways, Scott, we're done.

2609
01:48:33,632 --> 01:48:37,832
I am a big Manchester United fan.

2610
01:48:37,832 --> 01:48:38,992
My travel all over the world.

2611
01:48:38,992 --> 01:48:42,342
One of the big lifesavers for me, as someone that never misses a game ever

2612
01:48:42,342 --> 01:48:43,672
regardless of where I am in the world

2613
01:48:43,672 --> 01:48:51,412
is NordVPN, because NordVPN allows me to watch the game in territories and in countries where it's often not available for a variety of different reasons.

2614
01:48:51,412 --> 01:48:52,512
But it's not just about football.

2615
01:48:52,512 --> 01:48:54,892
It's websites, movies, that I can access

2616
01:48:54,892 --> 01:48:57,421
and it helps me navigate those geographical blockers.

2617
01:48:57,421 --> 01:49:00,012
And that's why NordVPN are both a sponsor of this podcast

2618
01:49:00,012 --> 01:49:01,482
but a lifesaver for me.

2619
01:49:01,482 --> 01:49:03,782
And it costs the same as a cup of coffee per month.

2620
01:49:03,782 --> 01:49:07,092
And not just that, when I'm accessing Wi-Fi networks around the world

2621
01:49:07,092 --> 01:49:11,352
it gives me a lot of security, which is something that I think we don't think about enough.

2622
01:49:11,352 --> 01:49:14,032
