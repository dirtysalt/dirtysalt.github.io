1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:01,359
Hey, I'm Dave.

2
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:02,299
Welcome to my shop.

3
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:08,360
I'm Dave Plummer, a retired software engineer for Microsoft going back to the MSDOS and Windows 95 days.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,759
And today, I have the rare privilege of being joined by Dave Cutler

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,919
the chief architect and designer of what we know today as Windows.

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:22,059
As someone who's gone on to design three successful operating systems in a row from RSX-11 to VMS and then Windows

7
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,359
Dave has few, if any, peers in the industry.

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,500
And if he did, he'd have to work on it with them anyway as he's still actively coding as a senior technical fellow at Microsoft at the age of 81.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,439
Dave was the recipient of the 2007 National Medal of Technology and Innovation at the White House

10
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,800
and in 2016 was honored as a fellow at the Computer History Museum.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,319
Now, with all of his achievements and honors

12
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:46,500
you might think I'd be tempted to put him on a pedestal like digital royalty.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,979
But I found him as approachable today as when he was just Dave C.

14
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,940
, my boss's boss's boss.

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,639
So please join me in welcoming Dave to the shop.

16
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,100
Let's get on with the interview.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,739
Let's see, might as well start with something interesting.

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,499
There's a legend that when Windows NT first shipped

19
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:04,059
that a gift was sent to Sun by the team.

20
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,559
Uh, I don't know many details about it and nobody's willing to tell me very much about it.

21
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,487
Is there anything you're willing.

22
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:09,599
..

23
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,419
Well, we decided that when we sh- we- we

24
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:13,903
you know, we.

25
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:14,079
..

26
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,079
Scott McNealy was kind of mealy-mouthed, um

27
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,939
and there were some other people around that were a little bit that way too.

28
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,539
Another one was Lee Reiswig at IBM.

29
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:30,059
So we decided somebody, and I don't know who it was

30
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:33,639
it might have been, um, Kelly Wilson

31
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,759
w- who was the admin for the group

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,499
found these black cardboard coffins, and they were about two feet long.

33
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:52,319
So we decided that we would send Scott McNealy and Lee Reiswig a coffin and we would put a special message in it

34
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,819
and some guy found, um, these, um

35
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,467
like birthday cards that have.

36
00:01:59,467 --> 00:01:59,599
..

37
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,799
they play a song.

38
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,159
Oh, yeah.

39
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,719
So he found a birthday card that played the death march

40
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:03,959
you know?

41
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:13,639
  And, um, so we sent one of these to Lee Reiswig and we sent one to Scott McNealy

42
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,199
and then Scott McNealy, at the time

43
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,019
um, Sun was running ads with their

44
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:23,884
um, with their.

45
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:23,999
..

46
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:26,859
They had a dog and the dog's name was Network

47
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:32,579
and Scott McNealy is reputed to have brought Network on the stage at one of his- I've heard of this

48
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:32,739
yeah.

49
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:32,752
.

50
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:32,779
..

51
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:35,319
talks with a fire hydrant and had the

52
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,599
the dog over and urinate on the fire hydrant and it said Microsoft on the fire hydrant.

53
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,845
So we put.

54
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:42,079
..

55
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,599
We got some fake dog doo and put in the box and we got.

56
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:46,699
..

57
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,479
I think we got a license, or

58
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,459
or a, a retail license or package for

59
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,799
I don't know whether it was SunOS or

60
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,139
or.

61
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:54,339
..

62
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:56,119
They had two, they had SunOS and

63
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:59,599
um, whatev- what the other one was.

64
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,819
And so we sent that.

65
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:01,145
We had.

66
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:01,239
..

67
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,759
Both of these we had hand-delivered so we know that they actually showed up.

68
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,239
Right.

69
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,994
Um, we had a third one, and I forget who we were gonna sell the third.

70
00:03:09,994 --> 00:03:10,059
..

71
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:10,564
It might have been.

72
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:10,679
..

73
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:13,859
The third one might have been going to Larry Ellison or somebody that was.

74
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:13,919
..

75
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,552
else that was.

76
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:14,679
..

77
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,419
But that one never went off.

78
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:20,055
And I have, I have, um.

79
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:20,279
..

80
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:23,019
Did you go to the 21st anniversary?

81
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:23,759
Yep, I did.

82
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,159
I showed the video.

83
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,219
I showed- That must be where I've seen it

84
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:27,651
'cause I have it.

85
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:27,659
..

86
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:27,667
..

87
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:27,675
..

88
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:27,683
..

89
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:27,691
..

90
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:27,699
..

91
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:27,707
..

92
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:27,715
..

93
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:27,723
..

94
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:27,731
..

95
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:27,739
..

96
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:27,747
..

97
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:27,755
..

98
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:27,979
. but I couldn't find anything.

99
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:28,779
Yeah, I showed the video.

100
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,335
We, we decided.

101
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:30,479
..

102
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,299
And there's a little side story here too.

103
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,459
I hope we, we don't get distracted here and this goes on too long

104
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:37,759
because I like to tell stories.

105
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,699
Um, we did a video.

106
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:45,479
We decided we're gonna video this and we're gonna show it at the WIM on Friday.

107
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,219
So we got somebody to come in and video it.

108
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,819
And I, I did, uh, a couple of mock presentations for Lee Reiswig and

109
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:04,291
and, um, and Scott McNealy and we were gonna show these at.

110
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:04,379
..

111
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,499
on Friday at the WIM.

112
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:10,379
Well, this is the same time that the DOJ was suing Microsoft over DOS.

113
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:10,859
Right.

114
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:20,059
And on Tuesday, I told, um, Alton that we ha- we were.

115
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:20,178
..

116
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,858
Oh, in fact, what ha- what happened was

117
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,639
Alton was coming by as we were videoing this stuff.

118
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,803
And he, uh.

119
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:26,819
..

120
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,199
somebody's out in the hall, I think it was Dave Thompson said

121
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
he's kind of giggling and Alton wants to know why he's giggling and

122
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,879
and Thompson said, "Come and, come and look at what we're doing.

123
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,359
" So Alton came in and oh, he's like

124
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,890
he's, "Oh, this is the greatest thing in the world.

125
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,939
" He wants to sign it.

126
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:42,727
And ev- we.

127
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:42,799
..

128
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,679
everybody signed this, signed a card.

129
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,219
He wants to sign it.

130
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:46,791
Well, on.

131
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:46,959
..

132
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,859
This is on Tuesday.

133
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:52,099
On Wednesday, Bill comes out with a company-wide memo that says

134
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,019
"We're gonna be nice people from now on.

135
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:54,913
We want.

136
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:54,959
..

137
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,953
We're not gonna disparage our competition or anything.

138
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:01,959
" So Alton comes in on Thursday and tells me

139
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,067
"We can't show this at the WIM and we can't send these.

140
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:08,959
" And I said, "Geez, that's too bad

141
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,035
Jim, we already sent them.

142
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:14,139
"  So they made it out.

143
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,199
But, so anyway, for the 21st anniversary

144
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,179
I dug up the videotape- Okay.

145
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:18,219
.

146
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:18,299
..

147
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:23,279
and we had it put on a DVD and showed it at the 21st anniversary.

148
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,999
That's what you saw was- Okay.

149
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:25,032
.

150
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:25,099
..

151
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,379
one of those presentations.

152
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,779
Cool.

153
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,439
I'll have to see if I can find a copy of that somewhere.

154
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,579
This was a black, it was a black box and we had.

155
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:31,679
..

156
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,939
I think we delivered it with red roses.

157
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:34,719
Okay.

158
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,199
It was, it was, it was great.

159
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,259
 So was it always operating systems for you?

160
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,739
No urge to make a living in job control language or anything like that?

161
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:46,159
Well, what happened was, um, you know

162
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:51,619
I came back after doing this model and this model was never really very satisfying because

163
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,819
you know, the people at Scott Paper

164
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,079
you know, sort of didn't really care.

165
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,059
And this was.

166
00:05:59,059 --> 00:05:59,199
..

167
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,279
Uh, this is a sort of a PR thing.

168
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,159
It's like DuPont's, you know, offering this service to help them and

169
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:07,679
you know, we talked to the plant manager and

170
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,159
you know, they'd sit in their chairs and

171
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:09,819
you know, "Mm.

172
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,269
" And we, we did a.

173
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:11,459
..

174
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:18,159
We asked them, uh, for a particular problem and they wanted to know what the run length should be to maximize

175
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,108
um-.

176
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:19,543
..

177
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:23,263
the, the, uh, yield because you have startup problems.

178
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:28,803
You have startup time and you have shutdown time where the ZARC weren't perfect

179
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:31,043
and the ZARC were never perfect anyway.

180
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,283
The ZARC had a big skin on them

181
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:36,444
which turned out to be a problem because they had to peel the skin off.

182
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:36,924
Right.

183
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:45,303
Um, so anyway, I decided that I was gonna go to work s- somewhere else and my boss at

184
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:49,424
um, in this math and stat group had left and went to Union Carbide.

185
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:55,223
So I queried Mark Union Carbide about whether or not they might have a job for

186
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:57,243
you know, I could get a job.

187
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,067
And I actually interviewed with them in.

188
00:06:59,067 --> 00:06:59,203
..

189
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:07,084
I interviewed with them in, uh, New York City and they sent me off to Kokomo

190
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:10,143
Indiana to, to interview for a job in Kokomo

191
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:13,643
which was a, it was a plant that made Hastelloy

192
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:17,363
which was a, a steel used in submarines

193
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:20,943
which is very highly, uh, corrosion resistant.

194
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:23,611
And Kokomo, Indiana is.

195
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:23,803
..

196
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:28,123
there may be one town that was worse

197
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:31,083
which was Gary, Indiana, but Kokomo was pretty bad.

198
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:36,543
Anyway, about the same time, I interviewed at the engineering department at DuPont.

199
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:40,283
Engineering department was not an operating department, it was

200
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:43,723
uh, a department that built all their chemical plants.

201
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:44,724
Did.

202
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:44,804
..

203
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:47,824
or DuPont actually designed and built their own plants

204
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:51,483
all their own chemical plants because they didn't think that anybody would.

205
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:51,543
..

206
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,163
they didn't want to give away any of their secrets- Right.

207
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:53,169
.

208
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:53,183
..

209
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:56,623
for one thing and they didn't think anybody else could do what they could do.

210
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:57,184
Right.

211
00:07:57,184 --> 00:08:01,643
So they had a group there that was called the Real-Time Systems Group

212
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:07,984
and they built, uh, some real-time systems for some of the operating plants.

213
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:12,449
So I thought that was a pretty good job and.

214
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:12,523
..

215
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:13,663
but their offer came back.

216
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:16,543
It was kind of weak, or I thought it was weak

217
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:25,343
and I accepted the job in Kokomo only to find out about a week later that the job with the engineering department was paying much more than I thought it was.

218
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,423
And so I sent all this stuff.

219
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:27,503
..

220
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:31,443
they sent me tickets and everything, and I sent it all back and said

221
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:32,438
"I'm not, uh, going to.

222
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:32,582
..

223
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:33,587
not taking your job.

224
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:36,482
" What a career decision that was.

225
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:41,543
I would ended up being a COBOL programmer and I probably still been there in Kokomo.

226
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,663
 Yeah, probably.

227
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:47,943
Um, so anyway, I went to the engineering department at this Real-Time Systems Group and

228
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:53,723
um, they had built some systems for

229
00:08:53,723 --> 00:08:56,883
uh, the textile fiber plants.

230
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,763
Uh, there's one in Tennessee.

231
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:00,483
Well, they were all over the South.

232
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:06,783
And I can't remember exactly what any of the systems did.

233
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:07,795
But anyway, they're on.

234
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:07,963
..

235
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:10,823
the computers were Bunker-Ramo 340s.

236
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:11,323
Mm.

237
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:15,723
The Bunker-Ramo 340 was a 28-bit machine.

238
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:19,923
Um, it was a very interes- uh

239
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:22,803
very interesting machine.

240
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:28,383
Uh, anyway, I got, um, into that group t-.

241
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:28,463
..

242
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:33,063
and the first thing I did there was they wanted to build

243
00:09:33,063 --> 00:09:39,603
um, automatic analysis of In- Instron tensile testing.

244
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:43,443
Instron is a machine that basically you pull things apart with.

245
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:44,043
Okay.

246
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:46,923
And they have a bunch of, uh

247
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:54,763
strain gauges that, that look at the what's going on with what you're pulling apart to see where the yield points are and everything

248
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,203
and they chart this all out.

249
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:59,563
And then somebody has to look at it and say

250
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:03,380
"Oh, yeah, this is the mo- the modulus was with the yield point

251
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,903
" and they had a bunch of other things

252
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:08,483
"What's the tensile strength and all that," so we're gonna automate all this.

253
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:14,849
So I, um, basically wrote the program that did that and.

254
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:15,163
..

255
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:18,483
or, well, I wrote the program that collected all the data.

256
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,363
And it was a real-time program and it ran

257
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:26,663
you know, I think we ran every millis- or every 100 milliseconds or something like that to get data.

258
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:32,823
100 milliseconds was fine for this stuff because you're pulling this apart at not anything that's a

259
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,203
uh, a really rapid speed.

260
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:34,323
Right.

261
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:35,583
It's sort of like this.

262
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:42,636
Um, and so I was in this group and I worked on that project and.

263
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:42,863
..

264
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:45,503
So again, I'm bored.

265
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:45,573
I.

266
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:45,643
..

267
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:46,523
there's nothing to do.

268
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:47,803
You know, I get to a point where.

269
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:47,923
..

270
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:48,436
well, it's the.

271
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:48,483
..

272
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:51,583
I'm not bored because of wha- the, the work stuff

273
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:57,843
uh, I'm bored because this is a engineering services department and they have to wait until somebody says

274
00:10:57,843 --> 00:10:59,003
"We want you to do something.

275
00:10:59,003 --> 00:10:59,483
" Right.

276
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:03,283
And then there's a whole bunch of stuff about proposing the project and what they're going to do.

277
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:08,063
Well, the same 1107 was right down the

278
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:11,923
the, uh, hall from me and they had.

279
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:12,103
..

280
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:16,443
they had a group of about three people that supported that.

281
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,423
Um, and so I went down and said

282
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,403
"Hey, um, do you guys need any help?

283
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:26,915
" And they said, "Yeah, we can get you to do something.

284
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:28,923
" So I started working on an Exec 2

285
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:33,523
which was the 1107 operating system at that time

286
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:35,703
which was a batch system.

287
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:36,323
Okay.

288
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:38,423
Um, but it was fast.

289
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:39,683
It was really fast.

290
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:41,820
We could run batch systems faster than.

291
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:41,963
..

292
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:43,003
I mean, really fast.

293
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:47,043
And it was a fast machine and then eventually it went to the 1108.

294
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:52,623
So that's where I really got into the operating system part and every night at

295
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:56,883
at five o'clock, we kick off the

296
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,003
the operators and we get the machine for two hours.

297
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:05,523
So in those two hours, we had to run all the experiments we cooked up for the day

298
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:07,643
all our test code and whatever.

299
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,243
Right.

300
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:11,783
And, um, of course everything was, you know

301
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:13,031
like, um.

302
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:13,143
..

303
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:16,163
debuggers, there's no debuggers.

304
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:17,854
You know, there's like.

305
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:18,003
..

306
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,323
there's switches on.

307
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:19,403
..

308
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:21,523
there's lots of switches on the 1107.

309
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:21,823
Right.

310
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:23,115
And, um, w-.

311
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:23,591
..

312
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:26,391
you know, there's a way we could halt instructions and things like that.

313
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:28,671
So it was kind of, uh, it was

314
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:31,651
it was very interesting, a lot of interesting concepts in that system

315
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:36,131
um, that were, that I sort of carried forward in

316
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,151
in, um, VMS.

317
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:42,132
Um, so I worked on that and then

318
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:46,651
um, the next thing I did was

319
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:56,251
um, the experimental station wanted to automate the analysis of all their Instron system stuff.

320
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:59,791
The other for- the other one was just for plants with the bunker remote.

321
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,251
Okay.

322
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:05,331
So we actually were gonna build a big computer system to do this and we ended up

323
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,452
this was, this was again back when

324
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:10,872
this is in a real-time systems group now because I was just loaned to the other group.

325
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:15,471
And so we end up with a dual PDP-10 system

326
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:24,291
sharing memory, and we had a PD8 prim- PDP8 front end for all the terminal input.

327
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:35,603
And then we ran, I think the wro- we ran analog lines in conduit for like 3

328
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,671
000 feet, a long distance.

329
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:40,171
A lot of noise, b- but a long distance.

330
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:47,011
And, um, in the dual PDP-10 we ran tops ten on one of them and then we ran another system that

331
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:50,051
that the group that I ran developed.

332
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,151
So they shared memory?

333
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:52,071
Shared memory, yeah.

334
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:52,511
But they run a different system?

335
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:52,871
Yeah.

336
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:56,351
Shared memory we had, I think we had 32K byte

337
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:03,911
K words, 32K words of shared memory and then I think each one of them had 16K of non-shared memory.

338
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:08,711
So we could dump data very fast between the two systems- Right.

339
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:08,717
.

340
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:08,731
..

341
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,751
directly and then we had, we had

342
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:15,831
uh, um, a dual interrupt system, or dual interrupt capability to interrupt back and forth.

343
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:21,711
So from there I went to Digital and s- of course I went to Digital to work on operating systems

344
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:23,411
so that's what I worked on at Digital.

345
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:26,791
How long were you at Digital before you started on RSX?

346
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:31,951
Well, uh, I immediately started on RSX 11C.

347
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:34,251
So that's my, one of my questions

348
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:35,931
didn't they not have people internal?

349
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:39,031
Why were they pulling external people in to start brand new operating systems?

350
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:42,131
Well, I was really hired to work on OS45.

351
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:42,591
Okay.

352
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:47,891
And at that time, OS45 is sort of in this embryonic state where it's

353
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:57,191
um, it's this, it's this pipe dream of Dave Stone who was a graduate of MIT and worked on M- and worked on Multics.

354
00:14:57,191 --> 00:15:00,271
So the, the big thing about the 45

355
00:15:00,271 --> 00:15:02,751
the PDP-10 was like a microsecond machine.

356
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:07,886
The 1145 was a 300 nanosecond machine and he had great.

357
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:07,991
..

358
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:13,491
And the, the PDP-10 was sold as a time-sharing system.

359
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:17,831
Um, you know, some of the time-sharing service bureaus had PDP-10s.

360
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:18,151
Right.

361
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,231
All the colleges had PDP-10s.

362
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:21,651
People loved the PDP-10.

363
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:25,711
So he had great visions that we're gonna build this system

364
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:31,951
or a look-a-like system on this new computer called PP11 because it was three times as fast.

365
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:42,651
Well, he had one thing that he didn't really think about a bit enough and it's the biggest single thing that obsoletes architectures is the number of address bits.

366
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,911
16 bits just wasn't enough.

367
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:46,351
Right.

368
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:50,331
So in the 11th, the OS45 was gonna be

369
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:55,111
um, at that time was, they were gonna have

370
00:15:55,111 --> 00:16:00,231
we were gonna have a subsystem as the real-time subsystem and the batch subsystem and the time-sharing subsystem.

371
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,951
You know, it sort of sounded like

372
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:05,791
um, some of the IBM 360 systems at the time.

373
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:11,191
You know, they, IBM had a dozen operating systems probably for the 360.

374
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:29,291
Um, so we're working on all the concepts and we're building the t- we're hiring people for the team and this project has been over in IPG which is Industrial Project Group for like a couple of years trying to get the PDP11 to just do terminal emulation.

375
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,431
This is, you know, that's all, just core only

376
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:38,651
terminal, and they're working on this thing called RSX 11C and their main architect is this guy from Foxborough.

377
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:41,331
Uh, do you know who Foxborough is?

378
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:44,011
Fox- Don't the Patriots play there?

379
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:44,831
Yeah.

380
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:51,051
Uh, actually Foxborough was in Foxborough and it was a process control company.

381
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:51,611
Okay.

382
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:55,031
So they produced custom process control systems.

383
00:16:55,031 --> 00:17:01,491
Um, and so they hired this guy from there who was absolutely terrible.

384
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:05,050
Uh, he may have been really okay with the

385
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,711
you know, the kind of process control hardware that they were sequencing

386
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:13,771
sequencers or whatever, but he was really trying to build something that was an operating system that ran

387
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:19,511
uh, multiple tasks and context switched and all that stuff and this had

388
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:20,590
this is only like.

389
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:20,751
..

390
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,830
How much code is this?

391
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,411
I'd be surprised if it was more than 10

392
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,371
000 lines of code.

393
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:29,351
So it was small.

394
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:29,631
Right.

395
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:35,271
It was not very big and they'd been working on this two or three years and IPG was desperate so they said

396
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:38,741
"Geez, you know, would you go work on this in your spare time?

397
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,284
" And I said, "Well, sure.

398
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:42,571
" So I ended up working on that

399
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:45,771
um, and we eventually did release that.

400
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:49,771
I wo- I think I worked on that about a year and it was terrible.

401
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:52,191
 It was horri- I mean, looking

402
00:17:52,191 --> 00:17:53,476
you know, I, at the time.

403
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:53,671
..

404
00:17:53,671 --> 00:18:05,111
If you took today's c- uh, customers and tried to superimpose them on the products of that time they'd all walk away.

405
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:05,591
Right.

406
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:06,931
They'd just walk away.

407
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:14,951
I mean, RSX 11C was probably capable of controlling your doorbell

408
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,031
right?

409
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:18,911
But not much more.

410
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:19,411
Right.

411
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:24,091
And I don't know, you know, I don't know how many they sold or what they did.

412
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:31,842
I, you know, I did another little offshoot of that that actually brought the disc into the picture but it never was anything that-.

413
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:32,039
..

414
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,440
you know, had a command capability or anything like that.

415
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:43,499
You know, you just basically, you had a set of sources that you customized to build whatever your application was.

416
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:43,979
Right.

417
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:52,819
Um, whether it was like, may- probably mainly reading switches somewhere and maybe reading switches and then output the switches

418
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:55,999
um, but not much more than that.

419
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,141
And what.

420
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:57,239
..

421
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:57,599
It was.

422
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:57,739
..

423
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:58,839
What kind of hardware was that on?

424
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,939
PDP- PDP-11.

425
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:00,279
Okay.

426
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,139
Eleven.

427
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:06,560
So when you started VMS, was it always self-hosted on VAX prototype hardware or did its

428
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,255
the code start on a PDP-11 platform or.

429
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:09,439
..

430
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:14,019
Well, it turned out actually that VAX

431
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,119
VAX had a PDP-11 mode.

432
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,839
Right.

433
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,140
And we developed something that was very similar to Wow64

434
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,420
um, where you could run PDP-11 programs on VAX.

435
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,119
So, you know, that side of the

436
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,219
the operating system, all the utilities and all that

437
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:36,139
we took from RSX 11M right out of the distribution and ran them.

438
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:40,959
But the development on the system, um

439
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:46,059
we had a, um, a group that produced a

440
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,739
an emulator, a hardware emulator.

441
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:57,159
And, um, it was w- it was microcoded.

442
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,239
It was a microcoded hardware emulator and, you know

443
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,005
I can't remember how.

444
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:02,099
..

445
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:03,879
It was not really that slow.

446
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:06,419
I mean, it wasn't fast but it wasn't slow either.

447
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,799
So the very embryonic work, um, you know

448
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,879
scheduling and memory management and that sort of stuff went on

449
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:15,479
on that.

450
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:18,259
And we only had one of those, on that one machine.

451
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,151
Uh, and, of course all of the s- we.

452
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:22,319
..

453
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,719
All of the tools and everything ran on RSX 11M

454
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,659
which was 16 bits.

455
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,119
We were building, we were building stuff

456
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,303
uh, on the 16.

457
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:32,519
..

458
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,339
Well, some of it was.

459
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:33,439
..

460
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:35,279
Most of it was on the 16-bit system.

461
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:41,559
So the assembler ran on the 16-bit system producing 32-bit relo- relocodable code.

462
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:41,859
Okay.

463
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:44,139
The linker, however, ran on PDP-10.

464
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:46,579
The linker was written in BLISS.

465
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,459
Hmm.

466
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:48,519
You know what BLISS is?

467
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,319
I've heard of it, but never, never up close.

468
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:56,659
BLISS was a language that was invented by CMU and its claim to fame was it was gotoless

469
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:01,459
and it never really caught on.

470
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:02,839
It was very error prone.

471
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:09,939
Um, everything was an L value and you had a specific operator to dereference it.

472
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:12,119
And everything had to be explicitly dereferenced.

473
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:12,959
Like if you.

474
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:12,999
..

475
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:13,131
On.

476
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:13,219
..

477
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:16,919
I- if you're looking at C, you look at a statement that says A=B+C

478
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:27,079
well you have an implicit dereference of B and C and you have a implicit reference of A on the left-hand side which is a store through whatever the value of A is

479
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,099
which is its address.

480
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:31,939
On, in BLISS you had to have a dot in front of all those.

481
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:39,439
So it was a very, um, very strict dichotomy between what is the L value and what is the R value.

482
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:39,879
Right.

483
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:41,499
Very error prone.

484
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:42,399
It was a dot.

485
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:47,379
And of course without a goto, um

486
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:50,379
all your logic got kind of inverted.

487
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:54,599
Everything is a, a while so that you can leave.

488
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,479
 You know, you can- Right.

489
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:56,532
.

490
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:56,639
..

491
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:59,359
you can exit the while, it's somewhere in the middle.

492
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,911
So anyway, we.

493
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:00,999
..

494
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:01,269
There.

495
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:01,359
..

496
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:12,859
They had developed this language and there was a compiler on the PDP-10 and we did a cross compiler on the PDP-10 for VAX so that we could do the linker.

497
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:16,159
The debugger was always also written in BLISS

498
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,519
um, on the PDP-10.

499
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,599
But all the rest of the development occurred on the 11

500
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,459
i- on R- RSX 11M on 1170, by the way.

501
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:25,812
And we ran.

502
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:26,059
..

503
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:33,639
We could run, um, I would say a dozen and a half users on RSX 1111 on 1170.

504
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:38,959
Um, it's amazing what we could do in S- in 64 KB of memory.

505
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:39,119
Right.

506
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,279
I mean, amazing.

507
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,979
We had compilers, linkers, I mean, all that stuff.

508
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,199
And today, you know, you, you

509
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:51,059
you link something that says hello world, it's a megabyte

510
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:51,699
you know.

511
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:54,919
It's a, it's a, uh, it's probably not a megabyte but it's close to a megabyte.

512
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,099
It's si- huge.

513
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:05,559
Um, so anyway, that's how th- that all got bootstrapped and then eventually we got one of the early prototypes.

514
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,939
I think it was Proto Six.

515
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:10,959
And we decided, and this is the same thing we did in

516
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:15,799
in NT and Windows was that we're gonna eat our own dog food.

517
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,979
And as soon as we got to the point where we could run

518
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:23,399
we could actually run reliably enough on Proto Six.

519
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:23,599
..

520
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,039
Actually it was Proto Three, it's Proto Three.

521
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:32,719
We could run on Proto Three, then we ju- we had w- our offices and

522
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:36,619
and the machine is like, it's like our offices are here and the machine is sitting over there.

523
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:41,499
And if the machine bug checks, you know

524
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:42,939
about three or four of us get up

525
00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:48,499
walk over to the machine, sit there in the debugger for a little while and figure out what it is

526
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:51,619
reboot the system, go back to our office

527
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:55,479
fix the bug, update the system, reboot and then go on.

528
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:55,879
Right.

529
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,019
And that's what we did.

530
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:04,459
That's the way- Does having everybody self-hosted on the same system kinda instill a quality thing because you're bringing down everybody if you bring down anybody pretty much?

531
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,839
Well, there was only one, there was only one piece of hardware.

532
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:06,959
Right.

533
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,339
Period.

534
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:10,414
So there was no way that you're gonna ho- you can't.

535
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:10,539
..

536
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:11,311
They can do.

537
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:11,519
..

538
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:18,139
They could still run assemblies and things like that on RSX 11M.

539
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:20,959
They could still develop the linker on the PDP-10

540
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,759
all right?

541
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,679
We just couldn't develop the op- the things that ran in the operating system

542
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,779
all right?

543
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:27,585
But we brought all.

544
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:27,679
..

545
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,755
I mean, since we.

546
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:28,859
..

547
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:31,919
The, the, this layer which was equivalent to

548
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,753
uh-.

549
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:33,171
..

550
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,051
WOW64 was called the AME.

551
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:39,251
It was the Application Migration Executive, much thinner layer than

552
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:41,051
than, um, WOW64.

553
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:42,031
It was much thinner.

554
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:44,671
I mean, it basically looked like a PDP-11.

555
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:45,331
Right.

556
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:56,211
And, um, you know, it loaded up the programs and started them and they ran and the file system was compatible.

557
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:56,862
It was files.

558
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:57,012
..

559
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:59,911
We took the R611M file system to VMS

560
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:04,611
which is called Files-11, and we just re-implemented it.

561
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:07,431
I don't think we really did, um

562
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:10,692
we didn't do anything that was, you know

563
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:11,831
an enhancement really.

564
00:25:11,831 --> 00:25:16,431
It was just a re-implementation of the same thing.

565
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,411
Um, so the file system worked.

566
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:21,432
We didn't have to do anything special for that

567
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,491
you know, the filenames were the same.

568
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:26,431
Uh, in those days there was one character set

569
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:28,991
it was ASCII period, there's no  other character sets.

570
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:32,211
Um, there was no graphics, so we didn't have to worry about graphics.

571
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:35,971
Um, you know, basically worry about disc drivers

572
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:38,911
um, tape drivers, um, terminal drivers.

573
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:41,831
Um, we had network stuff, we were

574
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:45,851
we were, uh, implementing DDCMP which was

575
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:50,651
um, digital's micro- or digital's protocol.

576
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:51,011
Okay.

577
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:51,652
It preceded.

578
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:51,791
..

579
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:59,771
Well, I- it didn't actually precede TCPIP 'cause TCPIP was an outgrowth of DARPA and

580
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:02,911
uh, that actually occurred before DDCMP.

581
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:06,871
Uh, but we were also developing SNA and

582
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:14,771
um, BISync which was IBM's remote terminal protocol for 2780s terminals.

583
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:15,231
Okay.

584
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:17,671
I've heard that VMS shipped with zero bugs.

585
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:18,128
Does that.

586
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:18,231
..

587
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:19,151
How much of that is- On the day

588
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:23,471
on the day we shipped VMS there were zero known bugs.

589
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:27,931
That didn't mean there were no n- there were no bugs 'cause there were bugs

590
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:30,591
but, but there's a big difference between shipping

591
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:35,251
uh, a system with 20,000 known bugs that

592
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:38,471
that some produc- prog- program manager said, "Well

593
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,563
you know, we've looked at this and it doesn't meet the bar.

594
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:44,031
" That used to just drive me just batty.

595
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:44,531
Right.

596
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:48,491
Uh, I wanted every bug fixed.

597
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:49,771
Every bug.

598
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:54,531
And it, you know, it'd get so depressing as we're going through the

599
00:26:54,531 --> 00:27:00,211
the, um, Windows relea- the NT releases where we have this war room every morning

600
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:03,051
you know, and you fix, you fix

601
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:04,531
uh, 200 bugs in a day.

602
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:10,631
Next day there's 200 new bugs, every single day for months

603
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:12,071
right?

604
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:14,111
But, but anyway, I mean, it

605
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:14,266
there.

606
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:14,271
..

607
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:19,731
We made a real effort to fix every bug that we knew about before we said

608
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:20,744
"Okay, we'll ship this.

609
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:22,971
" And there wa- I know there was a last minute bug

610
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:31,671
we had a race condition in a, a channel hol- or hand-off that occurred in one of the disc drivers

611
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:34,831
um, that we fixed, like, in the 11th hour.

612
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:37,571
But there were zero known bugs at the time we shipped.

613
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:39,515
I mean- But you were schedule-driven as opposed to.

614
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:39,571
..

615
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,371
You didn't have to make Christmas for DEC obviously

616
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:42,091
or that kind of thing?

617
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:44,359
No, but th- the thing that we were.

618
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:44,531
..

619
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:47,931
The thing that, that happened there, um

620
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:51,791
I guess y- you could really say we were schedule-driven because

621
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:55,471
you know, the success of the company was selling hardware.

622
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,331
It wasn't selling VMS.

623
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:57,731
Right.

624
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:02,331
And we couldn't sell the hardware without the operating system to run on it.

625
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:08,451
So, as soon as manufacturing is ready to start pumping these systems out

626
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:12,851
now you got inventory, you got customers who bought machines

627
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:16,631
you want to have the, the software to run on them.

628
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:16,891
Right.

629
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:23,411
And, and in fact we shipped, we shipped some systems to customers that were

630
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,401
um, early.

631
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:24,551
..

632
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:26,871
Sort of like the early adopter program.

633
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:35,297
We had, we had two customers that we actually gave early VAX hardware to and.

634
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:35,531
..

635
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:37,891
To help us develop things.

636
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:38,851
One was Schlumberger.

637
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:51,491
Schlumberger was putting VAXes in, in semi-sec- semi-tractor trailer trucks and carting them around the US taking data on oil well.

638
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:52,551
Oh, really?

639
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:52,951
All right?

640
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:53,291
They were.

641
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:53,371
..

642
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:57,851
You know, they'd send a, uh, instrument bundle down the

643
00:28:57,851 --> 00:29:02,211
the, the, um, casing and I don't know

644
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:05,631
they set off explosions or what they did and then get all that data.

645
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:08,611
They collect it all on VAX and then process it.

646
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:11,871
So Schlumberger was one and the other one was

647
00:29:11,871 --> 00:29:14,095
um, the, um.

648
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:14,191
..

649
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,711
Related to the Naval.

650
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:20,991
It wasn't the Naval Academy but it was some other Naval organization and we had

651
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:27,731
we had two software support specialists at each one of those customers and they would sort of be the people that

652
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:29,451
that would take the, the updates.

653
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:35,251
You know, we update the system not as often as we update the systems at Microsoft when we're doing development

654
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,591
which is basically every day.

655
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:38,496
But, you know, we'd, we'd get to a point.

656
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:38,551
..

657
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:41,244
We, we operated what we called base levels which was.

658
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:41,371
..

659
00:29:41,371 --> 00:29:43,491
We, when we planned the, at the beginning

660
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:51,271
we set out what the base levels were and this is the base level of functionality that we try to reach by a certain point and we wouldn't

661
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:54,211
we wouldn't go on to other stuff until we reached that point.

662
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:56,091
So it was various base levels.

663
00:29:56,091 --> 00:29:58,831
So as these came out, um, you know

664
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:04,195
people would get upgraded and they only got the functionality what was in the base level so.

665
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:04,451
..

666
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:09,891
And customers generally were at the other end of that where they get much more capability.

667
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,097
But, um, you know, there's things.

668
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:12,231
..

669
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:15,431
Uh, I don't know.

670
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:18,991
We probably ran for a year where the system was actually usable.

671
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:20,166
You know, we could.

672
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:20,271
..

673
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:22,071
We did the development on that system.

674
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:22,471
Right.

675
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:26,211
And it was reliable enough that it didn't crash that often.

676
00:30:26,211 --> 00:30:30,511
Um, uh, as far as stress on it

677
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:34,911
we didn't really probably stress it that badly because

678
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:36,530
you know, there's.

679
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:36,740
..

680
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:36,950
..

681
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,055
. I don't know, 24 to 30 people sitting around

682
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,955
you know, plinking on keys.

683
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:41,975
Right.

684
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,995
Now we had, we had better terminals then.

685
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:50,896
We had, we had, uh, CRT terminals with keyboards that didn't require a pound of force to for

686
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:52,415
to  to push down the keys.

687
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,396
You ever push down a key on a JSR-33?

688
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,136
Yeah.

689
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:55,976
.

690
00:30:55,976 --> 00:30:56,835
The round posts.

691
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:59,756
There weren't, there weren't any speed typers in those days.

692
00:30:59,756 --> 00:31:00,555
 No.

693
00:31:00,555 --> 00:31:07,736
Um, after VMS you worked for a bit on an embedded system or a real time control system of some kind?

694
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:08,079
Uh.

695
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:08,215
..

696
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:11,775
After, actually, after VMS I worked on the PL/I compiler.

697
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:14,436
Yeah, how did you get into compilers and why

698
00:31:14,436 --> 00:31:16,775
and how do you pick up compilers as a.

699
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:16,955
..

700
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:31,275
Well, you know, there's always this interest in this magic that compilers did and I always wanted to do a compiler or find out about a compiler and at the end of the VMS project

701
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:35,155
release one, I decided that there was a project that

702
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:46,216
that, um, one of the commercial divisions of Digital wanted to have a PL/I compiler and so they were looking for somebody to develop the compiler and

703
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:49,675
and all the language groups didn't want anything to do with this at all.

704
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:53,775
They were, they were Fortran and COBOL

705
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:57,915
um, not anything else.

706
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:01,775
The basic stuff was all over on the PDP-11.

707
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:05,595
So, we bought a front end from a co- a company

708
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:12,755
um, from Boston and the guy, I can't remember what the name of the company was

709
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:22,555
but the guy's name was Bob Fiberhouse, and it was a PL/I subset front end and so we bought that and then we had to develop the back end

710
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:26,216
um, and I developed a code generator for the

711
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:30,455
for the back end and we- What did the front end compile to- An intermediate- .

712
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:30,455
..

713
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:30,835
or pre-process to, I guess?

714
00:32:30,835 --> 00:32:30,841
.

715
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:30,855
..

716
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:32,035
an intermediate language.

717
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:32,435
Okay.

718
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:35,515
Um, in fact all the compilers do that these days.

719
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:39,895
Uh, you know, there's several phases to the compiler and each one does

720
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:41,795
you know, its job and moves on.

721
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:47,395
Um, but we ended up, we ended up doing

722
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:53,495
the back end we did on VAX and the front end work that we did

723
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:56,055
we did at MIT on Multics.

724
00:32:56,055 --> 00:33:06,855
And we tried to work from Tewksbury, Massachusetts remotely with Multics and it was a nonstarter.

725
00:33:06,855 --> 00:33:09,435
You could not run half duplex.

726
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:10,248
It could not.

727
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:10,435
..

728
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,155
It was so slow.

729
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:28,235
So we ended up, we, we had this tape shuttle and we'd do the stuff that we needed to do to the front end on the system at MIT and then put it all up on tape

730
00:33:28,235 --> 00:33:32,875
bring the tape up to Tewksbury, which was maybe ten miles away

731
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:36,255
read the tape, and then we'd have

732
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:40,675
we'd have input to fa- uh, to feed into our

733
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:50,255
our back end which knew what the format of all this stuff and the outcome of that would be object code which then we could run through the linker to produce programs.

734
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:52,275
So that's how we developed PL/I.

735
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:54,841
Um, so we also got.

736
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:54,915
..

737
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:57,275
We did a C compiler also with the same back end.

738
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,575
It was a very different back end.

739
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:02,795
It wasn't, um, it was not.

740
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:02,975
..

741
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:05,935
I, I, uh, you know, elegant .

742
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:07,315
It really wasn't elegant.

743
00:34:07,315 --> 00:34:09,395
Uh, a lot of it was, um

744
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,775
done in a, uh, a language called

745
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:16,034
we called TBL and TBL just stood for table

746
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:20,835
and it was basically a byte interpreter because the

747
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:23,614
the compiler is so full of, um

748
00:34:23,614 --> 00:34:25,395
function calls.

749
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:37,195
I mean like, thou- I mean the density is so high that you're run- you run this interpreter and the interpreter has a byte code with implied operands.

750
00:34:37,195 --> 00:34:40,751
So, you know, if you're gonna generate.

751
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:40,835
..

752
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:42,835
If you, you know what the input for the

753
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:53,875
the front end is you have, you have these records that are operands and all kinds of different records and you can think of each one of these byte codes as being a processor for that kind of particular type of operand

754
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:58,515
or maybe that record, or maybe it's some sub-part of that

755
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:01,555
some variable reference, or building a symbol table thing or something.

756
00:35:01,555 --> 00:35:09,635
So, a lot of it was written in that and then of course we also did an optimizer which I was very interested in optimized code because

757
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:16,315
uh, the early PDP-11 compilers were, were threaded code.

758
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:21,375
Uh, and threaded code was like, um

759
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:29,015
like byte codes only it was 16 bits rather than 8 bit byte codes and that's basically what it was.

760
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:29,455
Okay.

761
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:32,575
And that's what they compiled to and then we had these interpreters that ran.

762
00:35:32,575 --> 00:35:36,975
So, the, the original Fortran compiler, um

763
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:38,386
was byte, byte.

764
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:38,455
..

765
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:39,655
Was, uh, threaded code.

766
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:43,755
So anyway, I got interested in the optimization and what

767
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:49,895
what really was drove me about the optimization was how good a code that the 1108 could put out.

768
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:53,675
The Fortran compiler for the 1108 was written by CSC

769
00:35:53,675 --> 00:36:00,215
Computer Sciences Corporation, and it was fast and it was just unbelievably good code.

770
00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:06,815
Of course, it re- might not look so good now but in those days it looked really good and it ran really well.

771
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:08,835
So I was very interested in optimization.

772
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:13,815
Spent a lot of time on optimization and a lot of time on register allocation.

773
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:17,763
Um, and then, and then I left.

774
00:36:17,763 --> 00:36:17,895
..

775
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:18,711
I decided.

776
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:18,875
..

777
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:33,435
Actually one of the guys that I worked with said there was a guy in California that worked for Lawrence Livermore that had worked on the Shiva Nova project.

778
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:38,191
Shiva Nova is laser fusion.

779
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:43,799
And this is, um, we're talking circa 1980.

780
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:44,759
A while ago, yeah.

781
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:46,060
They're still working on that.

782
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,699
 Yeah.

783
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:47,780
20 years away, still.

784
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,779
Yeah.

785
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:49,387
It's like.

786
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:49,519
..

787
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:54,419
And so he, he had been one of the people that was instrumental in

788
00:36:54,419 --> 00:37:05,239
in convincing the people at Livermore that they had to have a special language developed to write the software to control the lasers for the Shiva Nova project.

789
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,359
It was called Praxis.

790
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,519
So, like a lot of these things in the government

791
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,579
you know, he got, they got through this thing and got the compiler and this is

792
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:18,099
it, this is pub- or it's pub- or it's

793
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:19,800
uh, funded by the, the, um

794
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,419
government, so it's public.

795
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:27,519
So he decides he's gonna start a, a compiler company.

796
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:35,159
So I got talked into joining this company with him and four

797
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,879
there was four of us from Digital and two from his company

798
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:42,499
and, um, so I was gonna leave.

799
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:43,559
I was already leaving.

800
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:48,379
And Gordon Bell is up in arms, he doesn't want me to leave

801
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:50,659
so he's, you know, he says, "Well

802
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:53,559
you know, what can we get, do to get you to stay?

803
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:56,419
" But I said, "I don't know," but I said

804
00:37:56,419 --> 00:37:57,579
"I gotta get away from here.

805
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,092
There's too much bureaucracy here.

806
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:00,739
" This is in Massachusetts.

807
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:06,139
And it had, the Digital had grown from a company that was

808
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:07,899
like, just a, it was just a

809
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:10,239
um, such a great place to work.

810
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:17,639
It was engineers building projects for, building products for people that were engineers and really liked them.

811
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,159
Right.

812
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:21,979
And into, uh, an atmosphere of, of

813
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:28,334
you know, all these business people coming in and all these business plans and no longer.

814
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:28,459
..

815
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:31,239
Ken Olsen's thing was, do what's right for the customer

816
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:34,719
and it was never, it was, kind of became

817
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,899
you know, do what's right for, to make the most money or whatever.

818
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:43,079
And we were very ill-prepared for all of the organization and the people we hired and everything

819
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,359
so it got very hard to work.

820
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:48,024
So I said, "Well, I have to be somewhere remote.

821
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:49,159
" He said, "Oh, we'll put you anywhere.

822
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,169
We'll put you anywhere you wanna go.

823
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:51,912
" And I said, "Well, no, I'm gonna do this.

824
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:55,199
" Well, this fell apart.

825
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:05,459
Um, we all put in $2,500 and this guy that was gonna be the president had a wife that would

826
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:12,399
would, had a calligraphy company and he contracted her to do our business cards.

827
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:14,879
He, he blew our whole $7,500.

828
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:16,299
 Just blew it all away.

829
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:19,059
And I was so, I was so mad about that.

830
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,639
I said, "I'm, I just, that's it.

831
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,492
I'm not doing this.

832
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:21,839
" Right.

833
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,879
Probably a bad sign.

834
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:26,219
So, so Gordon comes back and says

835
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:29,369
um, you know, "What do you wanna do?

836
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,105
" And I said, "Well, I wanna move somewhere else.

837
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:32,974
" He says, "Well, you can go anywhere you wanna go.

838
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:39,570
" He said, "The only thing that's, that I have as a restriction is I want you to go somewhere that's close to a university.

839
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:46,019
" So I said, "Well, I have some preconceived notions about where I don't wanna go.

840
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,539
So I don't wanna go to the Southeast.

841
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:51,459
I don't wanna go anywhere in, like

842
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:53,199
in Washington DC or any of that area.

843
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,159
I don't really wanna go to Mid-America, I grew up there.

844
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,739
Um, probably not Phoenix, maybe the Southwest not

845
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:03,076
maybe the West Coast.

846
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:07,459
" So off we go to the West Coast to look at potential places and we go.

847
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:07,699
..

848
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:13,179
'Course we have, we have, uh, a whole group of people now from Digital have to jump into this.

849
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:17,059
It, I can't just go with my group of people and we pick out a site.

850
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:17,459
Right.

851
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,579
We have to have the real estate people come with us

852
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:19,839
right?

853
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,319
'Cause they gotta get the best deal.

854
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,299
And so we go to Sacramento.

855
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:26,999
That's a nonstarter.

856
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:31,379
Um, we didn't go to Santa Rosa.

857
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:32,979
They wanted us to go to Santa Rosa

858
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:35,339
but Santa Rosa would've been a nonstarter too.

859
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:41,459
You know, that's sort of north of San Francisco and at that time I don't think there

860
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:42,499
I don't know how much is there now.

861
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:43,979
I think there is some stuff there, but.

862
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:44,119
..

863
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,379
We did go to Portland.

864
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:47,659
I really liked Portland.

865
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:52,699
And we went to Seattle and I remember we were

866
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:53,999
we were flying into Seattle.

867
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:55,439
Have you ever flown into Ireland?

868
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:56,099
Nope.

869
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:00,259
Ireland, you can't believe how many shades of green there are.

870
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:05,299
I mean, it's, Ireland you just fly in there and it's just all these different shades of green.

871
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:06,079
It's just beautiful.

872
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,119
So we're flying into Seattle and it's just

873
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,879
I mean, it just, and it's raining

874
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:12,759
but it looks really nice and so I

875
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:14,559
geez, this is a great place.

876
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:20,039
So we decide we're gonna start an engineering organization and University of Washington is next door.

877
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:26,599
So we're gonna start an engineering organization there and what we

878
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,879
what we're gonna have as a charter is to develop

879
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:32,839
um, chip-based system software.

880
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,779
And this was at a time where, where

881
00:41:37,779 --> 00:41:43,279
um, VLSI was just getting started, uh

882
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:51,459
at a large scale and, and Digital had great visions that they're gonna build one-chip faxes and

883
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:55,499
um, we really needed, we needed a set of s- uh

884
00:41:55,499 --> 00:42:01,759
software to run on these really cheap one-chip faxes that we're gonna populate everywhere.

885
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:04,619
So we went to see, went to

886
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,779
ended up in Bellevue, uh, with about

887
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:14,639
um, 12 people and we're gonna produce a

888
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:17,579
basically a real-time system for that.

889
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:24,319
And it was called Vaxilon and it was

890
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,259
it was, it was not a very good system

891
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:35,239
but it was, it was a f- one of the first systems where we tried out a lot of things that we hadn't tried before

892
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,479
um, because everybody thought they were great things to do

893
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:42,704
like, um, drivers and user mode.

894
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:43,018
..

895
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,195
. um, everything being message-oriented, everything's messages.

896
00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:48,495
And we would, when you send messages

897
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:52,135
you un-map it in the sender and when the receiver receives it

898
00:42:52,135 --> 00:42:54,055
they map, we map it in their receiver.

899
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:59,655
And it was the first system that we did was multi-threaded.

900
00:42:59,655 --> 00:43:02,216
So it was multi-threaded and the other thing

901
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:04,516
it was, it was multiprocessor.

902
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:05,415
Okay.

903
00:43:05,415 --> 00:43:09,675
So this is the first multiprocessor, multi-threaded system.

904
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:14,575
And, um, I had some bad experience

905
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:19,255
uh, with customers with some of the features of RS611M and

906
00:43:19,255 --> 00:43:20,155
and VMS.

907
00:43:20,155 --> 00:43:21,815
We had, we had.

908
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:21,976
..

909
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,075
In, in Windows we had things called

910
00:43:24,075 --> 00:43:26,536
w- they, the names changed, they're called APCs

911
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:32,675
um, which were asynchronous, uh, A- AS- APCs

912
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:35,735
A- Asynchronous, um, Procedure Call.

913
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:36,575
APCs.

914
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,295
Asynchronous p- procedure calls.

915
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:42,875
In RS611M and DMS they were called ASTs

916
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,835
they were Asynchronous System Calls.

917
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:47,115
So they were like interrupts.

918
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:51,235
Well, interrupts in user mode does not work.

919
00:43:51,235 --> 00:43:55,175
People just don't- Right.

920
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:55,215
.

921
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:55,295
..

922
00:43:55,295 --> 00:43:56,515
don't get that.

923
00:43:56,515 --> 00:44:02,895
So, um, we decided that we, we would

924
00:44:02,895 --> 00:44:05,755
should control things much better in the system.

925
00:44:05,755 --> 00:44:10,815
So we had a lot of user mode level scheduler controls.

926
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,635
You could disable context switching and all sorts of stuff.

927
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:20,175
And, and stuff like, we'll make it so that we can guarantee that you won't run two threads in your program at once.

928
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:24,255
Which, and, you know, right after we did it

929
00:44:24,255 --> 00:44:26,718
the first thing that people say is, "Why didn't you allow this?

930
00:44:26,718 --> 00:44:27,055
" Right?

931
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:27,489
It's like.

932
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:27,575
..

933
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:33,835
Anyway, um, we did ship that system and we had a few customers.

934
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:35,495
One of the customers we had was, uh

935
00:44:35,495 --> 00:44:37,015
a company called Cadex.

936
00:44:37,015 --> 00:44:38,215
You remember Cadex?

937
00:44:38,215 --> 00:44:38,555
No.

938
00:44:38,555 --> 00:44:46,155
Cadex was an offshoot of, um, the company that made Pagemaker.

939
00:44:46,155 --> 00:44:47,695
Aldus?

940
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:49,175
Aldus?

941
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:49,275
Aldus.

942
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:50,695
It was, it was an offshoot of Aldus.

943
00:44:50,695 --> 00:44:54,515
And they were building some kind of a document control system

944
00:44:54,515 --> 00:44:59,695
and they were a customer and so we worked with them.

945
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:04,515
Um, anyway, that's how, that's the system and it.

946
00:45:04,515 --> 00:45:04,755
..

947
00:45:04,755 --> 00:45:05,737
That.

948
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:05,835
..

949
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:16,835
Well, partway through that system, um, we look around the company and there aren't any single chip VAXes.

950
00:45:16,835 --> 00:45:18,555
None.

951
00:45:18,555 --> 00:45:28,175
So we say, "Well, geez, we need a small VAX.

952
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:29,635
A small, cheap VAX.

953
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:36,275
" So we started, the company started a project called MicroVAX

954
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:40,475
and we decided we'd build one.

955
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:43,875
So we built the first MicroVAX at DEC West.

956
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,315
DEC West was the name of the place.

957
00:45:45,315 --> 00:45:51,755
And my contribution to that was I wrote all the microcode for the whole thing.

958
00:45:51,755 --> 00:45:52,135
Really?

959
00:45:52,135 --> 00:45:56,175
Um, which was a, a real experience.

960
00:45:56,175 --> 00:45:57,455
And I don't have a copy of it.

961
00:45:57,455 --> 00:45:59,546
I'm just, just.

962
00:45:59,546 --> 00:45:59,615
..

963
00:45:59,615 --> 00:46:02,355
And I'm really upset that I don't have a copy of the microcode

964
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:06,255
but, um, I think it would've been interesting to go back and look at it.

965
00:46:06,255 --> 00:46:06,655
Yeah.

966
00:46:06,655 --> 00:46:13,035
It was, um, it was 4K by 30 bits.

967
00:46:13,035 --> 00:46:15,435
The microword was 30 bits wide.

968
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:18,367
Um, we had, when they were, um.

969
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,495
..

970
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:20,035
I'm sorry, it was 40 bits wide.

971
00:46:20,035 --> 00:46:23,795
Uh, it was 4K by 40 and it was

972
00:46:23,795 --> 00:46:29,855
um, eight, I'm sorry, five eight-bit PROMs were the

973
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:30,121
with the.

974
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:30,155
..

975
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:31,275
That was the microstore.

976
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:31,875
Okay.

977
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,095
Um, so we, we built MicroVAX 1.

978
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:38,835
0 and shipped that, um, and then shortly thereafter

979
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:39,975
we did come out with this, uh

980
00:46:39,975 --> 00:46:41,795
one-ship VAX which was called MicroVAX 2.

981
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:41,955
0.

982
00:46:41,955 --> 00:46:46,895
And so, anyway, that was the end of that story.

983
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:49,255
Sort of a naive question on that.

984
00:46:49,255 --> 00:46:51,855
When you've got these old machines with these huge machine words

985
00:46:51,855 --> 00:46:54,815
you know, if you think of the Huffman encoding of instructions

986
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:58,095
there's gonna be instructions that are tiny that don't need anywhere near 40 bits.

987
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:00,855
No, but, but the 40 bits is the micromachine.

988
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:02,575
It's not the instruction set.

989
00:47:02,575 --> 00:47:03,015
Oh, okay.

990
00:47:03,015 --> 00:47:05,375
The instruction set is VAX.

991
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:10,895
So what users deal with is, and what programmers deal with is

992
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:12,135
they think it's a VAX.

993
00:47:12,135 --> 00:47:12,935
It is a VAX.

994
00:47:12,935 --> 00:47:15,535
In fact, all the VAXes were microcoded.

995
00:47:15,535 --> 00:47:17,191
None of 'em were, um.

996
00:47:17,191 --> 00:47:17,335
..

997
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:25,815
In fact, none of the machines today are really hardcoded or hardwired except su- the ARM processors are hardwired and

998
00:47:25,815 --> 00:47:27,032
um, the system.

999
00:47:27,032 --> 00:47:27,135
..

1000
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,795
The RISC-V ones are too.

1001
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:29,235
Okay.

1002
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:31,315
And there, there's probably other, you know

1003
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,475
ones that we don't even know about.

1004
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,735
The Army has something somewhere, what, whatever.

1005
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:37,835
But all the machines were microcoded and the microcode

1006
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:43,195
like, the microcode on the 780 is like 99 bits wide or 100 bits wide.

1007
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:43,995
It's very wide.

1008
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:50,275
And so having a wide microinstruction, um

1009
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:57,955
k- uh, is so that you don't have to do any decoding of vertically encoded fields in the microword.

1010
00:47:57,955 --> 00:48:01,135
You can just take the bits right out and jam it into the hardware.

1011
00:48:01,135 --> 00:48:03,775
You don't have to run it through any kind of a

1012
00:48:03,775 --> 00:48:06,295
a ROM or anything that, that, you know

1013
00:48:06,295 --> 00:48:08,475
actually takes it from its value.

1014
00:48:08,475 --> 00:48:12,215
Say it's, it's zero to seven, that would be seven different

1015
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:13,675
or that's eight different bit patterns.

1016
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:16,615
But the bit patterns are not, you know

1017
00:48:16,615 --> 00:48:18,055
four bits.

1018
00:48:18,055 --> 00:48:20,455
The bit patterns are eight bits.

1019
00:48:20,455 --> 00:48:20,735
Right.

1020
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,275
All right?

1021
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:24,655
So it's gonna take those f- those, those bits and cry out.

1022
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:34,895
So the wider, uh, microinstructions allow for more parallelism and there's more bits to tweak hardware in parallel.

1023
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:35,215
Okay.

1024
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:38,535
So before we, uh, get to Microsoft

1025
00:48:38,535 --> 00:48:40,435
there was one thing I wanted to ask you about DEC and that was.

1026
00:48:40,435 --> 00:48:40,575
..

1027
00:48:40,575 --> 00:48:45,715
I may have the story wrong, but it sounds like before you decided to either move to DEC West or move to Microsoft

1028
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:48,275
you basically shopped yourself back to your own employer to say

1029
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:49,620
"What am I worth on the market?

1030
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,760
" Is that.

1031
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,210
..

1032
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:52,660
..

1033
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,945
. a summary of how it went?

1034
00:48:53,945 --> 00:49:02,086
Well,  actually there was an in- a l- there was a little interlude between a couple of the things there that I kinda skipped over and that was

1035
00:49:02,086 --> 00:49:04,045
the movement at DEC West.

1036
00:49:04,045 --> 00:49:04,505
Okay.

1037
00:49:04,505 --> 00:49:13,225
The first thing was really, um, it wasn't the compiler company.

1038
00:49:13,225 --> 00:49:19,866
There was another deal and it was, I got to be really good friends with the program manager for the

1039
00:49:19,866 --> 00:49:25,345
the VAX 750, and he went to work for

1040
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:27,029
um.

1041
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:27,285
..

1042
00:49:27,285 --> 00:49:35,866
He went to work for Intel in Portland and he worked on the 432 project.

1043
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:38,445
Don't know what that is.

1044
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:44,626
The 432 was Intel's super duper computer, uh

1045
00:49:44,626 --> 00:49:46,925
arch- uh, processor architecture.

1046
00:49:46,925 --> 00:49:48,866
You should go, you should wiki this.

1047
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:57,845
This is before the i860, their previous failed attempt- This is before the i- this is before the i860 and he worked on that and he

1048
00:49:57,845 --> 00:50:01,945
he tried to get me to go to Intel and I said

1049
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:02,974
"Sure, I'll come out and interview.

1050
00:50:02,974 --> 00:50:13,505
" So I went out and interviewed in Portland and I would've been working in a group there that was not the 432 group

1051
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:15,665
but it was a group that, that

1052
00:50:15,665 --> 00:50:22,345
um, I think they had a system called RMX-16 which was w- this was Intel's little realtime system for- Okay.

1053
00:50:22,345 --> 00:50:22,445
.

1054
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:22,645
..

1055
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,165
the 286, I think.

1056
00:50:24,165 --> 00:50:30,145
And, uh, so I interviewed and, and they're all favorable and

1057
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:32,785
and they wanna make me a job offer and

1058
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:38,005
um, at, in the 11th hour they come back and they say

1059
00:50:38,005 --> 00:50:45,525
"We can't make you a job offer be- unless you tell Gordon Bell that

1060
00:50:45,525 --> 00:50:53,705
that you're looking for a job with, and that you've interviewed at Intel because we have a good relationship with Intel.

1061
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:55,176
" And I said, "Sure, that's no problem.

1062
00:50:55,176 --> 00:50:58,805
" So I pick up the phone and this is

1063
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,185
I'm in, I'm in, uh, Nashville.

1064
00:51:01,185 --> 00:51:02,385
Uh, not Nashville.

1065
00:51:02,385 --> 00:51:04,865
Nashua, New Hampshire.

1066
00:51:04,865 --> 00:51:07,405
Uh, it's Pitt Brick Road.

1067
00:51:07,405 --> 00:51:09,165
I pick up the phone and I call Gordon.

1068
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,645
So I go, "Gordon, um, you know

1069
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:16,425
I've been interviewing at Intel and they told me that I've gotta let you know that

1070
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:21,991
that they wanna offer me a job and I just wanna let you know about that.

1071
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:24,625
" And Gordon says, "Oh yeah, well what's

1072
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,355
what's the deal?

1073
00:51:25,355 --> 00:51:27,405
" And I said, "Well, you know

1074
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:28,865
I'm not really looking for a job.

1075
00:51:28,865 --> 00:51:30,645
I'd just like to know what I'm worth.

1076
00:51:30,645 --> 00:51:32,502
I'd like to have them make me an offer.

1077
00:51:32,502 --> 00:51:34,945
" And Gordon says, "Oh, okay.

1078
00:51:34,945 --> 00:51:36,015
That sounds sensible.

1079
00:51:36,015 --> 00:51:37,805
" I hang up.

1080
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:43,645
Literally 15 minutes later I get this call from Larry Portner.

1081
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:49,405
Larry Portner's the VP of software engineering at Digital and he says

1082
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:52,587
"Gordon and I would like to have lunch with you today.

1083
00:51:52,587 --> 00:51:55,540
"  And I said, "Really?

1084
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,945
" And he says, "Yeah.

1085
00:51:56,945 --> 00:52:03,311
How about lunch, you know, in, in just Nashua in an hour?

1086
00:52:03,311 --> 00:52:04,879
"  And I said, "Okay.

1087
00:52:04,879 --> 00:52:10,405
" So here comes Larry, here comes Gordon for lunch and they wanna know

1088
00:52:10,405 --> 00:52:11,665
you know, what's going on.

1089
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:14,599
I said, "You know, all I wanna know is what I'm worth.

1090
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,745
" And they say, "Well, jeez.

1091
00:52:18,745 --> 00:52:22,905
You know, you should've said something to us.

1092
00:52:22,905 --> 00:52:25,405
" I said, "Well, you know," I said

1093
00:52:25,405 --> 00:52:27,065
"we did VAX and, you know, we really

1094
00:52:27,065 --> 00:52:30,685
that VAX was really a, the VMS was really

1095
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:32,485
I worked, I worked seven days a week

1096
00:52:32,485 --> 00:52:33,297
10 hours a day.

1097
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:36,285
" I said, "We got thrilled through that.

1098
00:52:36,285 --> 00:52:39,105
You know, across the wall comes, like

1099
00:52:39,105 --> 00:52:40,576
10,000 shares of stock.

1100
00:52:40,576 --> 00:52:46,285
" And I said, "You know, that just didn't seem like a very big reward for all that effort and

1101
00:52:46,285 --> 00:52:50,350
you know, VAX is just this tremendous success and the company's riding the waves.

1102
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,545
" "Oh, well, jeez, you know, you're probably right.

1103
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,645
We probably didn't do very well there.

1104
00:52:54,645 --> 00:52:57,425
We'll have to do something, but you know

1105
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,945
we really don't want you to take this offer from

1106
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:02,181
or get this offer from them.

1107
00:53:02,181 --> 00:53:07,825
" Well, it turned out that they, they actually did cough up some more stock and I didn't want

1108
00:53:07,825 --> 00:53:09,645
I didn't wanna work with these guys anyway.

1109
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:15,225
Uh, and I didn't think Intel was all that sharp and

1110
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,885
uh, that sort of blew over.

1111
00:53:16,885 --> 00:53:21,505
But part of that blowing over was the movement at DEC West in Bellevue.

1112
00:53:21,505 --> 00:53:24,905
Um, the first go around was the go around where

1113
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:30,985
you know, I'm gonna leave the company and then in the 11th hour I decide I'm not leaving the company

1114
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:33,125
but this is after Gordon had said, "We'll

1115
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:34,489
you know, we'll send you anywhere.

1116
00:53:34,489 --> 00:53:37,145
" And this time I said, "Well, you know

1117
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:40,625
I don't wanna go work for Intel, but I really do wanna get out of here.

1118
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:44,065
" So that's when we came out and looked around.

1119
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:48,185
And then after a while at DEC West you were but a Denny's meal away from Microsoft

1120
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:48,965
if I understand.

1121
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:50,245
I was what?

1122
00:53:50,245 --> 00:53:53,305
You were a Denny's meal away from Microsoft with Steve B.

1123
00:53:53,305 --> 00:53:54,285
? .

1124
00:53:54,285 --> 00:53:56,645
D- Steve Fleecetis.

1125
00:53:56,645 --> 00:53:58,585
 Okay.

1126
00:53:58,585 --> 00:54:02,645
Well, you know, we're, we, I was leaving.

1127
00:54:02,645 --> 00:54:06,385
I, well, there's a piece missing here and that is the Prism Project.

1128
00:54:06,385 --> 00:54:14,295
Um, Digital in the mid-eighty, in mid-'80s decided to start a.

1129
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:14,485
..

1130
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:20,545
Well, we hi- we started several projects to produce RISC architectures because we had

1131
00:54:20,545 --> 00:54:28,125
um, everybody was building RISC machines and th- one of the reasons they were building RISC machines was because they're easy to build at that time.

1132
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:44,765
You know, I, um, AMD was building these 2901 bit slice chips and they're four bits wide and they had all the ALU control and all that stuff and you just gang them together and presto esto you have a processor

1133
00:54:44,765 --> 00:54:45,105
right?

1134
00:54:45,105 --> 00:54:50,365
And now all you gotta do is design your instruction set and how you're gonna feed this thing.

1135
00:54:50,365 --> 00:54:54,665
So there were a dozen, at least

1136
00:54:54,665 --> 00:55:01,970
RISC machines-And they were all, they all claimed to have a two

1137
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:02,241
or, or.

1138
00:55:02,241 --> 00:55:02,249
..

1139
00:55:02,249 --> 00:55:04,209
RISC in general claimed to have a 2X

1140
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:14,270
um, performance im-, um, advantage over VAX because VAX was a CISC machine and you had to have all this decoding and

1141
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,629
and it was, really it was a byte serial decode.

1142
00:55:16,629 --> 00:55:23,829
Uh, VAX was overly complicated, um, overly complicated.

1143
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:24,482
Uh, for the.

1144
00:55:24,482 --> 00:55:24,549
..

1145
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:26,693
The reason it was overly complicated is because we.

1146
00:55:26,693 --> 00:55:26,869
..

1147
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:32,869
Memory was so expensive when we did VAX that we wanted to encode and PDP

1148
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:41,549
PDP-11 was so wildly popular, we wanted to be able to encode programs in the same amount of space that we did on the PDP-11

1149
00:55:41,549 --> 00:55:45,229
so we created this instruction set that did that.

1150
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:47,950
Uh, but it was very hard to decode.

1151
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:54,989
So we started these, these RISC projects in several groups and we had one at DEC West and there was one

1152
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:58,569
um, there were a couple of other ones.

1153
00:55:58,569 --> 00:55:59,949
There were three, I think, in the company

1154
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:06,309
and finally got to the point where the engineering vi- VP's said

1155
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:13,591
"Hey, we need just one of these and we're gonna anoint DEC West to be the keepers of the architecture.

1156
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:15,009
" And that was the Prism project.

1157
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:30,149
So, I started to work on the Prism project a lot like we worked on the VAX architecture where we invited representatives in from various groups that would have to eventually support this thing.

1158
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:33,509
You know, the hardware engineers, the software engineers and whatever

1159
00:56:33,509 --> 00:56:38,729
and we produced, uh, a couple of different versions of the architecture.

1160
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:42,309
One was a 32-bit machine and one was a 64-bit machine

1161
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:46,829
and, um, we were progressing along.

1162
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:49,029
We were building a new software system called Mica.

1163
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:50,869
You might have heard of Mica?

1164
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:51,269
Yeah.

1165
00:56:51,269 --> 00:56:57,069
Um, and Mica was, um, wildly ambitious

1166
00:56:57,069 --> 00:56:58,449
wildly ambitious.

1167
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:04,029
It was, uh, at the level of ambition of M- Multics maybe.

1168
00:57:04,029 --> 00:57:04,982
I mean it was.

1169
00:57:04,982 --> 00:57:05,149
..

1170
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:09,449
If we'd ever built it, probably no one would have ever bought it

1171
00:57:09,449 --> 00:57:11,009
but it had a lot of good ideas in it.

1172
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:13,769
And, anyway, worked on it, worked on it

1173
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:16,789
worked on it, and then finally what happened was

1174
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:27,829
you know, it's, it's not moving forward at the speed I guess the company wanted and MIPS kind of jumped up at the f- the forefront of the RISC processors and

1175
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:39,729
um, the, um, VP of, of research was Sam Fuller at DEC and he was sort of

1176
00:57:39,729 --> 00:57:40,005
um.

1177
00:57:40,005 --> 00:57:40,149
..

1178
00:57:40,149 --> 00:57:41,409
And Forrest Baskett.

1179
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:42,629
You ever heard of Forrest Baskett?

1180
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:42,969
No.

1181
00:57:42,969 --> 00:57:53,195
Forrest Baskett was one of the principals at SGI and he actually worked for DEC for a while at a place called WRL which was Western Research Lab.

1182
00:57:53,195 --> 00:57:56,529
In fact, they had a RISC processor called Titan that they did.

1183
00:57:56,529 --> 00:58:04,949
Anyway, they were all touting the fact that there were companies that could build these one chip systems that were faster than VAX.

1184
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:13,869
And so somebody stood up and gave a presentation that Ken Olsen really liked and the next day they canceled Prism.

1185
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:17,229
And the day after that I quit.

1186
00:58:17,229 --> 00:58:21,309
 Uh, but I didn't leave the company.

1187
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:25,129
Uh, I, I, I moved down the street

1188
00:58:25,129 --> 00:58:31,929
um, sort of across where Microsoft was down on 520 for a while.

1189
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:34,529
Yeah, I remember there were digital buildings down there right off 520.

1190
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:35,329
Yeah.

1191
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:37,749
And I was gonna start a company and I got

1192
00:58:37,749 --> 00:58:39,929
uh, three of the other guys that I worked on

1193
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:41,629
uh, at DEC West.

1194
00:58:41,629 --> 00:58:45,769
We were gonna start a company which was going to be a server company and we.

1195
00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:45,969
..

1196
00:58:45,969 --> 00:58:52,309
I spent a lot of time in Silicon Valley and talking to the VC people.

1197
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:53,969
Uh, we talked to Merrill Pickens.

1198
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:57,589
We talked to, um, to, um

1199
00:58:57,589 --> 00:59:00,969
whoever Don Dorr or John Dorr works for.

1200
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:05,109
Oak Investments and a bunch of other ones and we got money.

1201
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:16,289
We had money to start a company and were all signed up to start the company and some of the people that had been at DEC West had s- had left and went to Microsoft.

1202
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:16,429
Mm-hmm.

1203
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:21,889
And one of them was working for Nathan Myhrvold and Nathan Myhrvold

1204
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:22,869
we probably know Nathan.

1205
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:23,189
Mm-hmm.

1206
00:59:23,189 --> 00:59:36,489
Nathan Myhrvold had his, his, um, had Bill's ear and Nathan was very high on their whole RISC idea and

1207
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,122
uh, then you.

1208
00:59:38,122 --> 00:59:38,189
..

1209
00:59:38,189 --> 00:59:39,589
Actually that was part of it.

1210
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:46,609
The other part of it was that all of the software that Microsoft produced that was operating system stuff was pretty pathetic.

1211
00:59:46,609 --> 00:59:48,669
It was all Assembler.

1212
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,889
It was non-portable.

1213
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:51,949
Hey, I wrote some of that.

1214
00:59:51,949 --> 00:59:53,349
You wrote some of that?

1215
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:54,629
  So you know some of that

1216
00:59:54,629 --> 00:59:54,909
right?

1217
00:59:54,909 --> 00:59:57,789
Um, did you know Tim Patterson?

1218
00:59:57,789 --> 00:59:58,549
Uh, no.

1219
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:59,729
I did work on DOS but.

1220
00:59:59,729 --> 00:59:59,829
..

1221
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,229
I mean, I'd met him but I didn't know him well.

1222
01:00:01,229 --> 01:00:01,349
Okay.

1223
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:11,749
Um, so anyway, you know, I get this call from Microsoft and they want to know if I want to come talk to Bill about a job at Microsoft and I said

1224
01:00:11,749 --> 01:00:12,385
"Oh, sure.

1225
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:15,729
" So I go over and I talk to Bill and

1226
01:00:15,729 --> 01:00:19,369
you know, Bill was like, um.

1227
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:19,609
..

1228
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:25,689
You know, immediately, "You're gonna take a job with us

1229
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:25,946
right?

1230
01:00:25,946 --> 01:00:27,609
" And I'm like, "Well, you know

1231
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:29,465
maybe, maybe not.

1232
01:00:29,465 --> 01:00:30,435
" "Well, why.

1233
01:00:30,435 --> 01:00:30,529
..

1234
01:00:30,529 --> 01:00:32,529
How, how can you possibly not take a job with us?

1235
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:34,291
We're the greatest people in the world.

1236
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:36,524
" And I'm like, "Well, you know.

1237
01:00:36,524 --> 01:00:36,634
..

1238
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:40,129
" So I, you know, listened to the spiel and talked to Bill and

1239
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:42,369
and the other guys go talk to him too.

1240
01:00:42,369 --> 01:00:43,329
One was Rob Short.

1241
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:44,369
You may have known Rob Short.

1242
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:45,649
Did you know John Belchunas?

1243
01:00:45,649 --> 01:00:46,029
Nope.

1244
01:00:46,029 --> 01:00:52,249
The other guy was Lon Willoughby and so they all kind of went over and talked and

1245
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:55,937
and I came back and I s-.

1246
01:00:55,937 --> 01:00:56,049
..

1247
01:00:56,049 --> 01:00:57,069
You know, after all this and I

1248
01:00:57,069 --> 01:00:58,589
we talked and I said, "Hey, I'm not.

1249
01:00:58,589 --> 01:00:58,729
..

1250
01:00:58,729 --> 01:01:01,429
I, I don't see that this is gonna be a great thing.

1251
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:05,555
You know, I'm not so impressed with Microsoft.

1252
01:01:05,555 --> 01:01:13,825
"And so, I don't know whether I actually told them I wasn't gonna accept the job or what

1253
01:01:13,825 --> 01:01:20,599
but Steve Ballmer calls up and says, "How about breakfast at Denny's on Sunday morning at eight o'clock?

1254
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:22,905
" And I said, "Sure.

1255
01:01:22,905 --> 01:01:27,645
" So we had breakfast with Steve Ballmer at Denny's at eight o'clock.

1256
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:29,985
It's the one on 148th that's not there anymore.

1257
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:32,366
Uh, right down from Fred Meyer's.

1258
01:01:32,366 --> 01:01:32,825
Yeah, yeah.

1259
01:01:32,825 --> 01:01:35,885
And he sold us.

1260
01:01:35,885 --> 01:01:39,265
I mean, I don't know, that could've been Wednesday and we signed up

1261
01:01:39,265 --> 01:01:40,465
I was there next Monday.

1262
01:01:40,465 --> 01:01:41,786
I mean, it was that quick.

1263
01:01:41,786 --> 01:01:50,685
So, Steve was the, the, the one that really sold us all on going to Microsoft and that's how we ended up there.

1264
01:01:50,685 --> 01:01:54,805
And  I've been a friend and, of Steve's

1265
01:01:54,805 --> 01:01:56,265
an admirer of him forever.

1266
01:01:56,265 --> 01:01:58,306
Um, he's a great guy.

1267
01:01:58,306 --> 01:02:03,505
This is kind of a naive question, but Microsoft already had Xenix in-house.

1268
01:02:03,505 --> 01:02:03,925
Yeah.

1269
01:02:03,925 --> 01:02:08,085
And they could have, in theory, built an operating system based off that.

1270
01:02:08,085 --> 01:02:10,425
But they went and did a clean sheet design with OS/2

1271
01:02:10,425 --> 01:02:12,165
and did that again with NT.

1272
01:02:12,165 --> 01:02:14,045
Was it licensing or technical?

1273
01:02:14,045 --> 01:02:14,505
No.

1274
01:02:14,505 --> 01:02:18,185
See, I, uh, it didn't happen exactly like that.

1275
01:02:18,185 --> 01:02:20,565
 You know, they did the Xenix thing

1276
01:02:20,565 --> 01:02:23,005
uh, and I, I wasn't there then.

1277
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:23,385
Right.

1278
01:02:23,385 --> 01:02:27,225
Um, they did the Xenix thing and for some reason

1279
01:02:27,225 --> 01:02:31,059
um, they decide, and th- and they.

1280
01:02:31,059 --> 01:02:31,145
..

1281
01:02:31,145 --> 01:02:34,425
The Xenix thing, there's one piece of the Xenix thing that was genius

1282
01:02:34,425 --> 01:02:38,625
and that was they had to get a license from AT&T

1283
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:42,005
and so they, they said to AT&T

1284
01:02:42,005 --> 01:02:47,445
"You know, would you consider doing a volume license for us?

1285
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:48,630
For doing.

1286
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:48,725
..

1287
01:02:48,725 --> 01:02:52,765
So that as we, we bought more licenses

1288
01:02:52,765 --> 01:02:53,642
it got cheaper.

1289
01:02:53,642 --> 01:02:56,985
" And AT&T says, "Yeah, we'd probably do that.

1290
01:02:56,985 --> 01:02:59,905
" And then Microsoft said, "Well, you know

1291
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:01,985
like over a million, it oughta cost us

1292
01:03:01,985 --> 01:03:03,521
like, a couple of bucks or something?

1293
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:04,888
" "Yeah, that's fine.

1294
01:03:04,888 --> 01:03:10,525
" So what I, what Microsoft then did was sub-license.

1295
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:10,545
Oh, okay.

1296
01:03:10,545 --> 01:03:15,505
They sold their licenses to other people, and made the difference.

1297
01:03:15,505 --> 01:03:17,405
They had a big business going selling- Yeah.

1298
01:03:17,405 --> 01:03:17,425
.

1299
01:03:17,425 --> 01:03:17,465
..

1300
01:03:17,465 --> 01:03:18,325
selling Xenix licenses.

1301
01:03:18,325 --> 01:03:20,025
Anyway, back to DOS.

1302
01:03:20,025 --> 01:03:23,345
DOS happened, um, and, you know

1303
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:25,925
they chose DOS over CP/M.

1304
01:03:25,925 --> 01:03:30,105
And there's a lot of stories about what went on there

1305
01:03:30,105 --> 01:03:35,345
um, about whether, uh, Digital Research

1306
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:38,525
which was SP- uh, CP/M got stiffed or whatever.

1307
01:03:38,525 --> 01:03:39,665
But anyway, they ended up with DOS.

1308
01:03:39,665 --> 01:03:43,665
So DOS ships with the first, um

1309
01:03:43,665 --> 01:03:45,885
PC, the IBM PC.

1310
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:51,085
And then they decide that, that, you know

1311
01:03:51,085 --> 01:03:53,465
DOS is really this program loader.

1312
01:03:53,465 --> 01:03:55,125
It's not really much else.

1313
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:58,165
It's just this program loader, and they really need something beyond that.

1314
01:03:58,165 --> 01:04:04,365
So they decide they're gonna do this joint design between Microsoft and IBM for OS/2

1315
01:04:04,365 --> 01:04:12,265
and this is the 16-bit OS/2, and they're gonna do a new file system

1316
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:15,505
um, and the file system was called HP

1317
01:04:15,505 --> 01:04:16,465
HPFS.

1318
01:04:16,465 --> 01:04:16,605
HPFS.

1319
01:04:16,605 --> 01:04:23,445
And Gordon Letwin, you know, is gonna write the file system all in Assembler and all this stuff

1320
01:04:23,445 --> 01:04:26,685
and they got joined at the hip with IBM.

1321
01:04:26,685 --> 01:04:32,825
And the whole thing with IBM turned out not to work too well because IBM

1322
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:38,125
a very old company, and the older a company gets

1323
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:41,345
the more rigid they become, the more bureaucratic they become

1324
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:44,525
the more risk-averse they become.

1325
01:04:44,525 --> 01:04:50,265
So everything is like, you know, specs upon specs upon reviews and

1326
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:54,745
and mutual sign-off and everything, and the IBM guys are working in Boca Raton.

1327
01:04:54,745 --> 01:05:00,085
The Microsoft guys are working in Redmond, and they're just not going anywhere with that.

1328
01:05:00,085 --> 01:05:05,605
And so, this story falls into Nathan saying

1329
01:05:05,605 --> 01:05:09,371
"Geez, RISC processors are the future and there's no way that we're gonna get.

1330
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:09,505
..

1331
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,050
And 16 bits is not enough.

1332
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:12,445
" Right.

1333
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:19,165
"There's no way that we're gonna port OS/2 to anything.

1334
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,755
It's not portable.

1335
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:21,205
" Right.

1336
01:05:21,205 --> 01:05:26,050
"Um, we should build a system for a RISC system.

1337
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:30,225
" And, um, so one of the things that

1338
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:30,619
that.

1339
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:30,665
..

1340
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:35,865
One of my, my, uh, things I told Microsoft was

1341
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,205
I would not work with IBM.

1342
01:05:38,205 --> 01:05:40,525
I said, "I'm not working with IBM.

1343
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:42,825
" I said, "They can, they can

1344
01:05:42,825 --> 01:05:45,685
you know, comment on the design or whatever

1345
01:05:45,685 --> 01:05:46,915
but I'm not working with them.

1346
01:05:46,915 --> 01:05:49,705
" And that was a fear of being mired down in their bureaucracy more than anything?

1347
01:05:49,705 --> 01:05:52,256
Yeah, it was like, um, if we'd have said.

1348
01:05:52,256 --> 01:05:52,445
..

1349
01:05:52,445 --> 01:05:55,445
Um, well, even if it, easi- even if it

1350
01:05:55,445 --> 01:06:00,305
as it was, you know, they'd come in and they'd review every once in a while and produce their review comments

1351
01:06:00,305 --> 01:06:02,765
and they were super negative, you know

1352
01:06:02,765 --> 01:06:09,365
and, and they actually split off and did a 32-bit version of OS/2 which quickly went .

1353
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:09,625
Right.

1354
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:10,245
Dove.

1355
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:12,885
Uh, we sent a copy to Lee Risewick of

1356
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:13,465
that OS/2.

1357
01:06:13,465 --> 01:06:15,905
 But we had.

1358
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:16,045
..

1359
01:06:16,045 --> 01:06:18,945
The guys from IBM that reviewed, um

1360
01:06:18,945 --> 01:06:24,945
the design of NT were F- AIX guys from

1361
01:06:24,945 --> 01:06:26,165
um, Austin.

1362
01:06:26,165 --> 01:06:26,665
Okay.

1363
01:06:26,665 --> 01:06:28,665
You ever heard the name Larry Locks?

1364
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:29,965
No.

1365
01:06:29,965 --> 01:06:31,525
Larry was their big honcho.

1366
01:06:31,525 --> 01:06:34,685
He was their big honcho, and he'd come in with his cowboy boots on

1367
01:06:34,685 --> 01:06:38,645
you know, and put them up on the table and pontificate.

1368
01:06:38,645 --> 01:06:46,645
Anyway, um, so when, when we s- th- the charter when we started at

1369
01:06:46,645 --> 01:06:53,765
at Microsoft was a portable system that would run multiple environments

1370
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:57,071
and the reason for multiple environments was.

1371
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:57,285
..

1372
01:06:57,285 --> 01:06:59,225
And OS/2 was gonna be the target.

1373
01:06:59,225 --> 01:06:59,525
Yeah.

1374
01:06:59,525 --> 01:07:00,645
What, what else was, uh, what else?

1375
01:07:00,645 --> 01:07:01,165
POSIX.

1376
01:07:01,165 --> 01:07:01,545
Okay.

1377
01:07:01,545 --> 01:07:05,085
At the time, everybody was all hyped up about POSIX.

1378
01:07:05,085 --> 01:07:08,874
You know, POSIX was gonna, it was gonna unify the UNIX world.

1379
01:07:08,874 --> 01:07:09,150
..

1380
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:15,170
. the Unix world started out unified because it came out of Bell Labs and there's only one.

1381
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:22,489
But then the universities got a hold of it free and every university had to put their widget in it.

1382
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:22,849
Right.

1383
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:31,269
And then everybody that, that got a hold of Unix after that had to put their added value on so it ha- it became incompatible.

1384
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:34,769
So POSIX was an attempt to bring all this stuff back together.

1385
01:07:34,769 --> 01:07:36,469
And of course the other thing we had was we had

1386
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:39,789
we have CMU with Mach off on the side.

1387
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:47,929
So, um, we had, we wanted to have multiple environments and we actually ha- had

1388
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:56,549
and we, th- the w- the design of the system kind of was to be able to run these multiple environments and we thought that the way to do that was to have.

1389
01:07:56,549 --> 01:07:56,710
..

1390
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:06,809
The nucleus of the system would provide the basic services of the system and then they could be con- customized for these different environments.

1391
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:11,729
Um, now I, that's kind of a naïve view because.

1392
01:08:11,729 --> 01:08:11,909
..

1393
01:08:11,909 --> 01:08:17,749
In a sense it's a naïve view because there's a lot of things that wouldn't be very easy to do that with.

1394
01:08:17,749 --> 01:08:23,109
Um, um, things like thread scheduling or stuff like that

1395
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:28,769
it gets kinda sticky and the process structure gets a little sticky and paging gets a little sticky and.

1396
01:08:28,769 --> 01:08:28,929
..

1397
01:08:28,929 --> 01:08:31,189
But anyway, that's the way we started out.

1398
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:34,669
And then, you know, we get down the line w- um

1399
01:08:34,669 --> 01:08:37,189
we're, we're going along and we spend

1400
01:08:37,189 --> 01:08:42,908
we spend about, I don't know, six months to a year on a spec.

1401
01:08:42,908 --> 01:08:47,948
And this is a pretty detailed spec, uh

1402
01:08:47,948 --> 01:08:49,929
and it's two volumes that are that thick.

1403
01:08:49,929 --> 01:08:53,649
Um, The Smithsonian has a copy of those.

1404
01:08:53,649 --> 01:08:54,029
Oh really?

1405
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:54,429
Yeah.

1406
01:08:54,429 --> 01:08:55,629
It's, it's in the Smithsonian.

1407
01:08:55,629 --> 01:09:01,709
So we produce this and, um, we

1408
01:09:01,709 --> 01:09:04,095
then we start in on this project and.

1409
01:09:04,095 --> 01:09:04,288
..

1410
01:09:04,288 --> 01:09:11,069
I'm sorry, start actually doin' things and in the meantime we have this Windows thing and

1411
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:17,609
you know, I don't know, I don't think that Microsoft actually invented Windows itself.

1412
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:19,669
I think they got s- it, some group

1413
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:28,229
somebody somewhere had produced this windowing thing that ran on top of DOS and we bought it from them and we then shipped Windows 3.

1414
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:28,488
0.

1415
01:09:28,488 --> 01:09:31,549
Actually, I, it probably wasn't called 3.

1416
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:31,709
0.

1417
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:32,509
It was probably called 1.

1418
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:32,749
0.

1419
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:34,389
Nobody cared.

1420
01:09:34,389 --> 01:09:35,839
Then we shipped 2.

1421
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:36,929
0, nobody cared.

1422
01:09:36,929 --> 01:09:38,299
We shipped 3.

1423
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,569
0, nobody cared.

1424
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:41,269
Then we shipped 3.

1425
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:46,589
1, they sold 16 million copies in six months and Bill said

1426
01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:50,080
"I think the main environment of our new system will be Windows.

1427
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,089
"  So that's why we went to Windows is because

1428
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,529
uh, of the acceptance.

1429
01:09:56,529 --> 01:09:57,049
Right.

1430
01:09:57,049 --> 01:10:01,069
And th- then the, on the other side was OS/2 with

1431
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:04,535
with the, the, the Presentation Manager and.

1432
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:04,629
..

1433
01:10:04,629 --> 01:10:06,509
Now, now, I never worked with OS/2.

1434
01:10:06,509 --> 01:10:08,469
I, actually I can't say that.

1435
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:11,869
I never worked with it, I can say that

1436
01:10:11,869 --> 01:10:13,649
but I never, I did work on it.

1437
01:10:13,649 --> 01:10:18,189
We, we were developing NT on OS/2

1438
01:10:18,189 --> 01:10:27,609
even the ones that were targeted towards the RISC machines were developed on OS/2 and we couldn't wait to dogfood

1439
01:10:27,609 --> 01:10:29,089
to get off of OS/2.

1440
01:10:29,089 --> 01:10:37,909
It was- So one huge misconception is what NT actually stands for.

1441
01:10:37,909 --> 01:10:40,426
Well, that, you know.

1442
01:10:40,426 --> 01:10:40,569
..

1443
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:45,749
The, the NTen was the i860.

1444
01:10:45,749 --> 01:10:48,449
NTen being the codename for the i- i860?

1445
01:10:48,449 --> 01:10:50,589
It was the codename for the i860.

1446
01:10:50,589 --> 01:11:00,809
The i860 was a, was a, a great graphics processor and that's what it was really intended to be.

1447
01:11:00,809 --> 01:11:04,269
It had a very unusual architecture.

1448
01:11:04,269 --> 01:11:09,389
Um, it was not operating system friendly at all.

1449
01:11:09,389 --> 01:11:12,069
It had a virtually tagged cache.

1450
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:17,109
Virtual tagging of the cache means that every time you contact switch

1451
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:18,369
you have to flush the cache.

1452
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:23,469
Think about that for a moment because the code that's flush

1453
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:26,009
flushing the cache is cached.

1454
01:11:26,009 --> 01:11:27,289
Right.

1455
01:11:27,289 --> 01:11:33,169
So it became very difficult actually to get th- all that to work right.

1456
01:11:33,169 --> 01:11:35,509
The other thing it had was it had

1457
01:11:35,509 --> 01:11:39,349
um, it had a floating point mod- model.

1458
01:11:39,349 --> 01:11:46,069
It was pipeline floating point, but it was a pull model though where you actually had to pull things through the pipeline.

1459
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:50,689
Very funny architecture, but it worked well for graphics.

1460
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:53,609
It did not work well for operating system.

1461
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,909
But anyway, back to the NTen versus NT.

1462
01:11:55,909 --> 01:12:03,829
You know, in the beginning there may have been a few words about NT being NTen

1463
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:06,489
but NT really stood for next, next

1464
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:06,861
um.

1465
01:12:06,861 --> 01:12:07,069
..

1466
01:12:07,069 --> 01:12:09,509
New technology?

1467
01:12:09,509 --> 01:12:10,349
New technology.

1468
01:12:10,349 --> 01:12:10,649
Sure.

1469
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:16,214
And you know, we had big fights with the program managers because they didn't want.

1470
01:12:16,214 --> 01:12:16,329
..

1471
01:12:16,329 --> 01:12:18,669
And the marketing people, they didn't want it to be called NT.

1472
01:12:18,669 --> 01:12:23,669
They didn't want to call it NT because it si- stood for new technology.

1473
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:25,269
Well, what's the old technology then?

1474
01:12:25,269 --> 01:12:26,329
No, it wasn't that.

1475
01:12:26,329 --> 01:12:29,995
They said, "Nobody will buy the system because it's new technology.

1476
01:12:29,995 --> 01:12:30,529
" Oh, really?

1477
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:32,589
Nobody will buy it.

1478
01:12:32,589 --> 01:12:36,189
So we had a big fight about that and

1479
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:39,689
and I won the fight and we called it NT and I think that

1480
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:43,669
that, um, basically NT stands for new technology

1481
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:48,569
but you know, there may have been some fuzzy piece in there where the

1482
01:12:48,569 --> 01:12:53,469
the, the letters N and T showed up because of NTen and

1483
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:57,920
um, we said, "Okay, that's a good.

1484
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,029
..

1485
01:12:58,029 --> 01:12:59,489
You know, it could be new technology.

1486
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:03,549
" So anyway, I, I don't think it really makes a lot of difference.

1487
01:13:03,549 --> 01:13:05,389
No, just a point of curiosity.

1488
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:09,409
So were there four CPUs supported for the first version of Windows NT?

1489
01:13:09,409 --> 01:13:12,242
Or which CPUs were in- Um- .

1490
01:13:12,242 --> 01:13:12,389
..

1491
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:12,399
3.

1492
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:12,409
1?

1493
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:15,289
The first version of NT supported, um

1494
01:13:15,289 --> 01:13:17,154
the x86.

1495
01:13:17,154 --> 01:13:17,777
..

1496
01:13:17,777 --> 01:13:22,370
. MIPS and Alpha.

1497
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:26,029
No, wait a minute.

1498
01:13:26,029 --> 01:13:27,109
Y- yeah, MIPS.

1499
01:13:27,109 --> 01:13:29,489
It supported the R3000 of MIPS.

1500
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:34,669
I don't think we supported the, I don't think the R4000 was available.

1501
01:13:34,669 --> 01:13:38,970
Actually, it pr- I guess it probably was.

1502
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,170
So it's the ac- the, the x.

1503
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:41,290
..

1504
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:45,629
32-bit x86, the R3000, R4000, and Alpha.

1505
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:50,119
And I think the PowerPC actually came in like 3.

1506
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:50,489
5.

1507
01:13:50,489 --> 01:13:51,289
Daytona, yeah.

1508
01:13:51,289 --> 01:13:52,921
Um.

1509
01:13:52,921 --> 01:13:53,129
..

1510
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:53,519
Or 3.

1511
01:13:53,519 --> 01:13:54,089
5, yeah.

1512
01:13:54,089 --> 01:13:54,540
3.

1513
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:54,830
5.

1514
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,969
The PowerPC was by far the worst.

1515
01:13:57,969 --> 01:14:03,309
Um, IBM, um, was really pushing the PowerPC.

1516
01:14:03,309 --> 01:14:04,629
That was their new architecture.

1517
01:14:04,629 --> 01:14:07,650
And of course they had had such a success with the

1518
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,249
with the  the original PC that they

1519
01:14:11,249 --> 01:14:13,309
you know, this is gonna be their big thing.

1520
01:14:13,309 --> 01:14:19,449
But they had all these other things that they sold like AIX and their

1521
01:14:19,449 --> 01:14:22,869
their mainframes and everything, so they didn't wanna cannibalize anything.

1522
01:14:22,869 --> 01:14:23,269
Right.

1523
01:14:23,269 --> 01:14:29,769
So they would never produce a machine that was actually competitive.

1524
01:14:29,769 --> 01:14:32,291
And the tools, they.

1525
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:32,429
..

1526
01:14:32,429 --> 01:14:36,029
I think they did the compiler and it was always broken.

1527
01:14:36,029 --> 01:14:37,233
God, we.

1528
01:14:37,233 --> 01:14:37,329
..

1529
01:14:37,329 --> 01:14:39,149
You know, every day out of the build lab

1530
01:14:39,149 --> 01:14:42,249
we, we'd produce four builds or five builds.

1531
01:14:42,249 --> 01:14:46,849
I guess it was probably four at that time because we sorta dropped off the R3000.

1532
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:51,969
And  every single day, the PowerPC built and built.

1533
01:14:51,969 --> 01:14:53,669
Every single day.

1534
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:58,769
The RISC guys always built and the x86 was pretty reliable too.

1535
01:14:58,769 --> 01:15:02,121
Um, but, um.

1536
01:15:02,121 --> 01:15:02,329
..

1537
01:15:02,329 --> 01:15:09,229
And they kept doing that and they, they never ever actually got to a point where they had a competitive system

1538
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:10,669
so eventually just dropped it.

1539
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:14,349
And they, they would revamp their systems about once a year.

1540
01:15:14,349 --> 01:15:15,797
It's like they don't even.

1541
01:15:15,797 --> 01:15:15,849
..

1542
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:17,314
They're not selling any and we're.

1543
01:15:17,314 --> 01:15:17,369
..

1544
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:17,869
w- we haven't.

1545
01:15:17,869 --> 01:15:17,929
..

1546
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:19,409
We don't have the support yet, they're not selling it

1547
01:15:19,409 --> 01:15:20,869
and they're already revamping it for the next one.

1548
01:15:20,869 --> 01:15:21,329
Right.

1549
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:27,389
But it's always one level down from the other stuff that they're selling f- for A- AIX or something else.

1550
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:32,049
So  that was a real experience with all

1551
01:15:32,049 --> 01:15:32,609
all of those.

1552
01:15:32,609 --> 01:15:34,073
And, um.

1553
01:15:34,073 --> 01:15:34,249
..

1554
01:15:34,249 --> 01:15:38,649
You know, the way we structured the system

1555
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:42,769
um, didn't really make a lot of difference in building it.

1556
01:15:42,769 --> 01:15:45,689
It was just the  you had, just had the machines to build it.

1557
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:48,022
Um, and of course you had.

1558
01:15:48,022 --> 01:15:48,189
..

1559
01:15:48,189 --> 01:15:51,489
We had to fix the different compilation bugs for EAS and then

1560
01:15:51,489 --> 01:15:58,629
the, the, the machine-independent code far outweighed the machine-dependent code.

1561
01:15:58,629 --> 01:16:02,329
So, the dependent code is the processor-specific code.

1562
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:11,189
Um, and stuff that dealt with memory management and faults and exceptions and interrupts and stuff like that.

1563
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:15,395
So, um, it was.

1564
01:16:15,395 --> 01:16:15,569
..

1565
01:16:15,569 --> 01:16:18,029
The majority of it was pretty well shared

1566
01:16:18,029 --> 01:16:22,189
so it all, all just kinda compiled and worked.

1567
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:26,009
One question I get a lot is, how much assembly is actually down in the HAL?

1568
01:16:26,009 --> 01:16:27,869
Obviously a lot of it's gotta be system dependent

1569
01:16:27,869 --> 01:16:30,409
but how much of it actually needs to be in assembly language

1570
01:16:30,409 --> 01:16:30,789
if any?

1571
01:16:30,789 --> 01:16:32,789
Well, some has to be- The HALs

1572
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:35,349
um, are mostly not assembly language.

1573
01:16:35,349 --> 01:16:35,529
'Kay.

1574
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:38,813
Um, there are, um.

1575
01:16:38,813 --> 01:16:39,029
..

1576
01:16:39,029 --> 01:16:43,089
This is now.

1577
01:16:43,089 --> 01:16:45,729
Back then, there wasn't much in assembler then either.

1578
01:16:45,729 --> 01:16:56,529
Um, the things that would be in the HAL that would be in assembler that possibly didn't need to be in assembler were things that the compiler didn't do very well with

1579
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,429
but they were very frequent operations- Right.

1580
01:16:58,429 --> 01:16:58,429
.

1581
01:16:58,429 --> 01:16:58,429
.

1582
01:16:58,429 --> 01:17:00,849
that we wanted to make them run a little faster.

1583
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:05,309
Um, our philosophy from the start, I had witnessed the

1584
01:17:05,309 --> 01:17:10,289
the x86 compiler and the inline assembler and how bad that was.

1585
01:17:10,289 --> 01:17:14,189
Um, you know, basically the, the inline assembler

1586
01:17:14,189 --> 01:17:16,989
every time the compiler saw it, it just threw its arms up in the air and said

1587
01:17:16,989 --> 01:17:19,491
"Optimization, no optimization beyond this point.

1588
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:21,477
" So I said, "Hey, that's.

1589
01:17:21,477 --> 01:17:21,589
..

1590
01:17:21,589 --> 01:17:22,472
We don't want that.

1591
01:17:22,472 --> 01:17:23,589
" So the.

1592
01:17:23,589 --> 01:17:23,709
..

1593
01:17:23,709 --> 01:17:26,089
All the stuff, uh, when we.

1594
01:17:26,089 --> 01:17:26,249
..

1595
01:17:26,249 --> 01:17:29,909
Well, actually I'm skipping here because I'm talking about 64 bits now

1596
01:17:29,909 --> 01:17:30,489
but the 64.

1597
01:17:30,489 --> 01:17:30,689
..

1598
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:32,353
This is a 64-bit thing we s-.

1599
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:32,369
..

1600
01:17:32,369 --> 01:17:35,845
We said, "We want all of th- the stuff to be intrinsics.

1601
01:17:35,845 --> 01:17:43,569
" So all of those operations were intrinsics which meant that all that stuff in the HAL could all be written in the C code with an intrinsic.

1602
01:17:43,569 --> 01:17:50,429
So, they might be a machine-specific instr- intrinsic because the mach- the other machines didn't have those.

1603
01:17:50,429 --> 01:17:50,649
Right.

1604
01:17:50,649 --> 01:17:55,249
Um, but the HALs basically there's hardly any assembler

1605
01:17:55,249 --> 01:17:58,019
um, in the HALs and  most of the stuff.

1606
01:17:58,019 --> 01:17:58,169
..

1607
01:17:58,169 --> 01:18:01,909
Most of the stuff that has to do with interrupt handling

1608
01:18:01,909 --> 01:18:05,029
which you might think would be in the HALs is not in the HALs

1609
01:18:05,029 --> 01:18:06,189
it's in the kernel.

1610
01:18:06,189 --> 01:18:14,889
Um, some of the stuff that's in the HAL that belongs in the HAL is like configuration hardware

1611
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:20,209
uh, like PCI space on, on x86s and

1612
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:21,469
and x64.

1613
01:18:21,469 --> 01:18:25,589
And then some other stuff for ARM is in

1614
01:18:25,589 --> 01:18:28,169
um, some of the configuration stuff.

1615
01:18:28,169 --> 01:18:31,440
Um, the HALs.

1616
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:31,669
..

1617
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:34,035
In fact, the HALs now.

1618
01:18:34,035 --> 01:18:34,229
..

1619
01:18:34,229 --> 01:18:38,877
The x86 HALs have.

1620
01:18:38,877 --> 01:18:39,049
..

1621
01:18:39,049 --> 01:18:46,449
We can build them now both ways where we can actually build them as part of the system as opposed to being a separate DLL.

1622
01:18:46,449 --> 01:18:55,669
Um, originally they were separate DLLs because they were beyond being a hardware abstraction layer.

1623
01:18:55,669 --> 01:18:57,889
They were really a vendor abstraction layer.

1624
01:18:57,889 --> 01:18:58,489
Okay.

1625
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:02,689
So there's the HAL-specific stuff but the v-.

1626
01:19:02,689 --> 01:19:02,769
..

1627
01:19:02,769 --> 01:19:09,129
We, we imagined that, that vendors were gonna build HALs which was a bad idea.

1628
01:19:09,129 --> 01:19:09,649
On their own?

1629
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:09,929
Yeah.

1630
01:19:09,929 --> 01:19:13,709
Um, and we did have some vendors that tried that.

1631
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:16,989
We had a MIPS vendor, a couple MIPS vendors that tried building their own HAL

1632
01:19:16,989 --> 01:19:19,649
um, and didn't do a very good job.

1633
01:19:19,649 --> 01:19:25,056
Um, so they've become, um.

1634
01:19:25,056 --> 01:19:25,714
..

1635
01:19:25,714 --> 01:19:26,372
..

1636
01:19:26,372 --> 01:19:29,001
. basically just part of the operating system.

1637
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:38,841
Um, and I wish we would have built them that way in the beginning as just some- just another directory that build- produced an object library that we just linked in.

1638
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:41,461
But we couldn't in the beginning because these had to be pluggable

1639
01:19:41,461 --> 01:19:45,101
uh, because we had one basic, uh

1640
01:19:45,101 --> 01:19:49,622
SKU with, with different vendors being able to ship the system with their HAL.

1641
01:19:49,622 --> 01:19:56,131
 Sometime around, after the original release of NT3 or in the original NT 3.

1642
01:19:56,131 --> 01:19:59,981
1, the video driver ran in user code and- It did

1643
01:19:59,981 --> 01:20:00,341
it did.

1644
01:20:00,341 --> 01:20:00,427
.

1645
01:20:00,427 --> 01:20:00,601
..

1646
01:20:00,601 --> 01:20:02,662
it was a parallel tracking thread in the kernel side.

1647
01:20:02,662 --> 01:20:04,662
Well, yeah.

1648
01:20:04,662 --> 01:20:07,262
So there was a fair bit, not a fair bit

1649
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:09,801
it was a certain amount of overhead that we backed out for Daytona.

1650
01:20:09,801 --> 01:20:15,355
But now I'm wondering, are CPUs fast enough that that performance difference is still- Still- .

1651
01:20:15,355 --> 01:20:15,382
..

1652
01:20:15,382 --> 01:20:15,701
relevant?

1653
01:20:15,701 --> 01:20:16,281
Oh, yeah.

1654
01:20:16,281 --> 01:20:21,921
I mean, today a lot of the stuff in the GPU is

1655
01:20:21,921 --> 01:20:25,481
is dedicated towards not just graphics.

1656
01:20:25,481 --> 01:20:32,261
And GPU performance is right at the top and this

1657
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:36,401
you know, in that time we had a 64 K-byte window

1658
01:20:36,401 --> 01:20:37,681
that's what was shared.

1659
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:42,581
Today, that would have to be 64 gigabytes.

1660
01:20:42,581 --> 01:20:42,921
Right.

1661
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:46,301
I mean, it's, so it's like, it's not scalable.

1662
01:20:46,301 --> 01:20:52,161
Uh, we worked very hard to make the

1663
01:20:52,161 --> 01:21:00,781
this thing work in user mode and to make it so it was okay as far as performance was concerned and we got

1664
01:21:00,781 --> 01:21:02,041
we were pretty good with it.

1665
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:12,541
Um, and I was really against moving it into kernel mode because I didn't figure that the guys that did the graphics stuff and in the

1666
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:16,101
in the user inter- user interface, User32

1667
01:21:16,101 --> 01:21:18,186
could really write.

1668
01:21:18,186 --> 01:21:18,321
..

1669
01:21:18,321 --> 01:21:24,141
that really knew enough about writing high quality code and I was right.

1670
01:21:24,141 --> 01:21:30,681
 We moved it into kernel mode and we found out all these things that didn't quite work anymore.

1671
01:21:30,681 --> 01:21:30,921
Right.

1672
01:21:30,921 --> 01:21:31,301
Right.

1673
01:21:31,301 --> 01:21:34,329
Like the synchronization model is.

1674
01:21:34,329 --> 01:21:34,401
..

1675
01:21:34,401 --> 01:21:38,121
when you're in kernel mode, everything's parallel.

1676
01:21:38,121 --> 01:21:44,521
And it's parallel and the only way it's not parallel is with explicit synchronization.

1677
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:47,981
And in user mode that's not true.

1678
01:21:47,981 --> 01:21:49,721
If you know that you're the only thread

1679
01:21:49,721 --> 01:21:52,881
then you're the only thread no matter how many processors there are

1680
01:21:52,881 --> 01:21:54,821
then you're the only thread.

1681
01:21:54,821 --> 01:21:55,041
Right.

1682
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,641
And you're, you're safe.

1683
01:21:56,641 --> 01:21:58,801
You're thread-safe so everything's great.

1684
01:21:58,801 --> 01:22:08,881
So, so there was a lot of growing pains and it wasn't simply let's just pick up this set of code and move it down here into kernel mode.

1685
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:19,881
Uh, there was a lot of that went with it and the other thing that sort of hampered that too was that all of that old rotten 16-bit code was still in- Oh

1686
01:22:19,881 --> 01:22:20,141
yeah.

1687
01:22:20,141 --> 01:22:20,141
.

1688
01:22:20,141 --> 01:22:20,141
.

1689
01:22:20,141 --> 01:22:20,321
the code.

1690
01:22:20,321 --> 01:22:20,701
I imagine.

1691
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:24,021
So that all got put in, you know

1692
01:22:24,021 --> 01:22:29,021
drawn in and so it wasn't, it wasn't that we had 16-bit code

1693
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:33,001
we had 16-bit data structures and 16-bit, um

1694
01:22:33,001 --> 01:22:37,241
primitives that were still there and had to deal with those.

1695
01:22:37,241 --> 01:22:40,221
Now those, I think are pretty much gone now.

1696
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:45,281
Um, in fact the whole, the whole structure of all that is different now.

1697
01:22:45,281 --> 01:22:48,441
Um, it's not the same.

1698
01:22:48,441 --> 01:22:52,041
The video drivers don't fit in the system exactly the same.

1699
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:55,601
Of course that's went through I don't know how many different models

1700
01:22:55,601 --> 01:22:55,881
you know?

1701
01:22:55,881 --> 01:22:56,221
Right.

1702
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:57,901
Um, the way that works.

1703
01:22:57,901 --> 01:23:04,121
Um, and I can't tell you which model they're on now although I am right now right- working on graphics.

1704
01:23:04,121 --> 01:23:09,141
Um, um, there's a lot to it.

1705
01:23:09,141 --> 01:23:12,901
Anyway, um, it was, it was a good move.

1706
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:14,034
I was not.

1707
01:23:14,034 --> 01:23:14,201
..

1708
01:23:14,201 --> 01:23:19,981
I didn't think it was gonna be a very reliable move and I've- we've gotten the reliability to the point where it's much better.

1709
01:23:19,981 --> 01:23:25,381
Um, we had a pro- a lot of problems for a long time with

1710
01:23:25,381 --> 01:23:28,001
with vendors supplying graphics drivers.

1711
01:23:28,001 --> 01:23:28,461
Right.

1712
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:33,801
Um, and you know the graphics, they think that everything's great and we'd just show them

1713
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:37,681
we'd show them the, the, uh, the bug data from the field and say

1714
01:23:37,681 --> 01:23:39,681
"Here's your NVIDIA driver.

1715
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,356
It's got, you know, 20,000 bugs against it.

1716
01:23:42,356 --> 01:23:43,487
" "Really?

1717
01:23:43,487 --> 01:23:45,906
" "It fails, you know, every.

1718
01:23:45,906 --> 01:23:46,061
..

1719
01:23:46,061 --> 01:23:48,608
on the average of once every day and a half or something.

1720
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,192
" "Really?

1721
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:51,721
" So all that's gotten better.

1722
01:23:51,721 --> 01:23:54,741
Earlier you mentioned the Friday WIMs.

1723
01:23:54,741 --> 01:23:56,201
What's a WIM and why do you have them?

1724
01:23:56,201 --> 01:24:01,621
Well, when we started out when, when I went to Microsoft we took

1725
01:24:01,621 --> 01:24:04,001
um, 12 people.

1726
01:24:04,001 --> 01:24:09,581
Well, we immediately hired 12 people and we had a hardware group and a software group.

1727
01:24:09,581 --> 01:24:13,261
One of the, one of the things for going to Microsoft was we're gonna build hardware.

1728
01:24:13,261 --> 01:24:18,281
We decided we're going to build, we're going to build the first RISC PC and we did

1729
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:19,761
we built the first RISC PCs.

1730
01:24:19,761 --> 01:24:25,941
In fact we built one with Olivetti with the 860 which Olivetti dearly wanted to ship and we finally said

1731
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:26,911
"No you're not shipping this.

1732
01:24:26,911 --> 01:24:30,441
" So we wrote this big spec, we spent all this time

1733
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:36,281
wrote this big spec so all these 12 people that are in the software side of it are all busy doing all this.

1734
01:24:36,281 --> 01:24:40,101
But eventually we got to the point where now we're gonna hire people and

1735
01:24:40,101 --> 01:24:42,361
and, and, you know kind of fill out the

1736
01:24:42,361 --> 01:24:43,201
the group.

1737
01:24:43,201 --> 01:24:46,561
So one of the things that.

1738
01:24:46,561 --> 01:24:46,641
..

1739
01:24:46,641 --> 01:24:48,541
one of the people we hired was Dave Thomson

1740
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:49,321
you remember him?

1741
01:24:49,321 --> 01:24:49,641
Yep.

1742
01:24:49,641 --> 01:24:54,493
So Dave was in charge of the network group and this is sort of.

1743
01:24:54,493 --> 01:24:54,621
..

1744
01:24:54,621 --> 01:24:56,841
this is probably more than a year into the project

1745
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:57,776
maybe a couple.

1746
01:24:57,776 --> 01:24:57,901
..

1747
01:24:57,901 --> 01:24:59,161
uh, maybe a year and a half.

1748
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:04,401
And he came up with this idea that we're

1749
01:25:04,401 --> 01:25:13,581
we're hiring so many people and nobody knew each other and that we ought to have some way to get them together so he said

1750
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:17,132
"Let's, w- we'll have something called the WIM and it's the Weekly Integration Meeting.

1751
01:25:17,132 --> 01:25:22,001
" All right, so every Friday afternoon there was five

1752
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:24,201
five managers that worked for me.

1753
01:25:24,201 --> 01:25:29,412
One of them would go down to the Safeway and buy a few cases of beer-.

1754
01:25:29,412 --> 01:25:29,709
..

1755
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:33,329
you know, a couple of, of shopping carts full of chips

1756
01:25:33,329 --> 01:25:40,429
some shrimp and whatever, and we'd take one of the hardware labs and open it up and e- invite everybody in to meet everybody.

1757
01:25:40,429 --> 01:25:44,549
And that became very popular.

1758
01:25:44,549 --> 01:25:48,130
You know, we started out in a room that was probably about the size of this

1759
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:52,263
and we ended up with having these things in the.

1760
01:25:52,263 --> 01:25:52,350
..

1761
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:53,989
and then it kinda moved from there.

1762
01:25:53,989 --> 01:25:59,270
Remember the, like, building one and two had this reception desk and- Yeah.

1763
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,270
.

1764
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,270
.

1765
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:01,550
sort of a, um, a, uh

1766
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:02,789
well, a reception area.

1767
01:26:02,789 --> 01:26:08,029
It moved to the reception area and then we got Marriott to cater the things

1768
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:10,689
you know, and nobody's going to Safeway anymore.

1769
01:26:10,689 --> 01:26:12,075
And then.

1770
01:26:12,075 --> 01:26:12,230
..

1771
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:21,999
and this happened, this was like, every Friday night virtually for the time from we started that until the time we shipped 3.

1772
01:26:21,999 --> 01:26:22,309
1.

1773
01:26:22,309 --> 01:26:24,309
This happened every Friday night.

1774
01:26:24,309 --> 01:26:30,389
And one of the things that really up- that I really was displeased with Mr.

1775
01:26:30,389 --> 01:26:33,989
Zachary Pascal with, which I'm sure you've read the book.

1776
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:34,409
Yeah, yeah.

1777
01:26:34,409 --> 01:26:41,829
Was that whole book was about how we tortured people and the death march and everything

1778
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:45,549
and we never gave them any respite or anything

1779
01:26:45,549 --> 01:26:47,549
which was absolutely untrue.

1780
01:26:47,549 --> 01:26:52,569
We tried very hard to, to knock that edge off every week

1781
01:26:52,569 --> 01:26:53,529
every week.

1782
01:26:53,529 --> 01:26:56,969
That's where WIM came from.

1783
01:26:56,969 --> 01:26:57,509
All right.

1784
01:26:57,509 --> 01:27:01,269
So I enjoy as much open track time as I can get

1785
01:27:01,269 --> 01:27:03,769
but you actually went all out with actual competitive racing-  .

1786
01:27:03,769 --> 01:27:03,769
..

1787
01:27:03,769 --> 01:27:04,889
open wheel and everything.

1788
01:27:04,889 --> 01:27:05,049
I did.

1789
01:27:05,049 --> 01:27:06,989
How did you get into that and why'd you get out of it?

1790
01:27:06,989 --> 01:27:13,479
Well, I think we sh- it's when we shipped 3.

1791
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:13,909
1.

1792
01:27:13,909 --> 01:27:17,589
Steve Wood had this brilliant idea.

1793
01:27:17,589 --> 01:27:19,469
You remember Steve?

1794
01:27:19,469 --> 01:27:19,789
Mm-hmm.

1795
01:27:19,789 --> 01:27:25,889
He had this brilliant idea that we should go down to Laguna Seca and enroll in a

1796
01:27:25,889 --> 01:27:28,609
a r- a race car driving course.

1797
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:36,369
So, I think about, I don't know

1798
01:27:36,369 --> 01:27:40,949
somewhere around 15 people, we all sign up for this course

1799
01:27:40,949 --> 01:27:42,289
and we go to Laguna Seca and it's a

1800
01:27:42,289 --> 01:27:44,809
I think it's a, a four-day course

1801
01:27:44,809 --> 01:27:47,249
and it's in Formula Fords.

1802
01:27:47,249 --> 01:27:56,089
And I can't remember that course as being particularly inspiring.

1803
01:27:56,089 --> 01:27:58,329
The cars are slow.

1804
01:27:58,329 --> 01:28:01,949
They're open wheel cars, but they don't have much power.

1805
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:02,429
Okay.

1806
01:28:02,429 --> 01:28:04,409
Um, and they're clunky.

1807
01:28:04,409 --> 01:28:05,549
They're really clunky.

1808
01:28:05,549 --> 01:28:06,909
The transmissions were clunky.

1809
01:28:06,909 --> 01:28:09,602
But anyway, they had.

1810
01:28:09,602 --> 01:28:09,789
..

1811
01:28:09,789 --> 01:28:14,529
we, we did that, and then we found out that they had

1812
01:28:14,529 --> 01:28:17,389
they had another course that was in a different car

1813
01:28:17,389 --> 01:28:22,729
which was powered by a Mazda engine, and these were pretty spiffy cars.

1814
01:28:22,729 --> 01:28:23,949
I mean, they, they'd go, you know

1815
01:28:23,949 --> 01:28:25,289
130 miles an hour.

1816
01:28:25,289 --> 01:28:29,969
So a bunch of us signed up for that and did that.

1817
01:28:29,969 --> 01:28:35,562
And so we did that, and then we found out that they had.

1818
01:28:35,562 --> 01:28:35,749
..

1819
01:28:35,749 --> 01:28:36,629
or I.

1820
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:36,769
..

1821
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:40,069
so that was a lot more interesting, and that was a lot more

1822
01:28:40,069 --> 01:28:46,689
um, challenging, satisfying, um, whatever.

1823
01:28:46,689 --> 01:28:51,009
It was like, it was, um, something that

1824
01:28:51,009 --> 01:28:55,809
um, you really had to, to focus on and

1825
01:28:55,809 --> 01:28:58,989
and concentrate on to be good at and really practice at.

1826
01:28:58,989 --> 01:29:02,172
It just wasn't something.

1827
01:29:02,172 --> 01:29:02,229
..

1828
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:06,889
you just don't jump in a car and go off and start turning record laps.

1829
01:29:06,889 --> 01:29:07,209
Right.

1830
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:07,909
Doesn't happen.

1831
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:09,889
Well, the main thing too is, while you're doing it

1832
01:29:09,889 --> 01:29:13,129
you're not thinking about your taxes or your girlfriend or whatever.

1833
01:29:13,129 --> 01:29:13,169
No.

1834
01:29:13,169 --> 01:29:13,951
You're considering.

1835
01:29:13,951 --> 01:29:14,029
..

1836
01:29:14,029 --> 01:29:17,069
you know, you're focused entirely on that one process.

1837
01:29:17,069 --> 01:29:24,109
And it's, it's even, it's even tighter than that because you're focusing on in front of the car and what's coming up next.

1838
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:28,789
What happened 10 milliseconds ago or 100 milliseconds ago in the last turn

1839
01:29:28,789 --> 01:29:29,969
it's gone, gone forever.

1840
01:29:29,969 --> 01:29:31,849
Never gonna see that again.

1841
01:29:31,849 --> 01:29:34,889
The only thing you might remember out of that is if you did something wrong.

1842
01:29:34,889 --> 01:29:35,429
Right.

1843
01:29:35,429 --> 01:29:37,169
And then you're not gonna do that again

1844
01:29:37,169 --> 01:29:37,489
right?

1845
01:29:37,489 --> 01:29:44,249
So anyway, we did the, uh, the advanced course and then found out they have a

1846
01:29:44,249 --> 01:29:45,469
they had a racing school.

1847
01:29:45,469 --> 01:29:48,209
Um, not a ra- yeah, they had a racing s- well

1848
01:29:48,209 --> 01:29:48,966
they had a race.

1849
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:49,149
..

1850
01:29:49,149 --> 01:29:56,849
I guess it's called school y- and it's basically you sign up for two days of racing and then they have

1851
01:29:56,849 --> 01:29:57,177
um.

1852
01:29:57,177 --> 01:29:57,369
..

1853
01:29:57,369 --> 01:30:01,089
it seems like we had a practice day.

1854
01:30:01,089 --> 01:30:02,562
We had.

1855
01:30:02,562 --> 01:30:02,709
..

1856
01:30:02,709 --> 01:30:04,309
oh, it was Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

1857
01:30:04,309 --> 01:30:09,909
And on Friday you did, um, like

1858
01:30:09,909 --> 01:30:13,469
a couple sessions on the track, like two half hours or something

1859
01:30:13,469 --> 01:30:17,329
and then you did a race on Saturday and you did a race on Sunday

1860
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,489
and then they had 12 of these.

1861
01:30:18,489 --> 01:30:20,269
There, I, I think there was 12.

1862
01:30:20,269 --> 01:30:22,629
I don't know, maybe there was.

1863
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:24,309
Yeah, I guess there's 12 because there's two weekends.

1864
01:30:24,309 --> 01:30:27,173
So I did that and sort of.

1865
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:27,309
..

1866
01:30:27,309 --> 01:30:28,949
then I sort of like, you know

1867
01:30:28,949 --> 01:30:32,749
"Geez, you're looking for a little more speed or whatever.

1868
01:30:32,749 --> 01:30:36,929
" So they have, they have what they call the pro race

1869
01:30:36,929 --> 01:30:40,029
and what they do in the pro race is

1870
01:30:40,029 --> 01:30:42,969
it's the same engine, but they just

1871
01:30:42,969 --> 01:30:45,589
they sort of take the governor out- Right.

1872
01:30:45,589 --> 01:30:45,595
.

1873
01:30:45,595 --> 01:30:45,609
..

1874
01:30:45,609 --> 01:30:51,269
of the pitcher and, um, uh, open up the exhaust a little bit and they go a little faster and

1875
01:30:51,269 --> 01:30:53,949
and the other thing they let you do is screw with the suspension.

1876
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:55,675
So you get.

1877
01:30:55,675 --> 01:30:55,829
..

1878
01:30:55,829 --> 01:30:56,786
and, and they.

1879
01:30:56,786 --> 01:30:56,889
..

1880
01:30:56,889 --> 01:30:57,398
the mechanic.

1881
01:30:57,398 --> 01:30:57,489
..

1882
01:30:57,489 --> 01:30:59,629
this whole thing is built around a mechanic school.

1883
01:30:59,629 --> 01:31:08,169
So they're charging you to drive their cars and they're charging these mechanics to train them how to fix the cars

1884
01:31:08,169 --> 01:31:12,129
and you're paying for all the crash damage and everything that happens to- Right.

1885
01:31:12,129 --> 01:31:12,129
.

1886
01:31:12,129 --> 01:31:12,129
.

1887
01:31:12,129 --> 01:31:12,549
the cars.

1888
01:31:12,549 --> 01:31:21,749
So I did pro race and, and I got to be really good friends with one of the instructors

1889
01:31:21,749 --> 01:31:23,649
Case Montgomery.

1890
01:31:23,649 --> 01:31:33,709
And so he's talking to some guy that had raced in Atlantics

1891
01:31:33,709 --> 01:31:36,329
which Atlantic car is a Formula car-.

1892
01:31:36,329 --> 01:31:36,761
..

1893
01:31:36,761 --> 01:31:37,981
uh, open-wheel car.

1894
01:31:37,981 --> 01:31:39,301
Do you know what a Formula NAC is?

1895
01:31:39,301 --> 01:31:39,681
Mm-hmm.

1896
01:31:39,681 --> 01:31:40,221
Okay.

1897
01:31:40,221 --> 01:31:44,701
So, uh, once upon a time they had

1898
01:31:44,701 --> 01:31:47,921
uh, a series that actually raced in Canada

1899
01:31:47,921 --> 01:31:48,849
the U.

1900
01:31:48,849 --> 01:31:49,017
S.

1901
01:31:49,017 --> 01:31:50,021
, and Australia.

1902
01:31:50,021 --> 01:31:51,435
And they.

1903
01:31:51,435 --> 01:31:51,561
..

1904
01:31:51,561 --> 01:31:53,841
There was a car in Australia that had been stranded there.

1905
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:55,102
It'd only been raced once.

1906
01:31:55,102 --> 01:32:05,461
And he got this instructor all hopped up about buying this car and bringing it back and racing in the Atlantic series in the U.

1907
01:32:05,461 --> 01:32:05,681
S.

1908
01:32:05,681 --> 01:32:09,441
and wanted me to know if I'd be interested in

1909
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:11,781
you know, being involved in this.

1910
01:32:11,781 --> 01:32:13,538
And I said, "Yeah, sure.

1911
01:32:13,538 --> 01:32:19,741
" So, I end up buying the car and he raced the car in 1996.

1912
01:32:19,741 --> 01:32:24,301
And I.

1913
01:32:24,301 --> 01:32:24,521
..

1914
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:26,721
The next year, we decided we were gonna buy a

1915
01:32:26,721 --> 01:32:28,381
a new car for him.

1916
01:32:28,381 --> 01:32:31,361
And so we had this old one.

1917
01:32:31,361 --> 01:32:35,961
And, uh, it's, it's old in the sense that the

1918
01:32:35,961 --> 01:32:39,261
um, the body work is different.

1919
01:32:39,261 --> 01:32:44,961
Um, it's a refinement of the aerodynamic of the body.

1920
01:32:44,961 --> 01:32:45,606
You know, it's.

1921
01:32:45,606 --> 01:32:45,681
..

1922
01:32:45,681 --> 01:32:48,981
The engine's the same, the transmission's the same.

1923
01:32:48,981 --> 01:32:49,421
Right.

1924
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:53,601
Uh, so it's not like it's just drastically different.

1925
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:57,161
So, the series at the time had two classes within the race.

1926
01:32:57,161 --> 01:33:00,001
There was a C series, which was.

1927
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:00,161
..

1928
01:33:00,161 --> 01:33:02,781
And then there was the, the guys that were racing for the

1929
01:33:02,781 --> 01:33:04,041
the Big Buck Pros.

1930
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:05,221
Big Bucks.

1931
01:33:05,221 --> 01:33:07,901
It's called Year Bucks,  you know.

1932
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:11,041
And so, um, I said, "Well

1933
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:13,486
I'll try to drive the car and see if I can do it.

1934
01:33:13,486 --> 01:33:15,101
" So I, we went down to, uh

1935
01:33:15,101 --> 01:33:15,661
Firebird.

1936
01:33:15,661 --> 01:33:16,721
Do you know where Firebird's at?

1937
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:17,321
No.

1938
01:33:17,321 --> 01:33:17,921
Huh?

1939
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:19,581
It's in Phoenix.

1940
01:33:19,581 --> 01:33:20,041
Okay.

1941
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:26,061
Uh, Firebird is actually on an Indian reservation and they have two courses

1942
01:33:26,061 --> 01:33:28,341
two race courses, and then they have

1943
01:33:28,341 --> 01:33:31,861
they have a, um, a drag boat course.

1944
01:33:31,861 --> 01:33:36,561
Bondurant Driving School is headquartered there.

1945
01:33:36,561 --> 01:33:42,681
So, anyway, we go to Firebird and my driving against the instructor's driving

1946
01:33:42,681 --> 01:33:45,061
which he's, he's been now in Atlantic for years

1947
01:33:45,061 --> 01:33:47,601
I'm only off by two seconds in his lap time.

1948
01:33:47,601 --> 01:33:50,681
So, they sell me on the fact that I oughta race.

1949
01:33:50,681 --> 01:33:53,721
So, that's the start of my racing career

1950
01:33:53,721 --> 01:33:55,501
which was 1997.

1951
01:33:55,501 --> 01:33:55,621
Wow.

1952
01:33:55,621 --> 01:33:59,081
I did 56 races.

1953
01:33:59,081 --> 01:34:05,141
Uh, my last race was at the PepsiCo Center in Denver and we raced

1954
01:34:05,141 --> 01:34:08,241
we raced all over.

1955
01:34:08,241 --> 01:34:10,661
We raced in Hous- uh, we raced in Houston

1956
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:13,481
um, the street course there.

1957
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:16,001
We raced in Florida at Homestead.

1958
01:34:16,001 --> 01:34:20,621
We raced in, um, Nazareth, Pennsylvania.

1959
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:23,961
We raced in Monar- uh, Toronto.

1960
01:34:23,961 --> 01:34:26,861
We raced in Mon- Montreal.

1961
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:29,841
We raced in Trois-Rivières, which was, uh

1962
01:34:29,841 --> 01:34:33,281
by, um, north of Montreal.

1963
01:34:33,281 --> 01:34:35,881
We raced in Vancouver.

1964
01:34:35,881 --> 01:34:38,781
Um, I did Vancouver several times.

1965
01:34:38,781 --> 01:34:40,601
We raced in Portland.

1966
01:34:40,601 --> 01:34:41,961
We raced at Laguna Seca.

1967
01:34:41,961 --> 01:34:46,341
Um, we reaced- we raced at Long Beach.

1968
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:48,881
We raced at Mid-Ohio.

1969
01:34:48,881 --> 01:34:52,601
Um, raced at St.

1970
01:34:52,601 --> 01:34:53,161
Louis.

1971
01:34:53,161 --> 01:34:56,221
Raced in Chicago.

1972
01:34:56,221 --> 01:35:02,861
So, I did 56 races and the last one was in PepsiCo.

1973
01:35:02,861 --> 01:35:07,221
And I was sort of like, I was 60.

1974
01:35:07,221 --> 01:35:09,241
That was when I s- I quit when I was 60.

1975
01:35:09,241 --> 01:35:13,441
Um, this is 2002.

1976
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:16,821
So, it's a few years ago.

1977
01:35:16,821 --> 01:35:25,541
And I was sort of at the point where every year I got better and every year everybody else got better.

1978
01:35:25,541 --> 01:35:28,181
But they got better faster than I did.

1979
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:34,114
So, I became more competitive and so I was.

1980
01:35:34,114 --> 01:35:34,261
..

1981
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:36,254
My best finish was.

1982
01:35:36,254 --> 01:35:36,321
..

1983
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:38,081
I finished eighth at Milwaukee.

1984
01:35:38,081 --> 01:35:40,221
Oh, I forgot.

1985
01:35:40,221 --> 01:35:40,721
Milwaukee.

1986
01:35:40,721 --> 01:35:42,861
I've rac- the Milwaukee Mile, th- the oval.

1987
01:35:42,861 --> 01:35:43,194
I was.

1988
01:35:43,194 --> 01:35:43,301
..

1989
01:35:43,301 --> 01:35:45,061
The, the ovals I was very good at.

1990
01:35:45,061 --> 01:35:50,661
Um, the s- the street courses and the road courses

1991
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:52,381
um, I wasn't as good at.

1992
01:35:52,381 --> 01:35:59,181
Um, but the, the ovals, the younger guys don't got the cajones

1993
01:35:59,181 --> 01:35:59,541
right?

1994
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:03,001
 You know, there's only two kinds of oval racers.

1995
01:36:03,001 --> 01:36:04,321
Did you know that?

1996
01:36:04,321 --> 01:36:04,761
No.

1997
01:36:04,761 --> 01:36:09,281
There's the ones that haven't hit the wall and there's the ones that have.

1998
01:36:09,281 --> 01:36:12,481
And the ones that haven't are gonna hit the wall.

1999
01:36:12,481 --> 01:36:15,081
So, eventually you're gonna hit the wall.

2000
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:20,281
And I had, I had two big wrecks on the wall.

2001
01:36:20,281 --> 01:36:21,301
One in St.

2002
01:36:21,301 --> 01:36:24,461
Louis and, and one in Phoenix at PIR.

2003
01:36:24,461 --> 01:36:25,941
That was just testing.

2004
01:36:25,941 --> 01:36:28,161
Anyway, that's how I got in.

2005
01:36:28,161 --> 01:36:32,561
And I got out because, um, you know

2006
01:36:32,561 --> 01:36:38,301
I, I sort of was at the point where I'm pretty old for doing th- to be doing this.

2007
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:40,681
There's nobody else 60 doing this.

2008
01:36:40,681 --> 01:36:41,001
Right.

2009
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:43,681
You know, they're all 19, 21.

2010
01:36:43,681 --> 01:36:50,821
Um, uh, you know, I thought a little bit the cost was prohibitive

2011
01:36:50,821 --> 01:36:53,781
 it was tremendously prohibitive.

2012
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:56,909
The way to s- to make a big fortune in racing is to start with.

2013
01:36:56,909 --> 01:36:57,001
..

2014
01:36:57,001 --> 01:36:59,561
To make a small fortune in racing is to start with a big one

2015
01:36:59,561 --> 01:37:01,221
not racing.

2016
01:37:01,221 --> 01:37:01,681
Right.

2017
01:37:01,681 --> 01:37:05,661
Um, but the, the other thing was

2018
01:37:05,661 --> 01:37:07,781
this took up a lot of time.

2019
01:37:07,781 --> 01:37:13,941
Um, you know, we travel on Thursday and get home Sunday night.

2020
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:18,741
And we had 12 races a year and then you couple that with

2021
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:23,561
um, testing and we'd do at least six test days.

2022
01:37:23,561 --> 01:37:24,546
And test days were.

2023
01:37:24,546 --> 01:37:24,621
..

2024
01:37:24,621 --> 01:37:27,121
Usually a test day was a test weekend

2025
01:37:27,121 --> 01:37:31,961
so we would arrive on Friday and test Saturday and Sunday.

2026
01:37:31,961 --> 01:37:37,145
Um, so I just kinda got worn down.

2027
01:37:37,145 --> 01:37:39,449
Let's see.

2028
01:37:39,449 --> 01:37:43,469
After, uh, Daytona, do you remember Bob Day?

2029
01:37:43,469 --> 01:37:45,490
I do remember Bob Day.

2030
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:50,589
So I and Bob Day and a couple of guys did the port of the Windows 95 user interface over to NT

2031
01:37:50,589 --> 01:37:54,309
and we got it running on the Intel 351 basically.

2032
01:37:54,309 --> 01:38:01,069
Um, and that was sort of integral to the Tukwila project

2033
01:38:01,069 --> 01:38:04,289
and it was helpful in killing off Cairo

2034
01:38:04,289 --> 01:38:06,069
but I didn't get to go to any of those cool meetings.

2035
01:38:06,069 --> 01:38:08,790
So what actually happened in those years in behind the scenes?

2036
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:12,589
 You know, what happened was they hired Allchin

2037
01:38:12,589 --> 01:38:15,849
and Allchin came from Banyan.

2038
01:38:15,849 --> 01:38:26,110
And Bill was big on Allchin, and Allchin had these grand ideas about building this user interface in Cairo and everything.

2039
01:38:26,110 --> 01:38:33,030
And, and, um, Windows 95 had been brought out that interface and was pretty popular.

2040
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:37,249
And, you know, we wanted to bring that over to NT

2041
01:38:37,249 --> 01:38:40,349
and it's, "No, we gotta do, take it to Cairo.

2042
01:38:40,349 --> 01:38:45,149
" And so, you remember Megan Bliss?

2043
01:38:45,149 --> 01:38:45,729
Mm-hmm.

2044
01:38:45,729 --> 01:38:57,149
Megan Bliss and I convinced Jim Allchin that we could do Tukwila and Cairo at the same time

2045
01:38:57,149 --> 01:39:02,509
that we had enough lab horsepower to do that.

2046
01:39:02,509 --> 01:39:06,389
Of course, you know, I don't know why he bought this story

2047
01:39:06,389 --> 01:39:07,449
but he bought this story.

2048
01:39:07,449 --> 01:39:09,849
We said, "Here, here's what we'll do is

2049
01:39:09,849 --> 01:39:12,389
you know, we'll basically still have the two groups.

2050
01:39:12,389 --> 01:39:17,314
We'll have the Cairo group, and we'll have the Tukwila group.

2051
01:39:17,314 --> 01:39:19,629
" He didn't like the name Tukwila.

2052
01:39:19,629 --> 01:39:22,289
And the, the T-shirt, I don't if you remember the T-shirt

2053
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:23,589
it says- I was gonna wear it tonight

2054
01:39:23,589 --> 01:39:24,049
but I decided not to.

2055
01:39:24,049 --> 01:39:25,289
 It says, it says, it says

2056
01:39:25,289 --> 01:39:28,986
"Tukwila, it's just down the street a ways and we know how to get there.

2057
01:39:28,986 --> 01:39:30,109
" We can get there from here, yeah.

2058
01:39:30,109 --> 01:39:31,109
We can get there from here.

2059
01:39:31,109 --> 01:39:39,029
So the deal was that every day, we would put priority getting

2060
01:39:39,029 --> 01:39:41,209
uh, Cairo out of the build lab first

2061
01:39:41,209 --> 01:39:42,969
and then we get the rest of it out.

2062
01:39:42,969 --> 01:39:48,309
And it turned out that every day, Tukwila just came out

2063
01:39:48,309 --> 01:39:51,469
every day, and Cairo was always broken.

2064
01:39:51,469 --> 01:39:52,029
Right.

2065
01:39:52,029 --> 01:39:53,029
It took forever.

2066
01:39:53,029 --> 01:40:00,009
And little by little, the Cairo features didn't get done

2067
01:40:00,009 --> 01:40:03,919
and they never.

2068
01:40:03,919 --> 01:40:04,069
..

2069
01:40:04,069 --> 01:40:05,209
One of the things we did with, uh

2070
01:40:05,209 --> 01:40:11,849
with NTFS, we said, "You guys can change the file structure as many times as you want

2071
01:40:11,849 --> 01:40:19,469
but you can't stop people from booting old systems and using old file structures.

2072
01:40:19,469 --> 01:40:24,169
You have to either do an upgrade in place or you have to accept the old stuff.

2073
01:40:24,169 --> 01:40:26,866
We're gonna be dog food on this file system.

2074
01:40:26,866 --> 01:40:31,129
" The OFS guys never did that, right to the very end

2075
01:40:31,129 --> 01:40:33,369
and they kept promising and promising.

2076
01:40:33,369 --> 01:40:35,689
So they didn't get all of the, the burn-in.

2077
01:40:35,689 --> 01:40:36,369
Right.

2078
01:40:36,369 --> 01:40:38,889
And eventually, they missed a date, said

2079
01:40:38,889 --> 01:40:40,429
"OFS is gone.

2080
01:40:40,429 --> 01:40:42,769
" Say that's gone.

2081
01:40:42,769 --> 01:40:47,589
So little by little, these features, they just never delivered

2082
01:40:47,589 --> 01:40:52,209
and they just never delivered, and Tukwila just kept growing and growing and growing.

2083
01:40:52,209 --> 01:40:57,929
And eventually, the only thing that I can remember that we really brought over

2084
01:40:57,929 --> 01:41:00,849
actually maybe two things.

2085
01:41:00,849 --> 01:41:04,529
I think we brought over the ser- the file server software.

2086
01:41:04,529 --> 01:41:07,029
I think that that replaced the NT one

2087
01:41:07,029 --> 01:41:09,489
and the other thing we brought over was Kerberos.

2088
01:41:09,489 --> 01:41:12,049
Those are the only two things about Cairo.

2089
01:41:12,049 --> 01:41:13,269
Everything else was junked.

2090
01:41:13,269 --> 01:41:13,669
Really?

2091
01:41:13,669 --> 01:41:13,989
What'd they become of it?

2092
01:41:13,989 --> 01:41:19,169
Completely junked on the floor, um, it just wasn't there.

2093
01:41:19,169 --> 01:41:23,329
The people, um, I can't really, I

2094
01:41:23,329 --> 01:41:25,049
I guess I shouldn't really say anything.

2095
01:41:25,049 --> 01:41:27,169
Uh, there was a lot of good guys that worked on Cairo

2096
01:41:27,169 --> 01:41:35,969
um, and I don't, I just don't think that the whole project had the focus and the desire to make it really great.

2097
01:41:35,969 --> 01:41:38,509
And it just fell by the way because

2098
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:41,869
you know, on the other side of the fence is the NT group

2099
01:41:41,869 --> 01:41:43,529
and they're not letting up.

2100
01:41:43,529 --> 01:41:45,609
Like, uh, they're full on the throttle.

2101
01:41:45,609 --> 01:41:48,009
And Megan did a great job of selling all this.

2102
01:41:48,009 --> 01:41:48,815
We, uh, it was.

2103
01:41:48,815 --> 01:41:48,949
..

2104
01:41:48,949 --> 01:41:51,329
I can remember the day we did this with Allchin.

2105
01:41:51,329 --> 01:41:54,469
We were in one of the conference rooms in Building 36

2106
01:41:54,469 --> 01:41:57,429
and said, "Hey, we could, we'll just do

2107
01:41:57,429 --> 01:42:00,389
Tukwila will just be a backup, it's just a backup.

2108
01:42:00,389 --> 01:42:01,289
" NT 4.

2109
01:42:01,289 --> 01:42:06,149
0, I think is, is still one of the most popular ones that ever sold.

2110
01:42:06,149 --> 01:42:06,609
Yeah.

2111
01:42:06,609 --> 01:42:10,729
Uh, I ran into somebody, I don't know

2112
01:42:10,729 --> 01:42:13,009
a couple years ago, that was still running NT

2113
01:42:13,009 --> 01:42:14,155
they still had NT 4.

2114
01:42:14,155 --> 01:42:15,109
0 running on something.

2115
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:16,309
They still loved it.

2116
01:42:16,309 --> 01:42:18,669
Yeah, I've got it on a model 95 over there- Yeah?

2117
01:42:18,669 --> 01:42:18,675
.

2118
01:42:18,675 --> 01:42:18,689
..

2119
01:42:18,689 --> 01:42:19,669
a big IBM tower.

2120
01:42:19,669 --> 01:42:24,469
But, uh, scheduling software is notoriously hard

2121
01:42:24,469 --> 01:42:25,009
of course.

2122
01:42:25,009 --> 01:42:28,669
And the original, uh, version of Windows was supposed to take two years or three years.

2123
01:42:28,669 --> 01:42:30,329
I forget what was estimated, but it took longer

2124
01:42:30,329 --> 01:42:30,649
let's say.

2125
01:42:30,649 --> 01:42:31,069
Which one?

2126
01:42:31,069 --> 01:42:31,849
Windows NT?

2127
01:42:31,849 --> 01:42:32,129
Yeah.

2128
01:42:32,129 --> 01:42:32,589
Yeah.

2129
01:42:32,589 --> 01:42:34,549
It was supposed to be three years, I think

2130
01:42:34,549 --> 01:42:35,089
two years.

2131
01:42:35,089 --> 01:42:36,889
We did VMS in two years.

2132
01:42:36,889 --> 01:42:37,409
Right.

2133
01:42:37,409 --> 01:42:42,229
And VM, VMs, but in VMS, there's

2134
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:43,729
there's,  there was some difference.

2135
01:42:43,729 --> 01:42:49,069
In VMS, we had probably the whole project had 20 people

2136
01:42:49,069 --> 01:42:52,429
and that included the compiler people, um

2137
01:42:52,429 --> 01:42:55,029
and the main, the main thing, uh

2138
01:42:55,029 --> 01:42:58,229
the tools there was the FORTRAN compiler because we were selling that as a

2139
01:42:58,229 --> 01:42:59,469
a FORTRAN machine.

2140
01:42:59,469 --> 01:43:02,529
But every single one of those people were

2141
01:43:02,529 --> 01:43:05,189
you know, really just top-notch people.

2142
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:08,029
Um, and so it was a very

2143
01:43:08,029 --> 01:43:12,629
very talented group, extremely talented, and, and g- we did not have that with

2144
01:43:12,629 --> 01:43:16,269
with, uh, the NT group completely.

2145
01:43:16,269 --> 01:43:18,629
I mean, w- we had, we had a good core

2146
01:43:18,629 --> 01:43:22,709
and we had great people, but it wasn't as small a core

2147
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:24,409
and we had to do more stuff.

2148
01:43:24,409 --> 01:43:24,749
Right.

2149
01:43:24,749 --> 01:43:25,029
Right?

2150
01:43:25,029 --> 01:43:28,329
Um, so, and then of course, we

2151
01:43:28,329 --> 01:43:30,509
we had some other things in there too where

2152
01:43:30,509 --> 01:43:32,749
you know, we, we threw out the 860

2153
01:43:32,749 --> 01:43:35,629
and then we started on MIPS.

2154
01:43:35,629 --> 01:43:40,543
And then digital came along and said, "We wanna do the R3000 in addition to the R4000.

2155
01:43:40,543 --> 01:43:44,822
" And then we decided we're gonna do the x86 all before 3.

2156
01:43:44,822 --> 01:43:46,423
1 st- shipped.

2157
01:43:46,423 --> 01:43:51,257
So originally, it was just going to be one architecture and we were gonna sh- do the system for it

2158
01:43:51,257 --> 01:43:55,597
and we end up with all these architectures and actually throwing out the

2159
01:43:55,597 --> 01:44:01,167
uh, the 860, which was a godsend because that would have never.

2160
01:44:01,167 --> 01:44:01,317
..

2161
01:44:01,317 --> 01:44:02,517
I, I mean, it was so bad.

2162
01:44:02,517 --> 01:44:03,898
 It was terrible.

2163
01:44:03,898 --> 01:44:07,457
The rec- the, there were so, the errata sheet

2164
01:44:07,457 --> 01:44:10,617
I swear, was, it was a half-inch thick.

2165
01:44:10,617 --> 01:44:11,037
Really?

2166
01:44:11,037 --> 01:44:12,097
Oh, it was everything.

2167
01:44:12,097 --> 01:44:15,077
And Intel would come and say, they'd say

2168
01:44:15,077 --> 01:44:17,437
"There are some new errata discovered, you know

2169
01:44:17,437 --> 01:44:19,858
floating point something doesn't work.

2170
01:44:19,858 --> 01:44:24,501
No problem though, the Intel exception handler handles that.

2171
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:27,778
" Well, we didn't use the Intel exception handler because it was so buggy

2172
01:44:27,778 --> 01:44:28,517
it didn't work.

2173
01:44:28,517 --> 01:44:36,417
So anyway, um, that's how Tukwila came about and how Cairo ceased to exist.

2174
01:44:36,417 --> 01:44:37,077
All right.

2175
01:44:37,077 --> 01:44:42,197
I think about the time I started, um

2176
01:44:42,197 --> 01:44:46,157
there was a famous incident where you punched a wall and they framed the hole.

2177
01:44:46,157 --> 01:44:47,057
I did.

2178
01:44:47,057 --> 01:44:48,357
That was at the- But I don't know what's that about.

2179
01:44:48,357 --> 01:44:50,297
 That was at the 25th anniversary.

2180
01:44:50,297 --> 01:44:51,410
I had, I brought in the.

2181
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:51,537
..

2182
01:44:51,537 --> 01:44:53,037
I still have that.

2183
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:53,697
The drywall?

2184
01:44:53,697 --> 01:44:57,897
Yeah, that was NT, uh, System52.

2185
01:44:57,897 --> 01:45:01,497
That was an argument that I was having.

2186
01:45:01,497 --> 01:45:05,457
We were having some stressful moments about the debugger

2187
01:45:05,457 --> 01:45:14,777
and the debugger not being very functional, and work didn't seem to be progressing very fast

2188
01:45:14,777 --> 01:45:18,217
uh, definitely not progressing at the speed that I thought it should be progressing at.

2189
01:45:18,217 --> 01:45:21,277
And I was having this argument, I think it was with Brian Willman

2190
01:45:21,277 --> 01:45:24,317
in one of the corridors in building two

2191
01:45:24,317 --> 01:45:33,477
and I said something in, uh, or he said something that really ticked me off and I went wham like that.

2192
01:45:33,477 --> 01:45:35,337
It's a good thing I didn't have the two-by-four.

2193
01:45:35,337 --> 01:45:36,877
I hit between the, and they're metal

2194
01:45:36,877 --> 01:45:37,157
you know?

2195
01:45:37,157 --> 01:45:38,097
 Yeah.

2196
01:45:38,097 --> 01:45:40,037
So I hit between them and yeah, it went through the wall.

2197
01:45:40,037 --> 01:45:46,657
So unfortunate that a lot of the code that I wrote back in the day still lives on in the code today.

2198
01:45:46,657 --> 01:45:48,177
And I don't know how common that is.

2199
01:45:48,177 --> 01:45:50,003
How much do you think of NT 3.

2200
01:45:50,003 --> 01:45:52,157
5 is still in Windows 11 today?

2201
01:45:52,157 --> 01:45:53,037
A lot.

2202
01:45:53,037 --> 01:45:54,397
'Cause I mean, it's growing a lot- Well- .

2203
01:45:54,397 --> 01:45:54,397
..

2204
01:45:54,397 --> 01:45:57,057
but the core pieces still- The, of the original code

2205
01:45:57,057 --> 01:46:00,717
of the same functions that the original code did

2206
01:46:00,717 --> 01:46:04,917
I would say, you know, it's 80%.

2207
01:46:04,917 --> 01:46:05,357
Okay.

2208
01:46:05,357 --> 01:46:06,477
It's very high.

2209
01:46:06,477 --> 01:46:06,777
Right.

2210
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,457
But there's a lot of added stuff.

2211
01:46:08,457 --> 01:46:08,817
Yeah.

2212
01:46:08,817 --> 01:46:13,217
Um, there's a lot more stuff added around security.

2213
01:46:13,217 --> 01:46:16,057
There's a lot more stuff added around management.

2214
01:46:16,057 --> 01:46:19,257
Uh, there's a lot more s- stuff added around

2215
01:46:19,257 --> 01:46:21,557
um, just building the system.

2216
01:46:21,557 --> 01:46:28,677
Um, you know, what you remember of build is gone-zo.

2217
01:46:28,677 --> 01:46:34,337
I mean, it's, um, it's become a system of its own.

2218
01:46:34,337 --> 01:46:35,077
 Really?

2219
01:46:35,077 --> 01:46:37,957
Um, so a lot of it's still there.

2220
01:46:37,957 --> 01:46:40,257
You know, the kernel code, memory management code.

2221
01:46:40,257 --> 01:46:42,677
Uh, Landy, you know Landy Wang probably?

2222
01:46:42,677 --> 01:46:42,917
Mm-hmm.

2223
01:46:42,917 --> 01:46:48,857
Landy manages to probably pretty much rewrite memory management about once every three years.

2224
01:46:48,857 --> 01:46:52,817
But there's a lot of memory management functionality that's

2225
01:46:52,817 --> 01:46:56,997
that's new, um, that's all been done since then.

2226
01:46:56,997 --> 01:47:03,797
But the basic, uh, structure and the basic code from the beginning is still there.

2227
01:47:03,797 --> 01:47:07,317
Um, the process structure's still there.

2228
01:47:07,317 --> 01:47:08,677
The kernel's still there.

2229
01:47:08,677 --> 01:47:12,337
Um, there's s- been a lot of stuff added around

2230
01:47:12,337 --> 01:47:16,577
um, there's some stuff ar- added around for- uh

2231
01:47:16,577 --> 01:47:21,477
fairness in scheduling, um, and some other things.

2232
01:47:21,477 --> 01:47:23,017
And of course, there's more objects.

2233
01:47:23,017 --> 01:47:30,277
Um, I think one of the things I think made NT such a good code base was the object manager

2234
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:32,437
and that has not changed.

2235
01:47:32,437 --> 01:47:36,157
Um, if you look at Unix, you know

2236
01:47:36,157 --> 01:47:37,257
everything's a file.

2237
01:47:37,257 --> 01:47:39,817
You want to extend the operating system?

2238
01:47:39,817 --> 01:47:41,197
Create a new file system.

2239
01:47:41,197 --> 01:47:44,437
Not a good thing.

2240
01:47:44,437 --> 01:47:44,837
Right.

2241
01:47:44,837 --> 01:47:47,797
I mean, there's even, you can even read papers that some of the

2242
01:47:47,797 --> 01:47:50,797
the grandy, grand, the grand poobahs of the

2243
01:47:50,797 --> 01:47:54,977
the academic world say, "You know, maybe we were wrong.

2244
01:47:54,977 --> 01:47:56,853
Maybe everything isn't a file.

2245
01:47:56,853 --> 01:48:00,797
" Anyway, creating object is easy, you know?

2246
01:48:00,797 --> 01:48:02,977
You just have to build an object-type descriptor

2247
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:08,977
integrate it into the object manager, and presto esto and write a few services and there it is.

2248
01:48:08,977 --> 01:48:12,077
You have a new object, and that object can

2249
01:48:12,077 --> 01:48:14,917
can provide synchronization, it can provide a lot of things

2250
01:48:14,917 --> 01:48:15,237
right?

2251
01:48:15,237 --> 01:48:18,937
Um, so I think that was a

2252
01:48:18,937 --> 01:48:23,337
um, just a really great, um, underlying

2253
01:48:23,337 --> 01:48:28,637
uh, structure that went into the operating system that

2254
01:48:28,637 --> 01:48:29,677
that's lived on.

2255
01:48:29,677 --> 01:48:32,857
Um, you know, we've rewritten a lot of things.

2256
01:48:32,857 --> 01:48:35,297
The handle table has been rewritten several times.

2257
01:48:35,297 --> 01:48:36,917
I don't think we've done that lately, but

2258
01:48:36,917 --> 01:48:42,477
uh, you wouldn't think that handle translation would be a per- performance thing

2259
01:48:42,477 --> 01:48:43,177
but it is.

2260
01:48:43,177 --> 01:48:43,417
Mm-hmm.

2261
01:48:43,417 --> 01:48:44,677
It's a real performance thing.

2262
01:48:44,677 --> 01:48:47,617
And, and, you know, typically you run a system

2263
01:48:47,617 --> 01:48:51,257
like my system at work runs with, I don't know

2264
01:48:51,257 --> 01:48:54,077
like 60 processes and, you know, I don't know

2265
01:48:54,077 --> 01:49:00,051
um, a couple hundred threads, and 150

2266
01:49:00,051 --> 01:49:01,257
000 handles are open.

2267
01:49:01,257 --> 01:49:04,677
That means there's 150,000 objects- Right.

2268
01:49:04,677 --> 01:49:04,757
.

2269
01:49:04,757 --> 01:49:04,917
..

2270
01:49:04,917 --> 01:49:07,797
in the operating system that are being tracked.

2271
01:49:07,797 --> 01:49:11,017
They all have security, um, you know

2272
01:49:11,017 --> 01:49:12,657
have access protection.

2273
01:49:12,657 --> 01:49:16,437
Um, so anyway, though a lot of the code is still there

2274
01:49:16,437 --> 01:49:19,917
um, but a, a whole bunch of stuff is

2275
01:49:19,917 --> 01:49:22,657
keeps getting added, um, a lot of stuff.

2276
01:49:22,657 --> 01:49:27,597
So the, of the original code, I

2277
01:49:27,597 --> 01:49:35,877
you know, I bet you the original code is not a large percentage of the total code.

2278
01:49:35,877 --> 01:49:37,817
Right, right, right.

2279
01:49:37,817 --> 01:49:39,105
But if you took the total code.

2280
01:49:39,105 --> 01:49:39,277
..

2281
01:49:39,277 --> 01:49:40,637
Yeah, no, it's gonna be a small

2282
01:49:40,637 --> 01:49:41,477
tiny percentage, yeah.

2283
01:49:41,477 --> 01:49:42,797
It's just, it's, 'cause it keeps going down- Yeah.

2284
01:49:42,797 --> 01:49:42,803
.

2285
01:49:42,803 --> 01:49:42,817
..

2286
01:49:42,817 --> 01:49:44,597
'cause all this stuff gets added.

2287
01:49:44,597 --> 01:49:48,637
But it's like the, the one thing I always like to use as an example

2288
01:49:48,637 --> 01:49:52,277
the original task manager compiles to 85K and now it's four megabytes

2289
01:49:52,277 --> 01:49:54,759
and it does more than it did but not-.

2290
01:49:54,759 --> 01:49:55,129
..

2291
01:49:55,129 --> 01:49:56,130
many multiples of times better.

2292
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:58,889
You sh- The task manager, I, my system

2293
01:49:58,889 --> 01:50:01,269
I have two, I have two, um

2294
01:50:01,269 --> 01:50:03,769
AMD Ryzen Threadrippers.

2295
01:50:03,769 --> 01:50:07,189
And one of them is smaller than the other one.

2296
01:50:07,189 --> 01:50:12,709
The small one is 64 cores with 130

2297
01:50:12,709 --> 01:50:13,970
128 threads.

2298
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:19,429
The other one is 96 cores with 192 threads.

2299
01:50:19,429 --> 01:50:23,369
You should see what the task manager puts up for the

2300
01:50:23,369 --> 01:50:26,349
you know, the per CPU utilization.

2301
01:50:26,349 --> 01:50:29,209
It's, it, it's unviewable.

2302
01:50:29,209 --> 01:50:31,409
I mean, you can't s- It's just all

2303
01:50:31,409 --> 01:50:34,289
you know, it's all these little boxes with all these things going up and down.

2304
01:50:34,289 --> 01:50:34,629
Right.

2305
01:50:34,629 --> 01:50:38,069
You can only really look at the overall performance.

2306
01:50:38,069 --> 01:50:41,529
Or if they, I, there's no option to say

2307
01:50:41,529 --> 01:50:43,910
you know, "Take this group of eight over here.

2308
01:50:43,910 --> 01:50:46,422
You know, put those together and sort them.

2309
01:50:46,422 --> 01:50:48,789
" Yeah, you'd think you could heat map it or do some kind of visualization- Maybe you can.

2310
01:50:48,789 --> 01:50:48,795
.

2311
01:50:48,795 --> 01:50:48,809
..

2312
01:50:48,809 --> 01:50:49,589
that was useful, but.

2313
01:50:49,589 --> 01:50:51,669
Well, there's, but there's also a lot of other things

2314
01:50:51,669 --> 01:50:51,889
too.

2315
01:50:51,889 --> 01:50:54,409
There's, there used to be on the task manager

2316
01:50:54,409 --> 01:50:56,389
used to be the network stuff and the CPU stuff

2317
01:50:56,389 --> 01:50:59,009
but now there's the, there's disc and there's other stuff

2318
01:50:59,009 --> 01:50:59,389
so.

2319
01:50:59,389 --> 01:51:03,749
People often ask about Longhorn.

2320
01:51:03,749 --> 01:51:06,369
And I believe that was the precursor to Vista

2321
01:51:06,369 --> 01:51:08,590
or became Vista, or it was along the way to Vista.

2322
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:10,789
Well, there's a lot, there's a, there's a

2323
01:51:10,789 --> 01:51:13,709
there's a big story behind that.

2324
01:51:13,709 --> 01:51:14,210
Okay.

2325
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:15,969
Let's hear it.

2326
01:51:15,969 --> 01:51:26,369
 So when we finished Windows 2000, Windows 2000 was done on the co-same code base as

2327
01:51:26,369 --> 01:51:30,209
well, I'm sorry, the work station and the server were the same code base.

2328
01:51:30,209 --> 01:51:34,409
So we went off to plan the next system.

2329
01:51:34,409 --> 01:51:42,049
And the guy that's gonna do the work station is Chris Jones

2330
01:51:42,049 --> 01:51:46,609
and the guys that are planning the server is Dave Thompson's group.

2331
01:51:46,609 --> 01:51:51,429
And they come back and say, "Thompson says it's gonna take

2332
01:51:51,429 --> 01:51:57,964
it's gonna take, uh, three years for us to do the next server version.

2333
01:51:57,964 --> 01:52:02,399
" And Chris says, "Oh, I can't live with that.

2334
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:06,169
" He says, "Consumers don't expect the quality that

2335
01:52:06,169 --> 01:52:08,289
that the server people do.

2336
01:52:08,289 --> 01:52:10,305
We can do it in a year and a half.

2337
01:52:10,305 --> 01:52:15,169
" So, we said, "Well, we can't

2338
01:52:15,169 --> 01:52:16,377
can't do that, right?

2339
01:52:16,377 --> 01:52:19,349
" We, so thereupon we split the code base.

2340
01:52:19,349 --> 01:52:24,549
The server went one way and the consumer vision went the other way.

2341
01:52:24,549 --> 01:52:31,889
It wasn't long before the consumer software hardly would build and hardly would run.

2342
01:52:31,889 --> 01:52:37,429
In the meantime, the server branch, we fixed a whole bunch of server

2343
01:52:37,429 --> 01:52:39,009
I'm sorry, security problems.

2344
01:52:39,009 --> 01:52:39,369
Right.

2345
01:52:39,369 --> 01:52:40,369
A whole bunch.

2346
01:52:40,369 --> 01:52:43,169
And, uh, we might even done some security update

2347
01:52:43,169 --> 01:52:45,709
but there was a lot of stuff that went into the server

2348
01:52:45,709 --> 01:52:52,349
um, effort to fix security bugs, and none of that stuff was fixed in the other one.

2349
01:52:52,349 --> 01:53:00,409
Well, we finally shipped XP, and XP was wildly successful

2350
01:53:00,409 --> 01:53:04,269
uh, but then, but it was buggy.

2351
01:53:04,269 --> 01:53:08,229
But then there was a big, um

2352
01:53:08,229 --> 01:53:10,449
turmoil about security.

2353
01:53:10,449 --> 01:53:19,209
And that's about when the, um, the buffer overflow attacks started.

2354
01:53:19,209 --> 01:53:19,449
Right.

2355
01:53:19,449 --> 01:53:24,489
And so we stopped.

2356
01:53:24,489 --> 01:53:24,649
..

2357
01:53:24,649 --> 01:53:28,469
And in fact, the other thing was as soon as they shipped

2358
01:53:28,469 --> 01:53:33,309
um, XP, that became the code base for Longhorn

2359
01:53:33,309 --> 01:53:34,389
which was Vista.

2360
01:53:34,389 --> 01:53:40,209
So they're continuing on with this buggy code base without all those security fixes in it

2361
01:53:40,209 --> 01:53:45,989
and the server division basically is developing the server stuff

2362
01:53:45,989 --> 01:53:50,349
and, but fixing security problems.

2363
01:53:50,349 --> 01:53:53,249
And in the meantime, in the middle of this

2364
01:53:53,249 --> 01:53:56,409
in the middle of this, sort of somewhere in here

2365
01:53:56,409 --> 01:54:00,069
I start this project that's a, uh

2366
01:54:00,069 --> 01:54:07,309
it's a, uh, off on the side that is the

2367
01:54:07,309 --> 01:54:08,929
um, x64 stuff.

2368
01:54:08,929 --> 01:54:09,449
Okay.

2369
01:54:09,449 --> 01:54:14,269
So AMD comes in and talks to us and talks to Rob Short and I

2370
01:54:14,269 --> 01:54:34,093
and says, "You know, um, we have some ideas on how to build 64 bits extensions to the x86 that will be very less intrusive and will allow us to run 32 bit applications at speed on the 64 bit machine.

2371
01:54:34,093 --> 01:54:36,509
" We said, "Geez, that's pretty interesting.

2372
01:54:36,509 --> 01:54:37,513
What have you got?

2373
01:54:37,513 --> 01:54:39,131
" "Well, we've got just a few ideas.

2374
01:54:39,131 --> 01:54:40,189
" And then we said, "Well, you know

2375
01:54:40,189 --> 01:54:42,659
go away and come back and tell us what you wanna do.

2376
01:54:42,659 --> 01:54:45,349
" So they come back and we look at it and say

2377
01:54:45,349 --> 01:54:46,629
"This is great.

2378
01:54:46,629 --> 01:54:47,586
This is great.

2379
01:54:47,586 --> 01:54:49,349
" I mean, it's, like, unbelievable.

2380
01:54:49,349 --> 01:54:52,052
So I said, "Hey, we're gonna do this.

2381
01:54:52,052 --> 01:54:54,649
" So we just set out to do this.

2382
01:54:54,649 --> 01:54:57,309
This, this is not a company-annointed project at all.

2383
01:54:57,309 --> 01:55:01,169
And I say, "We're using the server code base

2384
01:55:01,169 --> 01:55:06,761
and we're gonna produce a 64 bit work station and we're gonna produce a 64 bit server.

2385
01:55:06,761 --> 01:55:11,549
" Meantime, we got Longhorn over here still going

2386
01:55:11,549 --> 01:55:15,909
and its name is now morphed into Does it Matterhorn.

2387
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:16,669
Right.

2388
01:55:16,669 --> 01:55:19,089
So it becomes Does it Matterhorn.

2389
01:55:19,089 --> 01:55:22,449
And Alton, of course, he's my boss

2390
01:55:22,449 --> 01:55:25,009
and he's running Longhorn.

2391
01:55:25,009 --> 01:55:30,969
I mean, he's responsible for that, and I'm running this x64 thing

2392
01:55:30,969 --> 01:55:34,229
and the server group is, is, you know

2393
01:55:34,229 --> 01:55:37,249
they're, they're off, they're shipping a system

2394
01:55:37,249 --> 01:55:38,529
and we're just using their code base.

2395
01:55:38,529 --> 01:55:51,329
Well, we build, um, we get the x64 system running well enough

2396
01:55:51,329 --> 01:56:00,029
we get everything ported, and we have a simulator that allows us to simulate setup.

2397
01:56:00,029 --> 01:56:00,735
..

2398
01:56:00,735 --> 01:56:02,209
. and we simulate setup.

2399
01:56:02,209 --> 01:56:05,809
It takes 24 hours, 24 hours.

2400
01:56:05,809 --> 01:56:07,970
The simulator's called SIM Now.

2401
01:56:07,970 --> 01:56:12,049
And AMD finally ships us a system.

2402
01:56:12,049 --> 01:56:16,869
It arrives at 12 noon, and they say

2403
01:56:16,869 --> 01:56:17,639
"There it is.

2404
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:19,389
" And we got a CD.

2405
01:56:19,389 --> 01:56:24,089
And we walk over to that machine, plug the CD in

2406
01:56:24,089 --> 01:56:25,950
and boot the 64-bit system.

2407
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:30,389
The first time it's ever been tried, and it boots and runs

2408
01:56:30,389 --> 01:56:34,429
and it runs, and it doesn't fall over and bug check.

2409
01:56:34,429 --> 01:56:39,329
So this sort of piqued the interest a little bit at that point

2410
01:56:39,329 --> 01:56:48,564
and, um, we get reliable enough that we actually convince Microsoft.

2411
01:56:48,564 --> 01:56:53,849
com, that website, to switch over to our 64-bit server

2412
01:56:53,849 --> 01:56:55,689
and they run it.

2413
01:56:55,689 --> 01:56:58,329
They only have to run it about a week and they switch everything.

2414
01:56:58,329 --> 01:56:58,870
Really?

2415
01:56:58,870 --> 01:57:00,770
And, and you know why they switched?

2416
01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:01,427
It became.

2417
01:57:01,427 --> 01:57:01,569
..

2418
01:57:01,569 --> 01:57:05,769
it was so immensely more reliable than the 32-bit stuff

2419
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:07,189
they just switched like that.

2420
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:11,141
And the reason was that their software.

2421
01:57:11,141 --> 01:57:11,309
..

2422
01:57:11,309 --> 01:57:12,490
I got cramps in my legs.

2423
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:16,550
The software has got so many memory leaks in it

2424
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:24,649
that on a 32-bit system, they keep leaking memory until eventually they got the virtual memories all filled- Right.

2425
01:57:24,649 --> 01:57:24,702
.

2426
01:57:24,702 --> 01:57:24,809
..

2427
01:57:24,809 --> 01:57:26,169
and then they have to roll over.

2428
01:57:26,169 --> 01:57:28,969
The 64-bit system, it took a long time.

2429
01:57:28,969 --> 01:57:31,506
So we had Microsoft.

2430
01:57:31,506 --> 01:57:32,410
com running on it.

2431
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:35,309
So we got to a point where the

2432
01:57:35,309 --> 01:57:40,570
the, the guys just couldn't get Longhorn or Doesn't-Matter-Horn out of the build lab.

2433
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:44,450
And I told Alton, I said, "This is just baloney.

2434
01:57:44,450 --> 01:57:49,109
You guys should switch the codebase to the x64 codebase.

2435
01:57:49,109 --> 01:57:52,089
" And eventually that's what we did.

2436
01:57:52,089 --> 01:57:55,209
So you unified them back again, so the server worked- Well- .

2437
01:57:55,209 --> 01:57:55,249
..

2438
01:57:55,249 --> 01:57:55,509
super all the same?

2439
01:57:55,509 --> 01:57:55,516
.

2440
01:57:55,516 --> 01:57:55,530
..

2441
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:56,667
and I mean, I, I should.

2442
01:57:56,667 --> 01:57:56,769
..

2443
01:57:56,769 --> 01:57:58,389
We left, I left out one thing.

2444
01:57:58,389 --> 01:58:02,290
We stopped in the middle of this, this

2445
01:58:02,290 --> 01:58:05,710
in the middle of th- th- we didn't actually stop the 64-bit effort

2446
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:11,710
but, but the 64-bit effort is mainly we're just porting stuff to get it run 64 bits

2447
01:58:11,710 --> 01:58:12,969
and we didn't have to port everything.

2448
01:58:12,969 --> 01:58:17,849
It was much like back in the days of VAX where all the 30-bit stuff just ran.

2449
01:58:17,849 --> 01:58:20,809
Your, your task manager just ran.

2450
01:58:20,809 --> 01:58:22,509
Didn't have to change a thing.

2451
01:58:22,509 --> 01:58:25,449
The only thing that changes in the task manager was

2452
01:58:25,449 --> 01:58:29,229
um, where it said what your process list was

2453
01:58:29,229 --> 01:58:33,909
I put an asterisk in so it could tell whether it was a 32-bit or- Okay.

2454
01:58:33,909 --> 01:58:33,915
.

2455
01:58:33,915 --> 01:58:33,929
..

2456
01:58:33,929 --> 01:58:34,869
a 64-bit one.

2457
01:58:34,869 --> 01:58:36,150
It's the only thing we changed.

2458
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:39,429
So in the middle of this, though

2459
01:58:39,429 --> 01:58:42,989
the, the security of, of XP got so bad

2460
01:58:42,989 --> 01:58:46,609
we had to actually stop and fix XP bugs.

2461
01:58:46,609 --> 01:58:48,933
And we fixed a lot of.

2462
01:58:48,933 --> 01:58:48,989
..

2463
01:58:48,989 --> 01:58:50,685
uh, my, my group fixed like 5

2464
01:58:50,685 --> 01:58:52,150
000 of those.

2465
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:53,790
And we went through everything, and we

2466
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:56,929
we turned over some code that, you know

2467
01:58:56,929 --> 01:58:58,989
like a shovel you turn over manure.

2468
01:58:58,989 --> 01:59:05,789
Uh, I think the worst code I probably looked at was the IME code that was done in Japan.

2469
01:59:05,789 --> 01:59:06,489
Oh, okay.

2470
01:59:06,489 --> 01:59:10,409
Just, just terrible.

2471
01:59:10,409 --> 01:59:15,149
Like, just no regard for any bugs at all and any bug condition

2472
01:59:15,149 --> 01:59:17,009
they just, "Oh, okay, that's bad.

2473
01:59:17,009 --> 01:59:18,569
Okay, we'll just skip that then, you know

2474
01:59:18,569 --> 01:59:19,443
just keep going.

2475
01:59:19,443 --> 01:59:23,009
" So there were actually overflowed bugs we couldn't fix.

2476
01:59:23,009 --> 01:59:25,269
We just couldn't fix them, you know?

2477
01:59:25,269 --> 01:59:28,089
We, we tried to mitigate them as best we could

2478
01:59:28,089 --> 01:59:29,249
but we couldn't fix them.

2479
01:59:29,249 --> 01:59:32,969
But anyway, we c- there was a release of XP that was a

2480
01:59:32,969 --> 01:59:33,989
it was an update.

2481
01:59:33,989 --> 01:59:38,829
It was like a 250 megabyte- Okay.

2482
01:59:38,829 --> 01:59:38,849
.

2483
01:59:38,849 --> 01:59:38,889
..

2484
01:59:38,889 --> 01:59:39,269
dump.

2485
01:59:39,269 --> 01:59:43,249
And then they switched the codebase for, um

2486
01:59:43,249 --> 01:59:48,289
Longhorn to the x64 codebase, and that's the codebase we're on today.

2487
01:59:48,289 --> 01:59:51,169
And everything is still unified now?

2488
01:59:51,169 --> 01:59:52,489
Everything's unified.

2489
01:59:52,489 --> 01:59:53,949
What about the stuff that went to Xbox?

2490
01:59:53,949 --> 01:59:59,109
I don't know much about Xbox technically, but I know that it runs a hypervisor that's similar to what goes on in NT.

2491
01:59:59,109 --> 02:00:01,029
Is there code shared or just ideas?

2492
02:00:01,029 --> 02:00:08,169
Uh, well, the, the hypervisor for Xbox came from Red Dog.

2493
02:00:08,169 --> 02:00:14,609
And Red Dog is the hypervisor that was developed for Azure.

2494
02:00:14,609 --> 02:00:20,149
Um, when we shipped the 64-bit system

2495
02:00:20,149 --> 02:00:22,600
we shipped it on Friday.

2496
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:22,729
..

2497
02:00:22,729 --> 02:00:24,709
on Thursday, I quit on s- I quit.

2498
02:00:24,709 --> 02:00:27,489
I sent mail to Bomber on Friday, said

2499
02:00:27,489 --> 02:00:29,529
"I quit," because it was so bad.

2500
02:00:29,529 --> 02:00:31,089
I had such a problem.

2501
02:00:31,089 --> 02:00:34,109
I couldn't get any traction on FCIBs.

2502
02:00:34,109 --> 02:00:36,489
Do you know what FCIB is?

2503
02:00:36,489 --> 02:00:36,869
Do not.

2504
02:00:36,869 --> 02:00:39,109
An FCIB is a fucking checked-in binary.

2505
02:00:39,109 --> 02:00:50,929
 And the reason that it's called a fucking checked-in binary is because we had all sorts of groups at Microsoft that checked the binary in rather than the sources

2506
02:00:50,929 --> 02:00:53,009
so it made it very difficult to port stuff

2507
02:00:53,009 --> 02:00:55,249
and it was stuff that was in the product.

2508
02:00:55,249 --> 02:00:55,749
Right.

2509
02:00:55,749 --> 02:01:03,949
And so, I was so fed up with not being able to get support from Bill to obliterate this stuff and say

2510
02:01:03,949 --> 02:01:06,509
"Hey, you guys have got to get your sources in.

2511
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:08,029
You don't have to port it.

2512
02:01:08,029 --> 02:01:11,139
We'll have somebody else port it, but you got to get your sources in.

2513
02:01:11,139 --> 02:01:14,922
" So I quit, and I, I'm gone for.

2514
02:01:14,922 --> 02:01:15,089
..

2515
02:01:15,089 --> 02:01:17,149
Uh, Bomber sends me mail and says

2516
02:01:17,149 --> 02:01:19,709
"I don't think you ought to quit.

2517
02:01:19,709 --> 02:01:21,769
Why don't you take some vacation and think about it?

2518
02:01:21,769 --> 02:01:24,331
" So I answered and said, "Okay.

2519
02:01:24,331 --> 02:01:29,969
" That was March 28th of 2005.

2520
02:01:29,969 --> 02:01:34,689
In November of 2005, it started to get.

2521
02:01:34,689 --> 02:01:34,749
..

2522
02:01:34,749 --> 02:01:36,185
the weather was bad so I had to.

2523
02:01:36,185 --> 02:01:36,329
..

2524
02:01:36,329 --> 02:01:40,029
I didn't have anything to do anymore, so I  came back to work.

2525
02:01:40,029 --> 02:01:44,269
And, and I think February I went to work on Azure.

2526
02:01:44,269 --> 02:01:50,181
And Azure was the, the, uh, premise.

2527
02:01:50,181 --> 02:01:50,269
..

2528
02:01:50,269 --> 02:01:53,929
Azure was, um, sponsored by, uh

2529
02:01:53,929 --> 02:01:57,149
Ray Ozzie, who was the software architect of the company.

2530
02:01:57,149 --> 02:01:58,169
Uh, do you remember Ray?

2531
02:01:58,169 --> 02:01:58,869
Probably not.

2532
02:01:58,869 --> 02:01:59,969
Ray Ozzie?

2533
02:01:59,969 --> 02:02:00,749
Ray Ozzie.

2534
02:02:00,749 --> 02:02:04,423
By name, but that's about it.

2535
02:02:04,423 --> 02:02:05,472
..

2536
02:02:05,472 --> 02:02:08,298
. anyway, it, Ray looked around and

2537
02:02:08,298 --> 02:02:13,378
and w- we had all these properties that were producing cl- cloud-based stuff

2538
02:02:13,378 --> 02:02:19,357
but there's no, there's no infrastructure, platform inst- infrastructure to work on.

2539
02:02:19,357 --> 02:02:20,957
How do you deploy the applications?

2540
02:02:20,957 --> 02:02:23,057
How do you do configuration control?

2541
02:02:23,057 --> 02:02:24,297
What version is running?

2542
02:02:24,297 --> 02:02:26,618
How do you do restarts and all sorts of stuff?

2543
02:02:26,618 --> 02:02:32,837
So, he talked Bomber into, and, and Gates into starting this project

2544
02:02:32,837 --> 02:02:35,698
which became, was called Red Dog, which be- eventually came

2545
02:02:35,698 --> 02:02:37,877
um, Azure.

2546
02:02:37,877 --> 02:02:42,798
And so, this was gonna involve virtualization.

2547
02:02:42,798 --> 02:02:46,737
Um, so this is at the same time that

2548
02:02:46,737 --> 02:02:49,697
you know, we, we, I bought a company called Connectix.

2549
02:02:49,697 --> 02:02:50,798
Right.

2550
02:02:50,798 --> 02:02:53,977
And Connectix came to Microsoft with two products.

2551
02:02:53,977 --> 02:02:56,517
One was called Virtual PC and the other one Virtual Server.

2552
02:02:56,517 --> 02:03:01,197
And they had started development of a hypervisor

2553
02:03:01,197 --> 02:03:06,157
and we, we actually took their, whe- where they were at at that time

2554
02:03:06,157 --> 02:03:11,097
which they were very embryonic, and we built a hypervisor to bring Azure up with.

2555
02:03:11,097 --> 02:03:18,737
And when I left Azure to go to work on the Xbox

2556
02:03:18,737 --> 02:03:27,497
um, eh, uh, the Red Dog hypervisor became the basis for the

2557
02:03:27,497 --> 02:03:29,817
um, Xbox hypervisor.

2558
02:03:29,817 --> 02:03:30,177
Okay.

2559
02:03:30,177 --> 02:03:30,737
All right?

2560
02:03:30,737 --> 02:03:39,917
So, the Xbox, the, the structure of Xbox is we really run t- three different co- copies of operating systems.

2561
02:03:39,917 --> 02:03:43,617
We, and we run in three, we run just three VMs.

2562
02:03:43,617 --> 02:03:47,317
We, n- like, in Azure we run hundreds of VMs.

2563
02:03:47,317 --> 02:03:50,277
You, you spawn VMs, you, you know

2564
02:03:50,277 --> 02:03:51,477
you spin 'em up.

2565
02:03:51,477 --> 02:03:57,477
And Azure was all about th- the platform and building all the infrastructure to

2566
02:03:57,477 --> 02:04:01,437
to provision new machines, bring 'em online

2567
02:04:01,437 --> 02:04:03,177
keep track of 'em, do the billing

2568
02:04:03,177 --> 02:04:06,317
the, the, uh, the cloud file system

2569
02:04:06,317 --> 02:04:07,317
just all s- that stuff.

2570
02:04:07,317 --> 02:04:08,637
It was called PaaS.

2571
02:04:08,637 --> 02:04:13,397
And we thought that everybody was just, that was what they wanted.

2572
02:04:13,397 --> 02:04:20,057
And, and what, um, AWS was serving up was IaaS infrastructures.

2573
02:04:20,057 --> 02:04:24,517
So, on, on Amazon, you actually bought

2574
02:04:24,517 --> 02:04:26,977
basically, a virtual CPU.

2575
02:04:26,977 --> 02:04:32,269
We were saying, "We're gonna sell you the stuff that allows you to deploy things

2576
02:04:32,269 --> 02:04:32,597
" right?

2577
02:04:32,597 --> 02:04:34,997
You can run, you can deploy a s- uh

2578
02:04:34,997 --> 02:04:41,797
an operating system, and you can deploy your applications and keep track of them and do billing and all this stuff.

2579
02:04:41,797 --> 02:04:47,457
So anyway, going, stepping back to, to Xbox again

2580
02:04:47,457 --> 02:04:50,617
we, we, we're only running three VMs.

2581
02:04:50,617 --> 02:04:51,173
We're running.

2582
02:04:51,173 --> 02:04:51,277
..

2583
02:04:51,277 --> 02:04:53,337
we have two VMs that run all the time.

2584
02:04:53,337 --> 02:04:54,737
One is the host system.

2585
02:04:54,737 --> 02:04:57,237
The host system owns all the devices.

2586
02:04:57,237 --> 02:05:02,477
So all the hardware access to devices is in the host system.

2587
02:05:02,477 --> 02:05:08,317
The host system is also sort of the traffic cop for any communications between the VMs.

2588
02:05:08,317 --> 02:05:12,317
And we have, we have formal communication b- between the VMs as opposed to

2589
02:05:12,317 --> 02:05:14,601
to Azure where there's.

2590
02:05:14,601 --> 02:05:14,717
..

2591
02:05:14,717 --> 02:05:18,377
the only c- communication between VMs would be where you had

2592
02:05:18,377 --> 02:05:21,117
uh, actually a network connection to somebody through a VM.

2593
02:05:21,117 --> 02:05:23,237
You know, you don't have anything where you're not

2594
02:05:23,237 --> 02:05:25,477
you're not close as a, as an operating system.

2595
02:05:25,477 --> 02:05:29,697
So, we have one OS that runs

2596
02:05:29,697 --> 02:05:33,097
um, basically what you see is the presentation.

2597
02:05:33,097 --> 02:05:33,717
Right.

2598
02:05:33,717 --> 02:05:35,617
You see the windowing system.

2599
02:05:35,617 --> 02:05:37,597
The window manager runs there.

2600
02:05:37,597 --> 02:05:41,097
And then, and that one's, that one's

2601
02:05:41,097 --> 02:05:43,917
uh, running all the time, and the host system runs all the time.

2602
02:05:43,917 --> 02:05:45,457
And then we have a game VM.

2603
02:05:45,457 --> 02:05:49,417
And the game VM starts and stops all the time.

2604
02:05:49,417 --> 02:05:49,845
Is.

2605
02:05:49,845 --> 02:05:49,917
..

2606
02:05:49,917 --> 02:05:50,303
when you.

2607
02:05:50,303 --> 02:05:50,417
..

2608
02:05:50,417 --> 02:05:53,117
a g- a, a, a game is a VM.

2609
02:05:53,117 --> 02:05:53,557
Right.

2610
02:05:53,557 --> 02:05:58,437
So games got packaged, w- uh, with an OS.

2611
02:05:58,437 --> 02:06:03,077
So, and this is a f- this is a feature and not a feature.

2612
02:06:03,077 --> 02:06:10,577
It's a feature in the sense that you never have backward compatibility problems because you say

2613
02:06:10,577 --> 02:06:13,577
"Here is the OS that you can package your game with

2614
02:06:13,577 --> 02:06:17,317
the c- the current version of it, and it comes in a GDK

2615
02:06:17,317 --> 02:06:19,117
which is a graphics development kit.

2616
02:06:19,117 --> 02:06:24,797
" You develop and package your game with that stuff in that development kit.

2617
02:06:24,797 --> 02:06:28,310
"And when we run your game, we run that VM with your game.

2618
02:06:28,310 --> 02:06:32,277
" So, it always runs.

2619
02:06:32,277 --> 02:06:37,137
It never, the, we will never ov- obviate your game by some change in the operating system.

2620
02:06:37,137 --> 02:06:40,417
That sounds great.

2621
02:06:40,417 --> 02:06:42,477
W- Hard to update stuff.

2622
02:06:42,477 --> 02:06:42,857
Huh?

2623
02:06:42,857 --> 02:06:45,637
Hard to update stuff too if you can't modify it later.

2624
02:06:45,637 --> 02:06:46,192
You can't.

2625
02:06:46,192 --> 02:06:46,317
..

2626
02:06:46,317 --> 02:06:47,925
um, they're.

2627
02:06:47,925 --> 02:06:47,997
..

2628
02:06:47,997 --> 02:06:50,517
the update, you can do an update to your own stuff

2629
02:06:50,517 --> 02:06:52,417
and you have a choice.

2630
02:06:52,417 --> 02:06:55,397
Your choice is you can stay on with your old.

2631
02:06:55,397 --> 02:06:55,577
..

2632
02:06:55,577 --> 02:07:16,097
The place where that didn't work, and we actually ended up producing a universal game operating system for stuff that was prior to

2633
02:07:16,097 --> 02:07:18,717
uh, this latest Xbox, um.

2634
02:07:18,717 --> 02:07:18,957
..

2635
02:07:18,957 --> 02:07:21,517
what do we call?

2636
02:07:21,517 --> 02:07:22,897
K- Xbox X, I think?

2637
02:07:22,897 --> 02:07:23,717
Uh, not X.

2638
02:07:23,717 --> 02:07:29,877
I don't know, whatever console came out about five or four years ago.

2639
02:07:29,877 --> 02:07:31,017
One?

2640
02:07:31,017 --> 02:07:31,447
Yeah, X.

2641
02:07:31,447 --> 02:07:31,537
..

2642
02:07:31,537 --> 02:07:31,857
no.

2643
02:07:31,857 --> 02:07:32,517
Yeah, maybe it was.

2644
02:07:32,517 --> 02:07:32,737
It wasn't.

2645
02:07:32,737 --> 02:07:34,177
No, it was always called Xbox One

2646
02:07:34,177 --> 02:07:34,397
wasn't it?

2647
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:35,557
Yeah, Series X would be the newest

2648
02:07:35,557 --> 02:07:36,217
right, I think?

2649
02:07:36,217 --> 02:07:36,717
Yeah.

2650
02:07:36,717 --> 02:07:38,077
Is the Xbox One's the new one?

2651
02:07:38,077 --> 02:07:38,957
 I don't have one, I don't know.

2652
02:07:38,957 --> 02:07:41,597
Any- anyway, we came across a f- uh

2653
02:07:41,597 --> 02:07:47,137
a thing that we wanted to add a feature that was a very

2654
02:07:47,137 --> 02:07:57,717
uh, important feature for selling systems, and we had to find a way to get that feature into these old copies of these games.

2655
02:07:57,717 --> 02:07:59,857
That's what I meant by updating the existing

2656
02:07:59,857 --> 02:08:00,117
yeah.

2657
02:08:00,117 --> 02:08:03,137
Well, I thought you meant update like bug-fixing.

2658
02:08:03,137 --> 02:08:05,268
The bug-fixing is like.

2659
02:08:05,268 --> 02:08:05,377
..

2660
02:08:05,377 --> 02:08:10,157
if, if, if you wanna put a- out a bug fix thing

2661
02:08:10,157 --> 02:08:13,167
we will fi- we fix bugs on these GDKs.

2662
02:08:13,167 --> 02:08:13,571
..

2663
02:08:13,571 --> 02:08:15,493
. but you package your game again.

2664
02:08:15,493 --> 02:08:16,233
Oh, okay.

2665
02:08:16,233 --> 02:08:16,553
All right?

2666
02:08:16,553 --> 02:08:18,773
Your old one doesn't get the bug fix.

2667
02:08:18,773 --> 02:08:19,154
Okay.

2668
02:08:19,154 --> 02:08:19,833
That makes sense.

2669
02:08:19,833 --> 02:08:21,873
The guy's running the old one, he runs the old one.

2670
02:08:21,873 --> 02:08:22,934
All right?

2671
02:08:22,934 --> 02:08:25,333
So, this, this thing we, we did was

2672
02:08:25,333 --> 02:08:27,274
it's called pau- pause/resume.

2673
02:08:27,274 --> 02:08:33,913
And so on the Xbox, it takes forever to load a game because there's so much data.

2674
02:08:33,913 --> 02:08:36,553
I mean, there's gigabytes and gigabytes of data that come with it.

2675
02:08:36,553 --> 02:08:40,634
There's texture data, there's image format stuff

2676
02:08:40,634 --> 02:08:41,000
and all.

2677
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:41,094
..

2678
02:08:41,094 --> 02:08:41,893
just a bunch of stuff.

2679
02:08:41,893 --> 02:08:47,574
Well, pause/resume allows you to do basically a save of the VM

2680
02:08:47,574 --> 02:08:49,874
and then bring it back later.

2681
02:08:49,874 --> 02:08:54,653
Uh, so we had to get that into these

2682
02:08:54,653 --> 02:08:55,533
th- these systems.

2683
02:08:55,533 --> 02:09:03,353
So we produced this universal one, and the universal one's kinda interesting because one of the things we'd done was

2684
02:09:03,353 --> 02:09:04,273
uh.

2685
02:09:04,273 --> 02:09:04,353
..

2686
02:09:04,353 --> 02:09:07,293
The original NT had the capability for drivers to

2687
02:09:07,293 --> 02:09:13,573
to create system service dispatch tables, and of course some of them did.

2688
02:09:13,573 --> 02:09:17,053
And of course our original graphics, um

2689
02:09:17,053 --> 02:09:24,913
our ga- game VM had its own, and then several other releases had modifications to that.

2690
02:09:24,913 --> 02:09:33,893
So this universal OS has to translate all of the system service call numbers according to what the version is of the- Oh

2691
02:09:33,893 --> 02:09:34,153
okay.

2692
02:09:34,153 --> 02:09:34,159
.

2693
02:09:34,159 --> 02:09:34,173
..

2694
02:09:34,173 --> 02:09:35,973
th- the game was packaged with.

2695
02:09:35,973 --> 02:09:36,093
Right.

2696
02:09:36,093 --> 02:09:36,453
Anyway.

2697
02:09:36,453 --> 02:09:37,753
That's kind of a sidestep.

2698
02:09:37,753 --> 02:09:39,873
Anyway, that's the way the game runs.

2699
02:09:39,873 --> 02:09:45,433
Um, so, you know, you run a game and then you can

2700
02:09:45,433 --> 02:09:48,553
you can, um, just let it pause or

2701
02:09:48,553 --> 02:09:48,825
or.

2702
02:09:48,825 --> 02:09:48,993
..

2703
02:09:48,993 --> 02:09:50,493
I'm sorry, pause, sleep, or whatever

2704
02:09:50,493 --> 02:09:51,793
while you're not running a game.

2705
02:09:51,793 --> 02:09:57,913
Or you can start another game, and if you start another game then you actually kill off the VM and start another one.

2706
02:09:57,913 --> 02:09:58,233
So they.

2707
02:09:58,233 --> 02:09:58,313
..

2708
02:09:58,313 --> 02:10:01,444
So we started out with.

2709
02:10:01,444 --> 02:10:01,633
..

2710
02:10:01,633 --> 02:10:12,773
The whole system is Windows 8 based and we wanted that to be as minimal as we could make it.

2711
02:10:12,773 --> 02:10:15,953
So that one's really custom.

2712
02:10:15,953 --> 02:10:18,593
It's, you know, it's been hacked down.

2713
02:10:18,593 --> 02:10:21,433
But, you know, the basic  structure

2714
02:10:21,433 --> 02:10:25,533
the object manager's still there, events and all that stuff are still there

2715
02:10:25,533 --> 02:10:26,993
scheduling is still there.

2716
02:10:26,993 --> 02:10:31,233
Um, drivers fit into the system the way they did in

2717
02:10:31,233 --> 02:10:33,193
in, in circa that.

2718
02:10:33,193 --> 02:10:35,413
But there's a few more things that are there that

2719
02:10:35,413 --> 02:10:38,653
that allow for communication with the other VMs or cross

2720
02:10:38,653 --> 02:10:40,473
crossed VM, uh, stuff.

2721
02:10:40,473 --> 02:10:42,453
So that's Windows 8.

2722
02:10:42,453 --> 02:10:46,493
The, the one that has the, the

2723
02:10:46,493 --> 02:10:47,645
um, display.

2724
02:10:47,645 --> 02:10:47,813
..

2725
02:10:47,813 --> 02:10:55,753
Basically the window manager is, um, based on the current version of Windows.

2726
02:10:55,753 --> 02:10:56,353
Okay.

2727
02:10:56,353 --> 02:10:59,413
And it's based on it, right?

2728
02:10:59,413 --> 02:11:02,517
And we don't really.

2729
02:11:02,517 --> 02:11:02,673
..

2730
02:11:02,673 --> 02:11:08,353
There's some stuff replaced and stuff left out.

2731
02:11:08,353 --> 02:11:11,830
In the operating system itself it's.

2732
02:11:11,830 --> 02:11:12,013
..

2733
02:11:12,013 --> 02:11:17,433
there's a lot of conditionals, uh, conditional compilation to take out things that

2734
02:11:17,433 --> 02:11:20,393
uh, we just don't want in the Xbox op- operating system.

2735
02:11:20,393 --> 02:11:20,753
Okay.

2736
02:11:20,753 --> 02:11:24,713
Um, and so on the mirror of that

2737
02:11:24,713 --> 02:11:26,833
which is the VM that the games run in

2738
02:11:26,833 --> 02:11:28,933
is also Windows 11 based.

2739
02:11:28,933 --> 02:11:31,673
Um, and it has.

2740
02:11:31,673 --> 02:11:31,853
..

2741
02:11:31,853 --> 02:11:34,913
It's almost identical to the other one.

2742
02:11:34,913 --> 02:11:38,233
Uh, one of the things that's different is

2743
02:11:38,233 --> 02:11:44,933
um, they both interface with the graphics driver but it's not

2744
02:11:44,933 --> 02:11:46,153
it's not symmetric.

2745
02:11:46,153 --> 02:11:47,333
It's not uniform.

2746
02:11:47,333 --> 02:11:52,033
One side uses the Windows 11, uh

2747
02:11:52,033 --> 02:11:53,153
stack.

2748
02:11:53,153 --> 02:11:53,693
Okay.

2749
02:11:53,693 --> 02:11:58,633
And the other side uses a very highly customized DirectX stack.

2750
02:11:58,633 --> 02:12:00,653
So that's a little different.

2751
02:12:00,653 --> 02:12:03,213
And that's just mainly to make the graphics

2752
02:12:03,213 --> 02:12:04,593
uh, for the games run better.

2753
02:12:04,593 --> 02:12:07,813
So going back a little bit, a long ways back.

2754
02:12:07,813 --> 02:12:11,313
Back to high school, I'm told you had s- collected 16 varsity letters?

2755
02:12:11,313 --> 02:12:11,953
I did.

2756
02:12:11,953 --> 02:12:14,233
Is that really four varsity sports per year

2757
02:12:14,233 --> 02:12:14,733
every year- Yes.

2758
02:12:14,733 --> 02:12:14,733
.

2759
02:12:14,733 --> 02:12:14,733
.

2760
02:12:14,733 --> 02:12:15,373
for four years?

2761
02:12:15,373 --> 02:12:15,753
Yes.

2762
02:12:15,753 --> 02:12:16,233
Which four?

2763
02:12:16,233 --> 02:12:19,953
I did track, baseball, basketball, and football.

2764
02:12:19,953 --> 02:12:23,133
And did you go to college on an athletic scholarship

2765
02:12:23,133 --> 02:12:23,595
or- I went.

2766
02:12:23,595 --> 02:12:23,693
..

2767
02:12:23,693 --> 02:12:29,293
I had, uh, three quarters of my scholarship base was athletics and one quarter was academic.

2768
02:12:29,293 --> 02:12:36,813
And then at some point, s- Now I have a senior of my own who's quarterback for the team and he just blew out his appendix in week two

2769
02:12:36,813 --> 02:12:40,733
so he's got four weeks off, so he knows a little bit about the dreams deferred.

2770
02:12:40,733 --> 02:12:42,433
But you've damaged your knee at some point

2771
02:12:42,433 --> 02:12:42,913
did you not?

2772
02:12:42,913 --> 02:12:44,121
Uh, with.

2773
02:12:44,121 --> 02:12:44,253
..

2774
02:12:44,253 --> 02:12:44,913
after I.

2775
02:12:44,913 --> 02:12:45,073
..

2776
02:12:45,073 --> 02:12:46,333
Well, I was playing football.

2777
02:12:46,333 --> 02:12:50,577
Uh, actually, my first injury was, um.

2778
02:12:50,577 --> 02:12:50,793
..

2779
02:12:50,793 --> 02:12:52,643
What was my first.

2780
02:12:52,643 --> 02:12:52,713
..

2781
02:12:52,713 --> 02:12:58,873
My first injury was in football and I broke my leg.

2782
02:12:58,873 --> 02:13:04,753
And I b- I broke my fibula in October of my sophomore year

2783
02:13:04,753 --> 02:13:09,733
and, um, I actually ended up playing half of the game on a broken leg.

2784
02:13:09,733 --> 02:13:16,353
Um, the doctor we had was the team doctor

2785
02:13:16,353 --> 02:13:16,673
was.

2786
02:13:16,673 --> 02:13:16,833
..

2787
02:13:16,833 --> 02:13:20,733
This is, you know, 1961, 1962

2788
02:13:20,733 --> 02:13:26,473
and, um, not the kind of team doctors you necessarily have today- Right.

2789
02:13:26,473 --> 02:13:26,479
.

2790
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:26,493
..

2791
02:13:26,493 --> 02:13:27,673
with medical ex- expertise.

2792
02:13:27,673 --> 02:13:32,713
So, um, I came over to the sidelines and my

2793
02:13:32,713 --> 02:13:33,893
my leg really hurt.

2794
02:13:33,893 --> 02:13:37,873
And, you know, he's squeezing my ankle and saying

2795
02:13:37,873 --> 02:13:38,633
you know, "Does this hurt?

2796
02:13:38,633 --> 02:13:39,099
That hurt?

2797
02:13:39,099 --> 02:13:40,659
" And, uh, I said, "Nah, it's okay.

2798
02:13:40,659 --> 02:13:45,273
" And he looks at the coach and he says

2799
02:13:45,273 --> 02:13:46,565
"Do you really need this guy?

2800
02:13:46,565 --> 02:13:48,073
" And the coach says, "Oh, yeah.

2801
02:13:48,073 --> 02:13:48,460
He's.

2802
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:48,615
..

2803
02:13:48,615 --> 02:13:49,758
" He says, "Okay.

2804
02:13:49,758 --> 02:13:53,533
" So he opens up his case and he gets out a hypodermic and gives me a shot.

2805
02:13:53,533 --> 02:13:57,913
And so then they tape everything all up and they say

2806
02:13:57,913 --> 02:13:59,640
"Okay, go up and run down the sidelines.

2807
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:04,253
" So I, you know, tried to to- run up and down the sidelines and I said

2808
02:14:04,253 --> 02:14:08,181
"You know, this doesn't feel good enough for me to play or to run.

2809
02:14:08,181 --> 02:14:08,573
" Right.

2810
02:14:08,573 --> 02:14:12,053
And the doctor looks at the coach again and says

2811
02:14:12,053 --> 02:14:13,145
"Do you really need this guy?

2812
02:14:13,145 --> 02:14:14,821
" And they s- he says, "Yeah.

2813
02:14:14,821 --> 02:14:17,470
" So he gave me another shot.

2814
02:14:17,470 --> 02:14:19,361
So I went and played the rest of the half

2815
02:14:19,361 --> 02:14:24,870
and then at halftime, you know, this stuff wore off and it just.

2816
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:25,002
..

2817
02:14:25,002 --> 02:14:27,122
so there's no way I could play in the second half.

2818
02:14:27,122 --> 02:14:31,961
So the doctor says after the game, "Maybe we should go to the hospital and get this x-rated.

2819
02:14:31,961 --> 02:14:34,261
"  So it was, it was just a

2820
02:14:34,261 --> 02:14:36,961
a break in the, uh, the bottom of the fibula.

2821
02:14:36,961 --> 02:14:38,146
It just, um.

2822
02:14:38,146 --> 02:14:38,322
..

2823
02:14:38,322 --> 02:14:41,241
it seemed like it took forever to, to heal.

2824
02:14:41,241 --> 02:14:42,045
But anyway, it.

2825
02:14:42,045 --> 02:14:42,221
..

2826
02:14:42,221 --> 02:14:46,781
the following spring, I tore up my right knee playing basketball.

2827
02:14:46,781 --> 02:14:47,541
Okay.

2828
02:14:47,541 --> 02:14:52,361
And, um, in those days, um

2829
02:14:52,361 --> 02:14:55,482
anything that happened to your knees, um

2830
02:14:55,482 --> 02:14:58,061
that even smelled of cartilage, they said

2831
02:14:58,061 --> 02:15:00,797
 "Uh, we have to take the cartilage out.

2832
02:15:00,797 --> 02:15:04,221
" I mean, today, they don't do that.

2833
02:15:04,221 --> 02:15:04,581
Right.

2834
02:15:04,581 --> 02:15:07,181
They, they go in there and if you have torn cartilage

2835
02:15:07,181 --> 02:15:08,261
they might sew it up.

2836
02:15:08,261 --> 02:15:10,941
Uh, they might trim it up a little bit.

2837
02:15:10,941 --> 02:15:14,721
Um, th- or well, arthroscopic surgery- surgery didn't exist then.

2838
02:15:14,721 --> 02:15:15,141
Right.

2839
02:15:15,141 --> 02:15:20,121
So, they ripped out my meniscus in my right knee

2840
02:15:20,121 --> 02:15:25,561
and I came back the next year to play and I

2841
02:15:25,561 --> 02:15:27,121
I went through all the, you know

2842
02:15:27,121 --> 02:15:31,021
the preseason practice and everything which all happens in August

2843
02:15:31,021 --> 02:15:34,881
and this is in Michigan where it's just excruciatingly hot

2844
02:15:34,881 --> 02:15:38,861
and we get in the first game and I tear up my left knee.

2845
02:15:38,861 --> 02:15:39,161
Huh.

2846
02:15:39,161 --> 02:15:40,621
The same thing.

2847
02:15:40,621 --> 02:15:45,021
So, here I am, you know, within

2848
02:15:45,021 --> 02:15:47,417
uh, about, about 10 or 12.

2849
02:15:47,417 --> 02:15:47,601
..

2850
02:15:47,601 --> 02:15:51,021
12, 11 months I've had a broken leg and two knee operations.

2851
02:15:51,021 --> 02:15:54,981
And I came out the next year to play again

2852
02:15:54,981 --> 02:16:03,621
and, um, I'd had all this time where I'd been on crutches for the broken leg and everything.

2853
02:16:03,621 --> 02:16:05,721
You know, and not being able to walk

2854
02:16:05,721 --> 02:16:08,061
you kind of take walking as, for granted

2855
02:16:08,061 --> 02:16:08,261
you know?

2856
02:16:08,261 --> 02:16:09,621
It's like, "Well, I can walk," you know?

2857
02:16:09,621 --> 02:16:09,921
Right.

2858
02:16:09,921 --> 02:16:12,061
Well, when you can't walk, it's like

2859
02:16:12,061 --> 02:16:14,547
"Geez, I don't think I wanna do this the rest of my life.

2860
02:16:14,547 --> 02:16:19,181
" So the doctor did an exam on me and he says

2861
02:16:19,181 --> 02:16:21,747
um, "God, your knees are really weak.

2862
02:16:21,747 --> 02:16:23,881
" And I don't know, he.

2863
02:16:23,881 --> 02:16:24,041
..

2864
02:16:24,041 --> 02:16:26,181
this is the team doctor again.

2865
02:16:26,181 --> 02:16:27,015
 Like.

2866
02:16:27,015 --> 02:16:27,181
..

2867
02:16:27,181 --> 02:16:30,601
so he scared me enough that I said

2868
02:16:30,601 --> 02:16:32,261
"Hey, I, I'm, you know, I'm through.

2869
02:16:32,261 --> 02:16:33,371
I'm not gonna play anymore.

2870
02:16:33,371 --> 02:16:36,380
" So I didn't play after that.

2871
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:39,300
So what happens on an athletic scholarship if you can no longer play?

2872
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:40,981
Do you risk your scholarship or not?

2873
02:16:40,981 --> 02:16:42,941
Uh, in, in that- In those days.

2874
02:16:42,941 --> 02:16:44,677
In those days, I actually.

2875
02:16:44,677 --> 02:16:44,800
..

2876
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,901
the scholarship was good for the whole thing.

2877
02:16:46,901 --> 02:16:46,941
Awesome.

2878
02:16:46,941 --> 02:16:47,427
And it was.

2879
02:16:47,427 --> 02:16:47,581
..

2880
02:16:47,581 --> 02:16:53,460
this was a Division III school and the scholarship situation was very funny because they

2881
02:16:53,460 --> 02:16:56,120
they didn't really have scholarships or athletic scholarships

2882
02:16:56,120 --> 02:16:58,721
they had something called grants-in-aid.

2883
02:16:58,721 --> 02:17:02,241
And a grants-in-aid could be given to any student.

2884
02:17:02,241 --> 02:17:03,334
So I just.

2885
02:17:03,334 --> 02:17:03,421
..

2886
02:17:03,421 --> 02:17:06,521
I had three grants-in-aid for the three sports.

2887
02:17:06,521 --> 02:17:08,161
I only played three sports in college.

2888
02:17:08,161 --> 02:17:09,081
I didn't play four.

2889
02:17:09,081 --> 02:17:13,341
Um, and I had an academic scholarship and I did.

2890
02:17:13,341 --> 02:17:13,521
..

2891
02:17:13,521 --> 02:17:18,401
my academic scholarship was such that I had to have a B average at the end of two years

2892
02:17:18,401 --> 02:17:20,401
and at the end of the two years

2893
02:17:20,401 --> 02:17:24,861
the only semester my whole college career I had a B- average

2894
02:17:24,861 --> 02:17:27,061
so they took my scholarship away.

2895
02:17:27,061 --> 02:17:27,460
Really?

2896
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:27,901
Yeah.

2897
02:17:27,901 --> 02:17:29,981
Anyway.

2898
02:17:29,981 --> 02:17:32,921
So you've played for a lot of teams

2899
02:17:32,921 --> 02:17:34,700
you've probably played for a lot of different coaches.

2900
02:17:34,700 --> 02:17:42,300
Is there anything about any of those teams or coaches that informs the way that you run a software team today or that informs what you expect from the people on it?

2901
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:48,083
Well, I had one coach, um, which was the second coach I had in high school that.

2902
02:17:48,083 --> 02:17:48,221
..

2903
02:17:48,221 --> 02:17:52,261
who was sort of a, somebody that I really looked up to.

2904
02:17:52,261 --> 02:17:53,561
His name was Bob Dilday.

2905
02:17:53,561 --> 02:17:58,401
He was from Michigan State and he played quarterback with Tommy Yousic.

2906
02:17:58,401 --> 02:18:00,200
Do you remember Tommy Yousic?

2907
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:00,561
You probably don't.

2908
02:18:00,561 --> 02:18:01,061
No, no.

2909
02:18:01,061 --> 02:18:05,021
Tommy Yousic was, um, one of the great quarterbacks from Michigan State

2910
02:18:05,021 --> 02:18:09,341
and he was a real, um, hard-driven

2911
02:18:09,341 --> 02:18:15,741
you know, wanna win kinda guy, and I think I sort of

2912
02:18:15,741 --> 02:18:16,173
um.

2913
02:18:16,173 --> 02:18:16,380
..

2914
02:18:16,380 --> 02:18:22,341
that really, uh, was something that I kind of

2915
02:18:22,341 --> 02:18:28,800
um, was, um, attracted to and I really looked up to him.

2916
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:31,054
Um, unfortunately he didn't.

2917
02:18:31,054 --> 02:18:31,120
..

2918
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:38,681
he wasn't there my whole y- my whole career in high school 'cause I think I could have done a lot better because he pushed people and

2919
02:18:38,681 --> 02:18:40,061
and got a lot more out of the people

2920
02:18:40,061 --> 02:18:40,501
um.

2921
02:18:40,501 --> 02:18:42,654
Uh, you know, I'm.

2922
02:18:42,654 --> 02:18:42,761
..

2923
02:18:42,761 --> 02:18:45,273
I'm all for.

2924
02:18:45,273 --> 02:18:45,460
..

2925
02:18:45,460 --> 02:18:50,001
I'm not somebody that, uh, wants to drag

2926
02:18:50,001 --> 02:18:51,141
drag people up.

2927
02:18:51,141 --> 02:18:54,361
I wanna motivate people to do what they oughta do

2928
02:18:54,361 --> 02:18:54,661
right?

2929
02:18:54,661 --> 02:18:54,901
Right.

2930
02:18:54,901 --> 02:18:56,681
So, and he was one of those kinda guys.

2931
02:18:56,681 --> 02:19:00,981
I think you have a saying somewhere that is

2932
02:19:00,981 --> 02:19:05,800
uh, successful people do the things that the unsuccessful people typically refuse to do.

2933
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:06,141
Yup.

2934
02:19:06,141 --> 02:19:10,641
Any good examples of things like that in daily life as a software engineer?

2935
02:19:10,641 --> 02:19:13,880
Well, you know, I think tha- that

2936
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:19,001
that saying kinda came from people who, you know

2937
02:19:19,001 --> 02:19:21,061
th- they say, "I only write the code

2938
02:19:21,061 --> 02:19:22,017
I don't test the code.

2939
02:19:22,017 --> 02:19:22,521
" Right.

2940
02:19:22,521 --> 02:19:27,061
Or they say, you know, um, "I don't care if

2941
02:19:27,061 --> 02:19:30,221
if the s- the schedule says we're gonna ship two weeks from now

2942
02:19:30,221 --> 02:19:32,914
I mean, at 5:00 I'm outta here.

2943
02:19:32,914 --> 02:19:37,891
" And so, I learned very early at Digital that if we're.

2944
02:19:37,891 --> 02:19:37,941
..

2945
02:19:37,941 --> 02:19:41,761
and if I wanted things to happen, that I had to make them happen

2946
02:19:41,761 --> 02:19:44,521
and that might mean that I did a lot of things.

2947
02:19:44,521 --> 02:19:46,540
I might be fixing bugs for other people.

2948
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:49,181
I mean, people hate to fix their own bugs and that's another thing.

2949
02:19:49,181 --> 02:19:52,821
It's like, um, people don't wanna fix bugs.

2950
02:19:52,821 --> 02:19:54,801
You know, it's like, "Well, you know

2951
02:19:54,801 --> 02:19:56,201
I wrote the code, it's good enough.

2952
02:19:56,201 --> 02:19:56,443
I'll.

2953
02:19:56,443 --> 02:19:56,541
..

2954
02:19:56,541 --> 02:19:59,452
you know, we'll f- we'll shake all this out in testing.

2955
02:19:59,452 --> 02:20:01,801
" Well, I'm not a believer in that.

2956
02:20:01,801 --> 02:20:07,501
I'm a believer that you're, you should do the best you possibly can do and then we'll find the ones after that and it'll be even better.

2957
02:20:07,501 --> 02:20:17,421
Um, so, I think it's this, this thing about doing whatever it takes to make things successful is what I really mean by that.

2958
02:20:17,421 --> 02:20:18,041
Right.

2959
02:20:18,041 --> 02:20:24,661
Uh, it's not necessarily a specific part or any part that would be the most glamorous part of what you're doing.

2960
02:20:24,661 --> 02:20:25,627
Um-.

2961
02:20:25,627 --> 02:20:25,921
..

2962
02:20:25,921 --> 02:20:28,116
like somebody saying, "I'm an architect.

2963
02:20:28,116 --> 02:20:32,401
" Well, you know, it's like Fred Brooks.

2964
02:20:32,401 --> 02:20:36,718
Fred Brooks says, "There's thinkers and there's doers.

2965
02:20:36,718 --> 02:20:40,841
" He says, "Thinkers are a dime a dozen.

2966
02:20:40,841 --> 02:20:43,481
Everybody can think great thoughts.

2967
02:20:43,481 --> 02:20:45,241
Doers are rare.

2968
02:20:45,241 --> 02:20:47,797
Thinker-doers are rarest.

2969
02:20:47,797 --> 02:20:48,321
" Right.

2970
02:20:48,321 --> 02:20:48,702
All right.

2971
02:20:48,702 --> 02:20:53,962
So, um, I, you know, we need people that are architects that

2972
02:20:53,962 --> 02:20:58,962
that think but they need to have a view of they gotta do more than just think

2973
02:20:58,962 --> 02:20:59,341
right?

2974
02:20:59,341 --> 02:20:59,362
Right.

2975
02:20:59,362 --> 02:21:03,181
They gotta make sure that whatever they're, they're doing is actually gonna

2976
02:21:03,181 --> 02:21:10,021
um, meet whatever goals or constraints that are put forward for whatever they're architecting.

2977
02:21:10,021 --> 02:21:15,341
So your first major job out of college was at DuPont working on a project for Scott Paper

2978
02:21:15,341 --> 02:21:16,001
is that close?

2979
02:21:16,001 --> 02:21:17,081
Scott Paper, yeah.

2980
02:21:17,081 --> 02:21:17,441
Yeah.

2981
02:21:17,441 --> 02:21:22,881
And you were using a computer and at some point the computer became far more interesting than the paper project itself

2982
02:21:22,881 --> 02:21:23,381
I'm guessing.

2983
02:21:23,381 --> 02:21:26,777
Yeah, I, you know, I graduated.

2984
02:21:26,777 --> 02:21:26,901
..

2985
02:21:26,901 --> 02:21:34,001
I- the school I went to was a liberal arts school and they were religiously affiliated with the congregational church

2986
02:21:34,001 --> 02:21:35,401
loosely.

2987
02:21:35,401 --> 02:21:40,861
Um, although in 19- the early 1960s it was much stronger than it is now.

2988
02:21:40,861 --> 02:21:44,481
It's hardly any relationship now, but, um

2989
02:21:44,481 --> 02:21:51,001
I didn't have any idea what I wanted to do and a lot of things about college were like

2990
02:21:51,001 --> 02:21:53,781
you know, I went to college basically to play sports.

2991
02:21:53,781 --> 02:21:58,461
I didn't go to college because I had some vision that I wanted to be anything.

2992
02:21:58,461 --> 02:22:04,521
I just wanted to play sports, and this was a place that I could play sports and

2993
02:22:04,521 --> 02:22:06,293
uh, I could get my.

2994
02:22:06,293 --> 02:22:06,421
..

2995
02:22:06,421 --> 02:22:08,081
I couldn't afford to go to school anywhere

2996
02:22:08,081 --> 02:22:10,201
so I could get there and do that.

2997
02:22:10,201 --> 02:22:14,341
But I got real interested in math and I got interested in physics

2998
02:22:14,341 --> 02:22:19,401
and, uh, I spent most of my time in math and physics in

2999
02:22:19,401 --> 02:22:20,921
in college.

3000
02:22:20,921 --> 02:22:23,151
So when I graduated.

3001
02:22:23,151 --> 02:22:23,281
..

3002
02:22:23,281 --> 02:22:25,441
And one of the things I liked to do was I

3003
02:22:25,441 --> 02:22:29,621
I, I worked, um, summers building barns.

3004
02:22:29,621 --> 02:22:31,401
I built pole barns.

3005
02:22:31,401 --> 02:22:31,861
Okay.

3006
02:22:31,861 --> 02:22:37,981
And, um, I ran the crew to build pole barns for this company at the age of 18.

3007
02:22:37,981 --> 02:22:41,814
 Um, so I like to build things so I wanted.

3008
02:22:41,814 --> 02:22:41,921
..

3009
02:22:41,921 --> 02:22:48,901
I thought, you know, I'd really like to find an engineering job so I'm looking for an engineering job and I'm sending resumes to

3010
02:22:48,901 --> 02:22:52,641
to, uh, the aerospace industry, you know

3011
02:22:52,641 --> 02:22:53,301
and everywhere.

3012
02:22:53,301 --> 02:22:55,261
Nobody wants anything to do with me.

3013
02:22:55,261 --> 02:22:59,561
So I sent this thing to DuPont, res- you know

3014
02:22:59,561 --> 02:23:01,436
said, "Hey, you know, here's what I'm interested in.

3015
02:23:01,436 --> 02:23:02,581
" I got a response.

3016
02:23:02,581 --> 02:23:05,301
So they invite me d- down there to

3017
02:23:05,301 --> 02:23:07,361
to interview with them and I go and

3018
02:23:07,361 --> 02:23:11,107
and this was.

3019
02:23:11,107 --> 02:23:11,181
..

3020
02:23:11,181 --> 02:23:19,841
It was a life lesson I learned a- and what I did there was I accepted a job there without really knowing what the job was I accepted.

3021
02:23:19,841 --> 02:23:27,841
So here I thought I was gonna, I was gonna work on testing methods for elastomeric materials.

3022
02:23:27,841 --> 02:23:32,261
Well, what I was going to work on was documenting

3023
02:23:32,261 --> 02:23:36,001
uh, testing methods for document- or for elastomeric materials.

3024
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:39,407
And English and.

3025
02:23:39,407 --> 02:23:39,541
..

3026
02:23:39,541 --> 02:23:44,221
was not my strong suit at all and we had

3027
02:23:44,221 --> 02:23:51,201
we had three different, um, three different organizations that had to approve test methods.

3028
02:23:51,201 --> 02:23:55,481
We had manufacturing facilities, we had the place that I worked which was a

3029
02:23:55,481 --> 02:24:01,481
a, um, a sales service laboratory, they helped customers use our products

3030
02:24:01,481 --> 02:24:04,401
and then there was the research group.

3031
02:24:04,401 --> 02:24:09,441
So they all, they all tested these materials so they wanted standardized testing.

3032
02:24:09,441 --> 02:24:15,101
Well, all of him had their editors so they would all edit this stuff and I

3033
02:24:15,101 --> 02:24:17,341
I don't think I ever got one approved

3034
02:24:17,341 --> 02:24:18,301
uh, not one.

3035
02:24:18,301 --> 02:24:27,541
But there was a group there that was a math and stat group that did math and stat analysis of customers

3036
02:24:27,541 --> 02:24:33,121
uh, processes using our, our chemicals to build products.

3037
02:24:33,121 --> 02:24:40,121
And Scott Paper Company had invented, um

3038
02:24:40,121 --> 02:24:46,981
this process to make foam which was centrifugal casting.

3039
02:24:46,981 --> 02:24:51,781
Um, foam, if you've never watched foam made

3040
02:24:51,781 --> 02:24:53,061
it's magical.

3041
02:24:53,061 --> 02:24:54,601
It's just magic.

3042
02:24:54,601 --> 02:24:57,123
Um, it's usually made.

3043
02:24:57,123 --> 02:24:57,301
..

3044
02:24:57,301 --> 02:24:59,621
Well, back then, I'm sure it's not changed much

3045
02:24:59,621 --> 02:25:03,201
they ha- there would be a conveyor belt that's just flat and goes

3046
02:25:03,201 --> 02:25:08,001
goes on for as far as you can see and it's maybe six to eight feet wide

3047
02:25:08,001 --> 02:25:15,221
and they shoot paper out onto this and it's kind of crimped up on the sides

3048
02:25:15,221 --> 02:25:19,021
and they have a mixing head at the front of the

3049
02:25:19,021 --> 02:25:19,301
the, the.

3050
02:25:19,301 --> 02:25:19,361
..

3051
02:25:19,361 --> 02:25:22,821
one end of this and this goes around continuously on a belt.

3052
02:25:22,821 --> 02:25:26,141
And the mixing head takes two chemicals, just two

3053
02:25:26,141 --> 02:25:32,681
and they put them together and it mixes these two chemicals and pours them out on the paper

3054
02:25:32,681 --> 02:25:35,561
just back and forth like this, so it's this puddle.

3055
02:25:35,561 --> 02:25:40,301
Within about 20 feet, this has risen to be about this high.

3056
02:25:40,301 --> 02:25:42,581
It's just magical.

3057
02:25:42,581 --> 02:25:43,081
Right.

3058
02:25:43,081 --> 02:25:45,526
And so they.

3059
02:25:45,526 --> 02:25:45,601
..

3060
02:25:45,601 --> 02:25:50,581
At that time they were, um, they were

3061
02:25:50,581 --> 02:25:52,825
um, making.

3062
02:25:52,825 --> 02:25:52,941
..

3063
02:25:52,941 --> 02:25:54,046
This is a time when.

3064
02:25:54,046 --> 02:25:54,121
..

3065
02:25:54,121 --> 02:26:00,981
I don't know if you remember, there was a time when we went through where a lot of garments that were outdoor garments had foam insulation in them.

3066
02:26:00,981 --> 02:26:01,561
Right.

3067
02:26:01,561 --> 02:26:04,511
Well, that was, that was made out of these.

3068
02:26:04,511 --> 02:26:04,641
..

3069
02:26:04,641 --> 02:26:08,881
The- these things were cut up into 60-foot long what they called logs.

3070
02:26:08,881 --> 02:26:11,741
So you imagine you have this thing six foot wide

3071
02:26:11,741 --> 02:26:13,561
four feet high, and 60 foot long

3072
02:26:13,561 --> 02:26:18,821
and now you got to make a sheet of this so they can use it in textile stuff.

3073
02:26:18,821 --> 02:26:24,841
So, uh, they would take the stuff and cut it up into

3074
02:26:24,841 --> 02:26:26,715
um.

3075
02:26:26,715 --> 02:26:27,192
..

3076
02:26:27,192 --> 02:26:29,765
That was comp, sorry, that was called a bun.

3077
02:26:29,765 --> 02:26:31,965
They cut this up in what they call logs

3078
02:26:31,965 --> 02:26:37,005
and logs were like maybe a foot and a half square and then across

3079
02:26:37,005 --> 02:26:38,345
whatever, four foot across.

3080
02:26:38,345 --> 02:26:43,145
Then they drill a hole through them and put them on a mandrel so they could spin them

3081
02:26:43,145 --> 02:26:44,945
and they'd spin them on a mandrel and

3082
02:26:44,945 --> 02:26:48,665
and with a slitter, and peel off- Okay.

3083
02:26:48,665 --> 02:26:48,765
.

3084
02:26:48,765 --> 02:26:48,965
..

3085
02:26:48,965 --> 02:26:49,885
a long sheet.

3086
02:26:49,885 --> 02:26:52,265
And that's what they used in the textile stuff.

3087
02:26:52,265 --> 02:26:55,765
Well, Scott Paper Company decided that this was

3088
02:26:55,765 --> 02:27:01,845
um, too much waste because you have to knock all the corners off and you just throw them away.

3089
02:27:01,845 --> 02:27:06,465
So they decided they, they'd try to invent centrifugal casting

3090
02:27:06,465 --> 02:27:09,586
so they invented this machine.

3091
02:27:09,586 --> 02:27:14,445
In this machine, you know the caged roll- roller bearing looks like?

3092
02:27:14,445 --> 02:27:14,725
Yep.

3093
02:27:14,725 --> 02:27:19,285
Well, think of this as a, a caged roller bearing that is

3094
02:27:19,285 --> 02:27:25,485
like, 30 feet long and about maybe five foot in diameter.

3095
02:27:25,485 --> 02:27:32,265
And sitting on this big thing at an angle and spinning

3096
02:27:32,265 --> 02:27:33,965
it has rollers in it.

3097
02:27:33,965 --> 02:27:39,745
There's rollers all around in it, there's some drive somewhere that's driving this thing so it's going like this.

3098
02:27:39,745 --> 02:27:45,585
And at the top of this, they shoot pieces of paper in that are about this wide

3099
02:27:45,585 --> 02:27:48,225
with some glue on it so it glues

3100
02:27:48,225 --> 02:27:50,205
and they have a mixing head with a pourer.

3101
02:27:50,205 --> 02:27:53,905
And they pour the foam down into the

3102
02:27:53,905 --> 02:27:56,585
the top of this thing like this barrel and it spins.

3103
02:27:56,585 --> 02:28:02,545
And as it travels down, it, it does its thing and it expands

3104
02:28:02,545 --> 02:28:04,365
and they had, at the other end

3105
02:28:04,365 --> 02:28:11,125
they had like a buzz saw saw that sawed these things off into 15-foot chunks what they called zarks.

3106
02:28:11,125 --> 02:28:11,645
Okay.

3107
02:28:11,645 --> 02:28:17,445
So a zark was a cylinder with a wall thickness of about like that

3108
02:28:17,445 --> 02:28:22,385
and the thinking was that they just put that on a big mandrel and spin it

3109
02:28:22,385 --> 02:28:24,925
and they'd have none of that knocking off the corners.

3110
02:28:24,925 --> 02:28:25,305
Right.

3111
02:28:25,305 --> 02:28:27,575
So I got enlisted.

3112
02:28:27,575 --> 02:28:27,725
..

3113
02:28:27,725 --> 02:28:36,485
Well, the Math and Stat group asked me if I would be interested in working on a computer simulation model for this process

3114
02:28:36,485 --> 02:28:39,245
what they were doing, and I said sure.

3115
02:28:39,245 --> 02:28:40,305
I was so bored.

3116
02:28:40,305 --> 02:28:44,185
I mean, they coulda asked me if I wanted to be the janitor and I woulda probably said

3117
02:28:44,185 --> 02:28:46,245
"Yeah, that would be more interesting," what I was doing.

3118
02:28:46,245 --> 02:28:54,125
So I said yes, and so we decided we're gonna do this

3119
02:28:54,125 --> 02:28:58,845
um, in a discrete simulation language called GPSS-III.

3120
02:28:58,845 --> 02:29:01,302
And if you're.

3121
02:29:01,302 --> 02:29:01,365
..

3122
02:29:01,365 --> 02:29:03,405
Yeah, you're familiar at all with discrete simulation?

3123
02:29:03,405 --> 02:29:03,425
Yep.

3124
02:29:03,425 --> 02:29:03,565
Mm-hmm.

3125
02:29:03,565 --> 02:29:03,885
Okay.

3126
02:29:03,885 --> 02:29:07,465
So it's like, it's- it's a time interval thing and it- it

3127
02:29:07,465 --> 02:29:12,485
the clock just jumps and each, each interval there's some set of de- event- discrete events that occur.

3128
02:29:12,485 --> 02:29:18,845
So off I go to Pisc- Poughkeepsie to go to the IBM GPSS-III school

3129
02:29:18,845 --> 02:29:23,225
which was quite an experience, and learn GPSS-III.

3130
02:29:23,225 --> 02:29:27,885
And there's people there, uh, there, I remember there were people there from Otis Elevator.

3131
02:29:27,885 --> 02:29:28,545
Okay.

3132
02:29:28,545 --> 02:29:30,745
They were doing a simulation of, um

3133
02:29:30,745 --> 02:29:34,705
the algorithms they're using to send elevators in high-rise

3134
02:29:34,705 --> 02:29:37,385
uh, um, business offices, you know

3135
02:29:37,385 --> 02:29:37,809
um.

3136
02:29:37,809 --> 02:29:37,945
..

3137
02:29:37,945 --> 02:29:39,805
That's what we simulated.

3138
02:29:39,805 --> 02:29:41,005
Elevators and traffic lights.

3139
02:29:41,005 --> 02:29:41,425
 Right.

3140
02:29:41,425 --> 02:29:46,145
So, um, I come back and I

3141
02:29:46,145 --> 02:29:50,116
you know, I go up and I meet all the people at Scott Paper Company and they assign.

3142
02:29:50,116 --> 02:29:50,245
..

3143
02:29:50,245 --> 02:29:53,625
They have an intern they assign to work with me that's

3144
02:29:53,625 --> 02:29:55,505
we're gonna sorta work together on this thing.

3145
02:29:55,505 --> 02:29:58,405
And, um, I'm gonna develop the model and I'm gonna try to

3146
02:29:58,405 --> 02:30:03,485
you know, transfer whatever knowledge I have of the model to him because when after I'm off this

3147
02:30:03,485 --> 02:30:04,865
he's gonna be on it.

3148
02:30:04,865 --> 02:30:11,805
So, um, I start developing this model and this is

3149
02:30:11,805 --> 02:30:19,245
the language is, is like a flowchart language where you have little boxes and little boxes do certain things.

3150
02:30:19,245 --> 02:30:20,685
And it's all sequential.

3151
02:30:20,685 --> 02:30:21,225
Okay.

3152
02:30:21,225 --> 02:30:26,965
Um, you know, basically there's no, there's no real parallelism in it at all

3153
02:30:26,965 --> 02:30:28,485
so it's, it's a consequential thing.

3154
02:30:28,485 --> 02:30:32,485
And so you put all, you connect all these things together just like you're drawing a flowchart.

3155
02:30:32,485 --> 02:30:35,105
In fact, you draw a flowchart to represent your program.

3156
02:30:35,105 --> 02:30:42,085
And then you, you take your flowchart and you punch up each one of these boxes as a certain

3157
02:30:42,085 --> 02:30:45,065
um, encoding on a punch card.

3158
02:30:45,065 --> 02:30:49,065
And you, you know, basically put them in the computer and it

3159
02:30:49,065 --> 02:30:51,705
it doesn't really compile anything.

3160
02:30:51,705 --> 02:30:53,305
I think if, all, all you could think of this is

3161
02:30:53,305 --> 02:30:55,885
is just recording of this big, um

3162
02:30:55,885 --> 02:31:00,065
piece of data, uh, it's a data-driven simulation.

3163
02:31:00,065 --> 02:31:02,365
So it's, well, this is more than the data

3164
02:31:02,365 --> 02:31:04,625
this is, this is actually the logic.

3165
02:31:04,625 --> 02:31:09,525
So it's sorta like a program, and there sorta is things like

3166
02:31:09,525 --> 02:31:12,105
there was g- things like go-tos and things like that.

3167
02:31:12,105 --> 02:31:15,185
And so I developed this model, you know

3168
02:31:15,185 --> 02:31:19,245
and I'm happily doing this and I had.

3169
02:31:19,245 --> 02:31:19,345
..

3170
02:31:19,345 --> 02:31:23,905
You know, in my life I'd never worked on anything that was really exacting.

3171
02:31:23,905 --> 02:31:30,025
You know if you're building a barn, you know if it's

3172
02:31:30,025 --> 02:31:33,065
if it's an eighth inch off, that's nothing.

3173
02:31:33,065 --> 02:31:33,305
Right.

3174
02:31:33,305 --> 02:31:34,565
Even if you get them a half inch 

3175
02:31:34,565 --> 02:31:35,465
I mean, okay?

3176
02:31:35,465 --> 02:31:36,725
You could cover that up.

3177
02:31:36,725 --> 02:31:44,145
But somehow, you know, things like key punch errors and things like that just didn't go through the computer very well .

3178
02:31:44,145 --> 02:31:44,465
Right.

3179
02:31:44,465 --> 02:31:46,665
Well, this was all unknownst to me

3180
02:31:46,665 --> 02:31:56,165
and so then finally the day arrived, the IBM representative and my boss and the guy that

3181
02:31:56,165 --> 02:31:58,265
that I worked with at, that worked at Di- uh

3182
02:31:58,265 --> 02:32:11,225
DuPont, and the, the guy from Scott Paper Company were all gonna go to the data center in Philadelphia to run this GPSS-III program on their 7044.

3183
02:32:11,225 --> 02:32:14,665
So off we go and we get there and

3184
02:32:14,665 --> 02:32:21,965
and this is, th- you can't imagine the madhouse of being in a data center where all the

3185
02:32:21,965 --> 02:32:23,425
all the time is scheduled.

3186
02:32:23,425 --> 02:32:28,312
There's no, there's no sharing of anything.

3187
02:32:28,312 --> 02:32:28,584
..

3188
02:32:28,584 --> 02:32:31,941
. um, everything is, there's a little time stamp machine.

3189
02:32:31,941 --> 02:32:35,841
You know, you grab a piece of paper and you go over and you get it stamped.

3190
02:32:35,841 --> 02:32:37,261
Says your start time.

3191
02:32:37,261 --> 02:32:39,481
It's a say- they'll tell you when your start time

3192
02:32:39,481 --> 02:32:41,122
or tell you when you can go on.

3193
02:32:41,122 --> 02:32:43,042
You go over and you punch this thing

3194
02:32:43,042 --> 02:32:43,721
the start time.

3195
02:32:43,721 --> 02:32:46,562
You run over to the computer and, you know

3196
02:32:46,562 --> 02:32:49,921
do your work and then you run back over and stamp your thing.

3197
02:32:49,921 --> 02:32:58,161
So, you know, we go through all this and we go to the computer and we load up the deck of cards and everything and spin the tapes and the whole works and

3198
02:32:58,161 --> 02:33:02,021
you know, it reads about 10 cards and rolls over dead.

3199
02:33:02,021 --> 02:33:04,303
Y- you know, "What's wrong?

3200
02:33:04,303 --> 02:33:05,781
" And it turns out I got, like

3201
02:33:05,781 --> 02:33:06,749
out of, out of.

3202
02:33:06,749 --> 02:33:06,861
..

3203
02:33:06,861 --> 02:33:11,941
My model is like, I would say about a thousand cards

3204
02:33:11,941 --> 02:33:15,642
thousand statements, and I probably got 500 errors.

3205
02:33:15,642 --> 02:33:22,521
We spent the whole day trying to fix the errors and never got them fixed.

3206
02:33:22,521 --> 02:33:25,541
You know, you, we'd create more errors.

3207
02:33:25,541 --> 02:33:26,361
Right.

3208
02:33:26,361 --> 02:33:32,861
And so, you know, that, that was the first experience.

3209
02:33:32,861 --> 02:33:34,702
That was the most humiliating day, I think

3210
02:33:34,702 --> 02:33:35,401
of my life.

3211
02:33:35,401 --> 02:33:40,339
I just, like, thinking about, "How can I possibly make s- this many pr- errors?

3212
02:33:40,339 --> 02:33:45,068
" So we went back to DuPont and I decided that what I was gonna do was.

3213
02:33:45,068 --> 02:33:45,262
..

3214
02:33:45,262 --> 02:33:51,781
We had a compute service there at the engineering department that was an 1108

3215
02:33:51,781 --> 02:33:53,822
which was a UNIVAC machine.

3216
02:33:53,822 --> 02:33:56,002
Well, actually it was 1107 at that time.

3217
02:33:56,002 --> 02:34:00,802
And my group, which was this math and stat group

3218
02:34:00,802 --> 02:34:03,936
said, "Well, you can run Fortran programs down there anytime you want to.

3219
02:34:03,936 --> 02:34:12,621
" So I decide I'm gonna write this Fortran program that's gonna look at all these cards and get rid of all my errors.

3220
02:34:12,621 --> 02:34:16,221
All my, my key punch errors.

3221
02:34:16,221 --> 02:34:21,742
So, and in those days, y- y- not very many people really punched their own cards.

3222
02:34:21,742 --> 02:34:22,722
They just corrected.

3223
02:34:22,722 --> 02:34:23,161
Right.

3224
02:34:23,161 --> 02:34:23,621
So you had.

3225
02:34:23,621 --> 02:34:23,762
..

3226
02:34:23,762 --> 02:34:27,341
You take, y- you know, you write all this stuff up and you tend it to the

3227
02:34:27,341 --> 02:34:28,601
you send it to the key punch.

3228
02:34:28,601 --> 02:34:30,542
Then key punch would punch it all.

3229
02:34:30,542 --> 02:34:33,982
One person would punch it and then another person would verify it all.

3230
02:34:33,982 --> 02:34:36,322
And even after all that, you know

3231
02:34:36,322 --> 02:34:37,542
there were still all these errors.

3232
02:34:37,542 --> 02:34:37,901
Right.

3233
02:34:37,901 --> 02:34:40,321
So I write this program in Fortran, which is

3234
02:34:40,321 --> 02:34:40,531
I.

3235
02:34:40,531 --> 02:34:40,641
..

3236
02:34:40,641 --> 02:34:45,281
This program must have been the most god-awful looking program ever written by man

3237
02:34:45,281 --> 02:34:52,761
that actually went through and found all of the problems and now we could go back to the data center and run again.

3238
02:34:52,761 --> 02:34:54,601
So we go back to the data center and

3239
02:34:54,601 --> 02:35:01,902
you know, now I'm dealing with logic errors and we're going back and forth and somewhere in this process

3240
02:35:01,902 --> 02:35:06,661
I decide that I'd like to know more about the machine.

3241
02:35:06,661 --> 02:35:12,041
You know, compilers really baffled me at that time.

3242
02:35:12,041 --> 02:35:17,861
Like, you know, like, certainly the machine can't take in this text and do something with it.

3243
02:35:17,861 --> 02:35:18,821
What's going on here?

3244
02:35:18,821 --> 02:35:23,842
So I decided I'd learn something about the machine

3245
02:35:23,842 --> 02:35:30,481
so I get a 7044 assembly language manual and one of the

3246
02:35:30,481 --> 02:35:34,581
one of the, uh, blocks, these

3247
02:35:34,581 --> 02:35:37,641
these things were blocks, this, that you had symbols for in the flowchart

3248
02:35:37,641 --> 02:35:38,781
was called a help block.

3249
02:35:38,781 --> 02:35:42,341
In a help block, you could write your own code.

3250
02:35:42,341 --> 02:35:48,453
So say, "Geez, what can I dream up that I've gotta have a help block for?

3251
02:35:48,453 --> 02:35:50,526
"  So I had about.

3252
02:35:50,526 --> 02:35:50,641
..

3253
02:35:50,641 --> 02:35:53,781
When I ended up, I had about a thousand card help block

3254
02:35:53,781 --> 02:36:00,441
all f- 7044 assembler and somewhere in there I decided that I

3255
02:36:00,441 --> 02:36:06,441
you know, I was really more interested in the computers than solving problems with computers.

3256
02:36:06,441 --> 02:36:07,101
Right.

3257
02:36:07,101 --> 02:36:10,761
So that, and that happened in, you know

3258
02:36:10,761 --> 02:36:12,921
like '67 or somewhere along there.

3259
02:36:12,921 --> 02:36:23,781
So correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm guessing that even the original release of NT was too much for any person to keep in their head in detail or was it still compact enough that you could understand the whole thing at that time?

3260
02:36:23,781 --> 02:36:31,201
Um, I think that it was compact that you could understand

3261
02:36:31,201 --> 02:36:35,661
uh, the conc- You understand the concepts of how everything's working.

3262
02:36:35,661 --> 02:36:42,921
Um, it definitely was big enough that  you couldn't have the code all in your own

3263
02:36:42,921 --> 02:36:45,521
you know, nobody could know all the code.

3264
02:36:45,521 --> 02:36:49,461
Was the move to Xbox in any way a desire to work on a smaller

3265
02:36:49,461 --> 02:36:53,641
more self-contained system that you could have greater control over or- No.

3266
02:36:53,641 --> 02:36:53,641
.

3267
02:36:53,641 --> 02:36:53,641
.

3268
02:36:53,641 --> 02:36:55,101
just good opportunity?

3269
02:36:55,101 --> 02:37:00,581
I, you know, I was, I was really bored with Azure.

3270
02:37:00,581 --> 02:37:02,121
We got to the point in Azure where

3271
02:37:02,121 --> 02:37:09,421
you know, the hypervisor was working and we did a lot of operating system work there in the beginning

3272
02:37:09,421 --> 02:37:19,181
'cause we had a host system there and we didn't use Hyper-V and we didn't run Windows in the host system and eventually

3273
02:37:19,181 --> 02:37:28,961
Azure has actually, uh, replaced the original hypervisor with Hyper-V and they've replaced the host system with

3274
02:37:28,961 --> 02:37:30,541
you know, a standard Windows system.

3275
02:37:30,541 --> 02:37:38,441
But at that point, we weren't, didn't have any plans to do that and I was just sort of bored and so this opportunity came up

3276
02:37:38,441 --> 02:37:41,361
uh, to go do this and I went and

3277
02:37:41,361 --> 02:37:47,681
um, listened to what they're doing and I

3278
02:37:47,681 --> 02:37:49,061
I got a chance to look at this.

3279
02:37:49,061 --> 02:37:51,301
One of the things I got a chance to look at was what

3280
02:37:51,301 --> 02:37:58,621
um, became HoloLens and some of their embryonic stuff at that.

3281
02:37:58,621 --> 02:37:59,021
Right.

3282
02:37:59,021 --> 02:38:02,381
Um, and, but at that time, it was

3283
02:38:02,381 --> 02:38:06,341
you know, you're required this big tether  you know

3284
02:38:06,341 --> 02:38:12,814
and a big cable off your headset to your th- server computer to run all the stuff for the.

3285
02:38:12,814 --> 02:38:12,861
..

3286
02:38:12,861 --> 02:38:14,901
But it was fantastic graphics.

3287
02:38:14,901 --> 02:38:16,641
3D was unbelievable.

3288
02:38:16,641 --> 02:38:21,581
Anyway, the, um, it was mainly to just to have

3289
02:38:21,581 --> 02:38:22,181
you know.

3290
02:38:22,181 --> 02:38:22,301
..

3291
02:38:22,301 --> 02:38:23,901
I was looking for something to do.

3292
02:38:23,901 --> 02:38:27,901
So I think there's a tendency with programmers to

3293
02:38:27,901 --> 02:38:30,941
the first time they attack a problem, they don't know what they're doing yet

3294
02:38:30,941 --> 02:38:32,361
so they write a terrible version of it.

3295
02:38:32,361 --> 02:38:36,801
The second time they think they understand and they make a super complicated version of it and over-engineer it

3296
02:38:36,801 --> 02:38:42,063
and then the third time they scale back and figure out what they were really gonna do in the first place and do it right that time.

3297
02:38:42,063 --> 02:38:45,417
Do you have any sense of that progression from RSX to VMS to NT?

3298
02:38:45,417 --> 02:38:49,677
Or are they all pretty much locked in for the time that they were in the market?

3299
02:38:49,677 --> 02:38:52,197
Or let me put it this way.

3300
02:38:52,197 --> 02:38:54,537
If you had to rewrite any of them now

3301
02:38:54,537 --> 02:38:56,437
would it be significantly different?

3302
02:38:56,437 --> 02:39:06,218
Um,  probably not.

3303
02:39:06,218 --> 02:39:12,497
Um,  RSX-11M was definitely not an over-extended system.

3304
02:39:12,497 --> 02:39:15,678
I had a, I made a stamp-up that says

3305
02:39:15,678 --> 02:39:16,743
"Size is the goal.

3306
02:39:16,743 --> 02:39:17,258
" Right.

3307
02:39:17,258 --> 02:39:19,707
And I stamped everything with, "Size is the goal.

3308
02:39:19,707 --> 02:39:22,078
" So it was very constrained.

3309
02:39:22,078 --> 02:39:28,238
We had to run in, um, 32K bytes of memory

3310
02:39:28,238 --> 02:39:32,937
and in 32K bytes of memory, you had to be able to run the file system.

3311
02:39:32,937 --> 02:39:36,137
You had to run the Fortran compiler.

3312
02:39:36,137 --> 02:39:36,898
Right.

3313
02:39:36,898 --> 02:39:38,317
You had to run the linker.

3314
02:39:38,317 --> 02:39:41,197
Um, so it was extremely constrained.

3315
02:39:41,197 --> 02:39:47,117
VMS, uh, was constrained too because, um

3316
02:39:47,117 --> 02:39:49,597
there was the time, val- uh, the time

3317
02:39:49,597 --> 02:40:03,097
um, that we basically had to do it was gonna be short and we were really w- where this was the first system we were gonna introduce paging into and

3318
02:40:03,097 --> 02:40:06,477
you know, even though the PDP-10 had

3319
02:40:06,477 --> 02:40:09,938
had, uh, didn't ha- it, PDP-10 did not have paging.

3320
02:40:09,938 --> 02:40:11,418
It had swapping.

3321
02:40:11,418 --> 02:40:16,897
And, um, all of the, um

3322
02:40:16,897 --> 02:40:22,617
the hype or whatever about paging just wasn't very good.

3323
02:40:22,617 --> 02:40:35,718
It was that paging systems basically didn't work very well and we spent an awful lot of time on VMS trying to make sure that we did things in a way that the paging would be good.

3324
02:40:35,718 --> 02:40:40,257
Um, one of the problems we had with VM- uh

3325
02:40:40,257 --> 02:40:43,258
VMS was very small page size.

3326
02:40:43,258 --> 02:40:45,118
That didn't help.

3327
02:40:45,118 --> 02:40:50,278
So VMS was constrained by the ship date

3328
02:40:50,278 --> 02:40:52,537
so we didn't have any grand ideas.

3329
02:40:52,537 --> 02:40:55,977
Um, one thing that we did do with VMS was we

3330
02:40:55,977 --> 02:41:08,377
we thought we did, was we looked at Unix for a little while and tried to pick the things that we thought were good features in Unix and bring them into VMS and

3331
02:41:08,377 --> 02:41:19,377
um, I don't think that anybody would ever say that they thought any feature in VMS looked like Unix but- Right.

3332
02:41:19,377 --> 02:41:19,477
.

3333
02:41:19,477 --> 02:41:19,677
..

3334
02:41:19,677 --> 02:41:30,437
uh, um, uh, NT, um, would probably be the one that maybe we were a little bit more optimistic about.

3335
02:41:30,437 --> 02:41:33,657
However, there's one thing in the middle of this that

3336
02:41:33,657 --> 02:41:37,737
that, that s- maybe saved NT and that's Mica.

3337
02:41:37,737 --> 02:41:41,357
Mica was very grandiose.

3338
02:41:41,357 --> 02:41:47,777
Extremely grandiose and one of the things, in fact

3339
02:41:47,777 --> 02:41:51,817
it scared the hell out of me that we'd ever be able to build it.

3340
02:41:51,817 --> 02:41:55,817
Um, it was very complicated.

3341
02:41:55,817 --> 02:42:00,577
Um, it was designed by, you know

3342
02:42:00,577 --> 02:42:04,137
like, I don't know, a dozen and a half people in a room together.

3343
02:42:04,137 --> 02:42:15,117
Um, and a lot of, uh, a lot of people that were on the design team had almost zero experience with actually building an operating system

3344
02:42:15,117 --> 02:42:20,097
so, you know, e- everybody, everybody that's a user thinks that

3345
02:42:20,097 --> 02:42:22,717
well, everything should be an op- you know

3346
02:42:22,717 --> 02:42:23,857
it should be a service.

3347
02:42:23,857 --> 02:42:25,877
We, an operating system service is like

3348
02:42:25,877 --> 02:42:27,537
and not thinking of it in terms of

3349
02:42:27,537 --> 02:42:38,957
well, is that something that really b- belongs in the operating system or is it s- something that belongs in a subsystem or something that belongs as a library or whatever?

3350
02:42:38,957 --> 02:42:40,957
And so they're, they're, they tend to

3351
02:42:40,957 --> 02:42:46,597
to gravitate towards features that are, just shouldn't be in the operating system at all.

3352
02:42:46,597 --> 02:42:49,757
So we had a lot of that, a lot of arguments about that.

3353
02:42:49,757 --> 02:42:55,297
But Mica probably helped trim down NT quite a bit.

3354
02:42:55,297 --> 02:42:59,857
Um, the whole object architecture in, in

3355
02:42:59,857 --> 02:43:12,757
in Mica was extremely baroque and extremely w- it was a multi-level architecture with containers and protection at each level and access controls and all sorts of stuff and

3356
02:43:12,757 --> 02:43:21,357
and after having done NT and finding out that the handle table translation was so important

3357
02:43:21,357 --> 02:43:25,977
I mean, it would've been like that would've been just a disaster .

3358
02:43:25,977 --> 02:43:27,397
It would've been, yeah, real disaster.

3359
02:43:27,397 --> 02:43:31,017
So no, I don't think any of them were over grandiose.

3360
02:43:31,017 --> 02:43:33,937
Um, I think NT is, is, um

3361
02:43:33,937 --> 02:43:39,017
proven itself to be very malleable, very extendable

3362
02:43:39,017 --> 02:43:39,457
um.

3363
02:43:39,457 --> 02:43:45,177
You know, um, we keep hitting security problems

3364
02:43:45,177 --> 02:43:49,737
um, but, you know, the security problems are

3365
02:43:49,737 --> 02:43:51,217
are different.

3366
02:43:51,217 --> 02:43:55,277
Um, I remember back with VMS we tried to

3367
02:43:55,277 --> 02:43:58,177
it- at the end of VMS, um

3368
02:43:58,177 --> 02:44:09,437
we tried to build a ASIC, what was called an ASICure VMS system and it was a single user system and it ran excruciatingly slow.

3369
02:44:09,437 --> 02:44:11,437
Excruciatingly slow.

3370
02:44:11,437 --> 02:44:18,277
But the level of things that were considered to be security issues then are not the same as they are now.

3371
02:44:18,277 --> 02:44:20,341
I mean, the stuff now is.

3372
02:44:20,341 --> 02:44:20,557
..

3373
02:44:20,557 --> 02:44:23,617
The worst problems aren't the problems that are bugs.

3374
02:44:23,617 --> 02:44:31,317
It's the problems where, where there's some phenomena that sprouts up because of the hardware or some

3375
02:44:31,317 --> 02:44:39,197
um, way that people find to use the hardware in a way that lets 'em break the system.

3376
02:44:39,197 --> 02:44:44,597
Um, you know, the recent example, um

3377
02:44:44,597 --> 02:44:48,637
of this is some ha- well, I guess I- you

3378
02:44:48,637 --> 02:44:51,452
uh, you probably would call these hardware bugs but.

3379
02:44:51,452 --> 02:44:51,730
..

3380
02:44:51,730 --> 02:44:52,008
..

3381
02:44:52,008 --> 02:44:57,307
. the bugs where, um, there was something called the threshold bug.

3382
02:44:57,307 --> 02:44:58,107
Okay.

3383
02:44:58,107 --> 02:45:02,619
And threshold was caused by.

3384
02:45:02,619 --> 02:45:02,987
..

3385
02:45:02,987 --> 02:45:07,847
 On In- this is an Intel only problem.

3386
02:45:07,847 --> 02:45:09,787
It didn't happen on AMD.

3387
02:45:09,787 --> 02:45:14,527
You know, all these processors are doing a lot of speculation these days and they're doing

3388
02:45:14,527 --> 02:45:16,347
uh, they're executing way ahead.

3389
02:45:16,347 --> 02:45:21,488
And on Intel, when they hit a

3390
02:45:21,488 --> 02:45:27,347
uh, an access violation, they just, they just put a

3391
02:45:27,347 --> 02:45:30,055
set a bit that said, "Okay,  this is bad.

3392
02:45:30,055 --> 02:45:32,687
" And let that keep right on going

3393
02:45:32,687 --> 02:45:34,587
they just kept right on pre- speculating.

3394
02:45:34,587 --> 02:45:40,888
And then some time later, that instruction tries to retire and it says

3395
02:45:40,888 --> 02:45:41,755
"Oh, it's bad.

3396
02:45:41,755 --> 02:45:45,108
" And now what they have to do is they have to unwind everything.

3397
02:45:45,108 --> 02:45:47,027
And they unwind it all.

3398
02:45:47,027 --> 02:45:51,667
That's good, everything's cool, and except for one thing.

3399
02:45:51,667 --> 02:46:02,847
They allowed software to access variables that weren't in the cache that were accessible after having discovered an access violation.

3400
02:46:02,847 --> 02:46:03,387
Oh, okay.

3401
02:46:03,387 --> 02:46:09,987
So that gave people a way to decode things by looking at the timing.

3402
02:46:09,987 --> 02:46:12,807
AMD did not have that problem.

3403
02:46:12,807 --> 02:46:16,047
AMD as soon as they hit- they saw the access violation

3404
02:46:16,047 --> 02:46:17,037
they said, "That's it.

3405
02:46:17,037 --> 02:46:17,807
" And cut them off.

3406
02:46:17,807 --> 02:46:25,687
So there is a problem that was a security problem that caused a lot of upheaval.

3407
02:46:25,687 --> 02:46:29,507
Um, the latest one is this one which

3408
02:46:29,507 --> 02:46:31,627
um, they're all side channel.

3409
02:46:31,627 --> 02:46:34,547
Most of this, a lot of this stuff lately has been side channel stuff.

3410
02:46:34,547 --> 02:46:38,227
This is where you do something here and somebody.

3411
02:46:38,227 --> 02:46:38,347
..

3412
02:46:38,347 --> 02:46:43,167
You do something and somebody can infer something from that.

3413
02:46:43,167 --> 02:46:47,007
Um, but they c- they don't have a direct channel with the data

3414
02:46:47,007 --> 02:46:49,967
but they discover what the data is based on a side effect of what you did.

3415
02:46:49,967 --> 02:46:55,307
And this has to do most, or this particular one has to do a lot with

3416
02:46:55,307 --> 02:46:56,987
uh, what's called the branch target buffer.

3417
02:46:56,987 --> 02:46:57,527
Okay.

3418
02:46:57,527 --> 02:47:04,267
And, you know, I have branch prediction and branch prediction predicts branches.

3419
02:47:04,267 --> 02:47:08,747
But the branch target buffer predicts where the next instruction is.

3420
02:47:08,747 --> 02:47:12,750
And you'd think, "How in the world could that work?

3421
02:47:12,750 --> 02:47:14,787
" You know, like, they keep this cache of where

3422
02:47:14,787 --> 02:47:16,267
where the next instruction's gonna be.

3423
02:47:16,267 --> 02:47:20,457
They access the cache, and if it looks legitimate they start.

3424
02:47:20,457 --> 02:47:20,567
..

3425
02:47:20,567 --> 02:47:22,467
That, that's where the next instructions come from.

3426
02:47:22,467 --> 02:47:33,227
Well, you can cause a leak of information if you can figure out how the branch target buffer works and kind of preload it

3427
02:47:33,227 --> 02:47:39,727
and then ask the operating system to do something knowing that what

3428
02:47:39,727 --> 02:47:46,627
what it's gonna do with that speculation that you've loaded into the branch target buffer in such a way that you can get cache timing information

3429
02:47:46,627 --> 02:47:49,207
which then you can translate into data.

3430
02:47:49,207 --> 02:47:49,747
Okay.

3431
02:47:49,747 --> 02:47:51,347
That's Spectre.

3432
02:47:51,347 --> 02:47:56,427
So the security problems, um, have changed a lot.

3433
02:47:56,427 --> 02:48:00,787
Uh, and, you know, on Xbox we had.

3434
02:48:00,787 --> 02:48:00,967
..

3435
02:48:00,967 --> 02:48:06,407
Xboxes is, um, to our knowledge has not been broken.

3436
02:48:06,407 --> 02:48:09,567
 That doesn't mean it can't be broken.

3437
02:48:09,567 --> 02:48:11,667
But we have a, we had a team

3438
02:48:11,667 --> 02:48:16,987
uh, that twice tried to break into Xbox and they actually got in.

3439
02:48:16,987 --> 02:48:20,767
And the way these guys, um, they just

3440
02:48:20,767 --> 02:48:24,452
um, have a different mindset  of the way they think about things and what.

3441
02:48:24,452 --> 02:48:24,567
..

3442
02:48:24,567 --> 02:48:25,967
making things do things.

3443
02:48:25,967 --> 02:48:30,127
Um, typically they'll find a bug and they'll ex- uh

3444
02:48:30,127 --> 02:48:38,507
a bug that, that's doesn't look like it's disastrous on the surface but it turns out that it gives them enough information that they can cause something to occur.

3445
02:48:38,507 --> 02:48:43,867
And then they do something that, um

3446
02:48:43,867 --> 02:48:47,327
writes over the stack, and you do a return.

3447
02:48:47,327 --> 02:48:51,907
Um, writing over function variables is a popular one.

3448
02:48:51,907 --> 02:48:53,947
Of course, all of these things that we

3449
02:48:53,947 --> 02:48:57,447
we try to mitiga- mitigate all these things in the operating system.

3450
02:48:57,447 --> 02:48:59,947
Anyway, I don't know how we got down that path

3451
02:48:59,947 --> 02:49:00,160
but.

3452
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:00,267
..

3453
02:49:00,267 --> 02:49:03,147
Well, I got two good questions left.

3454
02:49:03,147 --> 02:49:05,527
Um, one, I don't know if we talked about it yet

3455
02:49:05,527 --> 02:49:08,727
but one thing that always fascinated me back in the day was Lego or BBT.

3456
02:49:08,727 --> 02:49:10,547
And it was- BBT?

3457
02:49:10,547 --> 02:49:10,987
Yeah.

3458
02:49:10,987 --> 02:49:17,347
And the reordering of code in order to get jumps to be more predictable or closer and

3459
02:49:17,347 --> 02:49:20,207
um, better locality of cache reference and everything else.

3460
02:49:20,207 --> 02:49:22,867
And it seemed to have a pretty good performance impact on binaries.

3461
02:49:22,867 --> 02:49:24,747
Is that a public tool yet?

3462
02:49:24,747 --> 02:49:28,807
Is that something other people can run on or is it still an exclusive Microsoft technology?

3463
02:49:28,807 --> 02:49:30,987
I think BBT is still Microsoft.

3464
02:49:30,987 --> 02:49:32,907
I mean, I'm not absolutely sure.

3465
02:49:32,907 --> 02:49:37,747
I don't think we run BBT on as many things these days as we used to.

3466
02:49:37,747 --> 02:49:38,171
Um.

3467
02:49:38,171 --> 02:49:38,387
..

3468
02:49:38,387 --> 02:49:41,027
I guess memory pressure's not the same as it used to be either

3469
02:49:41,027 --> 02:49:41,275
so.

3470
02:49:41,275 --> 02:49:41,427
..

3471
02:49:41,427 --> 02:49:51,287
Uh, well BBT was basically reor- reorganizing things so that you get all the stuff that you don't execute out of the way.

3472
02:49:51,287 --> 02:49:51,587
Right.

3473
02:49:51,587 --> 02:49:56,187
And the stuff that you do execute, you have together.

3474
02:49:56,187 --> 02:50:01,527
Um, I don't know how much stuff.

3475
02:50:01,527 --> 02:50:04,127
You know, I- the Windows stuff, I don't know how much is BBT.

3476
02:50:04,127 --> 02:50:04,727
But you know what?

3477
02:50:04,727 --> 02:50:08,147
It's, I think it's still, um, you know

3478
02:50:08,147 --> 02:50:10,327
it's, that's a significant performance thing.

3479
02:50:10,327 --> 02:50:13,407
Um, it's like five, 5%.

3480
02:50:13,407 --> 02:50:19,687
Um, I just haven't been involved.

3481
02:50:19,687 --> 02:50:23,307
We do, we do Pogo now too.

3482
02:50:23,307 --> 02:50:23,322
That's.

3483
02:50:23,322 --> 02:50:23,327
..

3484
02:50:23,327 --> 02:50:24,907
We did, you know, when we did BBT

3485
02:50:24,907 --> 02:50:28,647
uh, Pogo was kind of a.

3486
02:50:28,647 --> 02:50:28,787
..

3487
02:50:28,787 --> 02:50:29,747
Well, there's a couple things.

3488
02:50:29,747 --> 02:50:30,667
I don't know what Pogo is.

3489
02:50:30,667 --> 02:50:34,647
Pogo is progr- program, profile, uh, guided optimization.

3490
02:50:34,647 --> 02:50:35,047
Okay.

3491
02:50:35,047 --> 02:50:42,167
So basically, BBT, uh, does profile.

3492
02:50:42,167 --> 02:50:45,307
It, pro- you could call that profile-guided optimization too

3493
02:50:45,307 --> 02:50:48,947
but it's being done by a tool that's run over the binary after the fact.

3494
02:50:48,947 --> 02:50:58,047
And, you know, it has to keep up with all the stuff that they do to change the format of the binary and stuff that's in the binary and whatever.

3495
02:50:58,047 --> 02:50:59,738
Whereas the, the.

3496
02:50:59,738 --> 02:50:59,893
..

3497
02:50:59,893 --> 02:51:00,049
..

3498
02:51:00,049 --> 02:51:02,067
. Pogo is done by the compiler.

3499
02:51:02,067 --> 02:51:14,787
So Pogo can ingest the, the, the data from the profile into the com- compilation of the code and produce code based on that.

3500
02:51:14,787 --> 02:51:15,287
Okay.

3501
02:51:15,287 --> 02:51:15,747
All right.

3502
02:51:15,747 --> 02:51:19,968
The other thing that I don't think that we had at that time

3503
02:51:19,968 --> 02:51:23,007
that was as well developed, was whole program optimization.

3504
02:51:23,007 --> 02:51:25,367
Link time code generation.

3505
02:51:25,367 --> 02:51:25,907
Okay.

3506
02:51:25,907 --> 02:51:26,447
All right.

3507
02:51:26,447 --> 02:51:28,987
So, you know, basically we, we motion-.

3508
02:51:28,987 --> 02:51:29,087
..

3509
02:51:29,087 --> 02:51:35,627
we mostly compiled, um, objects and then we link objects together.

3510
02:51:35,627 --> 02:51:43,207
And now, we emotionally compile into this intermediate language that then gets ingested by the linker

3511
02:51:43,207 --> 02:51:46,288
which then links the whole program- Right.

3512
02:51:46,288 --> 02:51:46,288
.

3513
02:51:46,288 --> 02:51:46,288
.

3514
02:51:46,288 --> 02:51:48,388
and does optimization over the whole program.

3515
02:51:48,388 --> 02:51:53,787
So I don't think BBT is as important as it used to be

3516
02:51:53,787 --> 02:51:54,447
but- Okay.

3517
02:51:54,447 --> 02:51:54,547
.

3518
02:51:54,547 --> 02:51:54,747
..

3519
02:51:54,747 --> 02:51:56,363
I'm, I'm, I'm not g-.

3520
02:51:56,363 --> 02:51:56,387
..

3521
02:51:56,387 --> 02:51:58,427
I can't give you a definitive answer on that.

3522
02:51:58,427 --> 02:51:58,807
Okay.

3523
02:51:58,807 --> 02:52:00,727
And that might've been- Oh, yeah.

3524
02:52:00,727 --> 02:52:02,727
I had a new guy start for me and

3525
02:52:02,727 --> 02:52:04,827
uh, you know, first thing he has to do is enlist in

3526
02:52:04,827 --> 02:52:06,367
uh, the source tree.

3527
02:52:06,367 --> 02:52:09,235
And so right before lunch, he does an enl-.

3528
02:52:09,235 --> 02:52:09,327
..

3529
02:52:09,327 --> 02:52:10,847
uh, I think it was just a straight enlistment

3530
02:52:10,847 --> 02:52:17,727
but we got back 45 minutes later and we could hear his phone ringing down the hall and it just kept ringing and ringing

3531
02:52:17,727 --> 02:52:18,067
and ringing.

3532
02:52:18,067 --> 02:52:19,007
 And we get there and we say

3533
02:52:19,007 --> 02:52:19,327
"Oh, shit.

3534
02:52:19,327 --> 02:52:20,987
Dave C's on the caller ID.

3535
02:52:20,987 --> 02:52:21,462
What do I do?

3536
02:52:21,462 --> 02:52:23,012
" And I said, "You better answer it.

3537
02:52:23,012 --> 02:52:24,487
"  And I think all you said was

3538
02:52:24,487 --> 02:52:26,553
"Release your fucking lock," and hung up and.

3539
02:52:26,553 --> 02:52:26,667
..

3540
02:52:26,667 --> 02:52:28,807
'cause he had locked the source tree and gone for lunch

3541
02:52:28,807 --> 02:52:29,127
so.

3542
02:52:29,127 --> 02:52:34,287
 That doesn't sound like you at all though.

3543
02:52:34,287 --> 02:52:44,567
Well, at that time, we had a source control system we endearingly referred to as SLIM.

3544
02:52:44,567 --> 02:52:46,707
And it was SLIM.

3545
02:52:46,707 --> 02:52:47,407
Yeah.

3546
02:52:47,407 --> 02:52:48,667
It was- It didn't do forks.

3547
02:52:48,667 --> 02:52:49,627
It didn't do anything.

3548
02:52:49,627 --> 02:52:50,013
It was.

3549
02:52:50,013 --> 02:52:50,127
..

3550
02:52:50,127 --> 02:52:51,303
The problem.

3551
02:52:51,303 --> 02:52:51,387
..

3552
02:52:51,387 --> 02:52:55,487
That was the, that was the original Unix source control system.

3553
02:52:55,487 --> 02:52:55,767
Oh, was it?

3554
02:52:55,767 --> 02:52:56,847
It's RCCS.

3555
02:52:56,847 --> 02:53:05,327
Um, they decide they're gonna build a source control system without really building a client server system.

3556
02:53:05,327 --> 02:53:07,450
So they say, "How are we gonna do this?

3557
02:53:07,450 --> 02:53:12,287
" Well, say we have remote file s- system access and we have file locks.

3558
02:53:12,287 --> 02:53:13,807
We'll just have the lient-.

3559
02:53:13,807 --> 02:53:13,887
..

3560
02:53:13,887 --> 02:53:15,267
the client lock the file.

3561
02:53:15,267 --> 02:53:22,607
So that works fine until the client fails while holding the lock.

3562
02:53:22,607 --> 02:53:23,127
Right.

3563
02:53:23,127 --> 02:53:28,749
And now, the whole source control system is down because this file.

3564
02:53:28,749 --> 02:53:28,847
..

3565
02:53:28,847 --> 02:53:33,327
this one guy, uh, his system crashed and when

3566
02:53:33,327 --> 02:53:36,387
yeah, when he recovers, he has no idea that he held the lock.

3567
02:53:36,387 --> 02:53:36,847
Right.

3568
02:53:36,847 --> 02:53:43,267
That's why we had all these people that were status file repair experts.

3569
02:53:43,267 --> 02:53:44,767
I don't know if you remember those guys.

3570
02:53:44,767 --> 02:53:45,047
No.

3571
02:53:45,047 --> 02:53:46,447
Chuck Lensmeyer was one.

3572
02:53:46,447 --> 02:53:47,167
You remember Chuck?

3573
02:53:47,167 --> 02:53:52,247
By name, but- Um, I would all the time calling him up saying

3574
02:53:52,247 --> 02:53:54,097
"Could you unlock this file?

3575
02:53:54,097 --> 02:53:56,527
" It was on a per file basis

3576
02:53:56,527 --> 02:53:59,027
so it wasn't like they locked the whole thing

3577
02:53:59,027 --> 02:53:59,233
but.

3578
02:53:59,233 --> 02:53:59,327
..

3579
02:53:59,327 --> 02:54:00,627
and it was slow.

3580
02:54:00,627 --> 02:54:03,387
It was excruciatingly slow.

3581
02:54:03,387 --> 02:54:04,667
You remember Dave Snip?

3582
02:54:04,667 --> 02:54:05,347
No.

3583
02:54:05,347 --> 02:54:13,227
He was actually at the 21st anniversary, and he was in charge of printer drivers and he was a neat guy.

3584
02:54:13,227 --> 02:54:18,567
He, uh, left Microsoft and went back to England and

3585
02:54:18,567 --> 02:54:20,027
um, I think he was from England

3586
02:54:20,027 --> 02:54:23,207
and started a company that does, um

3587
02:54:23,207 --> 02:54:27,267
I think it's sound and lighting control for

3588
02:54:27,267 --> 02:54:28,987
for, um, concerts.

3589
02:54:28,987 --> 02:54:29,487
Oh, yeah.

3590
02:54:29,487 --> 02:54:31,127
Great guy.

3591
02:54:31,127 --> 02:54:33,407
Anyway, he used to.

3592
02:54:33,407 --> 02:54:33,527
..

3593
02:54:33,527 --> 02:54:41,547
he'd run SLIM and he'd have like 10 or 15 copies of it running at once because that's the only way you could get any speed out of it.

3594
02:54:41,547 --> 02:54:45,807
Terrible.

3595
02:54:45,807 --> 02:54:48,407
That's why we had the streamlined utility for copying the kernel.

3596
02:54:48,407 --> 02:54:49,147
SUCK.

3597
02:54:49,147 --> 02:54:50,007
I remember that.

3598
02:54:50,007 --> 02:54:53,267
  Better than the fast u- utilities.

3599
02:54:53,267 --> 02:54:56,487
Well, Gordon Bell was definitely a mentor for me.

3600
02:54:56,487 --> 02:55:00,427
My coach in high school was definitely a men- mentor for me.

3601
02:55:00,427 --> 02:55:05,347
Um, other than that, I don't think I really have any mentors.

3602
02:55:05,347 --> 02:55:07,667
I mean, I never had anybody that

3603
02:55:07,667 --> 02:55:11,867
um, you know, I could go cry on their shoulder or- Right.

3604
02:55:11,867 --> 02:55:11,940
.

3605
02:55:11,940 --> 02:55:12,087
..

3606
02:55:12,087 --> 02:55:12,567
whatever.

3607
02:55:12,567 --> 02:55:16,627
Um, that was.

3608
02:55:16,627 --> 02:55:16,787
..

3609
02:55:16,787 --> 02:55:19,047
those events were more than a couple years apart.

3610
02:55:19,047 --> 02:55:19,387
Yeah.

3611
02:55:19,387 --> 02:55:20,584
I mean, I still Steve-.

3612
02:55:20,584 --> 02:55:20,687
..

3613
02:55:20,687 --> 02:55:22,927
see Steve once in a while and go to the basketball games with him.

3614
02:55:22,927 --> 02:55:25,087
Now that he owns the Clippers- Yeah.

3615
02:55:25,087 --> 02:55:25,087
.

3616
02:55:25,087 --> 02:55:25,087
.

3617
02:55:25,087 --> 02:55:27,727
and, um, play golf with him once in a while.

3618
02:55:27,727 --> 02:55:31,767
Not very often, but, um, you know

3619
02:55:31,767 --> 02:55:32,167
he's still.

3620
02:55:32,167 --> 02:55:32,227
..

3621
02:55:32,227 --> 02:55:36,407
I, I work directly for Steve for many years.

3622
02:55:36,407 --> 02:55:37,344
I work.

3623
02:55:37,344 --> 02:55:37,407
..

3624
02:55:37,407 --> 02:55:45,187
I started out working for Steve when I first went to the company and then they shuffled me over to Paul Maritz.

3625
02:55:45,187 --> 02:55:49,467
And then the one I really didn't like is when I got shuffled to Alton.

3626
02:55:49,467 --> 02:55:57,187
And then, uh, from there I went to Azure

3627
02:55:57,187 --> 02:55:58,927
which was totally different.

3628
02:55:58,927 --> 02:56:01,287
Wasn't any of those guys.

3629
02:56:01,287 --> 02:56:05,947
And then, I think when I went to Azure

3630
02:56:05,947 --> 02:56:07,827
I went back to reporting to Steve.

3631
02:56:07,827 --> 02:56:09,567
But by then, Steve is like the

3632
02:56:09,567 --> 02:56:11,047
the CEO of the company.

3633
02:56:11,047 --> 02:56:15,807
So I'm hanging off of this organization here and I never

3634
02:56:15,807 --> 02:56:17,387
never go to any of his meetings.

3635
02:56:17,387 --> 02:56:20,447
You know, never see him, but I report to him.

3636
02:56:20,447 --> 02:56:21,407
Sounds ideal, really.

3637
02:56:21,407 --> 02:56:22,227
 It was ideal.

3638
02:56:22,227 --> 02:56:23,893
Well, when he was.

3639
02:56:23,893 --> 02:56:24,047
..

3640
02:56:24,047 --> 02:56:26,267
when it came out that he was gonna leave

3641
02:56:26,267 --> 02:56:30,507
um, I sat down with him and said

3642
02:56:30,507 --> 02:56:37,347
"Hey, we gotta find somebody to be my boss because I don't want to end up in a situation where the new

3643
02:56:37,347 --> 02:56:40,607
the new CEO comes in here and, you know

3644
02:56:40,607 --> 02:56:44,447
of course he's gonna have to go around and glad-hand all of his direct reports.

3645
02:56:44,447 --> 02:56:50,655
He's gonna come and glad-hand me and then I'm not gonna show up at one of his executive meetings and he's gonna wonder why I'm not there.

3646
02:56:50,655 --> 02:56:53,427
" I said, "We gotta find somebody that's in the know here

3647
02:56:53,427 --> 02:56:53,738
right?

3648
02:56:53,738 --> 02:56:57,267
"   So he did, and I worked for somebody else for a while.

3649
02:56:57,267 --> 02:57:01,147
Um, and now I work for, uh

3650
02:57:01,147 --> 02:57:04,827
Phil Spencer, who is the VP of

3651
02:57:04,827 --> 02:57:07,587
of the Xbox division.

3652
02:57:07,587 --> 02:57:08,835
Okay.

3653
02:57:08,835 --> 02:57:11,863
How big was your org when you finally went individual contributor?

3654
02:57:11,863 --> 02:57:13,923
What was the biggest org when you had all of NT done?

3655
02:57:13,923 --> 02:57:15,743
About four, four, 450.

3656
02:57:15,743 --> 02:57:19,083
I did that after NT40.

3657
02:57:19,083 --> 02:57:19,763
Okay.

3658
02:57:19,763 --> 02:57:21,115
Uh.

3659
02:57:21,115 --> 02:57:21,323
..

3660
02:57:21,323 --> 02:57:26,156
I said, "I want, I don't want any more of this.

3661
02:57:26,156 --> 02:57:31,084
" And everything was growing at a prodigious rate.

3662
02:57:31,084 --> 02:57:37,963
Um, and everything really took off with NT at NT40.

3663
02:57:37,963 --> 02:57:41,984
Um, that's when we began to ship a lot of systems.

3664
02:57:41,984 --> 02:57:47,043
So a company like that, is there a big downside to not being an empire builder?

3665
02:57:47,043 --> 02:57:51,584
Well, I think it goes down to where your talents lie.

3666
02:57:51,584 --> 02:57:52,123
Right.

3667
02:57:52,123 --> 02:57:58,204
You know, if, if you've got, if you've got good currency that's outside of that

3668
02:57:58,204 --> 02:57:59,424
I don't think it makes any difference.

3669
02:57:59,424 --> 02:58:00,483
Yeah, a good point.

3670
02:58:00,483 --> 02:58:05,683
Um, but if you don't, then you better find some that you.

3671
02:58:05,683 --> 02:58:05,763
..

3672
02:58:05,763 --> 02:58:10,423
If you wanna grow like that, you better find  somewhere where you can go where you can actually do that.

3673
02:58:10,423 --> 02:58:10,763
Right.

3674
02:58:10,763 --> 02:58:14,044
That's, I think the reason I had the

3675
02:58:14,044 --> 02:58:18,504
the limited success I had with race car driving as late in my life as I did it

3676
02:58:18,504 --> 02:58:21,484
was just being able to focus on what you're doing.

3677
02:58:21,484 --> 02:58:23,291
So when you code, are you that.

3678
02:58:23,291 --> 02:58:23,423
..

3679
02:58:23,423 --> 02:58:26,283
Can you multitask or are you a one thing at a time kinda guy

3680
02:58:26,283 --> 02:58:27,583
and don't distract me, and.

3681
02:58:27,583 --> 02:58:27,703
..

3682
02:58:27,703 --> 02:58:32,527
Well, I'm sorta like, um.

3683
02:58:32,527 --> 02:58:32,744
..

3684
02:58:32,744 --> 02:58:40,484
I think multitasking is good, but I think that the highest productivity is not multitasking

3685
02:58:40,484 --> 02:58:43,823
because it does take some time to context switch.

3686
02:58:43,823 --> 02:58:44,183
Right.

3687
02:58:44,183 --> 02:58:54,884
Um, I do work, I do do multitasking because there'll be a sp- a problem somewhere that I'm not working on

3688
02:58:54,884 --> 02:58:58,723
and that somebody had a problem and I'll go f- try to fix it or whatever.

3689
02:58:58,723 --> 02:59:02,783
Um, but in general, I'm working on

3690
02:59:02,783 --> 02:59:04,123
you know, one thing.

3691
02:59:04,123 --> 02:59:10,903
Um, right now I'm, we're, we're trying to get in the

3692
02:59:10,903 --> 02:59:16,283
in the game VM space, we're running a Linux VM

3693
02:59:16,283 --> 02:59:25,680
and we're running a Linux VM there to be able to take advantage of some of the spare cycles we have in the data center with.

3694
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:25,863
..

3695
02:59:25,863 --> 02:59:30,043
The consoles we're running there in something called xCloud.

3696
02:59:30,043 --> 02:59:31,463
Have you heard anything about xCloud?

3697
02:59:31,463 --> 02:59:31,903
No.

3698
02:59:31,903 --> 02:59:45,283
xCloud is basically taking Xbox consoles, reke- repackaging them into a rack and putting them in the data center and giving people remote access to them.

3699
02:59:45,283 --> 02:59:50,183
So that allows them to play basically the triple A rated games

3700
02:59:50,183 --> 02:59:53,703
the really high performance, high graphics resolution games.

3701
02:59:53,703 --> 02:59:57,443
Well, but they're single tenet systems.

3702
02:59:57,443 --> 02:59:58,823
Right?

3703
02:59:58,823 --> 03:00:00,823
One person can be playing one console.

3704
03:00:00,823 --> 03:00:01,483
Right.

3705
03:00:01,483 --> 03:00:02,643
So you have to have a lot of them.

3706
03:00:02,643 --> 03:00:07,623
And so there becomes a question about what to do about the duty cycle of those

3707
03:00:07,623 --> 03:00:13,223
because, um, people don't play 24 hours a day.

3708
03:00:13,223 --> 03:00:13,703
Right.

3709
03:00:13,703 --> 03:00:16,323
So there's a, there's a bunch of idle time.

3710
03:00:16,323 --> 03:00:21,143
So our plan is, is to run

3711
03:00:21,143 --> 03:00:32,303
um, AI and machine learning workloads that are Microsoft specific on those systems in the off hours.

3712
03:00:32,303 --> 03:00:34,223
So that's what I've been working on.

3713
03:00:34,223 --> 03:00:40,683
And it's, uh, the first part of that was to get Linux to run with the Xbox Hypervisor

3714
03:00:40,683 --> 03:00:45,563
and then the second part of that has been to get the graphic stack running.

3715
03:00:45,563 --> 03:00:46,936
And.

3716
03:00:46,936 --> 03:00:47,183
..

3717
03:00:47,183 --> 03:00:51,143
it seems like I've been working on this forever.

3718
03:00:51,143 --> 03:00:53,303
Longer than VMS.

3719
03:00:53,303 --> 03:00:57,463
 So, you know, the, the

3720
03:00:57,463 --> 03:01:01,463
the University of Washington built a new computer science building a few years ago.

3721
03:01:01,463 --> 03:01:01,783
Yeah.

3722
03:01:01,783 --> 03:01:04,043
And I made a donation to the, to the thing and

3723
03:01:04,043 --> 03:01:06,443
and they're gonna, so they're gonna name a room

3724
03:01:06,443 --> 03:01:08,623
uh, actually a laboratory after me.

3725
03:01:08,623 --> 03:01:15,463
And I said that I'd do that, but I wanted them to put a slogan on the wall in the laboratory.

3726
03:01:15,463 --> 03:01:16,243
This is a big lab.

3727
03:01:16,243 --> 03:01:19,663
This is probably, maybe 50 by 50.

3728
03:01:19,663 --> 03:01:20,503
So it's a big lab.

3729
03:01:20,503 --> 03:01:24,243
And the, the, the slogan is, "If you don't put 'em in

3730
03:01:24,243 --> 03:01:25,655
you don't have to take 'em out.

3731
03:01:25,655 --> 03:01:32,249
" Yeah, it's hard to do, especially when you're younger and just starting and haven't paid the price of having to fix- You know- .

3732
03:01:32,249 --> 03:01:32,263
..

3733
03:01:32,263 --> 03:01:32,823
your own shit.

3734
03:01:32,823 --> 03:01:32,909
.

3735
03:01:32,909 --> 03:01:33,083
..

3736
03:01:33,083 --> 03:01:37,523
when I started, the debugging tools were so bad

3737
03:01:37,523 --> 03:01:43,483
so bad that I don't know how anybody could have that philosophy at that time

3738
03:01:43,483 --> 03:01:44,743
because- Right.

3739
03:01:44,743 --> 03:01:44,749
.

3740
03:01:44,749 --> 03:01:44,763
..

3741
03:01:44,763 --> 03:01:48,143
it was so hard to find a problem.

3742
03:01:48,143 --> 03:01:49,943
I mean, really hard.

3743
03:01:49,943 --> 03:01:51,783
I was telling you, I'm working on this KIM-1

3744
03:01:51,783 --> 03:01:55,403
which is a single board 6502, 64K flat model

3745
03:01:55,403 --> 03:01:57,143
but there's no debugging, there's no printf's.

3746
03:01:57,143 --> 03:01:59,783
It's got a hex keypad as your, pretty much your entry point to it.

3747
03:01:59,783 --> 03:02:02,583
Um, and so when you write code for that-  .

3748
03:02:02,583 --> 03:02:02,583
..

3749
03:02:02,583 --> 03:02:05,463
you have to be excruciatingly careful because the turnaround time is a mess.

3750
03:02:05,463 --> 03:02:05,843
Right.

3751
03:02:05,843 --> 03:02:07,603
But once you get the simulator on the desktop

3752
03:02:07,603 --> 03:02:09,403
then it's like, make run, make run

3753
03:02:09,403 --> 03:02:09,783
make run.

3754
03:02:09,783 --> 03:02:11,263
It's very easy to go back and forth.

3755
03:02:11,263 --> 03:02:11,283
Right.

3756
03:02:11,283 --> 03:02:12,843
And it totally changes the way you code

3757
03:02:12,843 --> 03:02:13,003
so.

3758
03:02:13,003 --> 03:02:17,063
The tools that we use today have, um

3759
03:02:17,063 --> 03:02:21,845
become so, um, functional that.

3760
03:02:21,845 --> 03:02:22,023
..

3761
03:02:22,023 --> 03:02:30,583
And, and a lot of the stuff that's been done has been aimed at trying to cut down on some of the little errors that people would make that

3762
03:02:30,583 --> 03:02:33,403
that aren't ma- they aren't re- like logic errors.

3763
03:02:33,403 --> 03:02:37,143
They're just errors that they make because they're just

3764
03:02:37,143 --> 03:02:39,329
um, they're not.

3765
03:02:39,329 --> 03:02:39,403
..

3766
03:02:39,403 --> 03:02:42,023
That their, their attention to detail isn't good enough or something.

3767
03:02:42,023 --> 03:02:44,063
And so a lot of that stuff's gone.

3768
03:02:44,063 --> 03:02:46,083
So I would say that, yeah, there's

3769
03:02:46,083 --> 03:02:50,623
there's not as much emphasis on quality, um

3770
03:02:50,623 --> 03:02:54,694
as there was when you were working with these machines where there's like.

3771
03:02:54,694 --> 03:02:54,763
..

3772
03:02:54,763 --> 03:02:59,203
Basically, sometimes, you know, the only way you could do anything is with a scope.

3773
03:02:59,203 --> 03:03:03,743
Hardware lan- a logic analyzer, and you're looking at it and saying

3774
03:03:03,743 --> 03:03:04,826
"Oh, well, you know.

3775
03:03:04,826 --> 03:03:08,143
" I was looking at an old Burroughs.

3776
03:03:08,143 --> 03:03:11,443
I think it's a Burroughs, and they had all the scope hookup points right inside the door

3777
03:03:11,443 --> 03:03:14,263
'cause you're just gonna have to always resort to it apparently

3778
03:03:14,263 --> 03:03:15,769
so.

3779
03:03:15,769 --> 03:03:18,131
I w- never worked on a Burroughs machine.

3780
03:03:18,131 --> 03:03:20,432
I did work on that Bunk & Ramo

3781
03:03:20,432 --> 03:03:24,032
which was kind of a  funny machine.

3782
03:03:24,032 --> 03:03:25,051
What about a Bendix?

3783
03:03:25,051 --> 03:03:26,171
Have you ever worked on a Bendix?

3784
03:03:26,171 --> 03:03:26,511
No?

3785
03:03:26,511 --> 03:03:28,031
That's vacuum tube days.

3786
03:03:28,031 --> 03:03:28,891
That's getting old, but.

3787
03:03:28,891 --> 03:03:29,011
..

3788
03:03:29,011 --> 03:03:30,771
That was before me.

3789
03:03:30,771 --> 03:03:32,172
Bendix was a drum machine.

3790
03:03:32,172 --> 03:03:32,492
Yeah.

3791
03:03:32,492 --> 03:03:34,931
That was the m- that was the main memory was drum

3792
03:03:34,931 --> 03:03:35,431
I think.

3793
03:03:35,431 --> 03:03:37,252
Yeah, it, it wrote, wrote and rewrote the drum every time.

3794
03:03:37,252 --> 03:03:38,992
It ro- rotated in e- e- the way you

3795
03:03:38,992 --> 03:03:46,011
you, the way you put your program on the drum was to try to make it so that when you finished the instruction execution

3796
03:03:46,011 --> 03:03:48,932
the drum had rotated to pick up the next instruction.

3797
03:03:48,932 --> 03:03:52,315
Yeah, well, the, they're all written on this drum and the drum's spinning at 3

3798
03:03:52,315 --> 03:03:54,471
000 RPM or some incredible speed and.

3799
03:03:54,471 --> 03:03:54,592
..

3800
03:03:54,592 --> 03:04:00,891
Those, those drums, the, the Bendix drum probably wasn't that fast.

3801
03:04:00,891 --> 03:04:01,211
 No.

3802
03:04:01,211 --> 03:04:02,751
I've never seen one running.

3803
03:04:02,751 --> 03:04:04,492
They're always crashed by the time I've ever seen one.

3804
03:04:04,492 --> 03:04:09,312
The 1108 had some drums that were just unbelievable.

3805
03:04:09,312 --> 03:04:10,592
They were word addressable.

3806
03:04:10,592 --> 03:04:16,311
Uh, they had three tracks per, uh

3807
03:04:16,311 --> 03:04:16,951
word.

3808
03:04:16,951 --> 03:04:18,291
A word was 36 bits.

3809
03:04:18,291 --> 03:04:21,871
So they're pulling off 12 bits in each track.

3810
03:04:21,871 --> 03:04:25,931
It was a 7500 RPM disc or drum

3811
03:04:25,931 --> 03:04:27,591
drum, and it was canonical.

3812
03:04:27,591 --> 03:04:32,771
So when it spun, it rose up like this to the heads

3813
03:04:32,771 --> 03:04:35,571
and if it lost speed, it dropped so- Okay.

3814
03:04:35,571 --> 03:04:35,571
.

3815
03:04:35,571 --> 03:04:35,571
.

3816
03:04:35,571 --> 03:04:37,131
that they didn't have head crashes.

3817
03:04:37,131 --> 03:04:39,025
What.

3818
03:04:39,025 --> 03:04:39,191
..

3819
03:04:39,191 --> 03:04:41,311
And it was just lightning fast in those days.

3820
03:04:41,311 --> 03:04:43,091
This was, uh, in the late '60s.

3821
03:04:43,091 --> 03:04:48,225
I don't know what the acc-.

3822
03:04:48,225 --> 03:04:48,311
..

3823
03:04:48,311 --> 03:04:53,771
Oh, the minimum access time of those things was like three milliseconds or something like that.

3824
03:04:53,771 --> 03:04:54,651
That was minimum.

3825
03:04:54,651 --> 03:04:57,571
No, maximum was pro- was a full rotation.

3826
03:04:57,571 --> 03:04:57,891
Rotation, yeah.

3827
03:04:57,891 --> 03:05:01,211
So, uh, and today it's, like

3828
03:05:01,211 --> 03:05:04,031
everything's SSDs today, so they're zero.

3829
03:05:04,031 --> 03:05:04,751
Right.

3830
03:05:04,751 --> 03:05:07,751
It's whatever the SSD's time is, so

3831
03:05:07,751 --> 03:05:09,991
boy does that make a difference.

3832
03:05:09,991 --> 03:05:10,551
Yeah.

3833
03:05:10,551 --> 03:05:14,691
How much vacation time you taking these days?

3834
03:05:14,691 --> 03:05:17,651
About the same as I've always taken.

3835
03:05:17,651 --> 03:05:22,851
You know, I, um, I take about six weeks a year probably.

3836
03:05:22,851 --> 03:05:28,311
 Um, basically I, I'm either on vacation or I'm at work.

3837
03:05:28,311 --> 03:05:28,771
Yeah.

3838
03:05:28,771 --> 03:05:29,951
Or I'm riding my bike.

3839
03:05:29,951 --> 03:05:30,311
Yeah.

3840
03:05:30,311 --> 03:05:31,311
One of the three things.

3841
03:05:31,311 --> 03:05:36,291
So, um, we have a place in Hawaii we

3842
03:05:36,291 --> 03:05:39,751
we try to go to about a one week a month through the winter.

3843
03:05:39,751 --> 03:05:40,171
Oh.

3844
03:05:40,171 --> 03:05:43,091
And then the summer is here, so.

3845
03:05:43,091 --> 03:05:43,331
..

3846
03:05:43,331 --> 03:05:45,331
And I'm still working.

3847
03:05:45,331 --> 03:05:47,571
Um, and I don't know what I'd do.

3848
03:05:47,571 --> 03:05:50,091
If I had a garage like this and interest that you have

3849
03:05:50,091 --> 03:05:51,591
then I'd be not working.

3850
03:05:51,591 --> 03:05:52,111
Right.

3851
03:05:52,111 --> 03:05:55,151
But I don't, so- Yeah.

3852
03:05:55,151 --> 03:05:57,891
Um, I'd be lost at home.

3853
03:05:57,891 --> 03:05:59,581
I'd, like, "What am I gonna do?

3854
03:05:59,581 --> 03:06:06,211
" Did you ever, um, get a chance to go down to The Living Computer Museum?

3855
03:06:06,211 --> 03:06:06,851
I did.

3856
03:06:06,851 --> 03:06:07,991
I saw it before it closed.

3857
03:06:07,991 --> 03:06:10,231
It was really impressive, especially because everything runs.

3858
03:06:10,231 --> 03:06:11,651
It's not just a static display.

3859
03:06:11,651 --> 03:06:13,211
Or at that time everything ran.

3860
03:06:13,211 --> 03:06:18,031
Rob Short and I were down there one time when they gave us a private tour

3861
03:06:18,031 --> 03:06:28,611
and, um, they have, they had at that time one of the basement floors was absolutely packed with equipment.

3862
03:06:28,611 --> 03:06:33,931
They had a lot of DEC systems, a lot of old PP8s and

3863
03:06:33,931 --> 03:06:35,551
um, PP11s.

3864
03:06:35,551 --> 03:06:38,811
Um, some 9s, some 15s.

3865
03:06:38,811 --> 03:06:40,571
I don't remember seeing any VAXes.

3866
03:06:40,571 --> 03:06:44,251
But I really like that museum, and the

3867
03:06:44,251 --> 03:06:45,848
the fact that they closed that and they.

3868
03:06:45,848 --> 03:06:45,911
..

3869
03:06:45,911 --> 03:06:49,951
uh, it doesn't look like there's any real plan to reopen it.

3870
03:06:49,951 --> 03:06:54,111
No, I've tried to find out what's going on and I haven't been able to find out anything

3871
03:06:54,111 --> 03:06:54,699
so.

3872
03:06:54,699 --> 03:06:54,891
..

3873
03:06:54,891 --> 03:06:57,111
I guess he didn't fund it, Paul

3874
03:06:57,111 --> 03:06:59,031
uh, Paul and his sister in law had tried to- He didn't

3875
03:06:59,031 --> 03:07:00,911
he didn't fund it in his will, apparently.

3876
03:07:00,911 --> 03:07:01,271
Yeah.

3877
03:07:01,271 --> 03:07:05,931
And which is funny because, uh, that must have been just an oversight that he didn't do that.

3878
03:07:05,931 --> 03:07:09,811
I- But he didn't do it with his movie theater and he didn't do it with his other thing that he had

3879
03:07:09,811 --> 03:07:11,731
so it seems like he didn't make any plans

3880
03:07:11,731 --> 03:07:12,671
which is weird.

3881
03:07:12,671 --> 03:07:18,451
Well, I like to go d- I like to go down there and look at those old machines.

3882
03:07:18,451 --> 03:07:21,611
And, you know, you, the- the Computer Museum

3883
03:07:21,611 --> 03:07:25,431
The Computer History Museum now is, um

3884
03:07:25,431 --> 03:07:31,751
all towards, um, whatever is the state of the art now and the

3885
03:07:31,751 --> 03:07:33,931
what people are interested in computing now.

3886
03:07:33,931 --> 03:07:36,571
And, and I like to look at the old stuff.

3887
03:07:36,571 --> 03:07:37,011
Yeah.

3888
03:07:37,011 --> 03:07:40,671
And see- I'm doing an episode on IBM hardware

3889
03:07:40,671 --> 03:07:44,311
so I went down to The Computer History Museum in Mountain View

3890
03:07:44,311 --> 03:07:45,611
the one you're a fellow at.

3891
03:07:45,611 --> 03:07:48,171
Or your picture's on the wall anyway, I remember that.

3892
03:07:48,171 --> 03:07:49,243
Um.

3893
03:07:49,243 --> 03:07:49,491
..

3894
03:07:49,491 --> 03:07:52,411
That's got to be The Computer History Museum then.

3895
03:07:52,411 --> 03:07:53,711
Yeah, which one were you talking about?

3896
03:07:53,711 --> 03:07:54,991
That's what I was talking about.

3897
03:07:54,991 --> 03:07:56,151
Local here or down in Mountain View?

3898
03:07:56,151 --> 03:07:58,691
No, no, down there is a Computer History Museum.

3899
03:07:58,691 --> 03:07:59,211
Oh, okay.

3900
03:07:59,211 --> 03:08:00,771
There- Here is The Living Computer Museum.

3901
03:08:00,771 --> 03:08:02,831
And this one up here is The Living History Computer Museum.

3902
03:08:02,831 --> 03:08:03,271
Okay.

3903
03:08:03,271 --> 03:08:04,811
So I've been to both, yes.

3904
03:08:04,811 --> 03:08:06,411
Um-  Yes.

3905
03:08:06,411 --> 03:08:07,551
Oh yeah, so I went through and I

3906
03:08:07,551 --> 03:08:09,211
I docu- or I filmed all the old

3907
03:08:09,211 --> 03:08:11,871
you know, the 1104 and all the old IBMs along the way

3908
03:08:11,871 --> 03:08:15,551
and I'm going out to Poughkeepsie in two weeks to see what their current state of the art is.

3909
03:08:15,551 --> 03:08:17,671
'Cause I haven't been in an IBM data center in 30 years

3910
03:08:17,671 --> 03:08:20,011
so I have no idea what they're making.

3911
03:08:20,011 --> 03:08:25,491
But I did an old episode on PC versus mainframe and what the fundamental differences are

3912
03:08:25,491 --> 03:08:31,111
and I think I joked that I wish IBM would send me an old System/360 or something for the shop.

3913
03:08:31,111 --> 03:08:35,911
And they actually called and they were talking about it but the power requirements are a bit much and they're three-phase and

3914
03:08:35,911 --> 03:08:36,795
um.

3915
03:08:36,795 --> 03:08:36,971
..

3916
03:08:36,971 --> 03:08:40,711
figured out you could actually run it but it's easier just to go on tour what they've got rather than.

3917
03:08:40,711 --> 03:08:40,791
..

3918
03:08:40,791 --> 03:08:47,451
My buddy down the road, he had a shop here and he just had a big one-phase motor spinning a big three-phase motor- Yeah.

3919
03:08:47,451 --> 03:08:47,504
.

3920
03:08:47,504 --> 03:08:47,611
..

3921
03:08:47,611 --> 03:08:52,411
and it would spin the three phase mo- three-phase motor backwards and the leads came off and it ran his mill and his

3922
03:08:52,411 --> 03:08:53,611
all his equipment.

3923
03:08:53,611 --> 03:08:54,351
Worked fine.

3924
03:08:54,351 --> 03:08:55,964
 So-  Surprised me, but.

3925
03:08:55,964 --> 03:08:56,071
..

3926
03:08:56,071 --> 03:08:58,811
Well, there's a lot of interesting old

3927
03:08:58,811 --> 03:09:00,111
uh, IBM stuff.

3928
03:09:00,111 --> 03:09:00,779
Um.

3929
03:09:00,779 --> 03:09:01,051
..

3930
03:09:01,051 --> 03:09:06,511
I mean, I would m- I would be most interested in seeing some of their old stuff like

3931
03:09:06,511 --> 03:09:07,291
uh, Stretch.

3932
03:09:07,291 --> 03:09:08,151
Yeah.

3933
03:09:08,151 --> 03:09:13,011
Um, and some of the stuff, the 709

3934
03:09:13,011 --> 03:09:16,931
704, some of those machines.

3935
03:09:16,931 --> 03:09:22,631
Um, I, I did work on the 7044 which was sort of a

3936
03:09:22,631 --> 03:09:25,971
an offshoot I think of the 7094.

3937
03:09:25,971 --> 03:09:28,231
Anyway, they're all 36-bit machines.

3938
03:09:28,231 --> 03:09:30,211
All those original machines were 36 bits.

3939
03:09:30,211 --> 03:09:31,231
Why 36?

3940
03:09:31,231 --> 03:09:33,271
Is that what you need for precision when you convert to floating-point?

3941
03:09:33,271 --> 03:09:33,575
It was sp- yeah, we.

3942
03:09:33,575 --> 03:09:33,671
..

3943
03:09:33,671 --> 03:09:34,951
It was floating-point precision.

3944
03:09:34,951 --> 03:09:39,131
IBM came out with the 360.

3945
03:09:39,131 --> 03:09:43,591
You know, they came out with a 24-bit mantissa with a hidden bit.

3946
03:09:43,591 --> 03:09:46,971
The 36-bit floating point did not have a hidden bit.

3947
03:09:46,971 --> 03:09:48,951
You mean the implied first bit or whatever?

3948
03:09:48,951 --> 03:09:49,291
Yeah.

3949
03:09:49,291 --> 03:09:49,551
Yeah.

3950
03:09:49,551 --> 03:09:50,851
It was not hidden.

3951
03:09:50,851 --> 03:09:55,471
So the mantissa was the mantissa, period.

3952
03:09:55,471 --> 03:10:02,911
And the, the IBM system came out with a hidden bit which gave them one more bit of precision

3953
03:10:02,911 --> 03:10:07,291
but 24 bits is still pretty s- pretty slim.

3954
03:10:07,291 --> 03:10:11,151
And even, I mean, people complain about 64 bits

3955
03:10:11,151 --> 03:10:16,171
either range-wise or precision-wise, one of the two.

3956
03:10:16,171 --> 03:10:19,511
 Maybe you try it.

3957
03:10:19,511 --> 03:10:23,931
Maybe you- Maybe you try it.

3958
03:10:23,931 --> 03:10:25,051
Maybe you-
