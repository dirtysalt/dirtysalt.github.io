1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,711
Have you had Guinness before?

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,588
I have actually never had a beer in my entire life.

3
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:07,090
All right, well, you're starting with the best beer—

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,925
So that's good.

5
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,260
You order your Amazon packages with Devin?

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,094
Yeah.

7
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,220
So you're just in Slack

8
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,388
and you ask it to buy something for you?

9
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,222
Yeah, just,

10
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,391
@Devin, can you go buy some more whiteboards for us?

11
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,225
Or something like that.

12
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,060
I really enjoyed math competitions

13
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,687
and going and competing and doing these things.

14
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,274
And this is stuff like, if I ask you, "What's 694 squared."

15
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,903
It is 481636.

16
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,573
I have shuffled the cards. I am not collaborating.

17
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,782
We give them to Scott.

18
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,867
So now you have six cards

19
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,119
and you're trying to make 163, right?

20
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,704
And one way that you could do that here

21
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,330
is two times 8 is 16.

22
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,957
9 divided by 3 is 3.

23
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,042
3 plus 16 is 19.

24
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,668
12 times 12 is 144.

25
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,171
144 plus 19 is 163.

26
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,547
And so almost all combinations can be—

27
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
But you're probably thinking like, "I could have done that.

28
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,675
That's too easy."

29
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,138
Let me just tip it upside down like that.

30
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,141
Very good.

31
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,602
Scott Wu is the co-founder and CEO of Cognition,

32
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,645
which makes Devin, the AI coding agent.

33
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,647
Scott is a triple IOI gold medal winner

34
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,191
and kind of famous for being a math whiz.

35
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,776
And now he's at the cutting edge

36
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,235
of agentic software development.

37
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,487
Cheers.

38
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,529
All right. Cheers.

39
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,742
Tell me about your upbringing and all the math stuff.

40
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,827
I feel like you're known for the math stuff these days.

41
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:22,040
Yeah, so I grew up, I'm from Baton Rouge.

42
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,292
My parents were both chemical engineers

43
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,796
and so they immigrated from China for grad school.

44
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,714
And then naturally when they were looking for jobs,

45
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,050
they were doing air emissions permitting

46
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,884
and things like that.

47
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,887
Louisiana has a lot of oil and gas

48
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,388
and so that's kind of how we ended up—

49
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,598
I love the air missions too, actually.

50
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,516
Yeah.

51
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,142
And so that's how we ended up there.

52
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,936
I always loved math as a kid.

53
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,521
I had an older brother named Neal.

54
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,942
Super, super close, the whole way through.

55
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,277
And Neal was about five years older than me.

56
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,863
Neal started doing math competitions

57
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,240
when he was in middle school.

58
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,033
And so he would've been in sixth grade

59
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,701
and I was in first grade at the time.

60
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,703
And naturally I, as a little brother,

61
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,873
would go and just watch what he was doing

62
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,500
and try to learn some of the same math too.

63
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,377
And that's kind of how I first got into math.

64
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,711
And then,

65
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,672
I found that I really enjoyed math competitions

66
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,340
and going and competing and doing these things.

67
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,052
And this is stuff like, if I ask you, "What's 694 squared?"

68
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,973
I think it's probably not quite things

69
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,307
of that nature.

70
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,685
It is 481636.

71
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,061
But it's things

72
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,105
math puzzles, things like,

73
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,107
the frog that's like going up

74
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,025
and then every night falls down the well.

75
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,860
And how many nights,

76
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,403
these kinds of things where you get to—

77
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,821
On the log.

78
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,655
Yeah

79
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,699
Where you kind of get to do the critical thinking

80
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,701
and come up with interesting ideas and stuff like that.

81
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:43,037
So I started doing math competitions in second grade.

82
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:47,375
I remember there was a contest at the local college

83
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,209
that I went to,

84
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,753
which was for middle schoolers and high schoolers.

85
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,006
I competed in the seventh grade math division

86
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,007
as a second grader.

87
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,010
I did the competition.

88
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,969
It was my first time doing any of these.

89
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,387
I just really liked math and stuff.

90
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,139
And then they were calling out third place,

91
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,432
second place, first place.

92
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,142
And none of them were me.

93
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,936
I still just remember, I was so upset.

94
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,770
That's your super villain origin story.

95
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,938
Yeah, exactly.

96
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,565
That's how it all began, basically.

97
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,066
So then I trained a bunch,

98
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,443
the next year I was in third grade

99
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,695
and I competed in algebra one or something

100
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,322
and I won that year.

101
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,948
Then I basically kept doing

102
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,158
math competitions from there.

103
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,367
My last year of high school,

104
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,827
which would've been my junior year.

105
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,828
I left a year early.

106
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,580
But I did IOI the programming.

107
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,748
Yeah.

108
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,250
I did IOI three times, and I got gold, yeah.

109
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,044
So, where'd you go to school?

110
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,130
I took a year off actually.

111
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,882
I left high school a year early.

112
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,508
I wasn't that good at school, I guess.

113
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,885
I left high school a year earlier—

114
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,178
Obviously, that's surprising,

115
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,304
you weren't that good at school.

116
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,180
Well, I

117
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,932
I wasn't that good at finishing school.

118
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,516
I have a middle school degree, but,

119
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,685
I didn't really make it through high school or college.

120
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,604
So I left high school a year early.

121
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,731
I spent a year actually in the Bay

122
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,691
working at a company called Addepar.

123
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,943
And I did that as a software engineer.

124
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,486
That was back in 2014.

125
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,487
Yeah, wow, that was a blast from the past.

126
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,239
Yeah, it was a while ago.

127
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,657
And then after that I decided,

128
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,450
OK, I will go try out college after all

129
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,284
and see what that's like.

130
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,036
I went to Harvard for two years and then I dropped out.

131
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:05,870
How did you end up at Addepar?

132
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,705
And that's very forward thinking of them, obviously,

133
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,875
that they took on a high school aged, high school dropout.

134
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,876
Yeah. It was a fun group.

135
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,213
Funnily enough there were four of us

136
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:20,218
who started at the same time as high schoolers.

137
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,847
It was myself, Alexandr Wang is another one.

138
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,474
We started on the same day.

139
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,394
Eugene Chen, who's now running Phoenix DEX,

140
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,645
and then Sreenath Are,

141
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,066
who's most recently at Sandbar as the CEO.

142
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,235
Wait, sorry, this is a real small group theory moment.

143
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,861
So you and Alex were in the same—

144
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,113
That's right.

145
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,947
So we knew each other,

146
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,781
we met in middle school.

147
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,741
Alex now of Meta.

148
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,867
Now of Meta. That's right.

149
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,619
MSL, I guess. Yeah.

150
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,747
We met in sixth grade.

151
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,457
He was from New Mexico, I was from Louisiana,

152
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,043
but we met in this math competition called MATHCOUNTS.

153
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,587
We were both at the national competition,

154
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,214
and then we started talking.

155
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,092
Google Hangouts was the thing at the time.

156
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,468
It turns out there's some math in AI.

157
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,303
Yeah, this may be an—

158
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,512
Yeah, it's a fun thing.

159
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,848
Well, a lot of the folks, as it turns out

160
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,892
from our vintage ended up being—

161
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,103
I think there's like a real infectiousness of,

162
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,688
being entrepreneurial too.

163
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,231
I think Alex deserves a lot of credit for,

164
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,941
I'd say being the first of our group.

165
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,110
Alex Wang got you into the idea of starting a company.

166
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,115
Yeah, somehow I think there's definitely a bunch

167
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,367
of that involved, for sure.

168
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,119
But also, a lot of folks,

169
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,121
Johnny Ho, who is one of the cofounders of Perplexity,

170
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,832
for example, Demi Guo, who started Pika,

171
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,834
a lot of these...

172
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,045
Jesse Zhang who started Decagon.

173
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,756
A lot of us were actually competing in these math

174
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,674
and programming competitions in the same year.

175
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,842
And we all knew each other.

176
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,136
OK, so this gets something I was wondering.

177
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:45,970
There's this topic

178
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,389
that people talked about a while back

179
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,976
of, where are the young founders?

180
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,312
There always used to be people

181
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,398
in their early twenties working on breakout companies.

182
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,275
Michael Dell was 19 when he started Dell.

183
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,651
23 when he took it public.

184
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,362
Obviously, Mark Zuckerberg was very young

185
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,030
when he started working on Facebook.

186
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,615
And when it was a real breakout,

187
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,491
he was still very young.

188
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,369
And there was a period where there was no young founders.

189
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,621
And now there's many, many more,

190
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,748
like a whole bunch of the people that you mentioned.

191
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,918
You're 28, running Cognition.

192
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,087
Is the presence of young people as founders

193
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,799
of leading companies a biomarker

194
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,677
for industry vibrancy? Where,

195
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,931
Michael Dell was young during the takeoff of the PC era

196
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,391
and, Mark Zuckerberg was young

197
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,810
during the takeoff of social networking,

198
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,229
and now we're in the takeoff of AI coding tools.

199
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,313
I should just say,

200
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,648
I appreciate you calling me young.

201
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,483
I think relative to being 18 or 19,

202
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,235
is still a long way.

203
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,237
The test is in your twenties.

204
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,406
So I have a take on this,

205
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,199
and I'm curious to hear yours on this.

206
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,867
I've been thinking about this question as well,

207
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,328
and my take is actually just that overall

208
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,789
being a founder has just gotten harder.

209
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,165
That's probably the biggest,

210
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,250
the highest order of it.

211
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,252
I think the reason that young founders

212
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,546
who are just really sharp and really determined,

213
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,632
did very well is because at the end of the day,

214
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,927
being a good first principles thinker does beat experience,

215
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,054
and just a lot of being a founder

216
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,014
is doing something that has never existed before

217
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,225
and coming to your own conclusions.

218
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,353
The thing is now there's a lot of people who have both,

219
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,647
the first principles thinking and the experience.

220
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:23,025
And I think things have gotten a lot more...

221
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,485
call it mature as a space.

222
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,611
And so

223
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,988
basically it's gotten harder.

224
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,030
So there are fewer

225
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,158
that are literally coming out of college.

226
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,703
It feels hard to make the claim that,

227
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,833
it was easy to start a leading business in prior eras.

228
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,544
Facebook faced lots of competition.

229
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,963
It's not like Dell was the only PC maker.

230
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,340
I don't think they had it easy

231
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,968
by any stretch of the imagination.

232
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,303
However, I think you are getting at something

233
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,640
where clearly all the large companies these days,

234
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,768
they're very aware,

235
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,896
they're very connected with the ecosystem.

236
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,565
If you look at Satya or Mark Zuckerberg,

237
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,817
they are very aware of everything that's going on AI,

238
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,277
and they're paying a lot of attention to it.

239
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,322
And so yeah, maybe there aren't giant opportunities

240
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,740
that are just being left on the ground

241
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,116
by the big established companies.

242
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,826
Yeah, and maybe harder is not the right word.

243
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,120
It's more just that the space is a bit more mature

244
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,622
and there's more of a playbook

245
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,499
and more existing knowledge.

246
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,791
There's obviously something unique

247
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,835
with every business, but lot of the details of,

248
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,296
"Here's how you should structure equity,

249
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,423
here's how you should figure out, fundraising,

250
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,467
here's how you should hire your initial team."

251
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,135
Many of these things I think do carry over a lot

252
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,804
with experience. Where,

253
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,764
I think in previous areas

254
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,933
where the book wasn't written at all almost,

255
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,269
so it just came down to how sharp you were

256
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,729
and how good you were at making your own decisions.

257
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,440
I think now there's a lot more experience to draw from.

258
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,399
Maybe that's part of it.

259
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,860
I also do just have a theory of like,

260
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,778
I guess I would call it,

261
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,197
the "Moneyballification" of everything,

262
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,199
to give a few examples,

263
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,202
one of the things that I do casually for fun

264
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,370
is playing poker.

265
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,372
Poker's a very fun game.

266
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,456
It's actually much more mathematical

267
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,624
than a lot of people realize.

268
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,084
It's very, of course people kind of—

269
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,085
I think people know that,

270
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,504
like the poker solvers in the odds tables

271
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,338
and everything. Solvers and such.

272
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,256
Or is it more mathematical than that?

273
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,674
No, I think that's right.

274
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,051
Well, I think there's a first sort impression of,

275
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,885
it's all about—

276
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,844
I'm all in. Yeah, exactly.

277
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,012
Pay the person on the other end.

278
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,515
It obviously is much more mathematical than that.

279
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,934
But the one thing that's kinda interesting is you see it

280
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,896
in the evolution of the top players in space as well.

281
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,231
Back in the day, in the 80s or 90s, the top pros,

282
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,945
I don't think the idea that is less competitive,

283
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,155
but the skills that made someone

284
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,241
really great poker player were just

285
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,867
really great intuition.

286
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,411
They understood a lot

287
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,579
of the mathematical concepts,

288
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,622
but just at a very system one level

289
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,874
of just being able to kind of think about them

290
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,419
and obviously they had a good feel for the game

291
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,462
and a good sense of how they should be able

292
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,798
to kind of improve their own play.

293
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,384
Now it's just all math nerds.

294
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,554
At some point when the space gets mature enough that,

295
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,388
you know what I mean?

296
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,181
Where for a less mature space,

297
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,226
when people don't know what the right questions to ask are

298
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,020
or how to even think about it,

299
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,771
like what is the right frame of reference.

300
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,606
Then I think there's something about just,

301
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
having a really sharp intuition

302
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,276
and coming to your own conclusions.

303
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,154
Then at some point, as these things get more mature,

304
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,657
the conclusion of it is math.

305
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,783
That's been the case

306
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,076
in a lot of different fields.

307
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,453
And I feel like it's happening a little bit

308
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,621
for startups as well.

309
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,455
I see.

310
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,249
More spaces have resolved to their underlying,

311
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,208
like a chess engine,

312
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,668
just deciding that the position is,

313
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,502
mate in 41 or something.

314
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,588
Yeah, and chess was totally the same way, by the way,

315
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,090
back in the 1800s people—

316
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,300
The romantic style of play is gone.

317
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,218
Yeah, exactly, the romantic style of play.

318
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,720
And now it's like,

319
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,181
there is a right sequence of moves and,

320
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,434
just seeing how close you are to that optimum.

321
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,020
What are other domains where the "Moneyballification"

322
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,104
of everything is shown?

323
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,148
One of my other hobbies,

324
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,817
which I played at least before,

325
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,319
the advent of Cognition

326
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,071
was a game called Super Smash Brothers.

327
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,281
I used to play tournaments for Smash.

328
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,284
You saw very much the same pattern where the,

329
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,411
it's a game called Melee in particular.

330
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,245
I don't know if you played Smash.

331
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,080
OK.

332
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,122
It's for the Game Cube, which came up 2001.

333
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,999
So it's a very old game, but,

334
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,834
people keep playing the same game.

335
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,753
For the first six to eight years

336
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,506
of the game, the personality was

337
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,591
really wily, sharp thinkers,

338
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,301
people who are just quick on their feet

339
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,552
and coming up with these ideas.

340
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,804
Now it's just all math.

341
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,933
And that the people who play and do really well are—

342
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,267
I think some of the RTSs are a little bit

343
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,102
that way as well.

344
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,311
Hopefully has gotten less creative

345
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,813
as people have gotten better at them, so.

346
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,065
Yeah, and it's a funny thing where it's like,

347
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,983
there's a lot of beauty

348
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,568
in the nerd side of it too.

349
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,736
It's just

350
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,907
a difference in what skills get most selected for,

351
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,034
is maybe the way I describe it.

352
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:42,868
OK, I'm getting distracted

353
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,786
from asking you about Cognition.

354
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,995
Yeah.

355
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,539
What is Cognition? What does it do?

356
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,750
Yeah, so we're building the AI software engineer.

357
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,252
We've been building Devin for,

358
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,461
the last year and a half,

359
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,213
and most recently just acquired Windsurf.

360
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,967
Devin, the agent in Windsurf, the IDE,

361
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,926
but at a high level,

362
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,512
we really want to build the future of software engineering.

363
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,139
Is it confusing for people that you have two brands,

364
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,181
you have Cognition, the company,

365
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,015
and then Devin,

366
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,686
the slightly anthropomorphized instantiation of it.

367
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,478
We've been talking about that.

368
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,063
Now there's Windsurf as well,

369
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,648
and so now there's a third thing.

370
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,192
But I think some consolidation is probably good.

371
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,152
Got it.

372
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,404
OK, and so people are maybe familiar with the,

373
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,032
the GitHub copilots or the IDE-style paradigm

374
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,244
where you're there writing code in your IDE

375
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,705
and it helps you auto-complete it,

376
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,790
or you can give some instructions in the IDE.

377
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,085
That is not the Cognition-Devin paradigm.

378
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:38,090
Instead with Devin, you're in a Slack channel with Devin,

379
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,676
and you're prompting it to

380
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,552
go off and "Build me an X or a Y,"

381
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,555
but you're talking to it as you would a coworker in Slack.

382
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,723
That's right.

383
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,475
Yeah, and so you can call it from Slack or Linear or Jira.

384
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,351
Or you can call it from your IDE as well,

385
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,936
but you don't have to, right?

386
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,480
I think that's exactly right.

387
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,815
There's been this paradigm,

388
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,692
in the past, I would say GitHub copilot

389
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,068
was really the biggest

390
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,155
and most well known originator of it, of IDEs.

391
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,656
I would describe it

392
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,159
as basically when you are typing at the keyboard

393
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,661
as an engineer, making you a little bit faster

394
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,205
at it and giving you the tools and the shortcuts

395
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,165
and everything to do that faster.

396
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,750
Devin is a very different paradigm

397
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,295
of what I would call like an async experience.

398
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,672
Where you have an agent and you delegate a task.

399
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,509
And so Devin naturally operates a little bit more like

400
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,677
at a ticket level or project level or something like that.

401
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,179
You have some issue and GitHub or something

402
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,223
and you tag Devin and then Devin gets to work on it.

403
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,474
Yep. Yep.

404
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:33,479
What level of task is Devin doing a good job of today?

405
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,732
Yeah, we like to call Devin a junior engineer today.

406
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,818
There are some things that an AI, of course,

407
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,694
is way, way better than all of us at,

408
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,196
especially encyclopedic knowledge

409
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,281
and just pulling facts and things like that.

410
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,157
There's some things that,

411
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,952
that it still makes terrible decisions on.

412
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,162
But I think that's the right average overall.

413
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,248
What we see folks typically using it for

414
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,458
are things like bugs, for example,

415
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,461
or like simple feature requests and fixes

416
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,630
and so on where you're talking about an issue

417
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,423
and you and your team are figuring out

418
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,299
what you should do and you're just like,

419
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,467
"hey, @Devin go do this."

420
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,512
Or on the other hand, a lot of the more,

421
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,681
I'll call it the repetitive tedious tasks

422
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,182
that come up often in engineering work.

423
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,185
That's often, migrations or modernizations

424
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,646
or refactors or version upgrades.

425
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,648
It's crazy how much testing and documentation,

426
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,025
it's crazy how much of the software engineers

427
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,069
of the world's time is,

428
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,654
more things like going

429
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,488
and fixing your Kubernetes's deploy than it is

430
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,322
building, and coming up with really—

431
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,160
Dependency management, all that kind of stuff.

432
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,995
Yeah.

433
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,621
What metrics can you share on where the business is at?

434
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,039
Devin is deployed

435
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,000
in thousands of companies all over the world.

436
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,168
We work with some of the biggest banks

437
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,212
in the world, like Goldman and Citibank,

438
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,797
all the way down to,

439
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,257
startups with two or three people.

440
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,509
In general, a lot of how we look at things

441
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,511
is in terms of merge pull requests,

442
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,929
and getting Devin to the point

443
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,514
where it is a significant percentage

444
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,057
of the merge pull requests in your org.

445
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,559
Typically in a successful org,

446
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,520
Devin is merging something in the range of 30% to 40%

447
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,314
of all the pull requests that come through.

448
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,441
You talked about this async model,

449
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,153
but isn't it the case that as I look at other,

450
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,487
the Github copilots and the Cursors

451
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,572
and everything like that,

452
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,365
or Claude Code,

453
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,076
they're not fully synchronous

454
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,578
because you prompt them

455
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,163
and they go off and do something.

456
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,291
Are these distinctions a moment in time thing?

457
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,794
Do they go away where everyone is synchronous

458
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,212
in the cases when they can do it instantly

459
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,048
and asynchronous in the cases where they don't?

460
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,842
Is this a durable distinction?

461
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,676
It's a good question.

462
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,012
I think the two experiences continue to exist

463
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,305
for the next while.

464
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,766
Then I actually think figuring out,

465
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,600
the shared experience between them actually

466
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,434
is the really interesting thing, right?

467
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,313
And that's a lot of recently with Windsurf

468
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,147
and things like that.

469
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,066
It's something that we've already been thinking about

470
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,152
and now are pretty excited to ship some things

471
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,236
in the near future on.

472
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,155
Do you know the concepts of essential complexity

473
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,198
and accidental complexity?

474
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,282
Have you heard about this before?

475
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,116
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

476
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,327
I think there's a real thing where,

477
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,663
maybe one way to describe it is the ethos

478
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,497
of a software engineer.

479
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,082
What it means to be a software engineer in my mind

480
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,710
is basically just somebody who solves problems

481
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,046
in the context of code, right?

482
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,465
It is somebody who tells the computer what to do

483
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,133
and makes all these decisions of,

484
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,969
it can be big decisions like "What is the right architecture

485
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,261
that we want to use for all of this?"

486
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,597
Or it can be like a lot of these micro decisions like,

487
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,431
"Oh by the way,

488
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,850
there's a case where this balance is less than zero,

489
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,768
and what do we want to do here?

490
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,020
Should we show an error

491
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,941
or should we request this?" or whatever.

492
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,609
All of these decisions are what people typically

493
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,443
call the essential complexity

494
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,406
what is all of the actual underlying logic

495
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,033
of the decisions of what the software is doing, right?

496
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,285
The accidental complexity is basically everything else.

497
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,162
All the things that you have to do

498
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,039
to support things as they scale.

499
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,749
Or all of your standard,

500
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,167
for example, anytime you have a class,

501
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,961
you probably have all the standard carotid features

502
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,005
along with that as well, where

503
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,048
everyone knows that you need to have that in your class,

504
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,175
but there's no real decision that needs to be made

505
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,219
in terms of going and doing that.

506
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,722
It's an interesting thing, which is,

507
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,475
up until, AI coding has come along,

508
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,185
The meat of software engineering

509
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,395
has been in making the decisions,

510
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,982
and yet you spend 80% or 90% of your time doing more

511
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,816
of the latter,

512
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,776
of just going and doing the routine implementation

513
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,736
and so on.

514
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,529
I think this merged experience

515
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,282
that comes up is basically something where for anything

516
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:15,826
that actually needs you in loop

517
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,202
where you can go and make the decision,

518
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,912
and you are looking at the high level strategy

519
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,414
or deciding what you want to build,

520
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,665
you are involved and you're doing that synchronously.

521
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,792
Then for all the parts that are pure execution,

522
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,712
you are able to hand that off asynchronously.

523
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,839
So, the interesting thing is that obviously

524
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,257
for an individual project,

525
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,010
there are typically a long stretches that actually are one

526
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,179
or the other, and it alternates between both of them, right?

527
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,599
And I think what that will effectively look like is,

528
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,975
the synchronous experience is the IDE

529
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,685
where you are looking at the code directly

530
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,853
and you see each of these things,

531
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,272
the asynchronous experience is the agent

532
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,774
that will go off and do each of these things,

533
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,984
but to be able to go back and forth between your IDE agent.

534
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,904
So you want the engineer to be interactive

535
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,739
with the agent as it's going and working,

536
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,367
but on the high-impact moments of important choices

537
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,827
as opposed to all the grunt work?

538
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,830
How do you get large enterprises comfortable

539
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,959
with giving Devin's sufficient permissions to be effective?

540
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,170
But like you talk about the migration use case.

541
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,046
Super boring.

542
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,715
And so you change the table

543
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,008
and get it talking to the new table,

544
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,552
and then eventually you delete the old table.

545
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,262
And that last step is kind of scary.

546
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,097
I think people still have a...

547
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,931
models hallucinate way less than they did,

548
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,935
but people still have fear

549
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,478
of the model just making something up—

550
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,312
For sure. ...doing it.

551
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,688
And so yeah, how do you get people comfortable

552
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,066
with giving it enough power to be effective?

553
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,151
So we pretty strongly recommend

554
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,570
that people using Devin don't give it,

555
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,615
broad database access, for example.

556
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,783
That's one way.

557
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,660
I don't know of any instances

558
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,537
where it has been an issue or things like that,

559
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,371
but obviously,

560
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,372
you'd just rather not take that chance.

561
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,916
The framing that I would give honestly is,

562
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,253
we have processes for these things

563
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,712
because humans make mistakes too.

564
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,048
And that's why we have pull requests and review.

565
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,383
That's why we have CI

566
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,135
and that's why we have all these things already, right?

567
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,136
So Devin naturally

568
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,012
slots neatly into all of these things.

569
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,723
Typically the way that folks will work with Devin is,

570
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,517
they're doing some big code migration

571
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,144
and they'll break up the task,

572
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,355
or maybe they have 50,000 files that all need to go,

573
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,149
upgrade from this version of Angular

574
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,775
to that version or something like that.

575
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,068
And Devin will go and do each one

576
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,528
and it'll make pull requests, right?

577
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,155
So you will go and review the code

578
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,322
and make sure things look correct,

579
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,365
but there's still this human—

580
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,033
It's back to your point of incidental complexity,

581
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,202
where the reason a migration is time consuming

582
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,788
is not the actual single deletion step,

583
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,541
all the time cost comes in other places.

584
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,542
Yeah. Exactly.

585
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,252
I think in practice what we see with folks is,

586
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,629
especially in these like enterprise migrations is,

587
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,632
is when folks measure internally,

588
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,552
they see something like an 8 to 15x gain

589
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,387
for a lot of these use cases with Devin.

590
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,139
Because, as you're saying,

591
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,390
you're just reviewing the code,

592
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,559
you're not going and writing every single line

593
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,019
or going through every single reference

594
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,312
or things like that.

595
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,271
So let's talk about that,

596
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,940
because I think all organizations

597
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,068
around the world are trying to figure out

598
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:59,114
the productivity impact of AI coding.

599
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,326
I think what everyone sees is engineers

600
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:07,331
for sure want to have access to AI tools for coding.

601
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,585
It's not totally obvious on the,

602
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,255
PRs per dev type metrics, what's happening.

603
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,382
Generally, you see some increase there,

604
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,301
but of course it's not clear how good even a,

605
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,596
pull request per dev metric is.

606
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,765
Then maybe you can say that there's some,

607
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,266
ongoing maintenance cost

608
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,726
if you're shipping low quality code

609
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,852
or something like that.

610
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,146
I feel like everyone right now is looking

611
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:35,317
for some slam dunk productivity data

612
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,945
on what is the impact of...

613
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,862
There's probably some CTOs

614
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,572
looking at the slam dump data to justify,

615
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,115
the spend to their CTO.

616
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,953
What's your view on how big is the productivity impact?

617
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,412
Is it actually measurable?

618
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,247
Yeah, for sure.

619
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,498
I think this is something

620
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,668
where this gradual shift towards agents

621
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,628
actually will help a lot, as it turns out.

622
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,505
If anything, to be honest,

623
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,466
I think IDE productivity is often underrated

624
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,511
because, how do you state it to your point, right?

625
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,762
Like, you look at the numbers and it's,

626
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,723
of our engineering org on average people

627
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,935
took the tab completion 238 times this week.

628
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,937
It seems quite clear that that should be worth something

629
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,854
and it should make you faster.

630
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,106
But how much faster does it make you,

631
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,816
it's a bit harder to say.

632
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,609
On the other hand, with agents

633
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,569
a lot of the workflow obviously is going

634
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,737
and doing the task for you, right?

635
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,364
So if it's a Jira ticket or something,

636
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,949
or a migration or things like that

637
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,159
where you typically do have a good sense

638
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,953
of how many engineering hours are going to be needed

639
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,037
for this and what's going on.

640
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,872
And because it's doing the whole thing end to end,

641
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,541
it's a lot more clear of like, yeah,

642
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,293
you didn't have to do this migration anymore,

643
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,128
you reviewed the PR in five minutes

644
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,587
and that's all done.

645
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,839
Yes. Yes.

646
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,673
As time goes on,

647
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,049
I think these things will become more

648
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,051
and more and more clear.

649
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:01,069
There is a view that some people have out there

650
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:05,657
that coding tools are a moment in time thing

651
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,662
that get run over by increasing model performance,

652
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,581
GPT-6 or GPT-7.

653
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,415
Yeah.

654
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,833
Presumably you do not hold this view.

655
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,460
Yeah.

656
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,253
How do you avoid getting run over by the labs?

657
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,087
Yeah, for sure.

658
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:19,921
So look, I think the labs are obviously,

659
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,714
I think they're incredible businesss.

660
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,053
As best as I understand it,

661
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,765
I would describe this view as a,

662
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,060
call it the nihilist computer use take.

663
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,771
Which is, of course all of these different things

664
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,356
that we do in the world,

665
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,233
in knowledge work involve using a computer.

666
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,736
And the AI is going to get better and better

667
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,404
and better at using the computer

668
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,532
until someday there is nothing left except just the AI going

669
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,618
and using your computer and doing your work for you,

670
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,619
to the best of my understanding,

671
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,329
is kind of that the argument there.

672
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,247
I see the wisdom of it.

673
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,291
This is the kind of thing that's very hard to disprove.

674
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,252
But I think that, in practice

675
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:03,006
what we've seen in the space is naturally there is a lot

676
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,716
of contextual knowledge.

677
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,469
There's a lot of industry details, there's a lot of...

678
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,553
And so, as we were saying,

679
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,597
going and doing some angular migration

680
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,349
or doing some...

681
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,310
It's not to say that these things can't get better.

682
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,229
In fact, I think they will continue to get much better.

683
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,981
But I think that the way that we make models better

684
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:23,527
and better at them is by giving it the right data of...

685
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,405
How good can you be at angular migrations

686
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,532
if you've never seen angular,

687
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,909
and you've never done an angular migration yourself?

688
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,202
And there's kind of a cap on that.

689
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,246
And obviously there are all sorts of these things of,

690
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,165
using your Datadog to go and debug errors.

691
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,959
The biggest thing I would say here

692
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,337
is software engineering in the real world is so messy,

693
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,922
and there's all sorts of these things

694
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,756
that come up.

695
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,966
I think in practice,

696
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,050
most disciplines look like this.

697
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,761
I would say the same thing about law or medicine or,

698
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,138
and so on.

699
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,056
So, while the general intelligence will continue

700
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,558
to get smarter and smarter,

701
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,685
I think there is still a lot of work to do

702
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,812
in making something both,

703
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,896
on the capabilities side,

704
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,898
really good for your particular use cases,

705
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,233
but also in actually going

706
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,901
and delivering a product experience

707
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,361
and bringing that to customers

708
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,238
of how that actually happens in the real world.

709
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,282
So it's not a general intelligence task,

710
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,741
it's a specific intelligence of,

711
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,368
working in the Stripe code base

712
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,619
requires some general intelligence,

713
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,037
but requires a bunch of context,

714
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,623
requires working within the workflows we have

715
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,875
and everything like that.

716
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,460
And you think that persists as an area

717
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,669
where you need to specialize?

718
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,503
Yeah, exactly.

719
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,337
Maybe one way to put it is,

720
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,090
I think the argument is something like a super intelligence.

721
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,924
I think in some sense,

722
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,758
yes, I think we are,

723
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,178
you could consider us short super intelligence.

724
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,804
I think what we're getting to with RL

725
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,723
as this thing is improving and improving,

726
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,308
and we see more and more of the gains

727
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,101
and people are developing the techniques.

728
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,062
I think of RL and this paradigm of AI

729
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:45,442
as basically, the platonic ideal of it is the ability

730
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,736
to solve any benchmark, right?

731
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,779
You have exactly a dataset of here are the things

732
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,615
that you want and here's how we measure success,

733
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,200
and here's how we do that.

734
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,701
And whatever that benchmark is,

735
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,785
it can be the hardest thing ever.

736
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,913
It can be a unsolved math problems

737
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,955
or whatever.

738
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,415
Someday we want to get to the point

739
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,501
where we can just take that and train a model

740
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,086
that will just get a hundred percent on it.

741
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,631
I think, frankly, we're moving towards

742
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,218
that ideal a lot faster than most folks would've expected.

743
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,011
I mean, there's been some pretty crazy,

744
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,680
developments like the IMO Gold Medal or

745
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,265
the scores on Sweet Venture or things like that.

746
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,476
The thing is, when that happens,

747
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,727
I don't think what we end up with

748
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,438
is just pure ASI, end of humanity,

749
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,731
human knowledge work or whatever.

750
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,651
I think the thing that we end up in is basically a point

751
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,568
where the hard question is,

752
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,819
"All right, now, what is the benchmark?"

753
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,654
Right?

754
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,905
I think defining the benchmark

755
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,532
in all of these spaces is a lot

756
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,785
of the practical, real messiness of the world, right?

757
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,162
And so for a software engineer, obviously,

758
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,456
what are all the tools

759
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,124
that you interact with on a day-to-day basis?

760
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,251
How do you use those tools?

761
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,336
What does it mean to build a representation

762
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,504
of the code base over time?

763
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,673
How do you decide whether you shipping the feature

764
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,258
was successful or not successful?

765
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,842
All of these various things

766
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,761
and creating the right environments around them.

767
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,097
And so can there be a good benchmark

768
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,641
for a model's performance on the kinds

769
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,934
of things that Devin wants to do?

770
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,062
Or is Devin's business model and...

771
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,398
Devin's revenue is the benchmark essentially?

772
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,983
Yeah, it's a good question.

773
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,942
From our perspective,

774
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,236
we have a lot of benchmarks internally.

775
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,738
The biggest is one that we call junior dev,

776
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,449
which we might need to upgrade to senior dev pretty soon.

777
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,827
But it is basically the ability to do a variety

778
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,954
of just random real world junior dev tasks.

779
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,081
We've shared some of the examples.

780
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,541
Obviously we don't publish the whole benchmark

781
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,586
because then it would, get obviated.

782
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,130
But a lot of the tasks are things like, "Hey,

783
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,799
you need to go and fix this Grafana dashboard

784
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,676
and get this going and then pull up the results."

785
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,094
And this is a very common thing

786
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,262
that a software engineer does, right?

787
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,471
And the thing that's hard about it

788
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,349
is perhaps not some algorithmic coding thing itself,

789
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,310
but it turns out on the setup

790
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,729
actually the server that's hosting this

791
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,064
is running the wrong version of some package.

792
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,316
So you have to go through the errors

793
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,984
and figure out what happened and then say,

794
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,569
"OK, I need to downgrade the package to this.

795
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,279
Other one, which is actually the right dependency

796
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,114
for this thing, and then I need to run it

797
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,199
and pull this up and make sure the numbers look correct."

798
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,409
Things like that,

799
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,828
which are basically as close as we can make them

800
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,664
to what real software engineers spend their time on.

801
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,208
And so how have the newly released Claude 4.1

802
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,044
and GPT-5 done this benchmark?

803
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,754
Both of them are

804
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,381
better at this benchmark

805
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,508
than any of the models that we've seen before this week.

806
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:20,513
As you think about the AI business and industry

807
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,599
over the next five to 10 years,

808
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,684
like you think about all the different layers of the stack.

809
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,895
You have the data centers, and then you have labs,

810
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,273
and then you have the application layers such as yourself.

811
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,818
Who benefits? What gets more competitive,

812
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,737
what gets less competitive?

813
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,782
Are all these just classic competitive oligopolies?

814
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,241
Yeah, what's the market structure?

815
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,702
So everyone always makes fun of me whenever I say this,

816
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,538
but I think all the layers are going to do very well.

817
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,539
I think all the—

818
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,374
There's just going to be a lot of AI.

819
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,084
I think the prices are cheap everywhere.

820
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,336
I've been saying this at least for the last six

821
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,671
to 12 months, and I think,

822
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,589
we've seen prices go up at decent bit

823
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,965
across all of these.

824
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,717
But no, at a high level, first of all,

825
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,678
there's going to be a lot of AI.

826
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,179
It can't be understated in the sense that,

827
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,890
I think we're kind of coming off of a decade

828
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,395
of a lot of various, B2B SaaS and so on.

829
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,562
I think there was the internet

830
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,731
obviously in the '90s and early 2000s,

831
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,566
and then there was the mobile phone and cloud,

832
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,735
which were kind of like late 2000s, early 2010s, right?

833
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,112
And those were some of the biggest things

834
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,697
in the last 30 years.

835
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,906
Over the last 10 years or so,

836
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,825
there was a real time where most of the stuff

837
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,659
that was being built

838
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,369
was a lot more incremental.

839
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,455
Each next thing and building for a particular niche

840
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,082
or for a small part of the workflow

841
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,042
and making that more efficient.

842
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:35,380
And AI now I think is the total opposite of that

843
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,464
in the sense that,

844
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,092
now we're talking about the entirety of knowledge work

845
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,719
and perhaps the entirety of physical work as well,

846
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,304
depending on what happens with the robotics, right?

847
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,349
First thing is there's just going to be a lot of AI.

848
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,183
The second thing about

849
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,727
where does the value accrue?

850
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,104
And my honest answer on that is,

851
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,147
value accrues

852
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,940
wherever there's meaningful differentiation

853
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,774
in the layer, right?

854
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,608
Simple,

855
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,986
like if there's NVIDIA and there's TSMC,

856
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,948
for as long as NVIDIA needs

857
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,782
to work with TSMC

858
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,076
and for as long as TSMC needs to work with NVIDIA,

859
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,828
of course there'll be some rubbing up

860
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,163
on each other's shoulders,

861
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,998
but like they will continue to do great, right?

862
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,250
And you kind of see this down the stack as well.

863
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,169
I would argue that the problems that are being solved

864
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,670
in all of these different layers are very,

865
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,046
very different problems

866
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,549
that have pretty meaningful differentiation.

867
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,384
You're saying this prevents too much vertical integration,

868
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,011
basically, where the layers

869
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,388
keep each doing their own thing?

870
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,222
Exactly.

871
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,183
And I think there's a real diff where,

872
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,226
as soon as you go from hardware to,

873
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,480
obviously foundation model training is its own can of worms,

874
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,815
and very much like the DNA of the company

875
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,818
is finding exceptionally strong researchers,

876
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,863
giving them as many GPUs as you can afford to give them

877
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,323
and setting up a culture

878
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,575
that orients around that.

879
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,327
Then the application layer, I would say,

880
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,788
is really focused...I'd say obviously it has a lot

881
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,372
of the elements of research as well.

882
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,957
But I think in particular is really,

883
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,335
really focused on just figuring out how

884
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,961
to make one use case work for us.

885
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,630
For example, the only thing

886
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,465
that we care about is

887
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,467
building the future of software engineering.

888
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,219
Maybe one thing I would call out is,

889
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,263
people often talk about AI code

890
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,139
abstractly in a vacuum.

891
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,517
I think there are a lot of companies that think about code,

892
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,644
in the foundation model layer or things like that.

893
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,229
We uniquely really think

894
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,897
about software engineering.

895
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,774
And all of the messiness that that comes with

896
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,276
and all the product interface and all the delivery

897
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,486
and the usage model.

898
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,696
And of course like a lot of these particular capabilities

899
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,073
that come with that.

900
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,783
So I think there's a real...

901
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,035
Everyone has their own DNA

902
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,746
and everyone has their own things that they do best.

903
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,122
That makes sense.

904
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,541
We at Stripe have been thinking a lot

905
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:39,212
about building the economic infrastructure for AI

906
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,840
and what is required.

907
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,427
You can have an agent acting on behalf of a person,

908
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,595
and you want to be able

909
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,890
to just be prompting or doing stuff in your app.

910
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,310
And part of the tool use that your AI can engage in

911
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,312
is going off and conducting commerce in the real world.

912
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,064
So we're building infrastructure for that.

913
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,484
And then we noticed that because of the economics of AI,

914
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,069
everyone has usage based models, right?

915
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,196
Per token, per what have you.

916
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,322
And so we're building out,

917
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,408
usage based billing infrastructure,

918
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,579
and again, we find the billing systems people are building

919
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,332
on Stripe, they're very different from the...

920
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,585
Classic SAS is per-seat pricing

921
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:22,171
whereas again, everything in AI is per-unit consumed.

922
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,007
And you can get into how the agents engage

923
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,049
in commerce with each other,

924
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,634
where there's, no human in the loop.

925
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,804
So there are all these ways in which our product roadmap

926
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,638
is being informed.

927
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,308
But I'm curious what you think the economic infrastructure

928
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,767
for AI needs to look like.

929
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,978
Are there things that we should be keeping in mind?

930
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,812
Yeah, for sure.

931
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,523
Yeah, seat-based to usage-based, big one for sure.

932
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,191
I think on both sides, right?

933
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,443
From the perspective of one,

934
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,736
seats don't really make sense

935
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,322
when the AI themselves are arguably seats

936
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,699
as well, they're doing a lot of the labor too.

937
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,035
And then on the other side,

938
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,870
usage of obviously just goes so naturally

939
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,998
with the cogs themselves because a lot of it's is,

940
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,957
effectively GPU spend

941
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,585
on how much you're spinning the models, basically.

942
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,253
I think that makes a ton of sense.

943
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,087
The other big one

944
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,548
which comes to mind obviously is just for there

945
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,967
to be an entire agent economy as well.

946
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,928
Today I would say is,

947
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,555
still probably more of a talking point

948
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,514
than a reality.

949
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,184
But things are pretty rapidly changing

950
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,144
and getting to the point where your agents are,

951
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,395
funnily enough we use Devin.

952
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,105
Devin is obviously entirely focused

953
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,273
towards software engineering,

954
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,192
but we order our DoorDash on Devin,

955
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,319
we order our Amazon packages with Devin.

956
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,363
There are pieces of that that turn out

957
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,490
to work nicely anyway—

958
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,325
So you order your Amazon packages with Devin?

959
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,159
Yeah.

960
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,786
So you're just in Slack and you ask it

961
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,578
to buy something for you?

962
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,621
Yeah, just "@Devin,

963
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,456
can you go buy some more whiteboards for us?"

964
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,290
Or something like that.

965
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,418
At a certain point, do the real world things you ask Devin

966
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,379
to do run into just blockers

967
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,715
with sites trying to block bot activity?

968
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,220
A lot of Devin working really well,

969
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,222
obviously, it relies on Devin being able

970
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,140
to do these things and get through it.

971
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,016
But some of these things,

972
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,851
I think are quite natural with the model,

973
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,813
which is, you often have API keys or secrets

974
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,647
or things like that

975
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,690
that you want Devin to be able to hold onto.

976
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,942
So that works for credit card numbers as well.

977
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,777
Obviously there's a lot of work of,

978
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,278
real world software engineering

979
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,739
doesn't involve a lot of just going and browsing the web

980
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,658
and finding different sites and clicking around on them,

981
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,910
even if you're just testing your own front end

982
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,495
or putting a documentation or something.

983
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,497
Good browser use is an important piece of that as well.

984
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,959
And I think it's just kind of something that's—

985
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,460
So shouldn't you build a consumer app?

986
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,170
Doesn't everyone want this magic wand app?

987
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,464
Where you can just have your virtual assistant,

988
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,341
there's a million virtual assistant startups.

989
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,052
It seems like none of them have really gotten to any scale.

990
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,220
Yeah, it's a fun question.

991
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,599
I think from our perspective, on the one hand,

992
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,519
it's fun seeing Devin go and do these DoorDash things.

993
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,396
At the same time, we also just know that,

994
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,190
our team is so small, we just don't have the,

995
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,151
focus to be able to do that

996
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,485
in addition to doing software engineering.

997
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,945
You're pulling up Devin and you're seeing this,

998
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,031
and then on the other side there's the IDE there,

999
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,533
but Devin's just going on DoorDash or something.

1000
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,579
It's a very, fish out of water experience

1001
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,830
and it's fine for us to keep—

1002
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,498
But a lot of product development

1003
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:07,503
follows from people noticing how a product is being used—

1004
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,005
Like emerging patterns.

1005
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:09,839
Exactly. And these emergent patterns.

1006
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,882
Like Twitter especially.

1007
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,175
People started linking

1008
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,260
to photos off site, so they built,

1009
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,844
in native image support.

1010
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:17,889
Or the hashtag was invented by the community.

1011
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,806
So similarly, you're checking the Devin logs

1012
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:22,310
and you notice people are buying a lot of DoorDash.

1013
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,895
Maybe that's a suggestion

1014
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,728
on the product side of things.

1015
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:25,563
Yeah. It's funny.

1016
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,399
Well, to be fair, it's mostly just ourselves.

1017
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,443
I know. Still, it's still emerging product usage.

1018
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,985
I agree. It's a fun one.

1019
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:34,072
That's funny. I love that.

1020
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,697
We had a fun one where Devin was,

1021
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:37,742
Walden had a flight that got canceled

1022
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,203
and was trying to,

1023
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,496
use Devin to go and negotiate with the airline

1024
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:43,873
to get the refund for it.

1025
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,416
Devin went to the site.

1026
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,085
And naturally the site forwards you two their agent

1027
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,003
to have the conversation.

1028
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,963
Then Devin was explaining these things

1029
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,047
and wasn't making progress.

1030
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:53,507
Then at some point Devin said,

1031
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:56,302
"This is not working, I need to speak to a human right now."

1032
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,345
And did it?

1033
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,179
It did. It did, yeah.

1034
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,806
So it got to the human and then it,

1035
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,933
the human got on the line and then it sent

1036
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,185
the link to like the airline contract, like

1037
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,104
"oh, Section 22 says this, this, and that,"

1038
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,105
and then Walden actually did get—

1039
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,272
But sorry, Devin was speaking?

1040
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,066
Devin was was chatting with the human.

1041
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,275
I see.

1042
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,235
Made it past the robot agent—

1043
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,069
Oh, that's funny.

1044
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,363
...equivalent, and then got to a human.

1045
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,073
And did it successfully get the flight refund?

1046
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,616
It got the refund, yeah. OK.

1047
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,785
Again, the people want this.

1048
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,663
Going back to the economic infrastructure for AI,

1049
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,789
the other thing that,

1050
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,501
we think about is it feels like trust

1051
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:33,089
is going to become a bigger deal online.

1052
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,217
I don't quite know what form that takes,

1053
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,052
because obviously, been a big bad internet

1054
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,303
for a long time.

1055
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,930
There's a lot of scams out there, there's a lot of hacking,

1056
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,764
but

1057
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,933
the hacking attempts become more sophisticated,

1058
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,143
the deep fakes and everything.

1059
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:50,148
And so having a good sense of who is a trusted individual,

1060
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,692
who is a trusted business

1061
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,069
just seems to become much more important in this world.

1062
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,195
Related to that too,

1063
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,989
I think one of these things,

1064
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,449
I feel like the CloudFlare with agents

1065
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,702
and everything is a hot topic and—

1066
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,536
Explain the CloudFlare issue for—

1067
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,370
Oh yeah, of course.

1068
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,414
So, there's a lot more agents

1069
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,540
browsing the web these days

1070
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,791
and there's been certain things,

1071
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,585
protections set up

1072
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,087
to not give agents access to websites.

1073
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,714
I think the paradigm...

1074
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,757
up until now, the paradigm for a lot of this stuff,

1075
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,093
I mean, there's robots.txt and all these things,

1076
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,721
has often been basically almost like a,

1077
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,347
there are tons of things

1078
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,518
which you are not allowed to do as a non-human.

1079
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,354
And I think what we will probably need to see a lot more of

1080
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:34,483
over time is delegating access,

1081
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,318
if that makes sense.

1082
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,778
Making it more clear that an agent can do something

1083
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,488
on your behalf.

1084
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,656
In some sense you are attaching some

1085
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,991
of your reputation to it too.

1086
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,076
There's a monetary question of how this works out,

1087
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,037
but there's also just actions

1088
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,789
that the agent takes are attributable to you.

1089
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,583
Yeah. Yeah. On your behalf.

1090
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,417
There's a great point.

1091
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,128
Right now we have bots versus no bots,

1092
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,464
clankers versus clankers not allowed.

1093
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:00,301
Whereas instead it needs to be bots allowed

1094
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,135
if you sign for them.

1095
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:01,969
As I was going to say,

1096
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:02,803
simple version is just like

1097
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,556
if you're signed into your Google Chrome email account

1098
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,183
and you have a verified address,

1099
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,684
then you can have an agent run in

1100
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,186
that browser window and do things.

1101
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:10,978
But all of the...

1102
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,563
you are responsible for the work that it does.

1103
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,523
Yes, it's sort of like API key permissions,

1104
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,777
but at a mass consumer scale across everything

1105
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,028
and the whole websites and everything.

1106
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,947
Hmm. I like that.

1107
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:25,284
How does the existence of Devin

1108
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,827
affect your own hiring of engineers?

1109
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,164
Yeah, from our perspective we've always,

1110
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,832
loved keeping the core engineering team

1111
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,584
very tight and very elite.

1112
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,503
What size? Like 30 people?

1113
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,296
Yeah, so up until a few weeks ago,

1114
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,799
our whole team is about 35 people of whom—

1115
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,425
Across all roles?

1116
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,802
Across all roles, yeah.

1117
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,221
Of whom, I mean, almost everyone actually is an engineer

1118
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,264
by background, funnily enough.

1119
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,809
But what we call core engineering is it was about 19.

1120
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,143
Yep. With Windsurf, obviously,

1121
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,228
the team count has grown a lot,

1122
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,272
but actually, with core engineering itself,

1123
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,107
it hasn't actually gotten all that much bigger.

1124
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,692
It's gone from 19 to something

1125
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,485
in the range of like 30 to 35.

1126
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,945
OK, so you keep the engineering team smaller.

1127
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,780
Are the engineers...

1128
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,741
how are the engineers themselves different

1129
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,827
versus a company being built 20 years ago?

1130
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,038
Yeah, so it is a pretty different profile of the work

1131
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:14,083
that we have to do in the sense that like there is a lot

1132
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,502
of execution and implementation that has to be done,

1133
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,212
but Devin does that so that humans don't need to.

1134
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,880
And so what we typically look for,

1135
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,091
our whole interview process, for example,

1136
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:22,925
for a lot of these is,

1137
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,303
having people build their own Devin

1138
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,639
in eight hours and seeing how far they get with it.

1139
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,849
And I think—

1140
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,683
Sorry, build their own version of Devin

1141
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,600
or build stuff with Devin?

1142
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,935
Build their own version, their own agent,

1143
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,479
their own full end-to-end agent,

1144
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,565
in eight hours or six hours or whatever.

1145
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,275
What we find is,

1146
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,277
and we'll see this trend generally

1147
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,863
in software engineering, which is knowing all the little,

1148
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,198
memorizing all the facts or knowing all the little details

1149
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,367
or being really good at syntax of some language

1150
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,036
or things like that are going to be less important.

1151
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,078
What's going to be more important

1152
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,331
are a lot of the high level decision makings

1153
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,125
or understanding the technical concepts really well.

1154
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,710
Having a good sense of products

1155
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,628
and then just having a good intuitive sense

1156
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,630
of what to build and what to do

1157
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,842
and being a self owner that way too.

1158
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,886
A lot of our team

1159
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,889
actually are specifically former founders,

1160
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:10,806
which is kind of the fun one.

1161
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,850
Of our initial kind of 35,

1162
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,394
21 of us have founded a company before.

1163
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,439
So it's been a very high density of that.

1164
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,231
Wow.

1165
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,608
OK. OK. good, good.

1166
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,734
Very good.

1167
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,693
Yeah,

1168
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,445
maybe I should have just come out earlier and then—

1169
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,655
I was wondering that, yeah.

1170
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,490
I think that could have been—

1171
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,324
Interesting.

1172
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,158
Good game.

1173
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:29,992
It's a nice game. Yeah.

1174
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,996
When will you hire your last engineer?

1175
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,499
It's a good question.

1176
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,750
I'll make a distinction here,

1177
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,379
which is that there will come a point,

1178
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,464
and my guess on this point is probably in the neighborhood

1179
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,925
of let's say two, three, four years from now,

1180
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,428
where we stop using code as the main interface.

1181
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,182
And basically being a software engineer

1182
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,226
really is just instructing your computer

1183
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,061
and telling your computer what to do and saying,

1184
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,771
you're looking at your own product

1185
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,605
and you're saying, hey—

1186
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,689
You think two to four years from now,

1187
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,566
software engineers are not really looking at code

1188
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,526
in their day to day,

1189
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,985
just like they don't look at assembly,

1190
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,487
today. Exactly. Yeah.

1191
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,864
That's going and looking at your own product

1192
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,698
and deciding, "Oh yeah, like we need to make a new

1193
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,491
page here.

1194
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,660
And by the way, like, all this data,

1195
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,370
let's save this this way and,

1196
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,664
let's index this according to X, Y, and Z,

1197
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,249
because here are the lookups

1198
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,417
that we need to do," or whatever.

1199
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,710
Making a lot of these architectural decisions,

1200
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,379
but not looking at the code themselves.

1201
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,965
At least in the majority of circumstances.

1202
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,428
At that point, obviously the jobs change a lot.

1203
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,096
Funnily enough, if anything,

1204
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,433
we will have way more software engineers, not fewer.

1205
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,769
Just because the interface is not code anymore

1206
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,272
doesn't mean that the core skills of software...

1207
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,606
People often ask us like,

1208
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,358
"My son or daughter is in high school

1209
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,401
or is just starting college,

1210
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,528
like, should they even be studying computer science?"

1211
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,447
My answer is always absolutely yes.

1212
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,073
If anything, funnily enough,

1213
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,284
I feel like university computer science always

1214
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,827
had the opposite sin of doing too much—

1215
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,661
It's theoretical—

1216
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,371
Of teaching you the concepts,

1217
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,290
what programming was about

1218
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,332
and what computer science was about,

1219
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,625
and not enough of like, all right,

1220
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,586
here's like syntax that you need to use,

1221
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,380
here's what it means to get a React app set up and whatever.

1222
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,423
I think we'll get to a point

1223
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,467
where those theoretical concepts

1224
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,469
and that high level understanding of,

1225
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,387
maybe in one line, the model of a computer

1226
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,390
and how to make decisions and problem solve

1227
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,225
with the computer as a tool,

1228
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,144
that is what programming will be.

1229
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,022
If anything,

1230
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,023
there's going to be a lot more software engineers.

1231
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,941
One of the nice things is everyone talks

1232
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,402
about Jevons Paradox and how it relates to AI.

1233
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,236
I think there's nowhere

1234
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,363
that it's more true than software because,

1235
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,656
we really never seem

1236
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,450
to run out of demand for more code

1237
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,284
and more software— You can just write a lot

1238
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,118
of software, yeah.

1239
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,496
Yeah, the half joking way to say this is despite

1240
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,414
how many software engineers in the world,

1241
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,248
we all know this,

1242
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,124
there are so many products out there

1243
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,876
that are still so bad.

1244
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,377
Yeah.

1245
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,837
You know, you're locking into your bank

1246
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,255
or you're dealing with your

1247
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,174
checkout and retail or whatever it is.

1248
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,008
And then there's all these things

1249
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,594
that are still super outdated, super buggy.

1250
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,804
You're logging into to your healthcare platform

1251
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,014
or whatever and you're trying to click around

1252
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,848
and find your thing.

1253
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,933
And it's like—

1254
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,392
We haven't finished writing all this software yet, yeah.

1255
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,645
Isn't it shocking that the UIs haven't changed at all?

1256
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,523
So we still, we talk to Siri, which is the same,

1257
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,401
I mean, button placement and the same brand on the iPhone

1258
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,946
as pre-transformer models.

1259
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,864
You prompt Devin via Slack.

1260
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,784
We use our AI tools in a web browser

1261
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,288
and we enter them into a text box like

1262
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:24,833
we're playing Zork in the 1980s or whenever that came out.

1263
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,294
And so, 70s maybe.

1264
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,546
I don't don't how old Zork is.

1265
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,755
Do you know what Zork is?

1266
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,048
I don't. Oh, you're too young.

1267
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,676
It was like the original text-based adventure game.

1268
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,261
Oh, I see. Yeah.

1269
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:39,515
But when are we going to see AI UIs,

1270
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,392
because it's very retro right now.

1271
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,144
Yeah, my high level thought on this is,

1272
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,939
you always see this with new waves of technology.

1273
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,233
I think mobile phone is a great example where,

1274
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,276
the initial apps

1275
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,570
just look like basically websites,

1276
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,321
but in a smaller box.

1277
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,323
And over time,

1278
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,242
you could still get a lot of value out of those.

1279
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,536
So the core value prop of the phone was already there.

1280
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,121
But of course over time we built a lot

1281
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,914
of cool touch interfaces or we,

1282
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:08,252
developed a lot of the science of what makes a good app UX.

1283
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,588
Yeah, but we've no multitouch, we've no rubber banding.

1284
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,589
Yeah.

1285
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,008
I think we are entering

1286
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,719
that phase now where for a few years

1287
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,221
it was just replacing existing flows

1288
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,098
and just using AI to do that better.

1289
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,766
Now we're starting to think about bit more

1290
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,977
of these various generative flows.

1291
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,187
Mybe the simplest example that comes

1292
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,733
to mind is a lot more products now have the little chat box

1293
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,984
at the bottom where,

1294
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,320
rather than having to click through all the menus yourself,

1295
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,697
you can just kind of ask the chat box and find that.

1296
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,574
Which is one very, very simple version of that.

1297
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,827
But I think there's way more innovation to do.

1298
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,330
One framing I was thinking about with this is,

1299
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,040
it became clear shortly

1300
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,084
after the invention of the transistor and the microchip,

1301
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,629
that everything would have a microchip in it.

1302
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,504
Everything could benefit

1303
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,882
from having a small computer in it and,

1304
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,383
your car would have a small computer in it

1305
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,761
and your dishwasher would have a small computer in it,

1306
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,803
and everything.

1307
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,057
There's some equivalent where everything will pass

1308
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,559
through a transformer model before it's consumed.

1309
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,356
One of my thoughts on this too is I think AI is,

1310
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,941
I'd say uniquely different from some of these previous ways

1311
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,526
in an important way, which is,

1312
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,904
personal computer or internet or mobile phone.

1313
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,030
All of these had,

1314
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,283
one of two things or often both.

1315
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,369
One was a big hardware component,

1316
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,204
just go ship modems to everybody

1317
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,580
and you had to get people on the internet

1318
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,666
and you had to give everyone a phone first.

1319
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:33,045
Then two was like a very core critical mass effect

1320
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,755
or empty room effect

1321
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,923
or whatever, network effect

1322
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:36,757
or whatever you want to call it.

1323
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,801
Where, the internet was great and all obviously,

1324
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,053
but it doesn't really get that useful

1325
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,638
until all your friends are on the internet too,

1326
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,639
and like the restaurant

1327
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,349
that you're looking up is on the internet too,

1328
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,935
and various other things as well.

1329
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,312
AI actually has neither of those problems.

1330
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,981
And as a result, what you see is like as soon

1331
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,191
as the tech works for somebody...

1332
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,443
It's pure software, it can work single player

1333
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,153
and give you a ton of value directly.

1334
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,738
It kind of works for everyone.

1335
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,948
There's been a few things

1336
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,032
that we've seen as a result of that.

1337
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,868
One is, there's a new person posting

1338
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,328
that they're the fastest company from 1 million

1339
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:09,039
to a hundred million, every couple weeks because,

1340
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,543
AI is just so much faster at... As soon as it works,

1341
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,919
it works for everyone.

1342
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,379
The other part of that is

1343
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,380
to to your point,

1344
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,216
there's actually a bit of lag with product,

1345
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,884
I would say. Where,

1346
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,011
I think you could freeze all the capabilities today

1347
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,389
and have no new models and no new research come out

1348
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,890
and there would still be a whole decade

1349
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,891
of product progress to make.

1350
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,310
Whereas before, the product progress

1351
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,564
kind of tracked alongside the distribution itself.

1352
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,066
Now, it's been much more sudden where

1353
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,860
two years total where everyone's been thinking about it.

1354
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,486
And honestly, if we factor in a lot

1355
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,530
of the more recent capabilities, agentic capabilities,

1356
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,324
things like that, it's arguably less than one year

1357
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,159
for a lot of these.

1358
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,327
We are all kind of grappling with that all of a sudden

1359
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,203
and trying to figure out

1360
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,747
what the right new product experiences are, right?

1361
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,583
So it's just taking a bit more time.

1362
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,042
What are your AGI timelines?

1363
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,254
I think we have AGI.

1364
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,757
OK, now. I was going to say,

1365
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,883
there's this joke that people talk about,

1366
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,428
which is, back in 2017 if you ask,

1367
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,097
"Do we have AGI?" The answer is no.

1368
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,766
Today, obviously if you ask if we have AGI,

1369
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,434
the first thing everyone always says,

1370
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,394
well, you have to go define AGI—

1371
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,228
Yeah. It's hemming and hawing.

1372
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,398
It's kind of true in some sense of—

1373
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,691
Devin will order your DoorDash for you.

1374
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,942
Sounds like AGI to me.

1375
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:19,777
Yeah.

1376
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,946
And so obviously a bit of a facetious answer,

1377
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,992
but my honest opinion is, I think there is some,

1378
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,870
rapid singularity is super intelligence thing

1379
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,497
that people talk about.

1380
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,083
It's very hard to say,

1381
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,794
nothing's impossible, but I would guess that

1382
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,254
that's not something that happens in the immediate future.

1383
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,714
Especially because, as we said

1384
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,216
that a lot of the work to do is going

1385
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,717
and collecting all the real world...

1386
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,636
What are the problems that you want to solve?

1387
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,596
How do you define success for all these things?

1388
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,348
With that said,

1389
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,682
we're going to just keep...

1390
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,601
I think it's not so binary basically.

1391
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,186
We're just going to keep rolling out more

1392
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,104
and more improvements and these things are going to be more

1393
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,064
and more capable,

1394
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,441
but I don't know that we have some sudden shift,

1395
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,152
at least for the next few years.

1396
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,737
That makes a lot of sense.

1397
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,156
We've got to talk about Windsurf.

1398
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,074
Oh, yeah. It played out

1399
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,493
so quickly, so give us the play by play.

1400
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,036
So we heard the news

1401
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,121
that it was going to be Google buying Windsurf,

1402
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,415
or I guess not technically buying...

1403
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,085
This whole deal that was happening,

1404
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,170
that Friday at the same time everyone else did.

1405
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,464
OK, so this was not something that played out in advance,

1406
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,590
the Friday where the news came out.

1407
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,009
It was basically just as sudden for us,

1408
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,053
we heard some rumors maybe the night before—

1409
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,180
Devin was scrolling Twitter for you and—

1410
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,014
Yeah, exactly.

1411
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,140
Yeah, Devin came back and said,

1412
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,559
"Hey, you guys should check this out.

1413
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,810
We probably should look at this."

1414
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,895
So we heard the news then

1415
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,729
and naturally that afternoon we were

1416
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,605
talking about it, thinking about like,

1417
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:42,150
"Is there something that we should do off of this,?"

1418
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,319
It's not uncommon that there's some crazy news

1419
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,154
that happens in AI.

1420
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,615
But this is, especially,

1421
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,993
in our space, and we talked about this idea.

1422
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,079
We reached out to them cold that evening

1423
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,915
and got to meet the new Windsurf leadership,

1424
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,835
Jeff and Graham and Kevin, that evening.

1425
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,044
As we were both talking about it,

1426
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,297
I think we came to this conclusion together,

1427
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,799
which is, if there is something to do here at all,

1428
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,386
then it has to be ready to go by Monday morning.

1429
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,014
Because everyone, all the customers were reeling.

1430
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:15,183
The whole team was like, "Do I have a job?

1431
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,018
Do I not have a job?"

1432
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,144
It was a melting ice cube.

1433
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:17,978
Exactly.

1434
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,605
So, if it even waited until Thursday,

1435
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,815
instead of Monday,

1436
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,317
people were going to cancel their contracts,

1437
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,568
people were going to

1438
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,111
be interviewing at other places.

1439
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,030
So we said, OK, what this means is if we want to explore

1440
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:28,864
this, we have to,

1441
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,495
just spend the entire weekend on this nonstop.

1442
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,580
A lot of fun moments there.

1443
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,584
We got to kind of the handshake agreement

1444
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,878
that Saturday, and then obviously there's all the legal

1445
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,212
and everything to figure out.

1446
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,799
We all pulled an all nighter that Sunday night.

1447
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,634
We had a very optimistic plan that we were going to

1448
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,635
get signed.

1449
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,386
You also pulled an all nighter the Saturday night,

1450
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,220
or did you get some sleep?

1451
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,098
We got a couple hours of sleep on Saturday.

1452
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:55,933
It was especially...

1453
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,060
A huge shout out to Jeff and Graham, Kevin,

1454
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,312
because they had had a pretty rough few days before—

1455
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,480
Totally.

1456
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,314
It was very existential. As well actually.

1457
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,774
And so they were already pretty sleep deprived

1458
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,608
coming into it.

1459
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,442
We were going through...

1460
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,526
We had this optimistic view

1461
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,070
that we were going to get it signed on Sunday night.

1462
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,447
So then we could go and focus on filming

1463
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,449
and figuring out how we address the team and everything.

1464
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,617
Obviously that did not happen.

1465
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,119
We got it signed on Monday at 9:00 AM

1466
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,789
because us and the lawyers were up all night

1467
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,457
basically sorting out all these things.

1468
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:24,336
We luckily filmed the Windsurf video

1469
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,504
in the Windsurf studio.

1470
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,964
We said, OK, we should just film it anyway—

1471
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:27,798
You realize you can announce acquisitions

1472
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:28,840
without a video?

1473
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,342
Yeah.

1474
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,678
Well, it's always nice to have one.

1475
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,262
Then as soon as we got things signed,

1476
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,306
we were up in front of the whole team

1477
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,349
and giving them the update

1478
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,434
and then sharing that publicly pretty soon after.

1479
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:42,312
It was a lot of...It was fun.

1480
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,314
I live for these moments, honestly.

1481
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,316
So you read the news on Friday,

1482
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,276
and you

1483
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,028
signed and announced the deal on Monday.

1484
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:53,615
But that means that you decided more or less instantaneously

1485
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,535
that you wanted to buy the remaining part of Windsurf.

1486
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,204
Yeah, so we talked it through on Friday evening,

1487
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,414
and from our perspective,

1488
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,999
there were a few things that were nice about this.

1489
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,458
First of all, obviously,

1490
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,252
we know the space very well.

1491
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,128
So in that sense,

1492
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,587
we didn't really have to diligence the product

1493
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,132
or the customers because we knew that.

1494
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,758
But as we were kind of understanding the pieces

1495
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,844
of what happened exactly with the team,

1496
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,053
how many of the folks are still there

1497
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,972
and who left.

1498
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,390
We found that there was a very nice synergy

1499
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,433
in the sense that,

1500
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,852
there was a core research

1501
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,562
and product engineering team that went to Google

1502
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,398
and all the other functions were entirely intact,

1503
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,941
which includes enterprise engineering,

1504
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,235
infra, deployed engineering,

1505
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,195
go-to market, marketing, finance, operations,

1506
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,280
all these various things.

1507
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,615
And funnily enough, with Cognition,

1508
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,660
for better or for worse, I think we had done a good job

1509
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,162
of building out this core research

1510
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,538
and product engineering team.

1511
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,372
But, were,

1512
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,248
a little bit behind

1513
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,250
on growing all the other functions.

1514
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,586
So we found a very natural fit there as well.

1515
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,920
As we were just talking,

1516
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,050
they had JP Morgan and we had Goldman Sachs...

1517
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:53,884
There were all of these

1518
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,635
very natural ways to fit in.

1519
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,887
I think from our perspective,

1520
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,306
we knew there was something really interesting there

1521
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,515
and we wanted to do it

1522
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,142
and a lot of the rest was just figuring out the details.

1523
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,020
So you got to acquire a bunch of people

1524
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,939
who have lots of familiarity with the space.

1525
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,651
They have a product offering that is in an adjacent

1526
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,695
but not identical place to Devin.

1527
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,489
And so you get to accelerate,

1528
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,616
it sounds like the go-to-market efforts

1529
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,493
and broaden out the product portfolio.

1530
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,744
That's how you think about it?

1531
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,578
Yeah. Absolutely.

1532
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,997
And then of course the products themselves I think are...

1533
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,957
Funnily enough, we were thinking about

1534
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,334
what does the interaction

1535
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,211
of an async product like Devin look like

1536
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,796
with a more sync product?

1537
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,506
And we had some ideas for certain synchronous things

1538
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,298
that we wanted to build.

1539
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,716
We weren't going to build an IDE entirely

1540
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,426
because it felt like there were a couple players

1541
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,260
in town already.

1542
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,804
But as it turns out, having the ideas,

1543
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,722
there actually were a lot of natural synergies with a lot

1544
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,557
of the synchronous stuff that we thought about and,

1545
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:43,475
very simple thing...

1546
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,643
We shipped Wave 11,

1547
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,562
a few days later after we closed that deal.

1548
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,064
And there are a lot of these basic things like,

1549
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,775
yeah, like being able to access your DeepWiki and your IDE

1550
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,110
or being able to use all

1551
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,986
of the Devin code-based representation in search,

1552
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,988
or spinning up the agent there.

1553
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,031
And all of these things...

1554
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,910
We felt a lot of natural compliments.

1555
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,454
And so from there felt like,

1556
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,331
if there was a right person to work with

1557
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,958
and do this with, it would be—

1558
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,792
So in six months,

1559
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,211
do I buy Devin's and I get Windsurf bundle?

1560
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,548
Do I separately buy Windsurf and I can buy Devin?

1561
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,382
Yeah.

1562
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,216
How will it work?

1563
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,217
Yeah, lots to figure out still.

1564
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,218
We certainly want to keep each

1565
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,594
of the product philosophies the same,

1566
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,054
like I mentioned, I think there will still

1567
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,014
continue to be both sync and async products.

1568
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,474
But making the integrations

1569
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,976
between them much stronger and much easier

1570
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,394
I think is going to be really nice.

1571
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,105
And so certainly a lot that'll be much easier

1572
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,273
from the customer perspective,

1573
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,151
but if for some reason they really wanted to use one

1574
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:34,985
of the two,

1575
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,154
I'd imagine that they would still be able to do that.

1576
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,655
It's obviously been an interesting aspect

1577
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,823
of the AI space,

1578
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,657
that there has been a number

1579
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:45,662
of these 49% licensing type deals to avoid the risk

1580
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,039
of an acquisition being blocked...

1581
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:53,044
Companies buy the license to the IP and then the talent

1582
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,549
that they want to be able to be sure comes with the company.

1583
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,427
Do you think that stays as a thing in the AI?

1584
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,304
It's a funny moment in time thing, right?

1585
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,763
Yeah, I certainly don't feel like

1586
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,140
I'm the expert on this one.

1587
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,559
The thing that I find funny,

1588
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,811
there's one new bell or whistle each time.

1589
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,022
I feel like there's a—

1590
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:12,856
On all the legal— The debt—

1591
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,649
And contractual stuff. Complexion, character.

1592
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:15,692
Uou see like,

1593
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,861
there's one, and now we do,

1594
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,779
this licensing deal and now we...

1595
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,741
And so I think the meta game around

1596
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,117
that is certainly developing.

1597
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,995
There is some amount of polarity at the top level of AI

1598
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,206
as a space in the sense that,

1599
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,541
there is a point at which you want to just have...

1600
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,918
these things do scale

1601
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,336
with resources and they scale...

1602
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,590
I think basically the games get bigger,

1603
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,175
I guess is one way to put it.

1604
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,219
I think for most companies,

1605
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,261
the question is basically

1606
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,846
whether they think they will get there themselves

1607
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,139
or whether they want to work

1608
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,349
with another company and go into—

1609
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,892
You're saying you would expect more M&A,

1610
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,852
whether it be classical M&A

1611
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,437
or this new model of M&A

1612
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,814
because there're skilled benefits in this game.

1613
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,524
Maybe one of my hot takes is,

1614
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,817
I think for a lot of the big,

1615
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,861
of course there will be,

1616
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,613
many medium-sized outcomes in AI.

1617
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,740
But I think in this space,

1618
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,158
a little bit more so than previous ones,

1619
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,077
it's a little bit more polarized towards,

1620
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,037
you become a hyperscaler or bust.

1621
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,206
And so for some companies,

1622
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,084
that is the trajectory

1623
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,752
and then the moonshot that they want to go for.

1624
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,587
That's one thing, for others,

1625
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:21,132
working with someone is something that people do.

1626
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,010
And so now as you're bringing the Windsurf team on board,

1627
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,889
Cognition has this very intense culture, you know?

1628
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,891
You guys work on the weekends,

1629
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:34,271
you all work out of this house

1630
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,731
and as you're doing this buyout offer.

1631
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,108
Yeah.

1632
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:38,942
I think for us it's...

1633
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,776
And most folks have been really excited to come in

1634
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,116
and do it, and only a small fraction have taken the buyout.

1635
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,742
But I think from our perspective,

1636
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,996
we just want to make sure it's an opt-in,

1637
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,330
situation for everyone

1638
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,832
because let's be honest,

1639
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,001
it isn't for everyone and I think it is a

1640
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,585
a very intentional thing there.

1641
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,296
Was it the intensity you wanted people to,

1642
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,089
what did you want people to opt into?

1643
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,383
Opt into the intensity and the new culture.

1644
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,260
And we're going to be going after

1645
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,178
some very ambitious goals.

1646
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,431
By revenue standards

1647
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,599
or by whatever you want to call it,

1648
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,395
there are...

1649
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,315
Folks might call us a mid or later stage company,

1650
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,233
but from our perspective,

1651
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,486
we are still very much early stage in terms of the profile

1652
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,989
of what happens next and how much more there is to build

1653
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,240
and how much more there is to do.

1654
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,659
Obviously at an early stage,

1655
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,078
we do all have to be,

1656
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:34,622
signing up for the uncertainty and the willingness

1657
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,625
to just go and take on a different challenge every week.

1658
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,794
To put in a lot of hours

1659
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,004
and to have that culture.

1660
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,714
That was a big piece of it.

1661
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,591
Obviously, regardless of what happens,

1662
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,302
we wanted to make sure people were well taken care of.

1663
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,264
Every day, Cognition is the largest company

1664
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,891
you've ever run.

1665
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,434
Your speed running, coming up to,

1666
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,895
which is true of me with Stripe as well, to be clear,

1667
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:01,566
but you're speed running learning how to run a company.

1668
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,444
I'm curious, how do you learn this stuff?

1669
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,488
How do you use AI, but how do you learn more broadly?

1670
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,322
Yeah.

1671
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:12,285
No, I mean it's, I've got a lot to learn still for sure.

1672
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,704
I think many of these functions are,

1673
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,373
if anything, like I mentioned,

1674
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,124
we have under invested in a lot of functions

1675
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,168
maybe because they're not as top of mind for us

1676
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,127
as they should be.

1677
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,087
And now that's something

1678
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,256
that we're pretty actively working to do more of.

1679
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,967
I don't believe in professional coach

1680
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,803
or career coach in the literal sense,

1681
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,514
but I think obviously you learn a lot from your peers

1682
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,141
and your friends who are doing similar things.

1683
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,643
So having a lot of close friends

1684
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,477
who are wanting— People you went

1685
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,812
to math camp with, apparently.

1686
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,563
Yeah, and then learn learning

1687
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,564
from all these different folks.

1688
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:45,026
I do think as an entrepreneur,

1689
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,820
it helps a lot to have

1690
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,322
a close group of friends that you can just be very honest

1691
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,907
and say, "This thing is totally messed up

1692
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,242
and I have no idea what we're going to do,

1693
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,076
and please tell me

1694
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,328
if you have done anything like this before."

1695
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,288
Or things like that, which has been really helpful.

1696
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,417
I think Eric and Karim from RAMP, for example,

1697
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,043
or all these various folks

1698
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,546
from math competitions.

1699
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:07,632
My previous co-founder Vlad from from Lunchclub,

1700
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,635
a lot of different folks that I talk to for advice.

1701
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,762
It really does help a lot.

1702
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,139
Last question, I'm curious,

1703
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,807
what is your information diet

1704
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,767
in terms of how you learn about the world?

1705
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,689
I feel like Twitter

1706
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,193
for tech news is really the place to be.

1707
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,361
We share a lot of things— Do you find there's too much

1708
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,155
video in the algorithm these days?

1709
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,823
I think there—

1710
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,283
It's kind of become TikTok.

1711
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,117
There is a lot of videos,

1712
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,493
but then I just don't watch the videos,

1713
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,245
for the most part, or you see the first few seconds...

1714
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,247
Which is an interesting thing to think about

1715
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,040
as people who are making videos too,

1716
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,126
of make sure you can convey your point

1717
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,128
with no sound and with the first three seconds.

1718
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,421
As much as you can do that,

1719
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,381
I think there are still like another like 5x

1720
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,800
of users you reach that are in that camp.

1721
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,385
The Twitter algorithm is the extent

1722
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,138
of how AI affects my information—

1723
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,848
But that's you on the receiving end of AI

1724
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,892
as opposed to you using AI as a tool.

1725
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,393
It's a good point. It's a good point.

1726
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,227
I mean, I should have Devin,

1727
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,353
just a GitHub action—

1728
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,314
The morning report, like Zazu— Have a common job basically

1729
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,357
where Devin just goes and does the morning report

1730
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,609
and gets out.

1731
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,570
There is a lot of optimization to do still.

1732
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,280
The president's daily briefing.

1733
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,865
Well, Scott, thank you. This is awesome.

1734
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,241
Thank you so much for having me.

1735
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,327
The national thing, obviously— Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1736
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,161
You're like whatever. Once that got too easy

1737
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,204
is then you take eight cards

1738
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,331
and you make the current year.

1739
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,916
And this year is now 2025,

1740
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,293
and so we get to try that one.

1741
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,127
And in this case it's actually

1742
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:30,840
quite easy because 13 minus 12 is 1,

1743
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,799
11 minus 10 is 1,

1744
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,468
1 plus 1 plus 7 is 9.

1745
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,929
And it turns out that 9 times 9 times 5 times 5

1746
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,097
is exactly 2025.

1747
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,642
But OK, so at some point that gets too easy.

1748
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,060
And now you guys can give me

1749
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,770
your favorite four digit number, let's say,

1750
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,729
and then we'll try and make that.

1751
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:49,150
Let's go with 6,843.

1752
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,277
6843, OK, so it's a little bit bigger,

1753
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,446
so we'll use nine cards for that.

1754
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,451
OK, 6843, right?

1755
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:03,456
So 6 plus 4 is 10,

1756
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,042
12 minus 10 is 2,

1757
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,588
2 times 10 times 10 is 200 plus 8 is 208,

1758
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:15,301
times 11 is 2288, minus 7 is 2281,

1759
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,637
and times three is 6843.

1760
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,063
Cheers. Well, you get another sip of Guinness for that.

1761
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,648
Yeah, I haven't had enough Guinness yet

1762
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:29,482
to be able to knock.

1763
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:32,235
Exactly, and now we test as drink more Guinness

1764
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,570
how the performance goes.
