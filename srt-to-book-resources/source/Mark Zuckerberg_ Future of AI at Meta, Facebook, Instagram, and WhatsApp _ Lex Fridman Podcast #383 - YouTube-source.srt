1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,760
- The following is a conversation

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,480
with Mark Zuckerberg,

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,490
his second time on this podcast.

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,410
He's the CEO of Meta

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,143
that owns Facebook, Instagram,

6
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,590
and WhatsApp, all services used

7
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,610
by billions of people to connect

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,480
with each other.

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,610
We talk about his vision for the future

10
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,380
of Meta and the future of AI

11
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,370
in our human world.

12
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,570
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast,

13
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,310
and now, dear friends,

14
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,770
here's Mark Zuckerberg.

15
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:30,169
So you competed

16
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:30,809
in your first Jiu-Jitsu tournament,

17
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,710
and me as a fellow

18
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,330
Jiu-Jitsu practitioner and competitor,

19
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,850
I think that's really inspiring,

20
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,570
given all the things you have going on.

21
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,230
So I gotta ask,

22
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,850
what was that experience like?

23
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,410
- Oh, it was fun.

24
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,850
I don't know, yeah,

25
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,779
I mean, well, look,

26
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:45,809
I'm a pretty competitive person.

27
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,309
- Yeah.

28
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,240
- Doing sports that basically require

29
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,360
your full attention,

30
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,630
I think is really important

31
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,049
to my mental health

32
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,560
and the way I just stay focused

33
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,980
at doing everything I'm doing.

34
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,950
So, I decided to get into martial arts,

35
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,720
and it's awesome.

36
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,280
I got a ton of my friends into it.

37
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,040
We all train together.

38
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,889
We have a mini academy in my garage.

39
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:10,590
And I guess one of my friends was like,

40
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,139
hey, we should go do a tournament.

41
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,160
I was like, okay, yeah, let's do it,

42
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,530
I'm not gonna shy away

43
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,620
from a challenge like that.

44
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,800
So yeah, but it was awesome,

45
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,760
it was just a lot of fun.

46
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,630
- You weren't scared, there was no fear?

47
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,700
I don't know, I was pretty sure

48
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,190
that I'd do okay.

49
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,780
- I like the confidence.

50
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,539
Well, so for people who don't know,

51
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:30,270
jiu-jitsu is a martial art

52
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,360
where you're trying

53
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,210
to break your opponent's limbs

54
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,127
or choke them to sleep,

55
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,070
and do so with grace and elegance

56
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,349
and efficiency and all that kind of stuff.

57
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:45,030
It's a kind of art form, I think,

58
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,270
that you can do for your whole life,

59
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,010
and it's basically a game,

60
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,460
a sport of human chess,

61
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,690
you can think of.

62
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:51,930
There's a lot of strategy, there's a lot

63
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,290
of sort of interesting human dynamics

64
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,650
of using leverage

65
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,130
And it's kind of incredible

66
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,370
what you could do.

67
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,839
You can do things

68
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,190
a much larger opponent,

69
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,730
and you get to understand the way

70
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,230
the mechanics of the human body works

71
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,309
because of that.

72
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:09,788
But you certainly can't be distracted.

73
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,039
- No, it's 100% focus.

74
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,670
To compete, I needed to get around

75
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,019
the fact that I didn't want it

76
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:18,426
to be this big thing,

77
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,280
so I basically just rolled up

78
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,210
with a hat and sunglasses,

79
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,950
and I was wearing a COVID mask.

80
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,420
And I registered under my first

81
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,470
and middle name, so Mark Elliott.

82
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,460
And it wasn't until I actually pulled

83
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,560
all that stuff off right before

84
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,340
I got on the mat

85
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,230
that I think people knew it was me.

86
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,290
So it was pretty low key.

87
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,700
- But you're still a public figure.

88
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,110
- Yeah, I mean, I didn't wanna lose.

89
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,540
- Right, the thing you're partially afraid

90
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,760
of is not just the losing,

91
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,600
but being almost like embarrassed.

92
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,780
It's so raw, the sport, in that like,

93
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,133
it's just you and another human being.

94
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:49,966
There's a primal aspect there.

95
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:50,799
- Oh, yeah its perfect.

96
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,060
- For a lot of people, it can be terrifying,

97
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,120
especially the first time

98
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,559
you're doing the competing,

99
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,070
and it wasn't for you.

100
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,570
I see the look of excitement in your face.

101
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,594
It wasn't, no fear.

102
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:03,500
- I just think part of learning is failing.

103
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,260
The main thing, people who train jiu-jitsu,

104
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,660
it's like you need to not have pride

105
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,940
because I mean all the stuff

106
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,090
that you were talking

107
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,900
about before about, you know,

108
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,730
getting choked or getting, you know,

109
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,190
a joint lock.

110
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,450
It's um, you only get

111
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,639
into a bad situation

112
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,620
once you've already lost right?

113
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,390
And, but obviously

114
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,390
when you're getting started

115
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,590
with something, you're not gonna be

116
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,140
So you just need to be willing

117
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,436
to go with that.

118
00:03:30,436 --> 00:03:30,980
But I think this is like, I don't know,

119
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,299
I mean, maybe I've just been

120
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:33,589
embarrassed enough times in my life.

121
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,379
Yeah.

122
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:36,089
I do think

123
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,430
you know, as people grow up,

124
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,030
maybe they don't wanna be embarrassed

125
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,910
or anything.

126
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,990
and they kind of have a sense

127
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,690
of who they are

128
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,790
and what they want to project

129
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,969
and I don't know.

130
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,270
I think maybe to some degree.

131
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,629
You know your ability

132
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,629
to keep doing interesting things

133
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:57,870
is your willingness to be embarrassed

134
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,820
again and go back to step one

135
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,780
and start as a beginner

136
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,910
and get your **** kicked

137
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,630
and you know look stupid doing things,

138
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,240
and yeah I think so many of the things

139
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,270
that we're doing

140
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,419
whether it's whether it's this.

141
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,660
I mean this is just like a kind

142
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,360
of a physical part of my life,

143
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,660
but but it running the company

144
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,970
it's like we just take on

145
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,769
new adventures and, you know,

146
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,969
all the big things that we're doing

147
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,710
I think of is like 10 plus year missions

148
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,108
that we're on where you think

149
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:27,667
of as like 10 plus year missions

150
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:27,910
that we're on where often early on,

151
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,409
people doubt that we're gonna be able

152
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:30,740
to do it and the initial work

153
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,750
seems kind of silly and our whole ethos

154
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,840
is we don't wanna wait,

155
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,530
to put it out there.

156
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:36,830
We wanna get it out quickly

157
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,940
and get feedback on it.

158
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,010
And so I don't know, I mean,

159
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,250
there's probably just something

160
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,830
about how I approach things in there.

161
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,400
But I just kind of think

162
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,599
that the moment that you decide

163
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:45,719
that you're gonna be too embarrassed

164
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,149
to try something new,

165
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,019
then you're not gonna

166
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:49,690
learn anything anymore.

167
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,280
But like I mentioned, that fear,

168
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,520
that anxiety could be there,

169
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,950
it could creep up every once in a while.

170
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,700
Do you feel that in especially

171
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,320
stressful moments sort of outside

172
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,950
of the judges and that, just at work?

173
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,260
Stressful moments, big decision days,

174
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,740
big decision moments,

175
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,860
how do you deal with that fear?

176
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,340
How do you deal with that anxiety?

177
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,780
The thing that stresses me out the most

178
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,360
is always the people challenges.

179
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,750
You know, I kind of think that,

180
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,045
you know, strategy questions, you know,

181
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:22,139
I tend to have enough conviction around

182
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,010
the values of what we're trying to do

183
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,580
and what I think matters

184
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,900
and what I want our company to stand

185
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,020
for that those don't really keep me up

186
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,409
at night that much.

187
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,120
it's not that I get everything right,

188
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,849
of course, I don't right I mean make

189
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:39,340
we make a lot of mistakes,

190
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,469
but I at least

191
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:43,300
have a pretty strong sense

192
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,990
of where I want us to go on that.

193
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,140
The thing in running a company

194
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,940
for almost 20 years now,

195
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,030
one of the things

196
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,809
is when you have a team that's cohesive,

197
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:59,240
you can get almost anything done.

198
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,530
And you can run

199
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,190
through super hard challenges,

200
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,120
You can make hard decisions

201
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,140
and push really hard

202
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,379
to do the best work even,

203
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,840
and kind of optimize

204
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,250
something super well.

205
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,415
But when there's that tension, I mean,

206
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,359
that's when things get really tough.

207
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:19,000
And when I talk to other friends

208
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,450
who run other companies

209
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,470
and things like that,

210
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,230
that I actually spend

211
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,450
on in running this company

212
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,830
is just fostering a pretty tight

213
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,809
core group of people

214
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:33,450
who are running the company with me.

215
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,719
And that to me is,

216
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,970
is kind of the thing that

217
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,230
both makes it fun, right?

218
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,880
Having, having, you know, friends

219
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,190
and people you've worked with

220
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,099
and new perspectives,

221
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:46,000
who can who you can go work

222
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
on some of these crazy things with.

223
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,929
But to me,

224
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:51,640
is when when there

225
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,020
are when there's tension, you know,

226
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,760
that's that that weighs on me.

227
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,469
I think the you know,

228
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:59,440
it's maybe not surprising.

229
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,510
I mean, we're like a very people

230
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,099
focused company and it's the the people

231
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,900
is the part of it that that, you know,

232
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,120
weighs on me the most to make sure

233
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,260
that we get right.

234
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,119
But yeah, that I'd say across everything

235
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:13,060
that we do is probably the big thing.

236
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,420
So when there's tension

237
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,870
in that inner circle of close folks,

238
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,640
so when you trust those folks

239
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,990
to help you make difficult decisions

240
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,480
about Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram,

241
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,323
the future of the company

242
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:34,170
and the metaverse with AI.

243
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,870
How do you build that close-knit group

244
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,270
of folks to make

245
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,060
those difficult decisions?

246
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,149
Is there people that you have

247
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:42,719
to have critical voices,

248
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:43,969
very different perspectives

249
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,379
on focusing on the past

250
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,680
versus the future,

251
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,200
all that kind of stuff.

252
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,760
Yeah, I mean, I think for one thing,

253
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,470
it's just spending a lot of time

254
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,940
with whatever the group

255
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,380
is that you wanna be that core group,

256
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,450
grappling with all

257
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,510
of the biggest challenges.

258
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,099
And that requires a fair amount

259
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,240
of openness.

260
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,740
And, you know, so I mean,

261
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,099
a lot of how I run the company is,

262
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,379
you know, it's like every Monday morning

263
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,450
we get our,

264
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,250
it's about the top 30 people together.

265
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,910
And we, and this is a group

266
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,469
that just worked together

267
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:16,159
for a long period of time.

268
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:16,389
And I mean, people, people rotate in,

269
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,900
I mean, new people join,

270
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,940
people leave the company,

271
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,380
people go to other roles in the company.

272
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,210
So it's not the the same group

273
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,179
over time.

274
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:25,270
But then we spend, you know,

275
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,810
a lot of times a couple of hours,

276
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,290
a lot of the time, it's, you know,

277
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,230
can be somewhat unstructured, we like,

278
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,790
I'll come with maybe a few topics

279
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,870
that I that are top of mind for me,

280
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,809
but I'll ask other people

281
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,630
to bring things and people, you know,

282
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,190
raise questions, whether it's okay,

283
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,330
there's an issue happening

284
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,590
in some country.

285
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,300
With with some policy issue,

286
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,570
there's like a new technology

287
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,640
that's developing here.

288
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,420
We're having an issue with this partner.

289
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,670
There's a design trade-off in WhatsApp

290
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,270
between two things that end up

291
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,020
being values that we care about deeply,

292
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,630
and we need to decide

293
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,263
where we want to be on that.

294
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:00,539
And I just think over time,

295
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,980
by working through a lot of issues

296
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,090
with people and doing it openly,

297
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,590
people develop an intuition

298
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,040
for each other

299
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,020
and a bond and camaraderie.

300
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,839
And to me, developing that is like a lot

301
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,559
of the fun part of running a company,

302
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,149
or doing anything, right?

303
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:20,990
who are kind of along on the journey

304
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,323
that you're, that you feel like

305
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:23,390
you're doing it with.

306
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:23,600
Nothing is ever just

307
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,730
one person doing it.

308
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,670
Are there people that disagree

309
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,478
often within that group?

310
00:09:28,478 --> 00:09:29,740
Oh yeah, it's a fairly combative group.

311
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,830
Okay, so combat is part of it.

312
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,459
So this is making decisions on design,

313
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,600
engineering, policy, everything.

314
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,720
Everything, everything.

315
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,060
Yeah.

316
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,950
I have to ask just back to Jiu-Jitsu

317
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,840
for a little bit,

318
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,310
what's your favorite submission now

319
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,610
that you've been doing it?

320
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,400
What's how do you like to submit

321
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,559
your opponent Mark Zuckerberg?

322
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,460
I'm in well, but first of all,

323
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,450
I Do you prefer no gi or gi jiu-jitsu?

324
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,860
So gi is this outfit you wear

325
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,560
that is Maybe mimics clothing,

326
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,849
so you can choke.

327
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:07,799
What's like a kimono?

328
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,470
It's like the traditional martial arts

329
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,399
or kimono.

330
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:10,659
Pajamas.

331
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:12,219
Pajamas.

332
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:13,374
Pajamas.

333
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:14,000
That you could choke people with, yes.

334
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,149
Well, it's got the lapels.

335
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:16,670
Yes.

336
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,270
Yeah, so I like jujitsu.

337
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,120
I also really like MMA.

338
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,440
And so I think

339
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,449
no gi more closely approximates MMA.

340
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,689
And I think my style is,

341
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,850
is maybe a little closer

342
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,040
to an MMA style.

343
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,000
So like a lot of jiu jitsu players

344
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,660
are fine being on their back, right.

345
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,830
And obviously having a good guard

346
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,160
is a critical part of jiu jitsu, but,

347
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
but in MMA,

348
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,950
you don't want to be on your back,

349
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,390
right?

350
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,580
you're just taking punches

351
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,770
while you're on your back.

352
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,529
So that's no good.

353
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:48,770
So you like being on top.

354
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,880
My style is I'm probably more pressure

355
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,559
and yeah, and I'd probably

356
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,639
rather be the top player.

357
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,830
But I'm also smaller, right?

358
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,290
I'm not like a heavyweight guy, right?

359
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,719
So from that perspective, I think like,

360
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,139
you know, it's especially because,

361
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,360
you know, if I'm doing a competition,

362
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,310
I'll compete with people

363
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,270
who are my size,

364
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,400
but a lot of my friends are bigger

365
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,230
than me.

366
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,490
So, so back takes probably pretty

367
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,670
important, right?

368
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,230
Because that's where you have

369
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,620
the most leverage advantage, right?

370
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,050
Where, you know, people, you know,

371
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,530
their arms, your arms

372
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:22,560
are very weak behind you, right?

373
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,240
So, so being able to get to the back

374
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,550
and take that pretty important.

375
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,800
But I don't know,

376
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,490
is to not be too committed

377
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,100
to any single submission.

378
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,150
But that said,

379
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,060
So I always think that chokes

380
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,690
are a somewhat more humane way

381
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,940
to go than joint locks.

382
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,850
Yeah, and it's more about control,

383
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,180
it's less dynamic.

384
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,670
So, you're basically

385
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:46,840
like a Habib Nurmagomedov

386
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,140
type of fighter.

387
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,150
So let's go, yeah,

388
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,370
I think is like the clean way to go.

389
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,969
Straightforward answer right there.

390
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:55,100
What advice would you give

391
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,090
to people looking

392
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,430
to start learning jiu-jitsu?

393
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,260
Given how busy you are,

394
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,939
given where you are in life,

395
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,310
that you're able to do this,

396
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,380
you're able to train,

397
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,569
you're able to compete

398
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:08,530
and get to learn something

399
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,809
from this interesting art.

400
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:12,059
I just think you have to be willing

401
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,559
to just get beaten up a lot.

402
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,069
Yeah.

403
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,300
I mean, it's, but I mean,

404
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,080
over time, I think that there's a flow

405
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,550
to all these things.

406
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,430
And there's, you know, one of the,

407
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,980
one of, I don't know,

408
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,490
my experiences that I think kind

409
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,140
of transcends, you know,

410
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,700
running a company and the different,

411
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,539
different activities

412
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:36,420
that I like doing are,

413
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,029
I really believe that like,

414
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:38,810
if you're going

415
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,150
to accomplish whatever anything,

416
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,140
a lot of it is just being willing

417
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,400
to push through, right,

418
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,569
and having the grit and determination

419
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,069
to, push through difficult situations.

420
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,020
And I think for a lot of it

421
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,022
is just being willing to push through,

422
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:51,324
right, and having the grit

423
00:12:51,324 --> 00:12:51,925
and determination

424
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:53,100
that ends up being sort

425
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,079
of a difference maker between the people

426
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,390
who kind of get the most done and not.

427
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,450
I mean, there's all these questions

428
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,210
about like, you know,

429
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,400
how many days people want to work

430
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,114
and things like that.

431
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:06,889
who like start successful companies

432
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,480
or things like

433
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,509
that are just working extremely hard.

434
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,570
But I think one of the things

435
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,790
by doing this over time or very acutely

436
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,180
with things like Jiu Jitsu

437
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,880
or surfing is you can't push

438
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,130
through everything.

439
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,850
And I think that that's you,

440
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,759
you learn this stuff very acutely.

441
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,719
You run doing sports compared

442
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,790
to running a company because running

443
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,390
a company, the cycle times are so long,

444
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,100
right?

445
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,230
It's like you start a project

446
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,560
and then, you know,

447
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,320
it's like months later or you know,

448
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,450
if you're building hardware,

449
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,460
it could be years later

450
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,920
before you're actually getting feedback

451
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,510
and able to, you know, make the next set

452
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,790
of decisions for the next version

453
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,670
of the thing

454
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,860
f the thing that you're doing.

455
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,139
Whereas one of the things

456
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:50,080
that I just think is mentally so nice

457
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,920
about these very high

458
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,500
turnaround conditioning sports,

459
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,409
things like that,

460
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:57,080
is you get feedback very quickly.

461
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,690
Right, it's like, okay,

462
00:13:59,690 --> 00:13:59,780
like I don't counter someone correctly,

463
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,030
you get punched in the face, right?

464
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,110
So not in jiu-jitsu,

465
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,440
you don't get punched in jiu-jitsu,

466
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,920
but in MMA.

467
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,180
There are all these analogies

468
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,240
between all these things

469
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,210
that I think actually hold that are like

470
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,410
important life lessons, right?

471
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,360
It's like, okay, you're surfing a wave,

472
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,719
it's like, you know,

473
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,509
sometimes you're like,

474
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,370
you can't go in the other direction

475
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,480
on it, right?

476
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,890
It's like, there are limits to kind

477
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,350
of what, you know, it's like a foil,

478
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,700
you can pump the foil

479
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,350
and push pretty hard in a bunch

480
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,350
of directions, but like, yeah, you,

481
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,360
you know, it's at some level,

482
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,450
like the momentum

483
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,650
against you is strong enough, you're,

484
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,700
that's not gonna work.

485
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
And I do think that that's sort

486
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,770
of a humbling,

487
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,640
but also an important lesson for,

488
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,320
I think people who are running things

489
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,440
or building things, it's like, yeah,

490
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,890
a lot of the game is just being able

491
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,330
to kind of push

492
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,640
and work through complicated things,

493
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,380
but you also need to kind of have enough

494
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,380
of an understanding

495
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:58,390
of which things you just can't push

496
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,270
through and where the finesse

497
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,330
is more important.

498
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,480
Yeah.

499
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:04,930
What are your jujitsu life lessons?

500
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,850
Well, I think you did it,

501
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,759
you made it sound so simple

502
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,790
and were so eloquent that it's easy

503
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,370
to miss.

504
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,559
But basically being okay

505
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,660
and accepting the wisdom and the joy in

506
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,630
the getting your ass kicked

507
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,000
in the full range of what that means.

508
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,530
I think that's a big gift,

509
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,910
of the being humbled.

510
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,530
Somehow being humbled,

511
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,100
especially physically,

512
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,640
opens your mind to the full process

513
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,370
of learning, what it means to learn,

514
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,700
which is being willing to suck

515
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,529
at something.

516
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,932
And I think Jiu-Jitsu

517
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:44,710
just very repetitively,

518
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,920
efficiently humbles you over and over

519
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,300
and over and over

520
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,870
to where you can carry that lessons

521
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,630
to places where you don't get humbled

522
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,150
as much, whether it's research

523
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,220
or running a company or building stuff,

524
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,820
the cycle is longer.

525
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,640
In Jiu-Jitsu, you can just get humbled

526
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,090
in a period of an hour,

527
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,960
over and over and over and over,

528
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,449
especially when you're a beginner,

529
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:07,980
you'll have a little person,

530
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,039
just somebody much smarter than you,

531
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,060
just kick your ass repeatedly,

532
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,660
definitively, where there's no argument.

533
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,599
Oh yeah.

534
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,139
And then you literally tap,

535
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,240
because if you don't tap,

536
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,559
you're going to die.

537
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,870
So this is an agreement,

538
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,529
you could have killed me just now,

539
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:28,430
but we're friends,

540
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,310
so we're gonna agree

541
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,340
And that kind of humbling process,

542
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,330
it just does something to your psyche,

543
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,580
to your ego that puts it in

544
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,200
its proper context to realize

545
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,889
that everything in this life

546
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,299
is like a journey from sucking

547
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:45,730
through a hard process

548
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,680
of improving rigorously day

549
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,230
after day after day after day.

550
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,300
Any kind of success requires hard work.

551
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,180
Yeah, jiu-jitsu,

552
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,170
more than a lot of

553
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,450
because I've done a lot of them,

554
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,969
really teaches you that.

555
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,639
And you made it sound so simple.

556
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,759
Like, I'm okay, you know, it's okay,

557
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,930
it's part of the process,

558
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,598
you just get humble,

559
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:07,467
get your ass kicked.

560
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:07,848
I've just failed and been embarrassed

561
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:09,589
so many times in my life that like,

562
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,730
you know, it's a core competence

563
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,375
at this point.

564
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,719
Well, yes, and there's a deep truth

565
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:16,819
to that, being able to,

566
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,598
and you said it in the very beginning,

567
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,368
which is, that's the thing

568
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:22,079
that stops us, especially

569
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,169
as you get older,

570
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:24,270
especially as you develop expertise

571
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,619
in certain areas,

572
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,910
not being willing to be a beginner

573
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,040
in a new area.

574
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,430
Yeah.

575
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,080
Because that's where the growth happens,

576
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,940
is being willing to be a beginner,

577
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,460
being willing to be embarrassed,

578
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,520
saying something stupid,

579
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,900
doing something stupid.

580
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,470
A lot of us that get good at one thing,

581
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,950
you wanna show that off,

582
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,570
and it sucks being a beginner,

583
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,970
but it's where growth happens.

584
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,910
Well, speaking of which,

585
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,759
let me ask you about AI.

586
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,429
It seems like this year,

587
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:58,210
for the entirety

588
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,379
of the human civilization,

589
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:00,020
is an interesting year

590
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,940
for the development

591
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,590
of artificial intelligence.

592
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,460
A lot of interesting stuff is happening.

593
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,180
So, meta is a big part of that.

594
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,020
Meta has developed Lama,

595
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,140
which is a 65 billion parameter model.

596
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,970
There's a lot of interesting questions

597
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,890
I can ask here,

598
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,060
one of which has to do with open source.

599
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,070
But first, can you tell the story

600
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,050
of developing of this model

601
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,180
and making the complicated decision

602
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,630
of how to release it?

603
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,049
Yeah, sure.

604
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:32,059
I think you're right, first of all,

605
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:33,509
that in the last year there

606
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:37,580
have been a bunch of advances on scaling

607
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,700
up these large transformer models.

608
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,950
So there's the language equivalent

609
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,130
of it with large language models,

610
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,910
there's sort

611
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,950
of the image generation equivalent

612
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,520
with these large diffusion models.

613
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,650
Um there's a lot of fundamental research

614
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,119
that's gone into this

615
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,580
and meta has taken the approach

616
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,250
of being quite open and academic

617
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,340
in our development um of of AI.

618
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,130
Part of this is we wanna have

619
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,490
the best people

620
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:08,500
in the world researching this,

621
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,590
and a lot of the best people wanna know

622
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,579
that they're gonna be able

623
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:14,190
to share their work.

624
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,880
So that's part of the deal that we have,

625
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,150
is that we can get,

626
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,929
if you're one of the top AI researchers

627
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:21,030
in the world, you can come here,

628
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,340
you can get access to kind

629
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,229
of industry scale infrastructure.

630
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,060
And part of our ethos is that we want

631
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,280
to share what's invented broadly.

632
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,850
We do that with a lot

633
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,360
of the different AI tools

634
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,349
that we create.

635
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,320
And LLAMA is the language model

636
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,880
that our research team made.

637
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,550
And we did a limited open source release

638
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,340
for it, right,

639
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,640
which was intended for researchers

640
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,180
to be able to use it.

641
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,340
But you know, responsibility

642
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,500
and getting safety right

643
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,150
on these is very important.

644
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,210
So we didn't think that

645
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,019
for the first one,

646
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:01,980
there were a bunch of questions around

647
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,139
whether we should be

648
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:04,230
releasing this commercially.

649
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,320
So we kind of punted on that for V1

650
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,510
of Llama

651
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,920
and just released it for research.

652
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,710
Now, obviously,

653
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,430
by releasing it for research, you know,

654
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,490
it's out there,

655
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,630
that they're not supposed

656
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,099
to kind of put

657
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,820
it into commercial releases.

658
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,630
And we're working

659
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,029
on the follow-up models for this

660
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,139
and thinking through

661
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,920
how exactly this should work

662
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,530
for follow-on now that we've had time

663
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,880
to work on a lot more of the safety

664
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,990
and the pieces around that.

665
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,590
But overall, I just kind of think that

666
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,120
it would be good if there were a lot

667
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,920
of different folks who had the ability

668
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,260
to build state-of-the-art

669
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,790
technology here, and not just a small number

670
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,480
of big companies.

671
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,709
To train one of these AI models,

672
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:03,220
the state-of-the-art models you know,

673
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,570
hundreds of millions of dollars

674
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,820
of infrastructure, right?

675
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,850
So there are not that many organizations

676
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,750
in the world, um,

677
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,449
that can do that

678
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:13,110
at the biggest scale today.

679
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,719
And now it gets,

680
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,199
it gets more efficient every day.

681
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:19,910
So, I do think that will be available

682
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,020
to more folks over time,

683
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,030
but I just think

684
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,730
like there's all this innovation out

685
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,530
there that people can create.

686
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,410
And I just think that we'll also learn

687
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,920
a lot by seeing what the whole community

688
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,050
of students and hackers and startups

689
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,490
and different folks build with this.

690
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,660
And that's kind of been

691
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,880
how we've approached this.

692
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,240
And it's also how we've done a lot

693
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,290
of our infrastructure.

694
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:44,980
And we took our whole data center design

695
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,059
and our server design

696
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:48,110
and we built this open compute project

697
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,179
where we just made that public

698
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:51,516
and part of the theory was like,

699
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:54,050
all right, if we make it

700
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,430
so that more people can use

701
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,420
the server design,

702
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,060
then that'll enable more innovation.

703
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,900
It'll also make

704
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,200
the server design more efficient

705
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,420
and that'll make

706
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,590
our business more efficient too.

707
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,669
So that's worked

708
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:04,700
and we've just done this with a lot

709
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,530
of our infrastructure.

710
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,740
So for people who don't know,

711
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,020
you did the limited release,

712
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I think in February

713
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,530
of this year of Lama,

714
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:15,540
and it got quote unquote leaked,

715
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,340
meaning like it escaped

716
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,410
the limited release aspect, but it was,

717
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,840
you know, that's something

718
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,340
you probably anticipated,

719
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,510
given that it's just released

720
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,939
to researchers.

721
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,000
We shared it with researchers.

722
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,470
Right, so it's just trying to make sure

723
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,530
that there's like a slow release.

724
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,240
Yeah.

725
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,030
But from there,

726
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,139
I just would love to get your comment

727
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:40,679
on what happened next, which is like,

728
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:41,940
there's a very vibrant

729
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,269
open source community

730
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:44,530
that just built stuff on top of it.

731
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,539
There's a Llamama CPP,

732
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:48,970
basically stuff that makes it

733
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,030
more efficient to run

734
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,740
There's combining with reinforcement

735
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,900
learning with human feedback,

736
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,530
so some of the different

737
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,490
interesting fine tuning mechanisms.

738
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,059
There's then also like fine tuning

739
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:02,920
in a GPT-3 generations.

740
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,149
There's a lot of GPT-4ALL, Alpaca,

741
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:08,360
Colossal AI, all these kinds of models

742
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,540
just kind of spring up,

743
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,620
like run on top of wood.

744
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,190
Like, what do you think about that?

745
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,290
No, I think it's been

746
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,660
I mean, there's been folks

747
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,120
who are getting it to run

748
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,429
on local devices, right?

749
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:21,360
So if you're an individual who just,

750
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,439
you know, wants to experiment

751
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,019
with this at home.

752
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:26,440
You probably don't have a large budget

753
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,780
to get access to a large amount

754
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,030
of cloud compute.

755
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,690
So getting it to run

756
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,179
on your local laptop is pretty good

757
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,190
and pretty relevant.

758
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,080
And then there are things

759
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,660
like Lama CPP re-implemented

760
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,790
it more efficiently.

761
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,620
So,you know,now even when we run our own

762
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,870
versions of it,

763
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,260
we can do it on way less compute

764
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,950
and it's just way more efficient,

765
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,160
save a lot of money for everyone

766
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,960
who uses this.

767
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,659
So that is good.

768
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,369
I do think it's worth calling out that

769
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,750
because this was a relatively

770
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,440
early release, LLAMA isn't quite

771
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,900
as on the frontier as, for example,

772
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,710
the biggest open AI models

773
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,540
or the biggest Google models.

774
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,059
You mentioned that

775
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,230
the largest Lama model that we released

776
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,930
had 65 billion parameters.

777
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,970
No one knows, I guess,

778
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,600
outside of OpenAI,

779
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,970
exactly what the specs are for GPT-4.

780
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,490
But I think the, you know,

781
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,279
my understanding is

782
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,190
it's like 10 times bigger.

783
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,900
And I think Google's Palm model is also,

784
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,990
I think, has about 10 times

785
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,040
as many parameters.

786
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,820
are very efficient, so they perform well

787
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,990
for something

788
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,700
that's around 65 billion parameters.

789
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,429
So for me, that was also part of this,

790
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:45,520
because there's this whole

791
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,150
debate around, you know,

792
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,670
is it good for everyone in the world

793
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,850
to have access

794
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,089
to the most frontier AI models?

795
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:59,130
And I think as the AI models

796
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,560
start approaching something

797
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,300
that's like a super human intelligence,

798
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,400
that's a bigger question

799
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,570
that we'll have to grapple with.

800
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,610
But right now, I mean,

801
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,920
these are still very basic tools.

802
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,730
They're powerful in the sense

803
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,490
that a lot of open source software

804
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,650
like databases or web servers can enable

805
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,870
a lot of pretty important things.

806
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,440
Um, but I don't think anyone looks

807
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,280
at the, you know, the current generation

808
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,990
of llama and thinks it's, um, you know,

809
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,280
anywhere near a super intelligent.

810
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,350
So I think that a bunch

811
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,060
of those questions around like, is it,

812
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,940
is it good to kind of get out there?

813
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,270
I think at this stage,

814
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,960
surely you want more researchers working

815
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,840
on it for all the reasons

816
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,020
that open source software has a lot

817
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,469
of advantages and we talked

818
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:47,129
about efficiency before

819
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:47,410
but another one is just

820
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,300
open source software tends

821
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,830
to be more secure

822
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,030
because you have more people looking

823
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,880
at it openly and scrutinizing it

824
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,360
and finding holes in it and that makes

825
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,299
it more safe.

826
00:25:58,299 --> 00:25:59,349
So I think at this point it's more

827
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,020
I think it's generally agreed upon

828
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,910
that open source software

829
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,900
is generally more secure and safer

830
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,190
than things that are kind of developed

831
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,500
in a silo where people try

832
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,510
to get through security

833
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,514
through obscurity.

834
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:13,890
So I think that for the scale

835
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,380
of what we're seeing now with AI,

836
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,740
I think we're more likely to get

837
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,490
to good alignment and good understanding

838
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,469
of kind of what needs

839
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:24,890
to do to make this work well

840
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,040
by having it be open source.

841
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,090
And that's something

842
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,370
that I think is quite good

843
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,350
to have out there and happening publicly

844
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,710
at this point.

845
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,490
Meta released a lot of models

846
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,789
as open source.

847
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:38,420
So the Massillon multilingual speech model,

848
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,070
the H5 model.

849
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,680
Yeah, that was neat.

850
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:42,890
I mean, I'll ask you questions

851
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,829
about those, but the point

852
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:45,940
is you've open sourced quite a lot.

853
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,940
You've been spearheading

854
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,360
Where's, that's really positive,

855
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,970
inspiring to see from one angle,

856
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,040
from the research angle.

857
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,320
Of course, there's folks

858
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,330
who are really terrified

859
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,960
about the existential threat

860
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,539
of artificial intelligence,

861
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:00,479
and those folks will say that, you know,

862
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,179
you have to be careful

863
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:06,480
about the open sourcing step.

864
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,910
But where do you see the future

865
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,519
of open source here as part of meta?

866
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,870
The tension here is,

867
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,129
do you wanna release the magic sauce?

868
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,119
That's one tension.

869
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,450
And the other one is,

870
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,530
do you wanna put a powerful tool

871
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,920
in the hands of bad actors,

872
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,099
even though it probably

873
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:28,110
has a huge amount

874
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:31,060
Yeah, I mean, again,

875
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,080
I think for the stage

876
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,889
that we're at in the development of AI,

877
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:35,369
I don't think anyone looks

878
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:37,049
and thinks that

879
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:37,179
this is super intelligence.

880
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:39,790
And you know, the models

881
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,320
that we're talking about,

882
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,540
the Lama models here are, you know,

883
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,280
generally an order of magnitude smaller

884
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,070
than what OpenAI or Google are doing.

885
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,920
So I think that at least for the stage

886
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,649
that we're in now,

887
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:54,920
the equities balance strongly

888
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,230
in my view towards

889
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,450
doing this more openly.

890
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,650
I think if you got something

891
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,820
that was closer to super intelligence,

892
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,450
then I think you'd have to discuss

893
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,139
that more and and think through

894
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:07,889
that a lot more

895
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:09,300
and we haven't made a decision,

896
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,559
yet as to what we would do

897
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,730
if we were in that position,

898
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,210
but I don't think I think

899
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:14,220
there's a good chance

900
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,830
that we're pretty far off

901
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,680
from that position.

902
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,929
So, I'm not.

903
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,970
I'm certainly not saying

904
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,080
that the position that we're taking

905
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,470
on this now applies

906
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,880
to every single thing

907
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,649
that we would ever do.

908
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:29,359
And certainly inside the company,

909
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,020
we probably do more open source work

910
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,600
than most of the

911
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,390
other big tech companies.

912
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,990
But we also

913
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,330
don't open source everything.

914
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,790
A lot of the core kind of app code

915
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,000
for WhatsApp or Instagram or something,

916
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,150
we're not open sourcing that.

917
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,340
It's not like a general enough piece

918
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,670
of software that would be useful

919
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,630
for a lot of people

920
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,879
to do different things.

921
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,000
You know, whereas the software

922
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,839
that we do whether

923
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:55,790
it's like a an open source server design,

924
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,910
or or basically, you know,

925
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,290
things like memcache right like a good,

926
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,040
you know, it was probably

927
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,279
our earliest project

928
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,159
that that I worked on.

929
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:06,610
It was probably one of the last things

930
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,660
that I coded and led directly

931
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,850
for the company.

932
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,580
But but basically,

933
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,180
this like caching tool

934
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,180
for quick data retrieval.

935
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,870
These are things

936
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,380
that are just broadly useful across

937
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,039
like anything that you want to build.

938
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,450
And, and I think that some

939
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,214
of the language models

940
00:29:25,214 --> 00:29:25,933
now have that feel I think that some

941
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:26,629
of the language models

942
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:27,536
now have that feel, as well as some

943
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:28,570
of the other things that we're building,

944
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,970
like the translation tool

945
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,090
that you just referenced.

946
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,360
So text-to-speech and speech-to-text,

947
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,389
you've expanded it

948
00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:37,579
from around 100 languages

949
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:38,710
to more than 1,100 languages.

950
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,390
Yeah.

951
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,549
the model can identify more

952
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,070
than 4,000 spoken languages,

953
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,240
which is 40 times more

954
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,560
than any known previous technology.

955
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,920
To me, that's really, really,

956
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,120
really exciting in terms

957
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,780
of connecting the world,

958
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,130
breaking down barriers

959
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,700
that language creates.

960
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,920
Yeah, I think being able to translate

961
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,440
between all of these different pieces

962
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,570
in real time,

963
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,520
this has been a kind

964
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,740
of common sci-fi idea

965
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,510
that we'd all have,

966
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,660
whether it's an earbud, or glasses,

967
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,960
or something that can help translate

968
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,080
in real time

969
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,160
between all these different languages.

970
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,510
And that's one that I think technology

971
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,860
is basically delivering now.

972
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,484
So, yeah,

973
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:21,960
I think that's pretty exciting.

974
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,710
You mentioned the next version of Lama.

975
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,730
What can you say mentioned

976
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:24,930
the next version of LLAMA,

977
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,110
what can you say

978
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,409
What can you say

979
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:31,540
about what you're working on

980
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,820
in terms of release,

981
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,090
in terms of the vision for that?

982
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,810
Well, a lot

983
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,010
of what we're doing is taking

984
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,119
the first version,

985
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:40,780
which was primarily

986
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,340
this research version,

987
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,740
and trying to now build a version

988
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,780
that has all

989
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,679
of the latest state-of-the-art

990
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,370
safety precautions built in

991
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:55,439
and and we're using some more data

992
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:58,670
to train it from across our services,

993
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,230
but a lot of the work

994
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,060
that we're doing internally is really

995
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,170
just focused on making sure that this is

996
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,869
as aligned and responsible as possible.

997
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,819
And we're building a lot of our own.

998
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,950
We're talking about

999
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,920
But the main thing that we focus

1000
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,790
on building here,

1001
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,116
a lot of product experience

1002
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:24,060
and express themselves.

1003
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,011
So we're going to have talked

1004
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:25,380
So, you know, we're gonna, I've talked

1005
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,050
about a bunch of this stuff,

1006
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,219
but you'll have, you know, an assistant

1007
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:32,400
that you can talk to in WhatsApp.

1008
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
You know, I think,

1009
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,620
every creator will,

1010
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,480
will have kind of an AI agent

1011
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,429
that can kind of act on their behalf

1012
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:41,259
that their fans can talk to.

1013
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:42,430
I want to get to the point

1014
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,150
where every small business basically

1015
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,629
has an AI agent that people can talk

1016
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:48,650
to for, you know, to do commerce

1017
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,430
and customer support

1018
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,460
and things like that.

1019
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,810
So there can be all

1020
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:55,660
these different things and LLAMA,

1021
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,590
or the language model underlying this

1022
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,220
is basically going to be the engine

1023
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,980
that powers that.

1024
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,550
The reason to open source it is that

1025
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,650
as we did with the first version

1026
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:11,270
is that it basically it unlocks a lot

1027
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,680
of innovation in the ecosystem will make

1028
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,750
our products better as well,

1029
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,770
and also gives us a lot

1030
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,290
of valuable feedback on security

1031
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,080
and safety, which is important

1032
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,079
for making this good.

1033
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:22,740
But yeah, I mean the work

1034
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,119
that we're doing to advance

1035
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,180
the infrastructure,

1036
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,130
it's basically at this point taking it

1037
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,920
beyond a research project

1038
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,130
into something which is ready

1039
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,700
to be kind of core infrastructure,

1040
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,160
not only for our own products,

1041
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,910
but you know, hopefully for a lot

1042
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,099
of other things out there too.

1043
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:40,809
Do you think the LLAMA

1044
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:43,010
or the language model underlying that

1045
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,590
version two will be open sourced.

1046
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,900
Do you have internal debate around that,

1047
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,530
the pros and cons and so on?

1048
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,670
This is, I mean, we were talking

1049
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,480
about the debates

1050
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,300
that we have internally

1051
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,420
and I think the question

1052
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,900
is how to do it, right?

1053
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,070
I mean, I think we did

1054
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,970
the research license for v1

1055
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,470
and I think the the big thing

1056
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,260
that we're that we're thinking

1057
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,510
about is is basically like

1058
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,110
what's the what's the right way.

1059
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,130
So there was a leak that happened,

1060
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,150
I don't know if you can comment

1061
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,210
on it for v1.

1062
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,610
You know, we released it

1063
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,530
as a research project for researchers

1064
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,320
to be able to use, but in doing so,

1065
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,160
we put it out there.

1066
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,170
So, you know, we were very clear

1067
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,110
that anyone who uses the code

1068
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,580
and the weights doesn't

1069
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,550
to put into products.

1070
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,480
And we've generally seen people respect

1071
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,450
that, right?

1072
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:35,625
It's like

1073
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,540
you don't have any reputable companies

1074
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,480
that are basically trying to put this

1075
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,570
into their commercial products.

1076
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,780
But yeah, but by sharing it with,

1077
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,840
you know, so many researchers, it's,

1078
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,809
you know, it did leave the building.

1079
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:48,370
But what have you learned

1080
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,010
from that process that you might be able

1081
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,309
to apply to V2

1082
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:54,139
about how to release it safely,

1083
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:57,640
effectively, if you release it?

1084
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,520
Yeah, well, I mean,

1085
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,370
like I said,

1086
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,290
is just around different things

1087
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,960
around how do you fine tune models

1088
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,240
to make them more aligned and safer?

1089
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,190
And you see

1090
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,369
all the different data recipes that, um,

1091
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:13,400
you know, you mentioned

1092
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,159
a lot of different projects

1093
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,120
that are based on this.

1094
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,460
I mean, there's one at Berkeley,

1095
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,518
there's, you know,

1096
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,750
and people have tried a lot

1097
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,800
of different things

1098
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,989
and we've tried a bunch

1099
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:26,929
of stuff internally.

1100
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,333
So kind of

1101
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,250
where we're making progress here,

1102
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,896
but also we're able to learn from some

1103
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:32,340
of the best ideas in the community.

1104
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,170
And I think we want

1105
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,460
to just continue pushing that forward.

1106
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,650
But I don't have any news to announce

1107
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,480
on this, if that's what you're asking.

1108
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,996
I mean, this is a

1109
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,409
This is a thing

1110
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:47,610
that we're still kind of, you know,

1111
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,449
actively working through the right way

1112
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,730
to move forward here.

1113
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,489
The details of the secret sauce

1114
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,260
are still being developed.

1115
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,959
I see.

1116
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,190
Can you comment on what do you think

1117
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,929
of the thing that worked for GPT,

1118
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:03,310
which is the reinforcement learning

1119
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,740
with human feedback?

1120
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,890
So doing this alignment process,

1121
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,760
do you find it interesting?

1122
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,130
And as part of that, let me ask,

1123
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,270
because I talked to Jan Lekun

1124
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,080
before talking to you today,

1125
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,130
he asked me to ask,

1126
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,570
or suggested that I ask,

1127
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,880
do you think LLM fine tuning will need

1128
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,139
to be crowdsourced Wikipedia style?

1129
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,860
So crowdsourcing.

1130
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,330
So this kind of idea of how

1131
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,250
to integrate the human

1132
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,810
in the fine tuning

1133
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,980
of these foundation models.

1134
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,910
Yeah, I think

1135
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,580
that's a really interesting idea

1136
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,170
that I've talked to Jan about a bunch.

1137
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,090
And we were talking

1138
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,890
about how do you basically train

1139
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,830
these models to be as safe and aligned

1140
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,200
and responsible as possible

1141
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,720
and different groups out there

1142
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,320
who are doing development

1143
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,690
test different data recipes

1144
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,150
and fine tuning.

1145
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,999
But this idea that you just mentioned

1146
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:03,279
is that at the end of the day,

1147
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,470
instead of having kind

1148
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,100
of one group fine tune some stuff

1149
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,080
and another group, you know,

1150
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,720
produce a different fine tuning recipe

1151
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,790
and then us trying to figure out

1152
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,990
which one we think works best

1153
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,969
to produce the most aligned model.

1154
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,690
I do think that it would be nice

1155
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,770
if you could get to a point

1156
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,020
where you had a Wikipedia style

1157
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,430
collaborative way for a kind

1158
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,669
of a broader community

1159
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:33,850
to fine tune it as well.

1160
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,039
Now there's a lot of challenges in that

1161
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,690
both from an infrastructure

1162
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,070
and like a community management

1163
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,160
and product perspective

1164
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,259
about how you do that.

1165
00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:45,410
So I haven't worked that out yet.

1166
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,420
Um but but as an idea,

1167
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,780
I think it's it's quite compelling

1168
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,220
and I think it it goes well

1169
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,870
with the ethos of open sourcing.

1170
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,090
The technology is also finding a way

1171
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,080
to have a kind of community driven um

1172
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,440
a community driven training of it.

1173
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,340
Um but I think that there are a lot

1174
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,950
of questions on this in general.,

1175
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,460
these questions around

1176
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,590
what's the best way

1177
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,719
to produce aligned AI models,

1178
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,080
it's very much a research area.

1179
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,630
And it's one that I think we will need

1180
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,610
to make as much progress on

1181
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,790
as the kind

1182
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:17,970
of core intelligence capability

1183
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,130
of the models themselves.

1184
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,790
Well, I just did a conversation

1185
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,960
with Jimmy Wales,

1186
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,524
the founder of Wikipedia.

1187
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:27,390
And to me, Wikipedia is one

1188
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,900
of the greatest websites ever created,

1189
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,990
and it's a kind of a miracle

1190
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,220
that it works.

1191
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,150
And I think it has to do

1192
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,380
which is community.

1193
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,310
You have a small community of editors

1194
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,520
that somehow work together well,

1195
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,910
and they handle

1196
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,740
very controversial topics

1197
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,180
and they handle it with balance

1198
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,430
and with grace despite sort

1199
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,820
of the attacks that will often happen.

1200
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,770
A lot of the time.

1201
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,850
I mean, it's not,

1202
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,120
it has issues just like

1203
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,349
any other human system.

1204
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:59,020
But yes, I mean, the balance is, I mean,

1205
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,030
it's amazing what they've been able

1206
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,049
to achieve, but it's also not perfect.

1207
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:05,759
And I think that that's,

1208
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:06,760
there's still a lot of challenges.

1209
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,930
Right, the more controversial the topic,

1210
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:14,450
the more difficult the journey towards,

1211
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,509
quote unquote, truth or knowledge

1212
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:18,870
or wisdom that Wikipedia

1213
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,540
tries to capture.

1214
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,100
we need to be able

1215
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,460
to generate those same things, truth,

1216
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,850
knowledge, and wisdom,

1217
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,510
and how do you align those models

1218
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,930
that they generate something

1219
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,940
that is closest to truth.

1220
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,050
There's these concerns

1221
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,100
about misinformation,

1222
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,700
all this kind of stuff

1223
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,390
that nobody can define,

1224
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,890
and it's just something that we together

1225
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,870
as a human species have to define.

1226
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,280
Like what is truth?

1227
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,715
And how to help

1228
00:38:50,715 --> 00:38:52,160
And one of the things language models

1229
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,860
do really well is generate

1230
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,449
convincing sounding things

1231
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:57,450
that can be completely wrong.

1232
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,940
And so how do you align it

1233
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,390
to be less wrong?

1234
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,810
And part of that is the training

1235
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,123
And part of that is the training

1236
00:39:09,123 --> 00:39:10,730
And however you do the alignment stage.

1237
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,329
And just like you said,

1238
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:14,030
it's a very new

1239
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,670
and a very open research problem.

1240
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,099
Yeah, and I think that

1241
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:20,250
there's also a lot of questions

1242
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,780
about whether

1243
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,680
the current architecture for LLMs,

1244
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,150
as you continue scaling it,

1245
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,949
what happens?

1246
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,990
A lot of what's been exciting

1247
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,799
in the last year is that there's clearly

1248
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:37,120
a qualitative breakthrough where,

1249
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,130
with some of the GPT models that OpenAI

1250
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,170
put out and that others have been able

1251
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,200
to do as well,

1252
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,360
I think it reached a kind of level

1253
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,600
of quality where people like, wow,

1254
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,969
this is this feels different,

1255
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,060
and like it's going to be able

1256
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,570
to be the foundation for building a lot

1257
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,000
of awesome products

1258
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,030
and experiences and value.

1259
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,390
But I think the other realization

1260
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,740
that people have is wow,

1261
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,200
we just made a breakthrough.

1262
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,180
Um, if there are

1263
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,910
other breakthroughs quickly,

1264
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,910
then I think that there's the sense

1265
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,089
that maybe where we're closer

1266
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:11,160
to general intelligence.

1267
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,180
But I think that that idea

1268
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,380
is predicated on the idea

1269
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,630
that I think people believe

1270
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,740
that there's still generally a bunch

1271
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,320
of additional breakthroughs to make

1272
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,500
and that it's um, we just don't know

1273
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,659
how long it's going

1274
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:24,610
to take to get there.

1275
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,510
And you know one view

1276
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,690
that some people have this doesn't tend

1277
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,139
to be my view as much

1278
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:32,140
is that simply scaling the current LLMs

1279
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,460
and you know getting

1280
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:34,640
to higher parameter count models

1281
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,800
by itself will get to something

1282
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,090
that is closer

1283
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,309
to general intelligence.

1284
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:43,230
But I don't know I tend to think

1285
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,160
that there's probably more more

1286
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,632
but I don't know,

1287
00:40:49,632 --> 00:40:49,662
that there's probably

1288
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:49,970
more fundamental steps that need

1289
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:50,050
to be taken along the way there.

1290
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,660
But still, the leaps taken

1291
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,360
with this extra alignment step

1292
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,510
is quite incredible,

1293
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,750
quite surprising to a lot of folks.

1294
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,440
And on top of that,

1295
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,849
when you start

1296
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:03,160
to have hundreds of millions

1297
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,230
of people potentially using a product

1298
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,320
that integrates that,

1299
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,270
you can start

1300
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,840
to see civilization transforming effects

1301
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,510
before you achieve super, quote unquote,

1302
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,050
super intelligence.

1303
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,590
It could be super transformative

1304
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,240
without being a super intelligence.

1305
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,229
Oh yeah, I mean,

1306
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:22,799
I think that there are gonna be a lot

1307
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:24,650
of amazing products

1308
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,070
and value that can be created

1309
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,750
with the current level of technology.

1310
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,820
To some degree,

1311
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,990
I'm excited to work on a lot

1312
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,970
of those products

1313
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,259
over the next few years

1314
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:37,830
and I think it would just create

1315
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,490
a tremendous amount of whiplash

1316
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,320
if the number of breakthroughs keeps,

1317
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,560
if they're keep on being stacked

1318
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,765
breakthroughs because I think

1319
00:41:45,765 --> 00:41:45,880
to some degree industry

1320
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,110
in the world needs some time

1321
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,230
to kind of build these breakthroughs

1322
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,330
into the products and experiences

1323
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,739
that we all use

1324
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,109
But I don't know.

1325
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:00,089
I think that there's

1326
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:01,860
just a like an awesome amount

1327
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,020
of stuff to do.

1328
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,420
I mean, I think about like all of the,

1329
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,580
I don't know, small businesses

1330
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,810
or individual entrepreneurs

1331
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,510
out there who, um, you know,

1332
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,280
now we're going to be able

1333
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,999
to get help coding the things

1334
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,330
that they need to go build things

1335
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,920
or designing the things that they need,

1336
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,990
or, um, we'll be able to, you know,

1337
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,410
use these models to be able

1338
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,510
to do customer support

1339
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,290
for the people that they're,

1340
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,030
over WhatsApp without having to,

1341
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,620
you know, I think

1342
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,520
that's just going to be,

1343
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:29,816
I just think that this is all going

1344
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:32,040
to be super exciting.

1345
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,369
It's going to create better experiences

1346
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:35,859
for people and just unlock a ton

1347
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:37,790
of innovation and value.

1348
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,629
So I don't know if you know,

1349
00:42:39,629 --> 00:42:41,390
but you know, what is it,

1350
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,270
over three billion people use WhatsApp,

1351
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,960
Facebook, and Instagram.

1352
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,960
So any kind of AI-fueled products

1353
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,050
that go into that,

1354
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,859
anything with LLMs,

1355
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:57,010
will have a tremendous amount of impact.

1356
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,450
Do you have ideas and thoughts

1357
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,890
about possible products

1358
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,889
that might start being integrated

1359
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,910
into these platforms used

1360
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,240
by so many people?

1361
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,069
Yeah, I think

1362
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:12,209
there's three main categories of things

1363
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:13,220
that we're working on.

1364
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:21,140
The first that I think is probably

1365
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,330
the most interesting

1366
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,758
is there's this notion

1367
00:43:25,758 --> 00:43:25,991
of you're gonna have an assistant

1368
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:26,435
that I think is probably

1369
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:26,850
the most interesting is, you know,

1370
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,770
there's this notion of like,

1371
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,299
you're gonna have an assistant

1372
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:31,420
or an agent who you can talk to.

1373
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,580
And I think probably the biggest thing

1374
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,310
that's different about my view

1375
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,570
of how this plays out from what I see

1376
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,069
with OpenAI and Google and others is,

1377
00:43:41,069 --> 00:43:42,789
you know, everyone else

1378
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,150
is building like, the one singular AI,

1379
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,610
right?

1380
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,359
It's like, okay,

1381
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:47,460
you talk to chat GPT

1382
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,440
or you talk to Bard or you talk to Bing.

1383
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,280
And my view is that they're going

1384
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,830
to be a lot of different AIs that people

1385
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,940
are going to want to engage with,

1386
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,100
just like you want to use, you know,

1387
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,130
a number of different apps

1388
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,439
for different things.

1389
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:05,740
And you have relationships

1390
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,020
with different people in your life

1391
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,430
who fill different emotional roles

1392
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,640
for you.

1393
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,190
And I think that they're going

1394
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:17,950
to be people have a reason

1395
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,980
that I think you don't just want like

1396
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,139
a singular AI.

1397
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:22,219
And that I think is probably

1398
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:24,230
the biggest distinction in terms

1399
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,450
of how I think about this.

1400
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,600
And a bunch of these things,

1401
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,580
I think you'll want an assistant.

1402
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,980
I mean, I mentioned a couple

1403
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,520
of these before.

1404
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,380
who you interact

1405
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,400
with will ultimately want some kind

1406
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,950
of AI that can proxy them

1407
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,589
and be something that their fans

1408
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:41,570
can interact with or that allows them

1409
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,200
to interact with their fans.

1410
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,420
This is like the common crater promise.

1411
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,630
Everyone's trying to build a community

1412
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,070
and engage with people

1413
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:51,993
and they want tools to be able

1414
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:53,970
and be able to do that.

1415
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,980
Um, but, but you only have 24 hours

1416
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,730
in a day.

1417
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,060
So, um, so I think having the ability

1418
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,850
to basically like bottle up

1419
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,890
your personality and um

1420
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,930
or you know like give your fans

1421
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,190
information about when you're performing

1422
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,940
a concert or or something like that.

1423
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,110
I mean that's that I think

1424
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,750
is going to be something

1425
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,729
that's super valuable

1426
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:15,370
but it's not just that you know again

1427
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,429
it's not this idea that

1428
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:18,230
I think people are going

1429
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,730
to want just one singular AI.

1430
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,930
I think you're gonna you know

1431
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:20,950
you're going to want to interact

1432
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,480
with a lot of different entities

1433
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,730
and then I think there's the business

1434
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,870
version of this too

1435
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:26,450
which we've touched on a couple

1436
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:27,250
of times,

1437
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,740
which is I think every business

1438
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,170
in the world is going to want basically

1439
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,730
an AI that, you know,

1440
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:35,750
it's like you have your page

1441
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,440
on Instagram, or Facebook, or WhatsApp,

1442
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,260
or whatever.

1443
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:40,950
And you want to,

1444
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,270
you want to point people to an AI

1445
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,850
that people can interact with,

1446
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,220
but you want to know that that AI

1447
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:46,250
is only going to sell your products.

1448
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,710
You don't want it recommending

1449
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,320
your competitors stuff, right?

1450
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,410
So it's not like there

1451
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:53,030
can be just one singular AI

1452
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,390
that can answer all the questions

1453
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,570
for a person because that AI

1454
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,490
might not actually be aligned

1455
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,700
with you as a business to really just do

1456
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,060
the best job providing support

1457
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,550
for your product.

1458
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,630
So I think that there's gonna

1459
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,059
be a clear need in the market

1460
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,230
and in people's lives for there

1461
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,200
to be a bunch of these.

1462
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,330
Part of that is figuring out

1463
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,620
the research,

1464
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,250
the technology that enables

1465
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,270
the personalization

1466
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:22,420
that you're talking about.

1467
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,860
So not one centralized, God-like LLM,

1468
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,509
but one just a huge diversity

1469
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:29,539
of them that's fine-tuned

1470
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:31,390
to particular needs, particular styles,

1471
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,570
particular businesses,

1472
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,360
particular brands,

1473
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,470
all that kind of stuff.

1474
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:37,510
And also just enabling people

1475
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,389
to create them really easily

1476
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,279
for your own business,

1477
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:44,210
or if you're a creator,

1478
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:44,560
to be able to help you engage

1479
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,310
with your fans

1480
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:46,520
and I I've met that's,

1481
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,660
so yeah I I think that

1482
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,790
there's a clear kind

1483
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,040
of interesting product direction here

1484
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,110
that I think is fairly unique

1485
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,100
from what you know any

1486
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,549
of the other big companies

1487
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:00,640
are taking it also aligns well

1488
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,130
with this sort of open source approach

1489
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:03,140
because again we sort

1490
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,020
of believe in this more community oriented,

1491
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,260
more democratic approach

1492
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,080
to building out the products

1493
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,160
and technology around this.

1494
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,080
We don't think that there's gonna be

1495
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,370
We think that there should be kind

1496
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,840
of a lot of development.

1497
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,540
So that part of things I think is gonna

1498
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,450
be really interesting

1499
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,040
and we could we could go probably spend

1500
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,350
a lot of time talking about that

1501
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,920
and the the kind of implications

1502
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,040
of that approach being different

1503
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,670
from what others are taking,

1504
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,090
but there's a bunch

1505
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,200
of other simpler things

1506
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,060
that I think we're also going to do

1507
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,410
just going back to your question

1508
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,570
around how this finds its way

1509
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:38,469
into like what do we build there

1510
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:39,860
are going to be a lot of simpler things

1511
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,920
around.

1512
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,160
Okay, you you post photos on Instagram,

1513
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,310
and Facebook, and, you know,

1514
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,600
and WhatsApp and Messenger

1515
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,010
and like you want the photos to look

1516
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,040
as good as possible.

1517
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,190
so like having an AI

1518
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,570
that you can just like take a photo

1519
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,420
and then just tell it like okay.

1520
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,469
I want to edit this thing,

1521
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:59,430
or describe this.

1522
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:00,409
It's like I think we're we're going

1523
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:01,390
to have tools that are just way better

1524
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,860
than than what we've historically

1525
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,910
had on this and that's more in the image

1526
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,200
and media generation side

1527
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,750
than the large language model side,

1528
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,309
but it all kind of plays off of advances

1529
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:13,389
in the same space.

1530
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:15,520
So, there are a lot of tools

1531
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,249
that I think are just going

1532
00:48:17,249 --> 00:48:18,209
to get built into every one

1533
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:18,860
of our products.

1534
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,620
I think every single thing that we do

1535
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,540
is going to basically get evolved

1536
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,899
in this direction.

1537
00:48:23,899 --> 00:48:24,859
It's like in the future,

1538
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:25,560
if you're advertising on our services,

1539
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,900
like, do you need to make your own kind

1540
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,080
of ad creative?

1541
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,160
It's no, you'll just, you know,

1542
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,670
you just tell us, okay,

1543
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,320
I'm I'm a dog walker and I, you know,

1544
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,080
willing to walk people's dogs

1545
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,960
and help me find the right people

1546
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,530
and like create the ad unit

1547
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,940
that will perform the best.

1548
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,740
And give an objective to the system

1549
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,599
and it just kind of connects you

1550
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,779
with the right people.

1551
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:54,830
Well, that's a super powerful idea

1552
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:57,130
of generating the language,

1553
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,490
almost like rigorous A-B testing for you

1554
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:06,440
that works to find the best customer

1555
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,720
for your thing.

1556
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,270
I mean, to me, advertisement,

1557
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,759
when done well,

1558
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:12,840
just finds a good match

1559
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,609
between a human being

1560
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:15,910
and a thing that will make that

1561
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:16,970
human being happy.

1562
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,279
Yeah, totally.

1563
00:49:20,279 --> 00:49:21,150
And do that as efficiently as possible.

1564
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,180
When it's done well,

1565
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:23,679
people actually like it.

1566
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:25,220
You know, I think that there's a lot

1567
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,730
of examples where it's not done well

1568
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,700
and it's annoying

1569
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,420
and I think that's what kind of gives it

1570
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,180
a bad rap.

1571
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,660
But yeah, a lot of this stuff

1572
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,620
is possible today.

1573
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,150
I mean, obviously,

1574
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:35,760
A-B testing stuff is built

1575
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,600
into a lot of these frameworks.

1576
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,990
The thing that's new

1577
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,100
is having technology that can generate

1578
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,439
the ideas for you

1579
00:49:42,439 --> 00:49:44,530
So, I think that's exciting.

1580
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,039
So, this will just be across everything

1581
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:47,904
that we're doing, right,

1582
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:49,110
all the metaverse stuff

1583
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:49,960
that we're doing, right?

1584
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,560
in the future, you'll just describe them

1585
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,970
and then it'll create the code for you.

1586
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:55,500
So natural language

1587
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,510
becomes the interface we use

1588
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,370
for all the ways we interact

1589
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,849
with the computer, with the digital.

1590
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:05,860
More of them.

1591
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,310
Yeah, which is what everyone

1592
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:08,910
can do using natural language.

1593
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,240
And with translation,

1594
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,290
you can do it in any kind of language.

1595
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,950
I mean, for the personalization,

1596
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,609
it's really, really, really interesting.

1597
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,489
Yeah.

1598
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:20,740
It unlocks so many possible things.

1599
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,790
I mean, I, for one,

1600
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:23,120
look forward to creating a copy

1601
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,250
of myself.

1602
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,200
I know, we talked about this last time.

1603
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,040
But this has, since the last time,

1604
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,460
this becomes- Now we're closer.

1605
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,089
Much closer.

1606
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:35,170
Like I can literally

1607
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:35,790
just having interacted

1608
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:35,849
with some of these language models,

1609
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:37,790
I can see the absurd situation

1610
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,449
where I'll have a large,

1611
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:43,371
or a Lex language model,

1612
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:43,898
and I'll have to have a conversation

1613
00:50:43,898 --> 00:50:44,840
with him large Or a Lex language model

1614
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,500
and I'll have to have a conversation

1615
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,230
with him about like hey listen.

1616
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:51,610
Like you're just getting out of line

1617
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,070
and having a conversation

1618
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:54,880
to be a little bit more respectful

1619
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,810
or something like this.

1620
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:00,049
And yeah, that's going to be the,

1621
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:02,900
that seems like an amazing product

1622
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,580
for businesses, for humans,

1623
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,450
just not just the assistant

1624
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,380
that's facing the individual,

1625
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,090
but the assistant

1626
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:14,380
that represents the individual

1627
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,200
to the public, both directions.

1628
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,380
There's basically a layer

1629
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,260
that is the AI system

1630
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,290
through which you interact

1631
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,830
with the outside world,

1632
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:26,930
with the outside world

1633
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,400
that has humans in it.

1634
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,150
That's really interesting.

1635
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:33,559
And you that have social networks

1636
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:35,430
that connect billions of people,

1637
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,980
it seems like a heck

1638
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,900
of a large scale place

1639
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,430
to test some of this stuff out.

1640
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,950
Yeah, I mean,

1641
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,050
I think part of the reason why creators

1642
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:47,410
will want to do this is

1643
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,019
because they already have the

1644
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:48,259
communities on our services.

1645
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:51,889
Yeah, and a lot of the interface

1646
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:53,740
for this stuff today

1647
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,410
are chat type interfaces.

1648
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:58,710
And between WhatsApp and Messenger,

1649
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:01,410
I think that those are just great ways

1650
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,870
to interact with people.

1651
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:05,030
So some of this is philosophy,

1652
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,820
but do you see a near term future

1653
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,280
where you have some

1654
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,660
of the people you're friends with

1655
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:15,820
are AI systems on these social networks,

1656
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,070
on Facebook, on Instagram,

1657
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:21,000
even on WhatsApp, having conversations

1658
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,080
where some heterogeneous,

1659
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,370
some humans, some is AI.

1660
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,929
I think we'll get to that.

1661
00:52:28,209 --> 00:52:31,180
And if only just empirically looking at,

1662
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,270
then Microsoft released

1663
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,399
this thing called

1664
00:52:36,399 --> 00:52:38,090
Showice several years ago in China.

1665
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,950
And it was a pre-LLM chatbot technology

1666
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,240
that so it was a lot simpler

1667
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,240
than what's possible today.

1668
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,480
And I think it was like tens

1669
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,870
of millions of people

1670
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,540
were using this and just really

1671
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,700
became quite attached

1672
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,860
and built relationships with it.

1673
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,930
And I think that there's services today

1674
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:00,289
like replica

1675
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:01,260
where people are doing things like that.

1676
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,420
And so I think that

1677
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,119
there's certainly needs

1678
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,940
for companionship that people have, older people.

1679
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,830
And I think most people

1680
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,270
probably don't have as many friends

1681
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:20,430
If you look at, there's some interesting

1682
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:24,230
demographic studies around like

1683
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,910
the average person

1684
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,690
has the number of close friends

1685
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,530
that they have

1686
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:32,080
is fewer today than it was 15 years ago.

1687
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,630
And I mean, that gets to like,

1688
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:35,840
this is like the core thing

1689
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,200
that I think about

1690
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,920
in terms of building services

1691
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,299
that help connect people.

1692
00:53:42,299 --> 00:53:43,140
So I think you'll get tools

1693
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,930
that help people connect with each other

1694
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,300
are gonna be the primary thing

1695
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,480
that we wanna do.

1696
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,800
So you can imagine, AI assistance that,

1697
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,170
just do a better job of reminding you

1698
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,230
when it's your friend's birthday

1699
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,930
and how you can celebrate them, right?

1700
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,779
It's like right now

1701
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:00,330
in the corner of the website

1702
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,719
that tells you

1703
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:02,880
whose birthday it is

1704
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,870
and stuff like that.

1705
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,212
But it's some level,

1706
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:06,680
you don't just wanna like

1707
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,160
send everyone a note that says

1708
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,180
the same note

1709
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:10,980
saying happy birthday

1710
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,870
So having something that's more

1711
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,480
of a social assistant

1712
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,280
in that sense

1713
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,210
and like that can update you

1714
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,820
on what's going on in their life

1715
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,190
and like how you can reach out

1716
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,640
to them effectively,

1717
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:24,980
help you be a better friend.

1718
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,100
I think that that's something

1719
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,350
But yeah, beyond that,

1720
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:32,450
and there were all these different

1721
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:36,590
flavors of kind of personal AIs

1722
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,210
that I think could exist.

1723
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,500
So I think an assistant is sort

1724
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,420
of the kind of simplest one

1725
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,630
to wrap your head around,

1726
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:46,490
but I think a mentor

1727
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,330
or a life coach,

1728
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,340
someone who can give you advice,

1729
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,860
who's maybe like a bit of a cheerleader

1730
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,010
who can help pick you up through

1731
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,969
all the challenges

1732
00:54:54,969 --> 00:54:56,740
that inevitably we all go through

1733
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,920
on a daily basis

1734
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,520
and that there's probably some role

1735
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,980
for something like that.

1736
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,260
And then all the way,

1737
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,370
you can probably just go through

1738
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,280
a lot of the different type of kind

1739
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,370
of functional relationships

1740
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,020
that people have in their life.

1741
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,750
And I would bet that

1742
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,770
there will be companies out there

1743
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,930
that take a crack at a lot

1744
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,050
of these things.

1745
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:17,210
So I don't know,

1746
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,390
I think it's part of the interesting

1747
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,740
innovation that's gonna exist

1748
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,560
is that there are certainly

1749
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,060
a lot like education tutors, right?

1750
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,629
It's like, I mean,

1751
00:55:26,629 --> 00:55:28,860
I just look at my kids learning to code

1752
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,100
and they love it,

1753
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,750
but it's like they get stuck

1754
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,830
on a question

1755
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,330
and they have to wait till like,

1756
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,500
I can help answer it right

1757
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,840
or someone else who they know

1758
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,200
can help answer the question

1759
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,120
in the future.

1760
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,490
They'll just,

1761
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:41,929
there will be like a coding assistant

1762
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:44,460
that they have that is like designed

1763
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,790
to be perfect

1764
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:48,120
for teaching a five

1765
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,075
and they'll just be able

1766
00:55:49,075 --> 00:55:50,910
to ask questions all the time

1767
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,360
and it will be extremely patient.

1768
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,970
It's never gonna get annoyed at them, right?

1769
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,010
I think that like,

1770
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,970
of relationships

1771
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,230
that we have in our lives

1772
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,670
that they're really interesting.

1773
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,050
And I think one of the big questions

1774
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:09,300
is like, okay,

1775
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:09,370
is this all gonna just get bucketed

1776
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:12,790
into one singular AI?

1777
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,630
I just don't, I don't think so.

1778
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,969
Do you think about,

1779
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:18,099
let's actually a question from Reddit,

1780
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:20,150
what the long-term effects

1781
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,309
of human communication

1782
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:24,390
when people can talk with, in quotes,

1783
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,190
talk with others through a chatbot

1784
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,620
that augments their language automatically

1785
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,410
rather than developing social skills

1786
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,930
by making mistakes and learning?

1787
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,599
Will people just communicate by grunts

1788
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,010
in a generation?

1789
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,289
I mean, do you think

1790
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:40,579
about long-term effects at scale,

1791
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:41,610
the integration of AI

1792
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,940
in our social interaction?

1793
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,680
Yeah, I mean, I think it's mostly good.

1794
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,220
I mean, that question was sort of framed

1795
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,340
in a negative way,

1796
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,180
but I mean,

1797
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,120
we were talking before

1798
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:53,500
about language models

1799
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,680
helping you communicate with,

1800
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,160
it was like language translation

1801
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,119
helping you communicate

1802
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:58,710
with people

1803
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:59,080
that don't speak your language.

1804
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,900
I mean, at some level,

1805
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,280
what all this social technology is doing

1806
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,710
is helping people express themselves

1807
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,669
better to people

1808
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,280
in situations where they would otherwise

1809
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,420
have a hard time doing that.

1810
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,370
So part of it might be okay,

1811
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:16,920
because you speak a language

1812
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,089
that I don't know,

1813
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:19,100
that's a pretty basic one that,

1814
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,200
you know, I don't think people

1815
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,300
are gonna look at that

1816
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,380
and say, it's sad that do we have

1817
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,839
the capacity to do that

1818
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,730
your language, right?

1819
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,020
I mean, that's pretty high bar.

1820
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,540
But overall,

1821
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:34,929
I'd say there are all these impediments

1822
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:38,410
and language is an imperfect way

1823
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,050
for people

1824
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:41,590
to express thoughts and ideas.

1825
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,756
It's, you know,

1826
00:57:43,756 --> 00:57:44,780
one of the best that we have,

1827
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,580
we have that, we have art, we have code.

1828
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,140
But language is also a mapping

1829
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,300
of the way you think,

1830
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,420
the way you see the world, who you are.

1831
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,959
And one of the applications

1832
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:54,819
I've recently talked to a person

1833
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:58,530
who's actually a jiu-jitsu instructor,

1834
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:03,120
he said that when he emails parents

1835
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,730
about their son and daughter

1836
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:08,490
that they can improve

1837
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,529
their discipline in class and so on,

1838
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:13,090
he often finds that he comes off a bit

1839
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,020
of more

1840
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:15,100
of an asshole than he would like.

1841
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,840
So he uses GPT

1842
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,860
to translate his original email

1843
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,110
into a nicer email, more polite one.

1844
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,290
We hear this all the time,

1845
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:25,890
a lot of creators

1846
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:25,960
on our services tell us

1847
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,070
that one of the most stressful things

1848
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:31,270
is basically negotiating deals

1849
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,310
with brands and stuff,

1850
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,317
like the business side of it.

1851
00:58:33,317 --> 00:58:34,720
Cause they're like, I mean,

1852
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,150
they do their thing, right?

1853
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:38,640
And, you know, the creators,

1854
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:38,900
they're excellent at what they do

1855
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,170
and they just want to connect

1856
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:41,760
with their community,

1857
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:41,930
but then they get really stressed,

1858
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,009
you know, they go into their DMs

1859
00:58:44,009 --> 00:58:46,039
and they see some brand wants

1860
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:48,079
to do something with them

1861
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:48,640
and they don't quite know

1862
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,690
how to negotiate

1863
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:51,450
or how to push back respectfully.

1864
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:53,670
So, I think building a tool

1865
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,420
that can actually allow them

1866
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,830
to do that well is the one simple thing

1867
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:59,280
that I think is just like

1868
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,270
an interesting thing

1869
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,370
that we've heard from a bunch

1870
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,319
of people

1871
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:05,210
that they'd be interested in.

1872
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,070
But I'm going back to the broader idea.

1873
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,420
I don't know.

1874
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,800
I mean, you know, I just, Priscilla and I

1875
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,780
just had our third daughter.

1876
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,080
Congratulations by the way.

1877
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,780
It's like one of the saddest things

1878
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,020
in the world

1879
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,240
is like seeing your baby cry, right?

1880
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,220
But like, it's like, why is that, right?

1881
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,710
It's like, well,

1882
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,150
cause babies don't generally

1883
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:30,100
have much capacity to tell you

1884
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,059
what they care about otherwise, right?

1885
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:35,440
It's not actually just babies, right?

1886
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,580
It's, you know,

1887
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,360
my five year old daughter cries too

1888
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,620
because she sometimes

1889
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,020
has a hard time expressing,

1890
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,240
you know, what matters to her.

1891
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,789
And I was thinking about that

1892
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:47,610
and I was like,

1893
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:48,430
get very frustrated too

1894
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,890
because they can't,

1895
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:51,290
they have a hard time expressing things

1896
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:53,210
in a way that going back to some

1897
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,350
of the early themes

1898
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,259
that maybe is something that, you know,

1899
00:59:58,259 --> 01:00:00,100
is a mistake or maybe they have pride

1900
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,495
or something

1901
01:00:01,495 --> 01:00:02,790
So I don't know.

1902
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:04,890
I think that all

1903
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:05,120
of these different technologies

1904
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,060
that can help us navigate

1905
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,910
the social complexity

1906
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,720
and actually be able to better express

1907
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,080
are what we're feeling and thinking.

1908
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,000
I think that's generally all good.

1909
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,320
And there are all these,

1910
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,650
these concerns like,

1911
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:20,050
okay, are people gonna

1912
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,920
because you have Google

1913
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,370
to look things up?

1914
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,760
a generation later,

1915
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,560
you don't look back and lament that.

1916
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,170
I think it's, you know, just like, wow,

1917
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,510
we have so much more capacity

1918
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,840
to do so much more now.

1919
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,319
And I think that that'll be

1920
01:00:33,319 --> 01:00:33,880
the case here too.

1921
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,389
You can allocate

1922
01:00:35,389 --> 01:00:38,930
to like deeper, nuanced thought.

1923
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,060
Yeah.

1924
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,880
But it's change.

1925
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,170
So with, just like with Google search,

1926
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:50,090
the additional language models,

1927
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,950
large language models,

1928
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,039
you basically don't have

1929
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:54,660
to remember nearly as much.

1930
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:57,240
Just like with Stack Overflow

1931
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,500
for programming,

1932
01:00:59,500 --> 01:00:59,620
now that these language models

1933
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,330
can generate code right there.

1934
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:02,760
I mean, I find that I write like

1935
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,480
maybe 80%, 90% of the code

1936
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,910
I write is non-generated first

1937
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:11,270
and then edited.

1938
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:11,750
I mean, so you don't have to remember

1939
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,800
how to write specifics

1940
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,110
of different functions.

1941
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,290
Oh, but that's great.

1942
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:19,660
it's not just the specific coding.

1943
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:20,910
I mean, in the context

1944
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,410
of a large company like this,

1945
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:25,800
I think before an engineer

1946
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,160
can sit down to code,

1947
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,740
they first need to figure out all

1948
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,760
of the libraries

1949
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,510
and dependencies that, you know,

1950
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:33,880
tens of thousands

1951
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,810
of people have written before them.

1952
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:37,923
And, you know, one of the things

1953
01:01:37,923 --> 01:01:39,800
that I'm excited about

1954
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,959
that we're working on is it's not just,

1955
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:43,750
you know, tools that help engineers code,

1956
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,200
it's tools that can help summarize

1957
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,990
the whole knowledge base

1958
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,480
and help people be able to navigate

1959
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,740
all the internal information.

1960
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:53,400
I think that that's, in the experiments

1961
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,720
that I've done with this stuff,

1962
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,690
I mean, that's on the public stuff.

1963
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:00,670
You just, you know, ask one of these models

1964
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,510
to build you a script that does anything

1965
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:05,190
and it basically already understands

1966
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,270
what the best libraries

1967
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,600
are to do that thing

1968
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,959
It's, I mean,

1969
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,330
That was always the most annoying part

1970
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,399
of coding

1971
01:02:14,399 --> 01:02:14,690
was that you had to spend all this time

1972
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,610
actually figuring out

1973
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:17,480
that you were supposed to import

1974
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,790
before you could actually

1975
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:20,429
start building the thing.

1976
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:21,679
Yeah.

1977
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:22,369
I mean, there's, of course,

1978
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:23,420
the flip side of that,

1979
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,670
I think for the most part is positive,

1980
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:28,090
but the flip side is if you outsource

1981
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:31,960
that thinking to an AI model,

1982
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,480
you might miss nuanced mistakes

1983
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,250
and bugs, you lose the skill

1984
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,180
to find those bugs.

1985
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,450
And those bugs might be,

1986
01:02:42,449 --> 01:02:44,520
the code looks very convincingly right,

1987
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,860
but it's actually wrong

1988
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:53,270
But that's the trade-off that we face

1989
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,340
as human civilization when we build

1990
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,799
more and more powerful tools.

1991
01:02:57,799 --> 01:03:00,560
When we stand on the shoulders of taller

1992
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,470
and taller giants,

1993
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,900
we could do more, but then we forget

1994
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,420
how to do all the stuff that they did.

1995
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,900
It's a weird trade-off.

1996
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,219
Yeah, I agree.

1997
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:12,630
I mean, I think it is very valuable

1998
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,000
in your life

1999
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,520
to be able to do basic things too.

2000
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:16,840
Do you worry about some

2001
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,730
of the concerns of bots

2002
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,840
being present on social networks?

2003
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,980
More and more human-like bots

2004
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:28,330
that are not necessarily trying

2005
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:29,559
to do a good thing

2006
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:31,410
or they might be explicitly trying

2007
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,750
to do a bad thing,

2008
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,160
like phishing scams,

2009
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,279
like social engineering,

2010
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:37,720
all that kind of stuff,

2011
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,300
a very difficult problem

2012
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,243
for social networks,

2013
01:03:41,243 --> 01:03:41,580
but now it's becoming almost a more

2014
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,760
and more difficult problem.

2015
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,090
Well, there's a few different parts of this.

2016
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:50,350
So one is there are all these harms

2017
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,440
that we need to basically fight

2018
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,869
against and prevent.

2019
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:56,230
And that's been a lot

2020
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:57,830
of our focus over the last

2021
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:01,470
five or seven years

2022
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:01,580
is basically ramping up

2023
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,880
very sophisticated AI systems,

2024
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,180
not generative AI systems,

2025
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,290
more kind of classical AI systems

2026
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:12,289
to be able to categorize and classify

2027
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:15,940
and identify, okay, this post looks

2028
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,740
like it's promoting terrorism.

2029
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:21,599
This one is exploiting children.

2030
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,100
This one looks like it might be trying

2031
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,219
to incite violence.

2032
01:04:25,219 --> 01:04:28,119
This one's an intellectual property violation.

2033
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:31,910
So there's like 18 different categories

2034
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:35,420
of violating kind of harmful content

2035
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,820
that we've had to build specific systems

2036
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:40,199
to be able to track.

2037
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:42,389
And I think it's certainly the case

2038
01:04:42,389 --> 01:04:46,100
that advances in generative AI

2039
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,170
will test those.

2040
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,320
But at least so far, it's been the case,

2041
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,120
and I'm optimistic that it will continue

2042
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,570
to be the case

2043
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:59,020
to bring more computing power to bear

2044
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,429
to have even stronger AI's

2045
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,600
that can help defend

2046
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,519
against those things.

2047
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:04,410
So we've had to deal

2048
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:06,650
with some adversarial issues before,

2049
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,310
right?

2050
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:08,430
It's, I mean, for some things

2051
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:09,760
like hate speech,

2052
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,200
it's like people aren't generally getting

2053
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,960
a lot more sophisticated,

2054
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,929
like the average person who,

2055
01:05:14,929 --> 01:05:16,960
let's say, you know, if someone's saying

2056
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,590
some kind of racist thing, right?

2057
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:19,640
It's like they're not necessarily

2058
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,679
getting more sophisticated

2059
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:21,780
at being racist, right?

2060
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,659
It just, it's okay.

2061
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:24,860
So that the system can just find.

2062
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,870
But then there's other adversaries

2063
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:29,220
who actually are very sophisticated,

2064
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,950
like nation-states doing things.

2065
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:34,070
And we find, whether it's Russia

2066
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,160
or just different countries

2067
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,590
that are basically standing up

2068
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:39,590
these networks

2069
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:42,030
of bots or inauthentic accounts

2070
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,070
is what we call them

2071
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:46,460
because they're not necessarily bots.

2072
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,700
be real people

2073
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,470
as other people,

2074
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:53,120
but they're acting in a coordinated way.

2075
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,820
And some of that behavior

2076
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,290
has gotten very sophisticated

2077
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:58,469
and it's very adversarial.

2078
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:00,840
So they, you know, each iteration,

2079
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,430
every time we find something

2080
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:03,680
and stop them,

2081
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,290
they kind of evolve their behavior.

2082
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:05,450
They don't just pack up their bags

2083
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:07,310
and go home

2084
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,270
and say, okay, we're not gonna try.

2085
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:10,349
You know, at some point

2086
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:10,600
they might decide

2087
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,090
doing it on meta services is not worth it.

2088
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,260
They'll go do it on someone else

2089
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:14,599
if it's easier to do it in another place.

2090
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,430
But we have a fair amount

2091
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:19,740
of experience dealing with

2092
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,760
even those kind of adversarial attacks

2093
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,799
where they just keep

2094
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:25,870
And I do think that as long

2095
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:28,490
as we can keep

2096
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:28,750
on putting more compute power against it,

2097
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,140
and if we're kind of one of the leaders

2098
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,270
in developing some of these AI models,

2099
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,400
I'm quite optimistic

2100
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,189
that we're gonna be able

2101
01:06:36,189 --> 01:06:37,490
to keep on pushing

2102
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,430
against the kind of normal categories

2103
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:41,470
of harm that you talk about.

2104
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:45,320
Fraud, scams, spam, IP violations,

2105
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:49,029
things like that.

2106
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:49,790
What about like creating narratives

2107
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:50,839
and controversy?

2108
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:53,590
To me, it's kind of amazing

2109
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,090
how a small collection of,

2110
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,870
what did you say, inauthentic accounts?

2111
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:59,436
So it could be bots, but it's huge.

2112
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:00,450
Yeah, I mean, we have sort

2113
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,450
of this funny name for it,

2114
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,750
but we call it coordinated inauthentic behavior.

2115
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,290
Yeah, it's kind of incredible

2116
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:07,730
how a small collection of folks

2117
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:10,219
can create narratives,

2118
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:11,410
create stories,

2119
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:14,380
especially if they're viral.

2120
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,550
So especially if they have an element

2121
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:19,530
that can catalyze the virality

2122
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:21,139
of that narrative.

2123
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:22,370
Yeah, and I think there the question

2124
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:24,510
is you have to be,

2125
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:26,490
I'm very specific

2126
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:27,150
about what is bad about it, right?

2127
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:29,240
Because I think a set

2128
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,360
of people coming together

2129
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,140
or organically bouncing ideas

2130
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,070
off each other

2131
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:36,150
and a narrative comes out of that,

2132
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:39,679
is not necessarily a bad thing by itself

2133
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:42,540
if it's kind of authentic and organic.

2134
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:43,639
That's like a lot of what happens

2135
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:44,700
and how culture gets created

2136
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,190
and how art gets created

2137
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,549
and a lot of good stuff.

2138
01:07:47,549 --> 01:07:48,730
So that's why we've kind of focused on

2139
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,130
this sense of coordinated

2140
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:51,670
inauthentic behavior.

2141
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,530
So it's like, if you have a network of,

2142
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:55,480
whether it's bots,

2143
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,150
some people masquerading

2144
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,760
as different accounts,

2145
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,780
but you have kind of someone pulling

2146
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,940
the strings behind it

2147
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:06,680
and trying to kind of act as if

2148
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,620
this is a more organic set of behavior,

2149
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,940
but really it's not.

2150
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:10,950
It's just like one coordinated thing.

2151
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,590
That seems problematic to me, right?

2152
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,770
I mean, I don't think people

2153
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:16,198
should be able

2154
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:16,779
to have coordinated networks

2155
01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:19,160
and not disclose it as such.

2156
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:22,689
But that again,

2157
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:23,859
we've been able to deploy

2158
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:24,470
pretty sophisticated AI

2159
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:27,450
and counterterrorism groups

2160
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:29,380
and things like

2161
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:29,460
that to be able to identify

2162
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:32,240
a fair number of these coordinated

2163
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,050
and authentic networks of accounts

2164
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:37,599
and take them down.

2165
01:08:37,599 --> 01:08:39,559
We continue to do that.

2166
01:08:39,559 --> 01:08:40,649
And I think we've, it's one thing

2167
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,040
that if you told me 20 years ago,

2168
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,049
it's like, all right,

2169
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:44,100
you're starting this website

2170
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,760
to help people connect at a college.

2171
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,090
And in the future, you're gonna be,

2172
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:49,399
part of your organization is gonna be

2173
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,719
a counterterrorism organization with AI

2174
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:53,559
to find coordinated and authentic,

2175
01:08:53,559 --> 01:08:55,399
I would have thought

2176
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:56,029
that was pretty wild.

2177
01:08:56,029 --> 01:09:00,350
But no, I think that that's part

2178
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,290
of where we are.

2179
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:02,850
But look, I think that these questions

2180
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:03,970
that you're pushing on now,

2181
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:08,439
this is actually where I'd guess most

2182
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:10,349
of the challenge

2183
01:09:10,349 --> 01:09:10,800
around AI will be

2184
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,870
for the foreseeable future.

2185
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,059
I think that there's a lot

2186
01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:15,950
of debate around things like,

2187
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:18,399
is this going to create

2188
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:19,370
existential risk to humanity?

2189
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,460
And I think that those

2190
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,479
are very hard things

2191
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:22,950
to disprove one way or another.

2192
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,290
My own intuition is that the point

2193
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,540
at which we become close

2194
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:29,300
to super intelligent,

2195
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,500
super intelligences,

2196
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,270
it's just really unclear to me

2197
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,350
that the current technology

2198
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:35,700
is gonna get there

2199
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,290
without another set

2200
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:39,370
of significant advances.

2201
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:41,439
But that doesn't mean

2202
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:42,080
that there's no danger.

2203
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,180
I think the danger

2204
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,580
the kind of known set of harms

2205
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,500
that people or sets of accounts can do.

2206
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,599
And we just need to make sure

2207
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:52,059
that we really focus

2208
01:09:53,139 --> 01:09:55,179
on basically doing that

2209
01:09:55,179 --> 01:09:56,370
as well as possible.

2210
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:57,690
So that's definitely a big focus for me.

2211
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:58,920
Well, you can basically

2212
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,290
use large language models

2213
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:03,139
as an assistant of how to cause harm

2214
01:10:03,139 --> 01:10:05,460
on social networks.

2215
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:11,000
Meta has very impressive,

2216
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
coordinated, inauthentic account,

2217
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:16,130
fighting capabilities.

2218
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,820
How do I do the coordinated

2219
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:21,300
and authentic account

2220
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,480
creation where Meta doesn't detect it?

2221
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,650
Like literally ask that question.

2222
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:26,889
And basically there's

2223
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,159
this kinda part of it.

2224
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:31,000
I mean, that's what OpenAI showed

2225
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,160
that they're concerned

2226
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,140
of those questions.

2227
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:35,490
Perhaps you can comment

2228
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:36,440
on your approach to it,

2229
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,220
how to do a kind of moderation

2230
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:39,910
on the output of those models

2231
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,120
that it can't be used

2232
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,840
to help you coordinate harm

2233
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,360
in all the full definition

2234
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,940
of what the harm means.

2235
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,880
Yeah, and that's a lot

2236
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,100
of the fine-tuning

2237
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,330
and the alignment training that we do.

2238
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,860
Is basically,

2239
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:57,219
when we ship AI's across our products,

2240
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,550
a lot of what we're trying to make sure

2241
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:04,340
is that if you can't ask it

2242
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,320
to help you commit a crime.

2243
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,840
So I think training it

2244
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:14,690
to kind of understand that.

2245
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:17,200
And it's not like any of these systems

2246
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,840
are ever gonna be 100% perfect,

2247
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,699
but just making it

2248
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:26,030
so that this isn't an easier way

2249
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:30,090
to go about doing something bad

2250
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:32,030
than the next best alternative, right?

2251
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:33,090
I mean, people still have Google,

2252
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:35,030
where they still have search engines.

2253
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,820
So the information is out there.

2254
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:42,349
And for these,

2255
01:11:42,349 --> 01:11:44,220
what we see is like for nation states

2256
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,220
or these actors that are trying

2257
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,260
to pull off

2258
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:49,180
these large coordinated

2259
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,679
and authentic networks

2260
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,300
to kind of influence different things.

2261
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,320
At some point,

2262
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,559
they do just try to use

2263
01:11:56,559 --> 01:11:58,549
other services instead, right?

2264
01:11:58,549 --> 01:12:00,599
It's just like,

2265
01:12:00,599 --> 01:12:00,890
if you can make it more expensive

2266
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:03,430
for them to do it on your service,

2267
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:05,910
then kind of people go elsewhere.

2268
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:08,750
And I think that that's the bar, right?

2269
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,030
It's not like, okay,

2270
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,270
are you ever gonna be perfect

2271
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,400
at finding every adversary

2272
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,480
who tries to attack you?

2273
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,059
I mean, you try to get as close

2274
01:12:16,059 --> 01:12:18,439
to that as possible,

2275
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:20,060
but I think really kind of economically

2276
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,290
what you're just trying to do

2277
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:22,893
is make it so

2278
01:12:22,893 --> 01:12:23,060
that it's just inefficient for them

2279
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,930
to go after that.

2280
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:26,470
But there's also complicated questions

2281
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:28,300
of what is and isn't harm,

2282
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,620
what is and isn't misinformation.

2283
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,700
So this is one

2284
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,740
of the things that Wikipedia

2285
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,240
has also tried to face.

2286
01:12:35,109 --> 01:12:37,650
I remember asking GPT

2287
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:39,890
about whether the virus leaked

2288
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:42,380
from a lab or not,

2289
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:42,840
and the answer provided

2290
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,259
was a very nuanced one

2291
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:47,440
and a well-sighted one,

2292
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,759
almost dare I say,

2293
01:12:48,759 --> 01:12:51,870
well thought out one balanced.

2294
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,980
I would hate for that nuance to be lost

2295
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:57,330
through the process of moderation.

2296
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,760
Wikipedia does a good job

2297
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,580
on that particular thing too,

2298
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,160
but from pressures from governments

2299
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,630
and institutions,

2300
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,630
it's you could see some

2301
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:06,790
of that nuance

2302
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:10,990
and depth of information, facts,

2303
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:13,750
and wisdom be lost.

2304
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,880
Absolutely.

2305
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:16,600
And that's a scary thing.

2306
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,620
Some of the magic, some of the edges,

2307
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,009
the rough edges might be lost

2308
01:13:21,009 --> 01:13:22,559
to the process of moderation

2309
01:13:22,559 --> 01:13:23,870
of AI systems.

2310
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:27,089
So how do you get that right?

2311
01:13:27,089 --> 01:13:28,919
I really agree

2312
01:13:28,919 --> 01:13:30,190
with what you're pushing on.

2313
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:34,040
I mean, the core shape of the problem

2314
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,400
is that there are some harms

2315
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,590
that I think everyone agrees

2316
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:38,820
are bad, right?

2317
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:43,480
So sexual exploitation of children, right?

2318
01:13:44,389 --> 01:13:46,000
Like you're not gonna get many people

2319
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,800
who think that that type of thing

2320
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,589
should be allowed on any service, right?

2321
01:13:49,589 --> 01:13:51,480
And that's something that we face

2322
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,650
and try to push off

2323
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:56,970
the as much as possible today, terrorism,

2324
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,040
and citing violence, right?

2325
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,219
Like we went through a bunch

2326
01:14:02,219 --> 01:14:02,639
of these types of harms before.

2327
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:06,240
But then I do think that you get

2328
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,860
to a set of harms

2329
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,400
where there is more social debate

2330
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,570
around it.

2331
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:13,629
So misinformation, I think is,

2332
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,259
has been a really tricky one

2333
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:20,929
because there are things that are kind

2334
01:14:20,929 --> 01:14:22,469
of obviously false,

2335
01:14:23,379 --> 01:14:24,879
right, that are maybe factual.

2336
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:28,870
But may not be harmful.

2337
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,608
Since like, all right,

2338
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:33,050
are you gonna censor someone

2339
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,270
for just being wrong?

2340
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,320
It's, you know,

2341
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:36,550
if there's no kind of harm implication

2342
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,629
of what they're doing,

2343
01:14:38,629 --> 01:14:39,529
I think that that's,

2344
01:14:39,529 --> 01:14:39,530
there's a bunch of real kind of issues

2345
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:41,660
and challenges there.

2346
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,589
But then I think

2347
01:14:42,589 --> 01:14:44,670
that there are other places

2348
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:46,139
where it is, it just takes some

2349
01:14:46,139 --> 01:14:48,229
of the stuff

2350
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,550
around COVID earlier on in the pandemic

2351
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:51,300
where there were

2352
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,580
real health implications

2353
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,480
but there hadn't been time to fully vet

2354
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,020
a bunch of the scientific assumptions.

2355
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,580
And, you know, unfortunately,

2356
01:14:58,580 --> 01:14:59,889
I think a lot of the kind

2357
01:14:59,889 --> 01:15:01,120
of establishment on that,

2358
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,600
you know, kind of waffled

2359
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,490
on a bunch of facts

2360
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:05,630
and, you know, asked for a bunch

2361
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,700
of things to be censored

2362
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,599
that in retrospect ended up being,

2363
01:15:08,599 --> 01:15:11,700
you know,more debatable or true.

2364
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,549
And that stuff is really tough, right?

2365
01:15:13,549 --> 01:15:15,720
And really undermines trust in that.

2366
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:19,639
And so I do think that the questions

2367
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,030
around how to manage

2368
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,140
that are very nuanced.

2369
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,990
The way that I try to think about it

2370
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:29,000
is that it goes,

2371
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,200
I think it's best

2372
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:31,880
to generally boil things down

2373
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,639
to the harms that people agree on.

2374
01:15:34,639 --> 01:15:35,980
So when you think about, you know,

2375
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,370
is something misinformation or not,

2376
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:41,360
I think often the more salient bit is,

2377
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,240
is this going to potentially lead

2378
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:48,070
to physical harm

2379
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:49,440
for someone and kind of think

2380
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,665
about it in that sense.

2381
01:15:51,665 --> 01:15:53,720
I think people just have

2382
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,589
different preferences

2383
01:15:54,589 --> 01:15:56,849
to be flagged for them.

2384
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:57,790
I think a bunch of people would like prefer

2385
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:00,390
to kind of have a flag on something that says,

2386
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,429
hey, a fact checker thinks that this might be false,

2387
01:16:02,429 --> 01:16:04,809
or I think Twitter's community notes

2388
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:07,219
implementation is quite good on this.

2389
01:16:08,599 --> 01:16:09,710
But again, it's the same type of thing.

2390
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:12,830
It's like just kind of discretionarily adding a flag

2391
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:14,820
because it makes

2392
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,010
but it's not, it's not, you know,

2393
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:18,420
trying to take down

2394
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:18,980
the information or not.

2395
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:19,559
I think that you want

2396
01:16:19,559 --> 01:16:21,429
to reserve the kind of censorship

2397
01:16:21,429 --> 01:16:23,210
of content to things that are

2398
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,900
of known categories

2399
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,750
that people generally agree or bad.

2400
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:30,530
Yeah, but there's so many things,

2401
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:31,660
especially with the pandemic,

2402
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,430
but there's other topics

2403
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:37,340
where there's just deep disagreement

2404
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,700
fueled by politics

2405
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,349
about what is and isn't harmful.

2406
01:16:41,349 --> 01:16:43,710
There's a, even just the degree

2407
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:45,860
to which the virus is harmful

2408
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:48,760
and the degree to which the vaccines,

2409
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,220
the response to the virus are harmful.

2410
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,300
There's almost

2411
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,050
like a political divider on that.

2412
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:56,960
And so how do you make decisions

2413
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,670
about that where half the country

2414
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:01,179
in the United States

2415
01:17:01,179 --> 01:17:03,750
or some large fraction of the world

2416
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,330
has very different views

2417
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,920
from another part of the world?

2418
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,110
Is there a way for Metta to stay out

2419
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:13,540
of the moderation of this?

2420
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:16,400
I think we, it's very difficult

2421
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,389
to just abstain,

2422
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:21,070
but I think we should be clear about

2423
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:23,519
which of these things

2424
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:25,320
are actual safety concerns

2425
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,320
and which ones are a matter

2426
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,340
of preference in terms

2427
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,140
of how people want information flagged.

2428
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,820
Right, so we did recently introduce something

2429
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:36,660
that allows people to have fact-checking

2430
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,369
not affect the distribution

2431
01:17:39,509 --> 01:17:41,940
of what shows them their product.

2432
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:41,950
So, okay, a bunch of people don't trust

2433
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:42,990
who the fact-checkers are.

2434
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:44,430
All right, well,

2435
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:45,970
you can turn that off if you want,

2436
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:49,830
but if the content violates some policy,

2437
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,010
like it's inciting violence

2438
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:53,079
or something like that,

2439
01:17:53,079 --> 01:17:53,090
it's still not gonna be allowed.

2440
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,639
So, I think that you wanna

2441
01:17:54,639 --> 01:17:56,520
honor people's preferences

2442
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,280
on that as much as possible.

2443
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,899
But look, I mean,

2444
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:02,000
this is really difficult stuff.

2445
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,210
I think it's really hard to know

2446
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,710
where to draw the line

2447
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:10,780
on what is fact and what is opinion,

2448
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,179
because the nature of science

2449
01:18:12,179 --> 01:18:13,770
is that nothing

2450
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:15,780
is ever 100% known for certain.

2451
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,639
You can disprove certain things,

2452
01:18:17,639 --> 01:18:19,980
but you're constantly testing new hypotheses

2453
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,870
and scrutinizing frameworks

2454
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:24,930
that have been long-held

2455
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:26,620
and every once in a while

2456
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:28,040
you throw out something

2457
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,900
that was working

2458
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:29,980
for a very long period of time

2459
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:31,700
and it's very difficult.

2460
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,750
But I think that just

2461
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,789
because it's very hard

2462
01:18:34,789 --> 01:18:35,930
and just because they're edge cases

2463
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:39,470
doesn't mean that you should not try

2464
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:41,580
to give people

2465
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,340
Let me ask about something you've faced

2466
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,179
in terms of moderation is pressure

2467
01:18:50,179 --> 01:18:52,520
from different sources,

2468
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,090
pressure from governments.

2469
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:55,299
I wanna ask a question,

2470
01:18:55,299 --> 01:18:58,350
how to withstand that pressure

2471
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:01,790
for a world where AI moderation starts

2472
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:02,949
becoming a thing too.

2473
01:19:03,809 --> 01:19:07,110
So what's Metta's approach

2474
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,710
to resist the pressure

2475
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:13,200
from governments

2476
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,460
in terms of what to moderate and not?

2477
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,830
I don't know that there's like

2478
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:19,140
a one-size-fits-all answer

2479
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:21,730
to that and I think we basically

2480
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:22,889
have the principles

2481
01:19:22,889 --> 01:19:26,520
around we wanna allow people to express

2482
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,639
as much as possible,

2483
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:31,890
but we have developed clear categories

2484
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,780
of things

2485
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,370
that we think are wrong,

2486
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,940
that we don't want on our services

2487
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,809
and we build tools to try to moderate those.

2488
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:41,920
So then the question is, okay,

2489
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,719
what do you do

2490
01:19:43,719 --> 01:19:44,579
when a government says

2491
01:19:45,839 --> 01:19:47,380
that they don't want something

2492
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,680
on the service

2493
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:54,090
and we have a bunch of principles

2494
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:56,550
around how we deal with that

2495
01:19:56,550 --> 01:20:00,370
if there's a democratically elected government

2496
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:01,900
and people around the world

2497
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,210
just have different values

2498
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:04,809
in different places,

2499
01:20:04,809 --> 01:20:08,670
then should we as a California-based

2500
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:11,970
company tell them

2501
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:14,980
that something that they have decided

2502
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:18,809
is unacceptable, actually that we need

2503
01:20:18,809 --> 01:20:21,030
to be able to express that?

2504
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:22,820
I mean, I think

2505
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:23,299
that there's a certain amount

2506
01:20:23,299 --> 01:20:26,350
of hubris in that,

2507
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,880
but then I think there are other cases

2508
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,120
where it's like a little more autocratic

2509
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,620
and you have the dictator leader

2510
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,460
who's just trying

2511
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:37,530
to crack down on dissent

2512
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:39,740
and the people in a country

2513
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:41,969
are really not aligned

2514
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:43,630
with that and it's not necessarily

2515
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,730
against their culture,

2516
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:47,430
but the person who's leading it

2517
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:49,460
is just trying to push in

2518
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:50,690
a certain direction.

2519
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:52,969
These are very complex questions,

2520
01:20:52,969 --> 01:20:55,120
but I think,

2521
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,190
so it's difficult

2522
01:20:57,190 --> 01:21:00,880
to have a one-size-fits-all approach

2523
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,460
to it.

2524
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,830
But in general,

2525
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:04,660
we're pretty active

2526
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:05,180
in kind of advocating

2527
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:09,380
and pushing back on requests

2528
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,510
to take things down.

2529
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:15,370
But honestly,

2530
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:15,920
the thing that I think a request

2531
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,969
to censor things is one thing

2532
01:21:17,969 --> 01:21:20,090
and that's obviously bad,

2533
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:22,640
but where we draw a much harder line

2534
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,580
is on requests

2535
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:26,010
for access to information, right?

2536
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:28,889
Because if you get told that

2537
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:29,889
you can't say something,

2538
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:33,270
that's bad, right?

2539
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,940
I mean, that obviously

2540
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:38,910
violates your sense

2541
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,580
and freedom of expression at some level,

2542
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:44,040
but a government getting access to data

2543
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,030
in a way

2544
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:48,500
that seems like it would be unlawful

2545
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,899
in our country

2546
01:21:50,899 --> 01:21:53,339
exposes people to real physical harm.

2547
01:21:54,679 --> 01:21:57,450
And that's something that in general

2548
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:59,400
we take very seriously.

2549
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,370
So that flows through all

2550
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,839
of our policies

2551
01:22:04,839 --> 01:22:05,010
in a lot of ways, right?

2552
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:07,080
By the time you're

2553
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:07,509
actually like litigating

2554
01:22:07,509 --> 01:22:09,960
with a government

2555
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,889
that's pretty late in the funnel.

2556
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:14,930
I'd say a bunch of this stuff starts

2557
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,220
a lot higher up

2558
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:17,910
in the decision

2559
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:18,450
of where do we put data centers.

2560
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:21,309
Then there are a lot of countries

2561
01:22:21,309 --> 01:22:22,320
where we may have

2562
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,540
a lot of people using the service

2563
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,679
in a place.

2564
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,229
It might be good for the service

2565
01:22:27,229 --> 01:22:29,429
in some ways,

2566
01:22:29,429 --> 01:22:31,169
good for those people

2567
01:22:31,169 --> 01:22:31,420
if we could reduce the latency

2568
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:34,440
by having a data center nearby them.

2569
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,080
But for whatever reason,

2570
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,219
we just feel like,

2571
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,750
does not have a good track record

2572
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:45,460
basically not trying to get access

2573
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,889
to people's data.

2574
01:22:47,889 --> 01:22:48,749
And at the end of the day,

2575
01:22:48,749 --> 01:22:49,010
I mean, if you put a data center

2576
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:50,900
in a country

2577
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,630
to get access to people's data,

2578
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:54,260
then they do at the end

2579
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,490
of the day have the option

2580
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:57,270
of having people show up with guns

2581
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:59,090
and taking it by force.

2582
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:00,650
So I think that there's like

2583
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:02,930
a lot of decisions

2584
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:03,190
that go into like

2585
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:03,510
how you architect the systems

2586
01:23:05,299 --> 01:23:06,600
years in advance

2587
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,840
of these actual confrontations

2588
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,770
that end up being really important.

2589
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,030
So you put the protection

2590
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,300
of people's data

2591
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,889
as a very, very high priority.

2592
01:23:17,889 --> 01:23:19,809
But-

2593
01:23:19,809 --> 01:23:20,060
Not I think there are more harms

2594
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,109
that I think can be associated with that.

2595
01:23:22,109 --> 01:23:23,170
And I think that that ends up

2596
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,810
being a more critical thing

2597
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:28,880
to defend against governments than,

2598
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,250
whereas if another government

2599
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,270
has a different view

2600
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:32,580
of what should be acceptable speech

2601
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:34,620
in their country,

2602
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:36,000
especially if it's

2603
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,400
a democratically elected government,

2604
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,740
and then I think that there's

2605
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:39,860
a certain amount of deference

2606
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:42,020
that you should have to that.

2607
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,280
So that's speaking more

2608
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,050
to the direct harm that's possible

2609
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:46,280
when you give governments

2610
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,270
access to data.

2611
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,089
But if we look at the United States,

2612
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,690
to the more nuanced kind of pressure

2613
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,840
to sensor, not even ordered to sensor,

2614
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,110
but pressure to sensor

2615
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,910
from political entities,

2616
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,959
which has kind of received quite a bit

2617
01:23:59,959 --> 01:24:02,070
of attention in the United States.

2618
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,700
Maybe one way to ask that question is,

2619
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,420
if you've seen the Twitter files,

2620
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:10,580
what have you learned

2621
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:14,330
from the kind of pressure

2622
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:16,309
from US government agencies

2623
01:24:16,309 --> 01:24:18,590
that was seen in Twitter files?

2624
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:19,700
And what do you do

2625
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,320
with that kind of pressure?

2626
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,090
You know, and I've seen it.

2627
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:27,880
It's really hard from the outside

2628
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,420
to know exactly what happened in each

2629
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:31,820
of these cases.

2630
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:32,320
You know, we've obviously been

2631
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,290
in a bunch of our own cases

2632
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:40,710
where agencies or different folks

2633
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:43,789
will just say,

2634
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:44,950
hey, here's a threat

2635
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:46,710
that we're aware of.

2636
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:48,660
You should be aware of this too.

2637
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:49,969
It's not really pressure,

2638
01:24:49,969 --> 01:24:53,140
as much as it is just, you know,

2639
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:55,849
flagging something

2640
01:24:55,849 --> 01:24:56,160
that our security systems

2641
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,570
should be on alert about.

2642
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:00,100
I get how some people could think

2643
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,730
of it as that.

2644
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:04,469
But at the end of the day,

2645
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:07,790
it's our call on how to handle that.

2646
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:09,080
But I mean, I just, you know,

2647
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,320
in terms of running these services,

2648
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,949
won't have access to as much information

2649
01:25:11,949 --> 01:25:13,420
about what people think that adversaries

2650
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:15,380
might be trying to do as possible.

2651
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,780
Boy, so you don't feel like

2652
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:18,900
there would be consequences

2653
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:22,220
if, you know, anybody, the CIA,

2654
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,300
the FBI, a political party,

2655
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,530
the Democrats, the Republicans,

2656
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:29,990
of high, powerful political figures,

2657
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:32,780
right, emails, you don't feel pressure

2658
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,660
from suggestions.

2659
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,600
I guess what I should say

2660
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,920
from all sides that I'm not sure

2661
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,660
that any specific thing

2662
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,920
that someone says is really adding

2663
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,540
that much more to the mix.

2664
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:46,359
It's, I mean,

2665
01:25:46,359 --> 01:25:47,510
there are obviously a lot of people

2666
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:50,800
who think that we should

2667
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,500
be censoring more content,

2668
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,830
where there are a lot of people

2669
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:55,220
who think we should

2670
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:55,450
be censoring less content.

2671
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:56,950
There are, as you say,

2672
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,110
all kinds of different groups

2673
01:25:58,110 --> 01:25:59,830
that are involved in these debates, right?

2674
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:02,330
So there's the kind of elected officials

2675
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:03,889
and politicians themselves,

2676
01:26:03,889 --> 01:26:04,940
there's the agencies,

2677
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:07,890
but I mean, but there's the media,

2678
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:09,040
there's activist groups,

2679
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,040
there's, this is not a U.S.

2680
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,360
specific thing,

2681
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,559
and kind of all in every country

2682
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:17,850
that bring different values.

2683
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:22,000
So it's just a very active debate

2684
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,959
and I understand it, right?

2685
01:26:23,959 --> 01:26:25,760
I mean, these are, you know,

2686
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,900
these kind of questions

2687
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,970
get to really some

2688
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:31,470
of the most important social debates

2689
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:33,040
that are being had.

2690
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,080
So it gets back to the question of truth

2691
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,230
because for a lot of these things,

2692
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,469
they haven't yet been hardened

2693
01:26:40,469 --> 01:26:41,670
into a single truth

2694
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:44,340
and society's sort of trying to hash out

2695
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:48,460
what we think, right, on certain issues.

2696
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:49,960
Maybe in a few hundred years,

2697
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,219
everyone will look back

2698
01:26:52,219 --> 01:26:54,570
that it should have been this,

2699
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:55,870
but, you know, no,

2700
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:56,240
we're kind of in that meat grinder now

2701
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:59,649
and working through that.

2702
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,450
So no, these are all very complicated

2703
01:27:06,450 --> 01:27:11,230
and some people raise concerns

2704
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:13,520
in good faith

2705
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,984
and just say, hey, this is something

2706
01:27:14,984 --> 01:27:15,570
that I wanna flag for you

2707
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:16,199
to think about.

2708
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:18,110
Certain people, I certainly think, like,

2709
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:19,690
come at things with somewhat

2710
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:21,969
of a more kind of punitive

2711
01:27:21,969 --> 01:27:25,540
or vengeful view of like,

2712
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:26,620
I want you to do this thing.

2713
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:27,639
If you don't, then I'm gonna try

2714
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:28,700
to make your life difficult

2715
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,610
and in a lot of other ways,

2716
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:33,309
but like, I don't know,

2717
01:27:33,309 --> 01:27:34,559
there's just, this is like,

2718
01:27:34,559 --> 01:27:36,780
this is one

2719
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:39,080
I think, in society.

2720
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:39,280
So I just think that there are

2721
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,760
so many people

2722
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,710
to apply pressure

2723
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:45,990
I don't think you can make decisions

2724
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:47,380
based on trying to make people happy.

2725
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,410
I think you just have to do

2726
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:52,069
what you think

2727
01:27:52,069 --> 01:27:53,760
and accept that people

2728
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,840
are gonna be upset no matter

2729
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,380
where you come out on that.

2730
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:00,180
Yeah, I like that pressurized debate.

2731
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:02,590
So how's your view

2732
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:03,550
evolved over the years?

2733
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,439
And now with AI,

2734
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:13,210
where the freedom might apply to them,

2735
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:14,950
not just to the humans,

2736
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:17,670
but to the personalized agents

2737
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:18,900
as you've spoken about them.

2738
01:28:20,179 --> 01:28:22,200
So yeah, I mean,

2739
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,307
I've probably gotten

2740
01:28:23,307 --> 01:28:24,849
just because I think that there are,

2741
01:28:24,849 --> 01:28:25,860
you know, I come at this,

2742
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:28,290
I'm obviously very pro freedom

2743
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:29,330
of expression, right?

2744
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,550
I don't think you build

2745
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:31,550
a service like this

2746
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:33,390
that gives people tools

2747
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:34,600
to express themselves

2748
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,530
unless you think

2749
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:36,670
at scale is a good thing, right?

2750
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:39,389
So I didn't get into this to like try

2751
01:28:39,389 --> 01:28:41,750
to prevent people

2752
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:42,440
from expressing anything.

2753
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,559
I like want to give people tools

2754
01:28:44,559 --> 01:28:46,600
so they can express as much as possible.

2755
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,190
And then I think it's become clear

2756
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,000
that there are certain categories

2757
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,430
of things that we've talked

2758
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:56,060
almost everyone accepts

2759
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,059
that are illegal even in countries

2760
01:28:58,059 --> 01:29:00,170
like the US

2761
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:00,723
where, you know,

2762
01:29:00,723 --> 01:29:01,670
you have the First Amendment

2763
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,099
that's very protective

2764
01:29:04,099 --> 01:29:04,370
of enabling speech.

2765
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:06,029
It's like, you're still not allowed to,

2766
01:29:06,029 --> 01:29:08,150
you know, do things that are going

2767
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:08,500
to immediately inside violence

2768
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,460
or, you know,

2769
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:10,620
violate people's intellectual property

2770
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:13,130
or things like that.

2771
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:14,920
but then there's also a very active core

2772
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:18,760
of just active disagreements in society

2773
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,059
where some people may think

2774
01:29:20,059 --> 01:29:21,750
that something is true or false.

2775
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:24,209
The other side might think

2776
01:29:24,209 --> 01:29:24,820
it's the opposite

2777
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:26,660
or just unsettled, right?

2778
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,930
And those are some

2779
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:31,410
of the most difficult to kind of handle

2780
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:33,220
like we've talked about.

2781
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:37,820
But one of the lessons that I feel like

2782
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:41,509
I've learned is that a lot of times

2783
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,349
when you can,

2784
01:29:45,349 --> 01:29:47,540
the best way to handle this stuff

2785
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,660
more practically

2786
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,070
is not in terms of answering

2787
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:52,649
the question

2788
01:29:52,649 --> 01:29:53,090
of should this be allowed,

2789
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:55,550
but just like,

2790
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:58,720
what is the best way to deal

2791
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,750
with someone being a jerk?

2792
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:03,480
Is the person basically just

2793
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,880
having a repeat behavior

2794
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,060
of like causing a lot of issues?

2795
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:14,750
So looking at it more at that level.

2796
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:17,009
And it's effect

2797
01:30:17,009 --> 01:30:19,119
health of the community,

2798
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:19,340
health of the community.

2799
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:20,750
It's tricky though, because like,

2800
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:23,170
how do you know

2801
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:23,690
there could be people

2802
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:24,910
that have a very controversial

2803
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:26,110
viewpoint that turns out

2804
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:28,610
to have a positive long-term effect

2805
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:30,090
on the health of the community

2806
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,219
because it challenges

2807
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:32,998
the community to think.

2808
01:30:32,998 --> 01:30:33,370
No, that's true, absolutely.

2809
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:36,309
Yeah, no, I think you wanna be careful about that.

2810
01:30:36,309 --> 01:30:37,510
I'm not sure I'm expressing

2811
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:38,679
this very clearly

2812
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:43,050
because I certainly agree

2813
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:44,040
with your point there.

2814
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,000
And my point isn't

2815
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
that we should not have people

2816
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,509
on our services that are being controversial.

2817
01:30:49,509 --> 01:30:51,630
That's certainly not what I mean to say.

2818
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:53,480
It's that often I think

2819
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:56,610
it's not just looking

2820
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:59,610
at a specific example of speech

2821
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:00,870
that it's most effective

2822
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:02,530
to handle this stuff.

2823
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:04,560
And I think often

2824
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,720
you don't wanna make specific

2825
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,660
binary decisions of kind

2826
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:09,280
of this is allowed or this isn't.

2827
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,059
I mean, we talked about, you know,

2828
01:31:11,059 --> 01:31:13,440
it's fact-checking

2829
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:13,960
or Twitter's community voices thing.

2830
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,445
I think that

2831
01:31:15,445 --> 01:31:15,520
that's another good example.

2832
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,570
It's like it's not a question

2833
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:18,560
of is this allowed or not.

2834
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,890
It's just a question

2835
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:22,740
I think that that's helpful.

2836
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:23,959
So in the context of AI,

2837
01:31:23,959 --> 01:31:26,250
which is what you're asking about,

2838
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,320
I mean, there are lots of ways

2839
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,580
that an AI can be helpful.

2840
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,950
With an AI, it's less about censorship, right?

2841
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:36,150
Because and it's more about

2842
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:37,800
what is the most productive answer

2843
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,099
to a question.

2844
01:31:40,099 --> 01:31:41,580
You know, there was one case study

2845
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,810
that I was reviewing

2846
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:45,120
with the team is someone asked,

2847
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,030
can you explain to me how

2848
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:53,060
to 3D print a gun?

2849
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:56,679
And one proposed response is like,

2850
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,590
no, I can't talk about that.

2851
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,840
But it's like basically just like

2852
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,099
shut it down immediately.

2853
01:32:03,099 --> 01:32:03,809
Which I think is some of what you see.

2854
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:05,510
It's like as a large language model,

2855
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:06,790
I'm not allowed to talk about,

2856
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:09,290
you know, whatever.

2857
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:11,430
But there's another response

2858
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:11,820
which is like,

2859
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:11,860
hey, you know,

2860
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,200
I don't think that's a good idea.

2861
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,179
In a lot of countries, including the US,

2862
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,030
or kind of whatever

2863
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,969
And I was like, okay, you know,

2864
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:24,330
that's actually

2865
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:24,880
a respectful and informative answer.

2866
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,420
And I may have not known

2867
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:27,790
that specific thing.

2868
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:30,450
And so there are different ways

2869
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:32,060
to handle this

2870
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:32,420
that I think kind

2871
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:36,459
of you can either assume good intent.

2872
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,679
Like maybe the person didn't know

2873
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:40,260
and I'm just gonna help educate them.

2874
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,260
Or you could kind of come at it as like,

2875
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:44,240
no, I need to shut this

2876
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:44,260
thing down immediately, right?

2877
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,940
It's like,

2878
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:49,890
And there may be times where you need

2879
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:51,990
to do that.

2880
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:53,259
But I actually think having

2881
01:32:53,259 --> 01:32:55,969
a somewhat more informative

2882
01:32:55,969 --> 01:32:57,520
approach where you generally

2883
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,660
assume good intent

2884
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:00,990
from people is probably a better

2885
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:02,400
balance to be

2886
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,660
on as many things as you can be.

2887
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:07,040
You're not gonna be able to do

2888
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:07,650
that for everything.

2889
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:08,340
But you're kind of asking

2890
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:09,630
about how I approach this

2891
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:12,009
and I'm thinking about this

2892
01:33:12,009 --> 01:33:13,949
and as it relates to AI.

2893
01:33:13,949 --> 01:33:16,059
And I think that that's a big difference

2894
01:33:16,059 --> 01:33:17,420
in kind of how

2895
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:20,620
to handle sensitive content

2896
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:21,850
across these different modes.

2897
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,950
I have to ask,

2898
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:26,440
there's rumors you might be working

2899
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:29,020
on a social network that's text-based.

2900
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,480
That might be a competitor

2901
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,810
to Twitter, codenamed P92.

2902
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:35,059
Is there something you can say

2903
01:33:36,379 --> 01:33:37,460
about those rumors?

2904
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,120
There is a project.

2905
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,610
You know, I've always thought that sort

2906
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:43,860
of a text-based

2907
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,670
kind of information utility

2908
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,420
is just a really important

2909
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,809
thing to society.

2910
01:33:50,809 --> 01:33:52,880
And for whatever reason,

2911
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,219
I feel like Twitter

2912
01:33:54,219 --> 01:33:55,520
has not lived up

2913
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:56,640
to what I would have thought

2914
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,190
its full potential should be.

2915
01:33:58,190 --> 01:33:59,807
And I think that the current, you know,

2916
01:33:59,807 --> 01:34:01,030
I think Elon thinks that, right?

2917
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:03,010
And that's probably one

2918
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:04,290
of the reasons why he bought it.

2919
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,979
And I do know there are ways to consider

2920
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:11,470
alternative approaches to this.

2921
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:12,860
And one that I think

2922
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:14,400
is potentially interesting

2923
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:17,420
is this open and federated approach

2924
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,870
where you're seeing with Mastodon.

2925
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:19,890
I mean, you're seeing that a little bit

2926
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:22,259
with Blue Sky.

2927
01:34:22,259 --> 01:34:25,469
And I think that it's possible

2928
01:34:25,469 --> 01:34:26,799
that something that melds some

2929
01:34:26,799 --> 01:34:28,369
of those ideas

2930
01:34:28,369 --> 01:34:31,380
with the graph and identity system

2931
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:32,660
that people have already cultivated

2932
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:35,470
on Instagram could be a kind

2933
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:38,110
of very welcome contribution

2934
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:40,219
to that space.

2935
01:34:40,219 --> 01:34:41,270
of things all the time though too.

2936
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:43,549
So I don't want to get ahead of myself.

2937
01:34:43,549 --> 01:34:46,030
And we have projects that explore a lot

2938
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:48,260
of different things.

2939
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:48,510
And this is certainly one

2940
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:49,960
that I think could be interesting.

2941
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:52,530
But so what's the release,

2942
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:54,700
the launch date of that again?

2943
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:57,090
Or what's the official website?

2944
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:59,440
And we don't have that yet.

2945
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,099
Oh, okay.

2946
01:35:01,099 --> 01:35:03,049
But I, and look, I mean,

2947
01:35:03,049 --> 01:35:05,299
I don't know exactly how this is gonna turn out.

2948
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:06,580
I mean, what I can say is, yeah,

2949
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:08,990
there's some people working on this, right?

2950
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:10,050
I think that there's something there

2951
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:13,730
that's interesting to explore.

2952
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:15,540
So if you look at, it'd be interesting

2953
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:17,090
to just ask this question

2954
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:19,290
and throw Twitter into the mix,

2955
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:22,139
that the landscape of social networks,

2956
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:25,530
that is Facebook, that is Instagram,

2957
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:26,559
that is WhatsApp,

2958
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:29,150
and then think

2959
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:31,210
of a text-based social network,

2960
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:32,639
when you look at that landscape,

2961
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:34,980
what are the interesting

2962
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:35,120
differences to you?

2963
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:37,090
Why do we have these different flavors?

2964
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,820
And what are the needs?

2965
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:42,210
What are the use cases?

2966
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:42,779
What are the products?

2967
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:43,369
What is the aspect of them

2968
01:35:43,369 --> 01:35:45,810
that create a fulfilling human experience

2969
01:35:45,810 --> 01:35:47,660
and a connection between humans

2970
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,310
that is somehow distinct?

2971
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:51,969
Well, I think text is very accessible

2972
01:35:51,969 --> 01:35:54,460
for people to transmit ideas

2973
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:56,620
and to have back and forth exchanges.

2974
01:35:56,620 --> 01:36:00,160
So it, I think ends up

2975
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:04,680
being a good format for discussion,

2976
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,080
in a lot of ways, uniquely good, right?

2977
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,110
If you look at some of the other formats

2978
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,280
or other networks that have focused

2979
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,690
on one type of content

2980
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:13,400
like TikTok is obviously huge, right?

2981
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,559
And there are comments on TikTok,

2982
01:36:15,559 --> 01:36:18,109
but I think the architecture

2983
01:36:18,109 --> 01:36:19,550
of the service

2984
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:21,400
is very clearly that you have the video

2985
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,420
is the primary thing

2986
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,960
and there's comments after that.

2987
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:32,099
But I think one of the unique pieces

2988
01:36:32,099 --> 01:36:35,139
of having text-based comments,

2989
01:36:35,139 --> 01:36:37,140
like content is that the comments

2990
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:39,280
can also be first class

2991
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,540
and that makes it

2992
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:43,100
so that conversations can just filter

2993
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,480
and fork into

2994
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,710
and in a way that can be super useful.

2995
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:48,889
So I think there's a lot of things

2996
01:36:48,889 --> 01:36:51,070
that are really awesome

2997
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:52,060
about the experience.

2998
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:52,750
It just always struck me,

2999
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:54,999
I always thought

3000
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:55,000
that Twitter should have

3001
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,350
a billion people using it

3002
01:36:56,350 --> 01:37:00,520
or whatever the thing is that basically

3003
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,620
ends up being in that space.

3004
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,929
And for whatever combination of reasons,

3005
01:37:03,929 --> 01:37:07,630
again, these companies are complex organisms

3006
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:10,030
and it's very hard

3007
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:10,869
to diagnose this stuff from the outside.

3008
01:37:10,869 --> 01:37:11,870
Why doesn't Twitter,

3009
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:15,890
why doesn't a text-based comment

3010
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:18,890
as a first citizen-based social network

3011
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:20,540
have a billion users?

3012
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:23,050
Well, I just think it's hard to build these companies.

3013
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:27,759
So it's not that every idea automatically goes

3014
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:28,889
and gets a billion people,

3015
01:37:28,889 --> 01:37:30,920
it's just that I think that that idea

3016
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,600
coupled with a good execution

3017
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,560
should get there.

3018
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,450
But I mean, look,

3019
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:37,860
we hit certain thresholds over time

3020
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:41,820
where we kind of plateaued early on

3021
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,919
and it wasn't clear

3022
01:37:43,919 --> 01:37:44,690
that we were ever gonna reach

3023
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:47,959
and then we got really good at dialing

3024
01:37:47,959 --> 01:37:49,500
in internationalization

3025
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,170
and helping the service grow

3026
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:52,290
in different countries

3027
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:55,370
and that was like a whole competence

3028
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:56,470
that we needed to develop.

3029
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:00,230
And helping people basically spread

3030
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:01,639
the service with their friends.

3031
01:38:01,639 --> 01:38:03,530
That was one of the things,

3032
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:03,820
once we got very good at that,

3033
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:05,999
that was one of the things

3034
01:38:05,999 --> 01:38:08,780
hey, if Instagram joined us early on,

3035
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:11,110
then I felt like we could help

3036
01:38:11,110 --> 01:38:11,470
and same with WhatsApp.

3037
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:12,510
And that's sort

3038
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:13,580
of been a core competence

3039
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:15,230
that we've developed

3040
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:17,429
and been able to execute on

3041
01:38:17,429 --> 01:38:18,299
and others have too, right?

3042
01:38:18,299 --> 01:38:19,040
I mean, ByteDance obviously have done

3043
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,500
a very good job with TikTok

3044
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,350
and have reached more

3045
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:23,889
than a billion people there.

3046
01:38:23,889 --> 01:38:26,710
But it's certainly not automatic, right?

3047
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:28,730
I think you need a certain level

3048
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:31,980
of execution to basically get there.

3049
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:34,480
And I think for whatever reason,

3050
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,500
I think Twitter has this great idea

3051
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,019
and sort of magic in the service,

3052
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:43,170
but they just haven't kind of cracked

3053
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:45,490
that piece yet.

3054
01:38:45,490 --> 01:38:47,310
so that you're seeing

3055
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:47,810
all these other things,

3056
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:50,629
whether it's Mastodon or Blue Sky,

3057
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,320
that I think are maybe

3058
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,370
just different cuts

3059
01:38:54,370 --> 01:38:56,269
at the same thing.

3060
01:38:56,269 --> 01:38:56,350
You know, I think through

3061
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:58,780
the last generation

3062
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:00,209
of social media overall,

3063
01:39:00,209 --> 01:39:01,530
one of the interesting experiments

3064
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:02,970
that I think should get run

3065
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:05,469
at larger scale

3066
01:39:05,469 --> 01:39:06,230
is what happens

3067
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:06,560
if there's somewhat more decentralized

3068
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,030
control and if the stack

3069
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:10,240
is more open throughout.

3070
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:13,000
And I've just been pretty fascinated

3071
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,410
by that and seeing how that works.

3072
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:17,939
To some degree,

3073
01:39:17,939 --> 01:39:20,460
end-to-end encryption on WhatsApp

3074
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,490
and as we bring it to other services,

3075
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:23,620
provides an element of it

3076
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:26,250
because it pushes the service really out

3077
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:27,990
to the edges.

3078
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:29,719
I mean, the server part

3079
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:31,880
of this that we run for WhatsApp

3080
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:33,420
is relatively very thin

3081
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,979
compared to what we do

3082
01:39:35,979 --> 01:39:36,299
on Facebook or Instagram.

3083
01:39:36,299 --> 01:39:38,200
And much more of the complexity is,

3084
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:39,890
you know, in how the apps kind

3085
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:41,629
of negotiate

3086
01:39:41,629 --> 01:39:42,280
with each other to pass information

3087
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,260
in a fully end-to-end encrypted way.

3088
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:47,410
But I don't know,

3089
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:48,110
I think that that is a good model.

3090
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:49,139
I think it puts more power

3091
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:50,180
in individuals' hands

3092
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:52,260
and there are a lot of benefits of it

3093
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,689
if you can make it happen.

3094
01:39:54,689 --> 01:39:55,480
Again, this is all like pretty speculative.

3095
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:58,150
I mean, I think that it's hard

3096
01:39:58,150 --> 01:40:00,569
from the outside

3097
01:40:00,569 --> 01:40:00,590
to know why anything does

3098
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:02,670
or doesn't work

3099
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:02,860
until you kind of take a run at it.

3100
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:06,490
So I think it's kind

3101
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:08,870
of an interesting thing

3102
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:10,000
to experiment with,

3103
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:10,670
but I don't really know

3104
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:11,850
where this one's gonna go.

3105
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:12,980
So since we were talking about Twitter,

3106
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:16,280
Elon Musk had

3107
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:19,580
what I think a few harsh words

3108
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,120
that I wish he didn't say.

3109
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:25,220
So let me ask, in the hope in the name

3110
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:26,450
of camaraderie,

3111
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:28,650
what do you think Elon

3112
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:29,100
is doing well with Twitter?

3113
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:32,220
And what, as a person who has run

3114
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:34,550
for a long time,

3115
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:36,630
you, social networks, Facebook,

3116
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:37,990
Instagram, WhatsApp,

3117
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:41,639
what can he do better?

3118
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:42,950
What can he improve on

3119
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:45,259
that text-based social network?

3120
01:40:45,259 --> 01:40:46,789
Gosh, it's always very difficult

3121
01:40:46,789 --> 01:40:49,290
to offer specific critiques

3122
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:51,670
from the outside

3123
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,320
Because I think one thing

3124
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:54,799
that I've learned

3125
01:40:54,799 --> 01:40:56,550
is that everyone has opinions

3126
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:57,620
on what you should do

3127
01:40:57,620 --> 01:41:00,020
and like running the company,

3128
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,960
you see a lot of specific nuances

3129
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:04,090
on things

3130
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:04,690
that are not apparent externally.

3131
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:09,050
And I often think that some

3132
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:12,280
of the discourse around us

3133
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,490
would be, could be better

3134
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:15,680
if there was more

3135
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,520
kind of space for acknowledging

3136
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:19,720
that there's certain things

3137
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:20,540
that we're seeing internally

3138
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:21,570
that guide what we're doing.

3139
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:23,589
But I don't know.

3140
01:41:23,589 --> 01:41:25,720
I mean, because since you asked

3141
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,200
what is going well,

3142
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:37,030
you know, I do think that Elon led

3143
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:39,330
a push early on

3144
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:41,420
to make Twitter a lot leaner.

3145
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:44,059
And I think that's a good point.

3146
01:41:44,059 --> 01:41:47,370
think that that, you know, it's like you can,

3147
01:41:47,370 --> 01:41:49,550
you can agree or disagree with exactly all

3148
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:50,880
the tactics and how, and how we

3149
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,710
did that, you know, obviously,

3150
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:54,349
you know, every leader

3151
01:41:54,349 --> 01:41:56,490
has their own style for if they, you know,

3152
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:58,490
if you need to make dramatic changes for that,

3153
01:41:58,490 --> 01:41:59,609
how you're going to execute it.

3154
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:04,140
But a lot of the specific principles that he pushed

3155
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:08,790
on around basically trying to make

3156
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:12,190
the organization more technical around decreasing

3157
01:42:12,190 --> 01:42:14,780
the distance between engineers at the company

3158
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:17,869
and, and him like fewer layers of management.

3159
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:24,000
I think that those were generally good changes and I'm also,

3160
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:26,000
I also think that it was probably

3161
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,630
good for the industry that he made those changes

3162
01:42:28,630 --> 01:42:29,969
because my sense is that there were a lot

3163
01:42:29,969 --> 01:42:33,230
of other people who thought that those were good changes,

3164
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:36,990
but who may have been a little

3165
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:39,710
shy about doing them.

3166
01:42:39,710 --> 01:42:43,260
And I think he, you know, and just in my conversations

3167
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:46,179
with other founders and how people have reacted

3168
01:42:46,179 --> 01:42:47,480
to the things that we've done, you know,

3169
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,969
what I've heard from a lot of folks is, is just,

3170
01:42:49,969 --> 01:42:52,359
hey, you know, when you, when someone like you, you know,

3171
01:42:52,359 --> 01:42:53,850
when I, when I wrote the letter

3172
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:55,660
outlining the organizational changes

3173
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:58,655
that I wanted to make back in March and, you know,

3174
01:42:58,655 --> 01:43:02,730
when people see what Elon is doing, I think that that gives,

3175
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:05,240
you know, people the ability

3176
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,050
to think through how to shape

3177
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:10,200
their organizations in a way that,

3178
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,100
that, that, you know, hopefully

3179
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:14,120
can, can be good for the industry and make

3180
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:16,130
all these companies more productive over time.

3181
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:18,300
So something that that was one

3182
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:21,490
where I think he was quite ahead

3183
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:23,000
of a bunch of the other

3184
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,370
companies on and, you know, what

3185
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:26,875
he was doing there, you know,

3186
01:43:26,875 --> 01:43:29,630
again, from the outside, very

3187
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:29,780
hard to know.

3188
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:29,840
It's like, okay, did he, did he cut too much?

3189
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,070
Did he knock enough?

3190
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,470
Whatever.

3191
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:35,059
I don't think it's like my place to opine on that.

3192
01:43:35,059 --> 01:43:37,760
And you asked for a, for a positive framing

3193
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,950
of the question of what, what do I admire?

3194
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:42,010
What do I think it went well?

3195
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:46,719
But I think that like certainly his actions led me

3196
01:43:48,219 --> 01:43:49,410
and I think a lot of other folks in

3197
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:51,830
the industry to think about, hey, are we,

3198
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:54,700
are we kind of doing this as much as we should?

3199
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:57,190
Like can we, could we make our companies better

3200
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:59,420
by pushing on some of these same principles?

3201
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:02,380
Well, the two of you are in the top of the world in terms

3202
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:04,049
of leading the development of tech.

3203
01:44:04,049 --> 01:44:07,960
And I wish there was more both way camaraderie and kindness,

3204
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:12,200
more love in the world because

3205
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,280
love is the answer.

3206
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:18,349
But let me ask kind of a point of efficiency.

3207
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:22,459
You recently announced multiple stages of layoffs and meta.

3208
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:28,350
What are the most painful aspects of this process given

3209
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:31,140
for the individuals, the painful

3210
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,809
effects it has on those people's lives?

3211
01:44:32,809 --> 01:44:34,529
Yeah.

3212
01:44:34,529 --> 01:44:35,670
I mean, that's it.

3213
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:36,850
And that's it.

3214
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:40,730
I mean, it's a, you basically have a significant number

3215
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:43,060
of people who, you know, this is just

3216
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:46,270
not the end of their time at meta that they,

3217
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:50,020
or I, you know, would have hoped for when

3218
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:52,689
they joined the company.

3219
01:44:52,689 --> 01:44:56,610
And yeah, I mean, running a company, people are, you know,

3220
01:44:58,529 --> 01:44:59,860
constantly joining and leaving

3221
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:01,180
the company for different directions,

3222
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:03,910
but for different, different reasons.

3223
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:08,020
But I'm a lay officer, like uniquely challenging

3224
01:45:09,820 --> 01:45:12,440
and tough in that you have a lot of people

3225
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,820
leaving for reasons that aren't connected

3226
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:17,639
to their own performance,

3227
01:45:17,639 --> 01:45:22,120
or the culture not being a fit at that point.

3228
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:27,110
It's really just, it's a, it's a kind of strategy decision

3229
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:29,150
and sometimes financially required.

3230
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:33,980
But not, not fully in our case,

3231
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:35,889
especially on the changes that we made this year.

3232
01:45:35,889 --> 01:45:38,250
A lot of it was more kind of culturally

3233
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:40,810
and strategically driven by this push where I

3234
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:44,520
wanted us to become a stronger technology company

3235
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,880
with a more of a focus on building

3236
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,140
more technical and more of a focus

3237
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:52,279
on building higher quality products faster.

3238
01:45:52,279 --> 01:45:53,390
And I just feel the external

3239
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:56,090
world is quite volatile right now.

3240
01:45:56,090 --> 01:46:00,440
And I wanted to make sure that we had a stable position

3241
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,760
to be able to continue investing

3242
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,000
in these longterm ambitious projects

3243
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,880
that we have around, you know, continuing to push

3244
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,170
AI forward and continuing to push

3245
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:10,369
forward all the metaverse work.

3246
01:46:10,369 --> 01:46:15,180
And in order to do that in light of the pretty big thrash

3247
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:17,450
that we had seen over the last 18

3248
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:20,240
months, you know, some of it, you know,

3249
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:22,710
macroeconomic induced, some of it specific,

3250
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:24,230
some of it competitively induced,

3251
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:27,440
some of it just because of bad decisions, right?

3252
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,769
Or things that we got wrong.

3253
01:46:30,329 --> 01:46:31,980
I know I just, I decided that we needed

3254
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,970
to get to a point where we were a lot leaner.

3255
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:36,740
And, but look, I mean, but then, okay, it's,

3256
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:38,660
it's one thing to do that, to like decide

3257
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:40,420
that at a high level, then the question is,

3258
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:42,889
how do you execute that as compassionately as possible?

3259
01:46:42,889 --> 01:46:44,309
And there's no good way.

3260
01:46:46,059 --> 01:46:47,440
There's no perfect way for sure.

3261
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,410
And it's, it's, it's going to be tough no matter what.

3262
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:53,490
But I, you know, as a leadership team here,

3263
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:55,130
we've certainly spent a lot of time just

3264
01:46:55,130 --> 01:46:58,460
thinking, okay, given that this is a thing that sucks,

3265
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:00,270
like, what is the most

3266
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:01,990
compassionate way that we can do this?

3267
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:04,590
And, and that's what we've tried to do.

3268
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:08,520
And you mentioned there, there's an increased focus

3269
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,560
on engineering on tech.

3270
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:14,730
So the technology teams, tech focus teams

3271
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:17,889
on building products that.

3272
01:47:17,889 --> 01:47:19,959
Yeah.

3273
01:47:19,959 --> 01:47:23,040
I mean, I wanted to, I want to empower engineers more,

3274
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:27,990
the people are building

3275
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:28,620
things, the tech, the technical teams.

3276
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:33,159
Um, part of that is making sure that the people

3277
01:47:34,059 --> 01:47:35,420
who are building things aren't just

3278
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:37,490
at like the leaf nodes of the organization.

3279
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:39,460
I don't want like, you know,

3280
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:42,150
eight levels of management and then the people

3281
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:44,380
actually doing the work.

3282
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:44,870
So we made changes to make it set,

3283
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:46,650
you have individual contributor engineers

3284
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:48,639
reporting at almost every level up the stack,

3285
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:50,030
which I think is important because

3286
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:51,180
you know, you're running a company,

3287
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:53,499
one of the big questions is, you know,

3288
01:47:53,499 --> 01:47:56,029
latency of information that you get.

3289
01:47:56,029 --> 01:47:58,680
You know, we talked about this a bit earlier in terms

3290
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,400
of kind of the joy of,

3291
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:04,100
of, of the feedback that you get doing something like

3292
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:05,970
jujitsu compared to running

3293
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:08,890
a long-term project, but I actually think part

3294
01:48:08,890 --> 01:48:10,140
of the art of running a company is

3295
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:13,439
trying to constantly re-engineer it

3296
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:15,080
so that your feedback loops get shorter

3297
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,180
so you can learn faster.

3298
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:18,089
And part of the way that you do that is by,

3299
01:48:18,089 --> 01:48:19,730
I kind of think that every, every

3300
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:23,610
layer that you have in the organization, um, means

3301
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:25,010
that information might not need

3302
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:27,309
to get reviewed before it goes to you.

3303
01:48:27,309 --> 01:48:29,766
And I think, you know,

3304
01:48:29,766 --> 01:48:30,360
making it so that the people doing the work are as close

3305
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:34,500
as possible to you as possible is pretty important.

3306
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:36,950
So there's that.

3307
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:38,360
And I think over time, companies just build up

3308
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:41,070
very large support functions

3309
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:43,300
that are not doing the kind of core technical work.

3310
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:45,429
And those functions are very important,

3311
01:48:45,429 --> 01:48:46,900
but I think having them in the right

3312
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:48,420
proportion is, is important.

3313
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:52,650
And if, um, if you, you try to do good work,

3314
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:54,300
but you don't have, you know, the

3315
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:56,290
right, you know, marketing team,

3316
01:48:57,730 --> 01:48:59,270
or the right legal advice, like you're

3317
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:01,950
gonna, you know, make some pretty big blunders,

3318
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:03,660
but at the same time,

3319
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:05,349
if you have, you know,

3320
01:49:05,349 --> 01:49:09,179
if you just like have too big of things

3321
01:49:09,179 --> 01:49:11,119
and, and some of these support roles,

3322
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:13,760
then that might make it so that things

3323
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,920
are just move a lot maybe you're too conservative

3324
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,310
or you, you move

3325
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,559
a lot slower than you should otherwise.

3326
01:49:22,559 --> 01:49:23,759
So those are just examples,

3327
01:49:23,759 --> 01:49:26,860
but it's but how do you find that balance?

3328
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:28,689
That's really tough.

3329
01:49:28,689 --> 01:49:29,190
Yeah.

3330
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:29,920
No, I, but that's, it's a constant equilibrium

3331
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,750
that you're searching for.

3332
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:33,770
Yeah.

3333
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:36,240
What are the pros and cons of managers?

3334
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,480
Well, I mean, I, I believe a lot in management.

3335
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,667
I think there are some people

3336
01:49:40,667 --> 01:49:41,420
who think that it doesn't matter as much, but look,

3337
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:43,240
I mean, we have a lot of younger people

3338
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:45,490
at the company for them.

3339
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:46,330
This is their first job and, you know,

3340
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:48,490
people need to grow and learn in their career

3341
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:50,330
and like that, all that stuff is important,

3342
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:51,730
but here's one mathematical

3343
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:53,810
way to look at it.

3344
01:49:53,810 --> 01:49:56,949
Um, you know, at the beginning of this, we, um,

3345
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,639
I asked our, our people team,

3346
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:01,780
what was the average number

3347
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:03,809
of reports that a manager had?

3348
01:50:03,809 --> 01:50:06,480
And I think it was, it was around three,

3349
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,530
maybe three to four, but closer to three.

3350
01:50:09,530 --> 01:50:13,370
I was like, wow, like a manager can, you know,

3351
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:15,220
best practices that person can,

3352
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:17,509
can manage, you know, seven or eight people.

3353
01:50:17,509 --> 01:50:20,130
Um, but there was a reason why it was closer to three.

3354
01:50:20,130 --> 01:50:22,750
It was because we were growing so quickly, right?

3355
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,950
And when you're hiring so many people so quickly,

3356
01:50:25,950 --> 01:50:27,750
then that means that you need

3357
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:30,820
managers who have capacity to onboard new people.

3358
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:32,620
Um, and also if you have a new manager,

3359
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:34,290
you may not want to have them have seven

3360
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:36,910
direct reports immediately because you want them to ramp up.

3361
01:50:36,910 --> 01:50:38,990
But the thing is going forward,

3362
01:50:38,990 --> 01:50:41,699
I don't want us to actually hire that many people

3363
01:50:41,699 --> 01:50:43,879
that quickly, right?

3364
01:50:43,879 --> 01:50:44,760
So I actually think we'll just do better

3365
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:46,230
work if we have more constraints and

3366
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:48,920
we're, um, you know, leaner as an organization.

3367
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,440
So in a world where we're not

3368
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:51,779
adding so many people as quickly,

3369
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:55,089
is it as valuable

3370
01:50:55,089 --> 01:50:56,360
to have a lot of managers who have extra capacity waiting

3371
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:58,459
for new people?

3372
01:50:58,459 --> 01:50:59,220
No, right?

3373
01:50:59,220 --> 01:50:59,779
So, um, so now we can,

3374
01:50:59,779 --> 01:51:02,030
we could sort of defragment the organization and get to

3375
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,686
a place where the average is close

3376
01:51:03,686 --> 01:51:05,260
r to that seven or eight.

3377
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:08,900
Um, and it's, it's just ends up being a somewhat more kind

3378
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:11,740
of compact management structure, which, you know,

3379
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:14,589
decreases the latency on information going up

3380
01:51:14,589 --> 01:51:17,709
and down the chain and I think empowers people more.

3381
01:51:17,709 --> 01:51:19,300
But I mean that's an example that I

3382
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:21,790
think it doesn't kind of undervalue

3383
01:51:21,790 --> 01:51:23,030
the importance of management,

3384
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:27,300
and the kind of the personal growth

3385
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,330
or coaching that people need in order to do their jobs.

3386
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:32,280
Well, it's just, I think realistically,

3387
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:34,260
we're just not going to hire as many people going forward.

3388
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:36,379
So I think that you need a different structure.

3389
01:51:36,379 --> 01:51:39,720
This whole, this whole incredible hierarchy

3390
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:43,110
and network of humans that make up a company is fascinating.

3391
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:44,530
Oh, yeah.

3392
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:45,840
Uh, yeah.

3393
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,440
How do you hire great teams?

3394
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:51,820
How do you hire great now with the focus on engineering

3395
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:54,159
and technical teams?

3396
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:55,880
How do you hire great engineers

3397
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:58,480
and great members of technical teams?

3398
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,380
Well, you're asking how you select

3399
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:03,010
or how you attract them.

3400
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:04,700
Both, but select.

3401
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:08,620
I think, uh, I think attract is work on cool stuff

3402
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:10,840
and have a vision.

3403
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:11,100
I think that's right.

3404
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,940
And, and, and have a track record that people

3405
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:14,721
think you're actually going to be

3406
01:52:14,721 --> 01:52:14,980
able to do it.

3407
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:16,310
Yeah, to, to me, the select is,

3408
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:20,099
seems like more of the art form, more of the tricky thing.

3409
01:52:20,099 --> 01:52:21,809
Yeah.

3410
01:52:21,809 --> 01:52:23,889
How do you select the people that fit the culture

3411
01:52:23,889 --> 01:52:25,650
and can get integrated the most

3412
01:52:25,650 --> 01:52:26,870
effectively and so on.

3413
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:31,250
And maybe, yeah, especially when they're young to see like,

3414
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:33,150
to see the magic through

3415
01:52:33,150 --> 01:52:36,390
the, through the resume, through the paperwork

3416
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:38,880
and all this kind of stuff to

3417
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:39,520
see that there's a special human there

3418
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,960
that would do like incredible work.

3419
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,520
So there are lots of different cuts on this question.

3420
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:49,930
I mean, I think when an organization has grown quickly,

3421
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:51,100
one of the big questions

3422
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:54,750
that teams face is, do I hire this person

3423
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:56,210
who's in front of me now because they

3424
01:52:56,210 --> 01:53:00,250
seem good, or do I hold out to get someone

3425
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:02,939
who's even better?

3426
01:53:02,939 --> 01:53:06,080
And the heuristic that I always focused on for myself

3427
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:08,460
and my own kind of direct

3428
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:11,510
hiring that I think works when you,

3429
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:13,820
when you recurse it through the organization

3430
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:15,470
is that you should only hire someone to be

3431
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:17,340
on your team if you would be happy

3432
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:19,679
working for them in an alternate universe.

3433
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:22,080
And so that, that kind of works.

3434
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,670
And, you know, that's basically how I've tried

3435
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:26,090
to build my team.

3436
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:27,370
It's, you know, I'm not, I'm not in a rush

3437
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:29,140
to not be running the company, but I

3438
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:30,809
think in an alternate universe where one

3439
01:53:30,809 --> 01:53:32,110
of these other folks was running the

3440
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:33,559
company, I'd be happy to work for them.

3441
01:53:33,559 --> 01:53:35,450
I feel like I'd learn from them.

3442
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:38,429
I respect their kind of general judgment.

3443
01:53:39,389 --> 01:53:40,650
They're, they're all very insightful.

3444
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:42,139
They have good values.

3445
01:53:42,139 --> 01:53:46,650
Um, and, and I think that that gives you some rubric for,

3446
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,880
you can apply that at every layer.

3447
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:49,950
And I think if you apply that at

3448
01:53:49,950 --> 01:53:51,800
every layer in the organization,

3449
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,170
then you'll have a pretty strong organization.

3450
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:56,900
Um, okay.

3451
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:59,080
In an organization that's not growing as quickly,

3452
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,240
the questions might be a little different though.

3453
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:05,980
Um, and there you asked about young people specifically,

3454
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:08,299
like people out of college, and one of the things

3455
01:54:08,299 --> 01:54:12,610
that we see is it's, it's a pretty basic lesson,

3456
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:15,240
but like we have a much better sense

3457
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:16,959
of who the best people are, who have

3458
01:54:16,959 --> 01:54:19,470
interned at the company for a couple of months,

3459
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:21,200
then by looking at them at, at,

3460
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:22,880
at, at kind of a resume or a short,

3461
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:25,200
or a short interview loop.

3462
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,370
I mean, obviously the in-person feel that you get

3463
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:29,860
from someone probably tells

3464
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:30,159
you more than the resume, um,

3465
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:33,639
and you can do some basic skills assessment.

3466
01:54:33,639 --> 01:54:36,440
But a lot of the stuff really just is cultural.

3467
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:38,820
People thrive in different environments

3468
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:42,950
and, um, and on different teams, even

3469
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:44,900
within a specific company,

3470
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:48,530
and it's, it's like the people who come for even a

3471
01:54:48,530 --> 01:54:50,589
short period of time over a summer,

3472
01:54:50,589 --> 01:54:52,779
who do a great job here, you know, that

3473
01:54:52,779 --> 01:54:54,010
they're going to be great if they,

3474
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:55,380
if they came and joined full time.

3475
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:56,760
And that's, you know, one of the reasons

3476
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,270
why we've invested so much in

3477
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:01,480
internship is, um, is basically it just,

3478
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:03,870
it's a very useful sorting function,

3479
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:05,530
both for us and for the people who want

3480
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:07,629
to try out the company.

3481
01:55:07,629 --> 01:55:08,049
You mentioned in-person,

3482
01:55:08,049 --> 01:55:10,910
what do you think about remote work, a topic that's

3483
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:13,350
been discussed extensively because of the,

3484
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:15,930
over the past few years, because of the pandemic?

3485
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:17,700
Yeah.

3486
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:18,330
I mean, I think it's, I mean

3487
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:20,380
it's a thing that's here to stay.

3488
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:24,990
Um, but I think that there's, there's value in both, right?

3489
01:55:24,990 --> 01:55:27,809
It's not, um, you know, I wouldn't want

3490
01:55:27,809 --> 01:55:31,510
to run a fully remote company yet at least.

3491
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:33,620
I think there's an asterisk on that, which is that,

3492
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,660
which is that some of the

3493
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:35,970
other stuff you're working on.

3494
01:55:35,970 --> 01:55:37,710
Yeah.

3495
01:55:37,710 --> 01:55:38,089
Yeah, exactly.

3496
01:55:38,089 --> 01:55:39,190
It's like all the, all the, um, you know,

3497
01:55:39,190 --> 01:55:42,130
metaverse work and the ability to be, to

3498
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:45,870
feel like you're truly present, no matter where you are.

3499
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:49,530
I think once you have that all dialed in, then we may,

3500
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:50,730
you know, one day reach a point

3501
01:55:50,730 --> 01:55:52,330
where it really just doesn't matter

3502
01:55:52,330 --> 01:55:54,180
as much where you are physically.

3503
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:58,749
Um, but I don't know, today it, today it still does, right?

3504
01:56:02,049 --> 01:56:05,379
So yeah, for people who, there are all these people

3505
01:56:05,379 --> 01:56:08,330
who have special skills and want to live in a place

3506
01:56:08,330 --> 01:56:10,670
where we don't have an office,

3507
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:11,620
or are we better off having them at the company?

3508
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:13,549
Absolutely.

3509
01:56:13,549 --> 01:56:14,280
Right.

3510
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,420
And are a lot of people who work at the company

3511
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:17,780
for several years and then, you

3512
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:20,819
know, build up the relationships internally, um,

3513
01:56:22,059 --> 01:56:23,480
and kind of have the trust and have a

3514
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:25,000
sense of how the company works.

3515
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,750
Can they go work remotely now if they want

3516
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:28,040
and still do it as effectively?

3517
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:30,052
And we've done all these studies that show it's like,

3518
01:56:30,052 --> 01:56:31,670
okay, does that affect their performance?

3519
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:33,840
It does not.

3520
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,950
Um, but, you know, for the new folks who are joining,

3521
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:39,360
um, and for people who are

3522
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,740
earlier in their career and you don't need to learn

3523
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:43,090
how to solve certain problems

3524
01:56:43,090 --> 01:56:45,250
and need to get ramped up on the culture.

3525
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:48,400
Um, you know, when you're working through

3526
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,030
really complicated problems where you

3527
01:56:50,030 --> 01:56:51,510
don't just want to sit in the,

3528
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:52,950
you don't just want the formal meeting,

3529
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:55,050
but you want to be able to like brainstorm

3530
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:56,470
when you're walking in the hallway together

3531
01:56:56,470 --> 01:56:58,809
after the meeting.

3532
01:56:58,809 --> 01:56:59,130
Um, I don't know.

3533
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:02,750
It's like we, we just haven't replaced the kind

3534
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:06,720
of in-person dynamics

3535
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:08,920
there yet with, with, with anything remote yet.

3536
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:11,270
So yeah, there's a magic to the in-person

3537
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:13,110
that we'll talk about this a little

3538
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:15,660
bit more, but I'm really excited by the possibilities

3539
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:16,690
in the next two years and

3540
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:20,000
virtual reality and mixed reality that are possible

3541
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,900
with high resolution scans.

3542
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:26,040
I mean, uh, I, as a person who loves in-person interaction,

3543
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:28,820
like these podcasts

3544
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:31,040
in person, it would be incredible

3545
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:33,490
to achieve the level of realism.

3546
01:57:33,490 --> 01:57:35,230
I've gotten a chance to witness,

3547
01:57:35,230 --> 01:57:38,300
but let me ask about that.

3548
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:40,020
Yeah.

3549
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:43,360
I got a chance to, uh, look at the quest three headset

3550
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:45,500
and it is amazing.

3551
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:48,480
Um, you've, you've announced it.

3552
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:52,879
It's, uh, you'll get some more details in the fall.

3553
01:57:52,879 --> 01:57:55,279
Maybe release in the fall.

3554
01:57:55,279 --> 01:57:56,310
I forgot you, you mentioned it.

3555
01:57:56,310 --> 01:57:57,770
We'll give more details of connect,

3556
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:59,160
but, but it's coming, it's coming this fall.

3557
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:01,360
Okay.

3558
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:06,130
So, uh, it's, uh, priced at, uh, $4.99.

3559
01:58:07,270 --> 01:58:09,679
What features are you most excited about there?

3560
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:11,269
There are basically two big new things

3561
01:58:11,269 --> 01:58:14,410
that we've added to quest three over quest two.

3562
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:17,670
The first is high resolution, mixed reality.

3563
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:21,890
Um, and the, the basic idea here is that you can think

3564
01:58:23,090 --> 01:58:25,360
about virtual reality as you

3565
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:29,029
have the headset and like all the pixels are virtual

3566
01:58:29,029 --> 01:58:30,580
and you're basically like immersed

3567
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:32,890
in a different world.

3568
01:58:32,890 --> 01:58:35,280
Mixed reality is where you see the physical world

3569
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,670
around you and you can place virtual

3570
01:58:36,670 --> 01:58:40,219
objects in it, whether that's a screen to watch a movie

3571
01:58:40,219 --> 01:58:41,470
or a projection of your virtual

3572
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:44,900
desktop, or you're playing a game where like zombies

3573
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:45,920
are coming out through the wall

3574
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,380
and you need to shoot them.

3575
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:48,780
Um, or, you know, we're, you know,

3576
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:50,600
we're playing Dungeons and Dragons or some board

3577
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:52,850
game and we just have a virtual version of the board

3578
01:58:52,850 --> 01:58:54,730
in front of us while we're sitting here.

3579
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:57,530
Um, all that's possible in mixed reality.

3580
01:58:57,530 --> 01:59:01,080
And I think that that is going to be the next big capability

3581
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:02,580
on top of virtual reality.

3582
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:05,549
It is done so well.

3583
01:59:05,549 --> 01:59:08,470
I have to say, as a person who experienced it today

3584
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:10,990
with zombies, having a full

3585
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:14,420
awareness of the environment and integrating

3586
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:16,460
that environment in the way they run

3587
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:17,870
at you while they try to kill you.

3588
01:59:17,870 --> 01:59:19,520
So it's, it's, uh, it's just the,

3589
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,839
the mixed reality that passed through is really,

3590
01:59:21,839 --> 01:59:22,950
really, really well done.

3591
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:24,740
Uh, and the fact that it's only

3592
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:28,290
$500 is really, it's, uh, well done.

3593
01:59:28,290 --> 01:59:30,420
Thank you.

3594
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:30,630
I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm super excited about it.

3595
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:35,419
I mean, our, and we put a lot of work into making the device

3596
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,650
both as good as

3597
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:41,420
possible and as affordable as possible because a big part

3598
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:42,822
of our mission and ethos

3599
01:59:42,822 --> 01:59:45,560
here is we, we, we want people to be able

3600
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:47,860
to connect with each other.

3601
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:48,070
We want to reach and we want to

3602
01:59:48,070 --> 01:59:50,552
serve a lot of people, right?

3603
01:59:50,552 --> 01:59:51,860
We want to bring this technology to, to everyone, right?

3604
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:56,370
So we're not just trying to serve like a, you know, an elite

3605
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:57,620
, a wealthy crowd.

3606
01:59:57,620 --> 02:00:01,330
We, we want to, um, we really want this to be accessible.

3607
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:03,860
So that, that is in a lot of ways,

3608
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:06,270
an extremely hard technical problem because

3609
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:08,320
you know, we don't just have the ability

3610
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:10,599
to put an unlimited amount of hardware.

3611
02:00:10,599 --> 02:00:12,990
And thus we needed to basically deliver something

3612
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:14,920
that works really well, but in

3613
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:16,150
an, an affordable package.

3614
02:00:16,150 --> 02:00:18,230
And we started with Quest pro last year

3615
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:22,500
and it was, um, it's, it's, it was $1,500.

3616
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:25,270
Um, and now we've, we've lowered the price to a thousand,

3617
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:26,599
but in a lot of ways, the

3618
02:00:26,599 --> 02:00:30,690
mixed reality in quest three is an even better

3619
02:00:30,690 --> 02:00:31,980
and more advanced level than what

3620
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:33,549
we were able to deliver in quest pro.

3621
02:00:33,549 --> 02:00:36,129
So I'm really proud of where we are with,

3622
02:00:36,129 --> 02:00:38,490
with, um, with quest three on that it's

3623
02:00:38,490 --> 02:00:40,770
going to work with all of the virtual reality titles

3624
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:42,900
and everything that, that existed there.

3625
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:45,309
So people who want to play fully immersive games,

3626
02:00:45,309 --> 02:00:49,040
social experiences, fitness, all that stuff will, will work,

3627
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,730
but now you'll also get mixed reality too.

3628
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:54,280
Um, which I think people really like

3629
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:56,510
because it's sometimes you want to

3630
02:00:56,510 --> 02:01:00,500
be super immersed in a game, but a lot of the time,

3631
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:02,559
especially when you're moving around, if you're active,

3632
02:01:02,559 --> 02:01:05,170
like you're, you're doing some fitness experience.

3633
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:07,320
Um, you know, let's say you're

3634
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:08,689
like doing boxing or something.

3635
02:01:08,689 --> 02:01:09,966
It's like, you kind of want to be

3636
02:01:09,966 --> 02:01:11,170
able to see the room around you.

3637
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:12,320
So that way you know that like,

3638
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,670
I'm not going to punch a lamp or something like that.

3639
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:16,220
Um, and I don't know if you got

3640
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:18,519
to play with this experience,

3641
02:01:18,519 --> 02:01:19,349
but we basically have

3642
02:01:19,349 --> 02:01:20,360
the, and it's just sort of like a fun little, little demo

3643
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:22,559
that we put together.

3644
02:01:22,559 --> 02:01:24,679
But it's, um, it's like, you just, you know,

3645
02:01:24,679 --> 02:01:25,900
we're like in a conference room or

3646
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:28,309
you're living room and you, you have, um,

3647
02:01:28,309 --> 02:01:30,139
the guy there and you're boxing him

3648
02:01:30,139 --> 02:01:31,809
and you're fighting him and it's like,

3649
02:01:31,809 --> 02:01:35,540
Oh, the other people are there too.

3650
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:36,870
I got a chance to do that.

3651
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:38,390
Yeah.

3652
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:38,612
And all the people are there.

3653
02:01:38,612 --> 02:01:39,230
Uh, it's like that guy is right there.

3654
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:41,030
Yeah.

3655
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:42,689
And the other human,

3656
02:01:42,689 --> 02:01:43,550
the path that you're seeing them also,

3657
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:45,600
they can cheer you on.

3658
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:46,799
They can make fun of you

3659
02:01:46,799 --> 02:01:47,379
if there are anything like friends of mine.

3660
02:01:47,379 --> 02:01:51,740
And then just it, yeah, it, it, it, it's really,

3661
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:55,030
it's a really compelling experience.

3662
02:01:55,030 --> 02:01:57,000
I mean, VR is really interesting too,

3663
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,830
but this is something else almost.

3664
02:01:58,830 --> 02:02:01,679
This is, this becomes integrated into your life,

3665
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:04,169
into your world.

3666
02:02:04,169 --> 02:02:05,410
Yeah.

3667
02:02:05,410 --> 02:02:06,940
And it, so I think it's a completely new capability

3668
02:02:06,940 --> 02:02:09,290
that will unlock a lot of different content

3669
02:02:09,290 --> 02:02:10,870
and I think it'll also just make

3670
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:12,390
the experience more comfortable

3671
02:02:12,390 --> 02:02:13,809
for a set of people who didn't want

3672
02:02:13,809 --> 02:02:16,860
to have only fully immersive experiences.

3673
02:02:16,860 --> 02:02:18,000
I think if you want experiences

3674
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,639
where you're grounded in, you know, your

3675
02:02:19,639 --> 02:02:21,719
living room in the physical world around you,

3676
02:02:21,719 --> 02:02:23,840
now you'll be able to have that too.

3677
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:24,940
And I think that that's pretty exciting.

3678
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:29,140
I really liked how it added windows to a room

3679
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:30,500
with no windows.

3680
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:32,090
Yeah.

3681
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:33,360
Me as a person.

3682
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:34,230
where you could see the sharks swim up

3683
02:02:34,230 --> 02:02:35,580
or was that just a zombie one?

3684
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:37,640
Just a zombie one.

3685
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:39,410
But it's still, you don't necessarily want windows added

3686
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:41,070
to your living room where zombies come out of.

3687
02:02:41,070 --> 02:02:42,900
But yeah, so the context of that game,

3688
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,372
it's, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good.

3689
02:02:45,372 --> 02:02:47,570
I enjoyed it because you could see the nature outside.

3690
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:50,030
And me as a person that doesn't have windows,

3691
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:52,110
it's just nice to have nature.

3692
02:02:52,110 --> 02:02:53,969
Yeah.

3693
02:02:53,969 --> 02:02:56,639
Well, even if it's a mixed reality setting,

3694
02:02:56,639 --> 02:02:58,559
it's, it's kind of, like there's a, I

3695
02:02:58,559 --> 02:03:01,720
know it's a zombie game, but there's a Zen nature,

3696
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:03,120
Zen aspect to being able to

3697
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:06,610
look outside and alter your environment as you know it.

3698
02:03:08,309 --> 02:03:10,059
Yeah.

3699
02:03:10,059 --> 02:03:11,250
In, you know, there'll probably be better,

3700
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:12,683
more Zen ways to do that than the

3701
02:03:12,683 --> 02:03:13,820
zombie game you're describing,

3702
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:16,199
but you're right that the, the basic idea

3703
02:03:16,199 --> 02:03:19,430
of sort of having your physical environment

3704
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:21,600
on pass through, but then being able to

3705
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:25,350
bring in different elements, external,

3706
02:03:25,350 --> 02:03:27,660
I mean, I think it's going to be super powerful.

3707
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:31,530
And in some ways, I think that these are mixed reality

3708
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:33,170
is also a predecessor to

3709
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:36,090
eventually we will get AR glasses that are not kind

3710
02:03:36,090 --> 02:03:39,460
of the goggles form factor of the current generation

3711
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:41,970
of headsets that, that people are making.

3712
02:03:41,970 --> 02:03:44,099
Um, but I think a lot of the experiences

3713
02:03:44,099 --> 02:03:45,900
that developers are making for mixed

3714
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:48,140
reality of basically you just have a kind

3715
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:49,240
of a hologram that you're putting in the

3716
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:51,299
world will hopefully apply once we,

3717
02:03:51,299 --> 02:03:53,630
once we get the, the AR glasses too.

3718
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:55,610
Now that's got its own whole set of challenges.

3719
02:03:55,610 --> 02:03:57,849
And it's, um,

3720
02:03:57,849 --> 02:03:58,330
Well, the headset is already smaller

3721
02:03:58,330 --> 02:04:00,030
than the previous version.

3722
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:01,760
Oh yeah, it's 40% thinner.

3723
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:04,140
And the other thing that I think

3724
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:05,969
mixed reality was the first big thing.

3725
02:04:05,969 --> 02:04:10,170
The second is it's just a great VR headset.

3726
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:11,389
It's, I mean, it's got two X,

3727
02:04:11,389 --> 02:04:13,460
the graphics processing power,

3728
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:15,960
um, 40% sharper screens,

3729
02:04:21,010 --> 02:04:22,559
know, if you liked quest two,

3730
02:04:22,559 --> 02:04:24,187
I think that this is just going to be, you know, it's

3731
02:04:24,187 --> 02:04:25,940
like all this, all the content that you might have played

3732
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:28,050
in quest two is just going to be sharper automatically

3733
02:04:28,050 --> 02:04:29,080
and look better in this.

3734
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:31,746
So it's, um, I think people are really going to like it.

3735
02:04:31,746 --> 02:04:33,363
Yeah.

3736
02:04:33,363 --> 02:04:34,290
So this fall,

3737
02:04:34,290 --> 02:04:38,190
This fall, I have to ask Apple just announced

3738
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:40,349
a mixed reality headset called

3739
02:04:40,349 --> 02:04:45,349
Vision Pro for $3,500 available in early 2024.

3740
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:47,269
What do you think about this headset?

3741
02:04:48,969 --> 02:04:51,830
Well, I saw the materials, um, when they launched,

3742
02:04:51,830 --> 02:04:53,110
I, I haven't gotten a chance

3743
02:04:53,110 --> 02:04:55,620
to play with it yet.

3744
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:56,179
So, so, so kind of take everything with a grain of salt,

3745
02:04:56,179 --> 02:04:58,610
but a few high level

3746
02:04:58,610 --> 02:05:02,780
thoughts, I mean, first, um, you know,

3747
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:06,540
I do think that this is a certain level

3748
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:10,860
of validation for the category right where, you know,

3749
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:13,220
we were the primary folks

3750
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:14,740
out there before saying,

3751
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:17,710
Hey, I think that this, you know, virtual reality,

3752
02:05:17,710 --> 02:05:19,030
augmented reality, mixed reality,

3753
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:20,389
this is going to be a big part

3754
02:05:20,389 --> 02:05:22,190
of the next computing platform.

3755
02:05:22,190 --> 02:05:26,700
Um, I think having Apple come in and share that vision,

3756
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:32,150
um, we'll make a lot

3757
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:33,280
of people who are fans

3758
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:36,730
of their products, um, really consider that.

3759
02:05:36,730 --> 02:05:41,730
Um, and then, you know, of course, the, the $3,500 price,

3760
02:05:42,029 --> 02:05:44,610
um, you know, on the one hand,

3761
02:05:44,610 --> 02:05:45,850
I get it for with all the stuff

3762
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:47,240
that they're trying to pack in there.

3763
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:49,180
On the other hand, a lot of people aren't going to find

3764
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:51,330
that to be affordable.

3765
02:05:51,330 --> 02:05:53,030
So I think that there's a chance that,

3766
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:54,990
that them coming in actually increases

3767
02:05:54,990 --> 02:05:57,130
demand, um, for the overall spac

3768
02:05:57,130 --> 02:05:59,920
e and that quest three is actually the primary

3769
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,640
beneficiary of that because a lot of the people

3770
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:04,840
who might say, Hey, you know,

3771
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:06,800
this, uh, I think I'm going to

3772
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,220
give another consideration to this

3773
02:06:08,220 --> 02:06:10,380
or, you know, now I understand maybe

3774
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:12,889
what mixed reality is more and in quest three is

3775
02:06:12,889 --> 02:06:16,359
the best one on the market that I can, that I can afford.

3776
02:06:16,359 --> 02:06:18,169
Um, and it's great also, right?

3777
02:06:18,169 --> 02:06:20,400
It's, I think that that's, um, and, you know,

3778
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:21,610
in our own way, I think we're,

3779
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:22,650
and there are a lot of features

3780
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:24,470
that we have where we're leading on.

3781
02:06:24,470 --> 02:06:27,179
Um, so I think that that's, that,

3782
02:06:27,179 --> 02:06:29,080
that I think is going to be a very,

3783
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:30,250
that could be quite good.

3784
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:33,150
Um, and then obviously over time,

3785
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:34,679
the companies are just focused on,

3786
02:06:35,629 --> 02:06:37,010
somewhat different things, right?

3787
02:06:37,010 --> 02:06:39,750
Apple has always, um, you know,

3788
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:43,740
I think focused on building really kind of high

3789
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:47,959
end things, whereas our focus has been on,

3790
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:52,050
it's just, we have a more

3791
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:53,019
democratic ethos.

3792
02:06:53,019 --> 02:06:53,860
We want to build things that are accessible

3793
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:55,640
to a wider number of people.

3794
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,760
Um, you know, we've sold tens of millions

3795
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:00,450
of quest devices.

3796
02:07:00,450 --> 02:07:05,120
Um, my understanding, just based on rumors,

3797
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:06,120
I don't have any special knowledge

3798
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:09,540
on this is that Apple is building about 1 million of their,

3799
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:11,720
of their device.

3800
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:12,189
Right.

3801
02:07:12,189 --> 02:07:13,530
So just in terms of like what you kind of expect

3802
02:07:13,530 --> 02:07:15,340
in terms of sales numbers.

3803
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:18,920
Um, I, I just think that this is,

3804
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:21,719
I mean, quest is going to be the primary

3805
02:07:21,719 --> 02:07:25,120
thing that people in the market will continue using

3806
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:27,209
for the foreseeable future.

3807
02:07:27,209 --> 02:07:28,879
it's up to the companies to see how,

3808
02:07:28,879 --> 02:07:30,490
how well we've executed the different things

3809
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:32,060
that we're doing, but we kind of

3810
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:33,090
come at it from different places.

3811
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:36,320
We're very focused on social interaction,

3812
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:40,940
communication, um, being more active, right?

3813
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:44,099
So there's fitness, there's gaming, there are those things.

3814
02:07:44,099 --> 02:07:46,730
Um, you know, whereas I think a lot of the use cases

3815
02:07:46,730 --> 02:07:49,770
that you saw in, um, in, in

3816
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:52,080
Apple's launch material were more around, you know,

3817
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:53,950
people sitting, um, you know,

3818
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:56,950
people looking at screens, um, which are great.

3819
02:07:56,950 --> 02:07:59,440
I think that you will replace your laptop over time

3820
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:00,780
with, with a, with a headset.

3821
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:02,309
But, um, but I think in terms

3822
02:08:02,309 --> 02:08:05,049
of kind of how the different use cases that the

3823
02:08:05,049 --> 02:08:07,490
companies are going after, um,

3824
02:08:07,490 --> 02:08:08,780
they're, they're, they're, they're a bit different

3825
02:08:08,780 --> 02:08:10,350
for, for, for where we are right now.

3826
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:11,830
Yeah.

3827
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:13,750
So their gaming wasn't a big part of the presentation,

3828
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:15,210
which is an interesting,

3829
02:08:16,389 --> 02:08:20,860
it feels like mixed reality gaming, such a big part of that.

3830
02:08:22,209 --> 02:08:24,449
It was interesting to see it missing in the presentation.

3831
02:08:24,449 --> 02:08:27,100
Well, I mean, look, there are certain design trade-offs

3832
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:29,780
in this where, you know,

3833
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:32,020
they only made this point about

3834
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:33,480
not wanting to have controllers,

3835
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:35,170
which on the one

3836
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:37,059
hand, there's a certain elegance about just being able

3837
02:08:37,059 --> 02:08:38,470
to navigate the system

3838
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:41,140
with eye gaze and hand tracking.

3839
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:42,170
And by the way, you're,

3840
02:08:42,170 --> 02:08:44,380
you'll be able to just navigate quest with, with your

3841
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:45,970
hands too, if that's what you want.

3842
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:47,410
Um, yeah, one of the things I

3843
02:08:47,410 --> 02:08:50,980
should mention is the capability

3844
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:54,120
from the cameras to, uh, with computer vision

3845
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:56,190
to detect certain aspects of the hand,

3846
02:08:56,190 --> 02:08:57,400
allowing you to have a controller

3847
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:58,990
that doesn't have that ring thing.

3848
02:08:58,990 --> 02:09:00,719
Yeah.

3849
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:01,570
The hand tracking in quest three and the,

3850
02:09:01,570 --> 02:09:03,510
and the tracking is, is a big step

3851
02:09:03,510 --> 02:09:05,890
up from, from the last generation.

3852
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:09,770
Um, and one of the demos that we have is basically

3853
02:09:09,770 --> 02:09:11,240
an MR experience teaching you

3854
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:13,590
how to play piano, where it basically highlights the notes

3855
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:15,230
that you need to

3856
02:09:15,230 --> 02:09:16,910
play and it's like just all its hands, it's no controllers.

3857
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:18,780
But I think if you care

3858
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:22,990
about gaming, having a controller allows you to

3859
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:27,410
have a more tactile feel and allows you to capture

3860
02:09:28,830 --> 02:09:31,690
fine motor movement much more precisely

3861
02:09:33,339 --> 02:09:35,519
than what you can do

3862
02:09:35,519 --> 02:09:37,499
that you're touching.

3863
02:09:37,499 --> 02:09:38,520
So again, I think it's, there, there are certain question

3864
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:39,900
s which are just around

3865
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:42,410
what use cases are you optimizing for?

3866
02:09:42,410 --> 02:09:45,800
Um, I think if you want to play games,

3867
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:47,469
then I think that that, that I think

3868
02:09:47,469 --> 02:09:48,790
you want, you, you want to design

3869
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:50,280
the system in a different way

3870
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,374
and, and we're

3871
02:09:52,374 --> 02:09:53,920
more focused on, on kind of social experiences,

3872
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,650
entertainment experiences.

3873
02:09:55,650 --> 02:09:59,760
Um, whereas if, if what you want is to make sure

3874
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:02,090
that the text that you read

3875
02:10:02,090 --> 02:10:04,630
on a screen is as crisp as possible,

3876
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:07,080
then you need to make the, the design

3877
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:09,559
and cost trade-offs that they made that,

3878
02:10:09,559 --> 02:10:12,389
that lead you to making a $3,500 device.

3879
02:10:12,389 --> 02:10:14,720
So I think that there is a use case for that for sure.

3880
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:17,710
But I just think that they're, they've, the company is,

3881
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:19,730
we've basically

3882
02:10:19,730 --> 02:10:20,679
made different design trade-offs to,

3883
02:10:20,679 --> 02:10:24,580
to get to, um, the use cases that we're trying to serve.

3884
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:26,710
There's a lot of other stuff I

3885
02:10:26,710 --> 02:10:28,349
would love to talk to you about,

3886
02:10:29,549 --> 02:10:31,900
about the metaverse, especially the Kodak avatar, uh,

3887
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:33,240
which I've gotten to experience

3888
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:34,570
a lot of different variations

3889
02:10:34,570 --> 02:10:37,490
of recently that I'm really, really excited about.

3890
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:38,880
Yeah, I'm excited to talk about that too.

3891
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:43,480
I'll, I'll have to wait a little bit because well,

3892
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:47,179
I think there's a

3893
02:10:47,179 --> 02:10:47,600
lot more to show off in that regard.

3894
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:49,440
Uh, but let me step back to AI.

3895
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,860
I think we've mentioned it a little bit,

3896
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:55,690
but I'd like to linger on this question

3897
02:10:55,690 --> 02:10:59,420
that, uh, folks, folks like Elias or Yadkowski has to worry

3898
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:01,980
about, uh, and others

3899
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:04,690
of the existential, the serious threats of A

3900
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:07,100
I that have been reinvigorated now

3901
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,580
with the rapid developments of AI systems.

3902
02:11:09,580 --> 02:11:14,140
Uh, do you worry about the existential risks of AI as Elias

3903
02:11:15,630 --> 02:11:16,940
or does about the

3904
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:20,660
alignment problem about this getting out of hand?

3905
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:23,150
Anytime where there's a number of serious people

3906
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:25,470
who are raising a concern

3907
02:11:25,470 --> 02:11:27,500
that is that existential

3908
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:29,210
about something that you're involved with, I think

3909
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:30,810
you have to think about it.

3910
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:32,240
Right.

3911
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:33,760
So I've spent quite a bit of time thinking

3912
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,490
about it from that perspective.

3913
02:11:35,490 --> 02:11:40,160
Um, the thing that, that I were,

3914
02:11:41,070 --> 02:11:42,570
where I basically have come out on this for

3915
02:11:42,570 --> 02:11:46,340
now is I, I do think that there are, over time,

3916
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:48,730
I think that we need to think

3917
02:11:48,730 --> 02:11:51,230
about this even more as we, as we approach something that,

3918
02:11:51,230 --> 02:11:53,090
you know, could be closer to superintelligence.

3919
02:11:53,090 --> 02:11:54,719
I just think it's pretty clear to anyone

3920
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:56,679
working on these projects today that

3921
02:11:56,679 --> 02:11:58,270
we're, that we're not there.

3922
02:11:58,270 --> 02:12:02,850
Um, and one of my concerns is that we, we, we, we spend

3923
02:12:02,850 --> 02:12:04,760
a fair amount of time

3924
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:08,120
on this before, but there are more, um,

3925
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,759
I don't know if mundane is the right word,

3926
02:12:11,759 --> 02:12:15,000
but there's like concerns that already exist right

3927
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,779
about like people using AI

3928
02:12:17,779 --> 02:12:19,990
tools to do harmful things of the

3929
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:21,150
type that we're already aware,

3930
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:23,870
whether, youknow, we talked about fraud or scams

3931
02:12:23,870 --> 02:12:25,630
or different things like that.

3932
02:12:25,630 --> 02:12:30,059
Um, and that's going to be a pretty big set of challenges

3933
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:33,749
that the companies

3934
02:12:33,749 --> 02:12:36,740
with regardless of whether there

3935
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:38,270
is an existential concern as

3936
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:40,120
well at some point down the road.

3937
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:44,080
So I do worry that to some degree you can,

3938
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:48,020
people can get a little too focused

3939
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:52,770
on, on some of the tail risk and then not do as good

3940
02:12:52,770 --> 02:12:54,970
of a job as we need to on

3941
02:12:54,970 --> 02:12:58,250
the things that you are, can be almost certain are going

3942
02:12:58,250 --> 02:13:00,280
to come down the

3943
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:01,750
pipe as, um, as, as real risks

3944
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:03,880
that, that, that, that kind of manifest themselves

3945
02:13:03,880 --> 02:13:05,329
in the near term.

3946
02:13:05,329 --> 02:13:07,679
So for me, I've, I've spent most of my time

3947
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:11,320
on that once I kind of made the

3948
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:14,160
realization that the size of models

3949
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:15,610
that we're talking about now in terms of

3950
02:13:15,610 --> 02:13:17,860
what we're building are, are just quite far

3951
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:19,460
from the superintelligence type

3952
02:13:19,460 --> 02:13:22,260
concerns that, um, that, that people raise,

3953
02:13:22,260 --> 02:13:23,410
but, but I think once we get a

3954
02:13:23,410 --> 02:13:25,849
couple of steps closer to that, um,

3955
02:13:25,849 --> 02:13:27,400
I know as we do get closer, I think that

3956
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:30,900
those, you know, there are going to be some novel,

3957
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:33,660
um, risks and issues about

3958
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:36,770
how we make sure that the systems are safe for sure.

3959
02:13:36,770 --> 02:13:38,530
I guess here, just to take the conversation

3960
02:13:38,530 --> 02:13:40,960
in a somewhat different

3961
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:44,110
direction, I think in some of these debates around safety,

3962
02:13:45,790 --> 02:13:47,339
I think the

3963
02:13:47,339 --> 02:13:50,549
concepts of intelligence and autonomy,

3964
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:54,530
or like the, the, the being of the

3965
02:13:54,530 --> 02:13:57,840
thing, um, you know, as an analogy,

3966
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,730
they get kind of conflated together.

3967
02:13:59,730 --> 02:14:03,460
And I think it very well could be the case

3968
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:04,949
that you can make something and

3969
02:14:04,949 --> 02:14:07,240
scale intelligence quite far,

3970
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:12,030
but that, that may not manifest the safety

3971
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:16,500
concerns that people are saying in the sense that

3972
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:17,510
, I mean, just if you, if you

3973
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:19,009
look at human biology, it's like, all right,

3974
02:14:19,009 --> 02:14:20,500
we have our neocortex is where

3975
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:23,170
all the, the thinking happens, right?

3976
02:14:23,170 --> 02:14:25,770
And it's, but, but it's not really calling the shot

3977
02:14:25,770 --> 02:14:27,990
s at the end of the day.

3978
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:30,719
We have a much more, you know, primitive old brain structur

3979
02:14:30,719 --> 02:14:32,040
e for which our

3980
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:34,190
neocortex, which is this powerful machinery

3981
02:14:34,190 --> 02:14:36,300
is basically just a kind of

3982
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:40,430
prediction and reasoning engine to help it kind of like

3983
02:14:40,430 --> 02:14:42,290
our, our very simple brain.

3984
02:14:42,290 --> 02:14:47,240
Um, decide how to plan and do what it needs to do in order

3985
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:51,059
to achieve these

3986
02:14:51,059 --> 02:14:52,450
like very kind of basic impulses.

3987
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:55,370
And I think that you can think about some

3988
02:14:55,370 --> 02:14:59,059
of the development of intelligence

3989
02:14:59,059 --> 02:15:01,240
along the same lines where just like

3990
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:04,520
our neocortex doesn't have free will or autonomy.

3991
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:08,460
Um, we might develop these wildly intelligent systems

3992
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:10,620
that are much more

3993
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:13,620
intelligent than our neocortex have much more capacity,

3994
02:15:13,620 --> 02:15:14,679
but are, you know, the

3995
02:15:14,679 --> 02:15:17,150
same way that our neocortex is sort of subservient

3996
02:15:17,150 --> 02:15:19,360
and is used as a tool by our,

3997
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:22,180
our kind of simple impulse brain.

3998
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:24,930
It's, um, you know, I think that it's not out

3999
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:27,590
of the question that very

4000
02:15:27,590 --> 02:15:29,510
that have the capacity to think we'll, we'll kind of

4001
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:31,570
act as that is sort of an extension

4002
02:15:31,570 --> 02:15:33,700
of, of, of the neocortex doing that.

4003
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:37,560
So I think my, my own view is that where we really need

4004
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:39,380
to be careful is on

4005
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:42,690
the development of autonomy

4006
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:44,349
and how we think about that.

4007
02:15:44,349 --> 02:15:49,320
Because, um, it's actually the case that relatively simple

4008
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,290
and unintelligent

4009
02:15:51,290 --> 02:15:52,420
things that have runaway autonomy

4010
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:54,630
and just spread themselves or, you know,

4011
02:15:54,630 --> 02:15:55,860
it's like, we have a word for that.

4012
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:57,030
It's a virus, right?

4013
02:15:57,030 --> 02:15:59,590
It's, I mean, like it's, can be simple computer code

4014
02:15:59,590 --> 02:16:01,780
that is not particularly

4015
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:03,400
intelligent, but just spreads itself and does a lot of harm,

4016
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:05,950
um, biologically or

4017
02:16:05,950 --> 02:16:09,940
computer and, um, I just think that these

4018
02:16:11,140 --> 02:16:13,010
are somewhat separable things.

4019
02:16:13,010 --> 02:16:15,820
And a lot of what I think we need to develop

4020
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:17,980
when people talk about

4021
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:19,860
safety and responsibility is really the governance

4022
02:16:19,860 --> 02:16:21,910
on the autonomy that can be

4023
02:16:21,910 --> 02:16:23,860
given to, to systems.

4024
02:16:23,860 --> 02:16:26,880
And to me, if, you know, if I were, you know,

4025
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,680
a policymaker is, or think about

4026
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:31,570
this, I would really want to think about that distinction

4027
02:16:31,570 --> 02:16:32,750
between these where I

4028
02:16:32,750 --> 02:16:35,110
think building intelligent systems will be

4029
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:37,110
, can create a huge advance in terms

4030
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:38,750
of people's quality of life

4031
02:16:38,750 --> 02:16:42,388
and productivity growth in the economy.

4032
02:16:42,388 --> 02:16:44,040
But it's the, the autonomy part

4033
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:47,170
of this that I think we really need to make

4034
02:16:47,170 --> 02:16:50,110
progress on how to govern these things responsibly

4035
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:53,160
before we build the

4036
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:56,610
capacity for them to make a lot of decisions on their own

4037
02:16:56,610 --> 02:16:57,820
or, or give them

4038
02:16:57,820 --> 02:17:00,349
goals or things like that.

4039
02:17:00,349 --> 02:17:01,969
And I know that that's a research problem,

4040
02:17:01,969 --> 02:17:03,150
but I do think that to some degree

4041
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:06,930
these are, are somewhat, are somewhat separable things.

4042
02:17:06,930 --> 02:17:08,879
I love the distinction between intelligence

4043
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:12,059
and autonomy and, and the metaphor within your cortex.

4044
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,839
Let me ask about power.

4045
02:17:16,879 --> 02:17:20,009
So, uh, building superintelligence systems,

4046
02:17:20,009 --> 02:17:22,180
even if it's not in the near term, I

4047
02:17:22,180 --> 02:17:25,549
think meta as is one of the few companies,

4048
02:17:25,549 --> 02:17:28,730
if not the main company that will

4049
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:31,370
develop the superintelligence system

4050
02:17:31,370 --> 02:17:33,709
and you are a man who's at the head of this

4051
02:17:33,709 --> 02:17:36,480
company, building AGI might make you

4052
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:37,959
the most powerful man in the world.

4053
02:17:37,959 --> 02:17:40,058
Do you worry that that power will corrupt you?

4054
02:17:42,709 --> 02:17:45,240
What a question.

4055
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:47,989
Um, I mean, look, I think realistically this gets back

4056
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:51,530
to the open source

4057
02:17:51,530 --> 02:17:51,849
things that we talked about before,

4058
02:17:51,849 --> 02:17:55,350
which is I don't think that the world will

4059
02:17:55,350 --> 02:17:59,889
be best served by any small number of organizations

4060
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:06,200
having this without it being

4061
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:09,240
something that is more broadly available.

4062
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:10,830
And I think if you look through history,

4063
02:18:12,830 --> 02:18:14,570
it's when there are these sort of like

4064
02:18:14,570 --> 02:18:17,910
unipolar advances and things that,

4065
02:18:17,910 --> 02:18:19,730
and like power imbalances that they're,

4066
02:18:19,730 --> 02:18:23,959
they're, they're doing to being kind of weird situations.

4067
02:18:23,959 --> 02:18:27,388
So this is one of the reasons why I think open sources is,

4068
02:18:27,388 --> 02:18:31,549
is generally the right approach.

4069
02:18:31,549 --> 02:18:33,119
And, you know, I think it's a,

4070
02:18:33,119 --> 02:18:34,920
it's a categorically different question today when

4071
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:36,870
we're not close to superintelligence,

4072
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:38,100
I think that there's a good chance that even

4073
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:40,160
once we get closer to superintelligence,

4074
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:42,160
open sourcing remains the right approach,

4075
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,519
even though I think at that point

4076
02:18:44,519 --> 02:18:44,718
it's a somewhat different debate.

4077
02:18:44,718 --> 02:18:49,170
Um, but I think part of that is that that is, you know,

4078
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:51,580
I think one of the best

4079
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:53,209
ways to ensure that the system is as secure

4080
02:18:53,209 --> 02:18:54,379
and safe as possible, because

4081
02:18:54,379 --> 02:18:57,209
it's not just about a lot of people having access to it.

4082
02:18:57,209 --> 02:19:00,500
It's the scrutiny that, that, that kind of comes with being,

4083
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:02,888
with building an open

4084
02:19:02,888 --> 02:19:04,280
this is a pretty widely accepted

4085
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:06,820
thing about open

4086
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:08,790
sources that, um, you know, you have the code out there

4087
02:19:08,790 --> 02:19:10,830
so anyone can see the

4088
02:19:10,830 --> 02:19:12,020
vulnerabilities, um, anyone can,

4089
02:19:12,020 --> 02:19:13,940
can kind of mess with it in different ways.

4090
02:19:13,940 --> 02:19:15,540
People can spin off their own projects

4091
02:19:15,540 --> 02:19:17,000
and an experiment in a ton of different

4092
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,888
ways.

4093
02:19:18,888 --> 02:19:20,850
And the net result of all of that is that the systems

4094
02:19:20,850 --> 02:19:22,849
just get hardened and get

4095
02:19:22,849 --> 02:19:25,020
to be a lot safer and more secure.

4096
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:29,440
Um, so I think that there's a chance that that ends up

4097
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:32,740
being the way that this

4098
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:36,940
goes to a pretty good chance and that having this be open,

4099
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:40,599
both leads to a

4100
02:19:40,599 --> 02:19:43,150
healthier development of the technology

4101
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:45,629
and also leads to a more balanced,

4102
02:19:45,629 --> 02:19:50,020
um, distribution of the technology in a way that,

4103
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:51,780
that strike me as good values

4104
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:54,550
to aspire to.

4105
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:56,010
So to you, the risks, there's risks to open sourcing,

4106
02:19:56,010 --> 02:19:58,470
but the benefits

4107
02:19:58,470 --> 02:20:00,110
outweigh the risks at, at the two, it's interesting.

4108
02:20:00,110 --> 02:20:04,300
I think the way you put it, uh, you put it well,

4109
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:05,940
that there's a different

4110
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:08,260
discussion now than when we get closer

4111
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:10,880
to the, uh, to development of super

4112
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:15,480
intelligence of, of the benefits and risks of open sourcing.

4113
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:17,460
Yeah.

4114
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:17,880
And to be clear, I, I feel quite confident

4115
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:19,940
in the assessment that open sourcing

4116
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:23,420
models now is net positive.

4117
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:26,290
I think there's a good argument that in the future,

4118
02:20:26,290 --> 02:20:27,400
it will be two, even as you

4119
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:28,790
get closer to super intelligence,

4120
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:31,170
but I've not, I'm, I've certainly have not

4121
02:20:31,170 --> 02:20:32,280
decided on that yet.

4122
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:34,490
And I think that it becomes a somewhat more complex set

4123
02:20:34,490 --> 02:20:35,960
of questions that I

4124
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:37,340
think people will have time to debate

4125
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:39,570
and will also be informed by what happens

4126
02:20:39,570 --> 02:20:41,660
between now and then and to make those decisions.

4127
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:43,370
We don't have to necessarily just

4128
02:20:43,370 --> 02:20:44,860
debate that in theory right now.

4129
02:20:44,860 --> 02:20:47,590
Uh, what year do you think we'll have a super intelligence?

4130
02:20:50,110 --> 02:20:51,609
I don't know.

4131
02:20:51,609 --> 02:20:52,150
I mean, that's pure speculation.

4132
02:20:52,150 --> 02:20:54,099
I think it's, uh, I think it's

4133
02:20:54,099 --> 02:20:55,359
very clear to take a step back

4134
02:20:55,359 --> 02:20:57,100
that we had a big

4135
02:20:57,100 --> 02:20:57,520
breakthrough in the last year, right?

4136
02:20:57,520 --> 02:20:59,670
Where the, the LLMs and diffusion

4137
02:20:59,670 --> 02:21:01,610
models basically reached a,

4138
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:04,130
a scale where

4139
02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:05,369
they're able to do some, some pretty interesting things.

4140
02:21:05,369 --> 02:21:06,670
And then I think the question is what happens

4141
02:21:06,670 --> 02:21:08,520
from here and just to paint

4142
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:13,072
the two extremes on the, um, on, on one side, it's like,

4143
02:21:15,172 --> 02:21:16,370
okay, we just had one

4144
02:21:16,370 --> 02:21:18,489
breakthrough.

4145
02:21:18,489 --> 02:21:19,400
If we just have like another breakthrough like that,

4146
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:20,840
or maybe two, then we

4147
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:23,280
can have something that's truly crazy, right?

4148
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:28,220
And, and is like, is, um, just like so much more advanced

4149
02:21:28,220 --> 02:21:30,860
and, and on, on that

4150
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:31,920
side of the argument, it's like, okay,

4151
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:36,030
well, maybe we're, um, and maybe we're

4152
02:21:36,030 --> 02:21:38,160
only a couple of big steps away

4153
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:41,070
from, uh, from, from, from reaching something

4154
02:21:41,070 --> 02:21:43,360
that looks more like general intelligence.

4155
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:44,860
Okay.

4156
02:21:44,860 --> 02:21:45,840
That's one, that's one side of the argument.

4157
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,780
And the other side,

4158
02:21:47,780 --> 02:21:49,360
which is what we've historically seen a lot more is that a

4159
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:53,740
breakthrough leads to, um, you know, in that

4160
02:21:54,990 --> 02:21:56,860
, in that Gartner hype cycle, there's

4161
02:21:56,860 --> 02:21:59,250
like the hype and then there's the trough

4162
02:21:59,250 --> 02:22:01,400
of disillusionment after when like

4163
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:02,890
people think that there's a chance that,

4164
02:22:02,890 --> 02:22:04,690
Hey, okay, there's a big breakthrough.

4165
02:22:04,690 --> 02:22:06,069
Maybe we're about to get another big breakthrough.

4166
02:22:06,069 --> 02:22:07,700
And it's like, actually, you're not about to get

4167
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:09,960
another breakthrough.

4168
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:10,800
You're, maybe you're actually just going to have to sit

4169
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,379
with this one for a while.

4170
02:22:12,379 --> 02:22:16,170
And, um, and you know, it could be,

4171
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:18,770
it could be five years, it could be 10 years.

4172
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:21,500
It could be 15 years until you figure out

4173
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:24,130
the, um, the kind of the next big thing

4174
02:22:24,130 --> 02:22:25,679
that needs to get figured out.

4175
02:22:25,679 --> 02:22:28,530
And, um, but I think that the fact that we just

4176
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:31,199
had this breakthrough sort of

4177
02:22:31,199 --> 02:22:32,810
makes it's that we're at a point

4178
02:22:32,810 --> 02:22:36,020
of almost a very wide error bars on what happens

4179
02:22:36,020 --> 02:22:37,980
next.

4180
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:38,270
Yeah.

4181
02:22:38,270 --> 02:22:39,680
Um, I think the traditional technical view,

4182
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:43,440
like looking at the industry would

4183
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:44,770
suggest that we're not just going

4184
02:22:44,770 --> 02:22:47,770
to stack in a like breakthrough on top of

4185
02:22:47,770 --> 02:22:49,120
breakthrough on top of breakthrough,

4186
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:52,320
like every six months or something right now.

4187
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:55,468
I think it will, I'm guessing, I would guess that it will,

4188
02:22:55,468 --> 02:22:57,509
that it will take

4189
02:22:57,509 --> 02:22:57,969
somewhat longer in between these,

4190
02:22:57,969 --> 02:23:02,120
but, um, I don't know, I tend to be pretty

4191
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:03,480
optimistic about breakthroughs too.

4192
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:04,680
So I mean, so I think if you,

4193
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:07,340
if you, if you normalized for, for my normal optimism,

4194
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:09,170
then, then maybe it would be even,

4195
02:23:09,170 --> 02:23:10,350
even slower than what I'm saying.

4196
02:23:10,350 --> 02:23:11,550
But, but even within that,

4197
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:14,530
like I'm not even opining on the question of how many

4198
02:23:14,530 --> 02:23:16,700
breakthroughs are required to get to general intelligence

4199
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:18,990
because no one knows.

4200
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:23,670
But this particular breakthrough was so such a small step

4201
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:24,770
that resulted in such

4202
02:23:24,770 --> 02:23:28,950
a big leap in performance as experienced

4203
02:23:28,950 --> 02:23:31,540
by human beings that it makes you think,

4204
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:35,530
wow, are we, as we stumble across this very open

4205
02:23:35,530 --> 02:23:37,780
world of research,

4206
02:23:37,780 --> 02:23:41,670
will we stumble, um, across another thing

4207
02:23:41,670 --> 02:23:43,860
that will have a giant leap in performance.

4208
02:23:45,910 --> 02:23:48,970
And, um, also we don't know exactly

4209
02:23:48,970 --> 02:23:51,360
at which stage is it really going to be

4210
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:54,380
impressive because it feels like it's really encroaching

4211
02:23:54,380 --> 02:23:56,120
on impressive levels

4212
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:58,030
of intelligence.

4213
02:23:58,030 --> 02:23:59,750
You still didn't answer the question

4214
02:23:59,750 --> 02:24:01,470
of what year we're going to have super

4215
02:24:01,470 --> 02:24:03,560
intelligence.

4216
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:03,730
I'd like to hold you to that.

4217
02:24:03,730 --> 02:24:05,929
No, I'm just kidding.

4218
02:24:05,929 --> 02:24:06,710
But is there something you can say

4219
02:24:06,710 --> 02:24:10,080
about the timeline as you think about the

4220
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:14,020
development of, um, AGI superintelligence systems?

4221
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:17,040
Sure.

4222
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:19,400
So I, I still don't think I have any particular insight

4223
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:20,930
on when like a singular

4224
02:24:20,930 --> 02:24:24,180
AI system that is a general intelligence will get created.

4225
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:26,210
But I think the one thing that most people

4226
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:28,570
in the discourse that I've seen

4227
02:24:28,570 --> 02:24:29,770
about this haven't really grappled

4228
02:24:29,770 --> 02:24:32,350
with is that we do seem to have.

4229
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,619
Organize organizations and, you know,

4230
02:24:36,619 --> 02:24:38,220
structures in the world that exhibit

4231
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:40,220
greater than human intelligence already.

4232
02:24:40,220 --> 02:24:43,630
So, you know, one example is, you know,

4233
02:24:43,630 --> 02:24:45,130
a company, you know, it acts as an

4234
02:24:45,130 --> 02:24:48,059
entity, it has, you know, a singular brand.

4235
02:24:48,059 --> 02:24:50,940
Um, obviously it's a collection of people,

4236
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:52,900
but I, I certainly hope that, you

4237
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:54,440
know, meta with tens of thousands

4238
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:57,030
of people make smarter decisions than one

4239
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:58,910
person, but I think that that would be pretty bad

4240
02:24:58,910 --> 02:25:00,940
if it didn't.

4241
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:04,230
Um, another example that I think is even more removed

4242
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:07,040
from kind of the way we

4243
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:08,839
think about like the personification

4244
02:25:08,839 --> 02:25:11,560
of, of, um, of intelligence, which is often

4245
02:25:11,560 --> 02:25:13,800
implied in some of these questions is think

4246
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:15,700
about something like the stock market

4247
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:17,570
where the stock market is, you know,

4248
02:25:17,570 --> 02:25:19,550
it takes inputs, it's a distributed system.

4249
02:25:19,550 --> 02:25:23,679
It's like the cybernetic organism that, you know,

4250
02:25:23,679 --> 02:25:24,889
probably millions of people

4251
02:25:24,889 --> 02:25:28,500
around the world are basically voting every day

4252
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:30,820
by choosing what to invest in.

4253
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:34,930
But it's basically this, this organism

4254
02:25:34,930 --> 02:25:38,490
or structure that is smarter than any

4255
02:25:38,490 --> 02:25:42,349
individual that we use to allocate capital

4256
02:25:42,349 --> 02:25:43,790
as efficiently as possible around the

4257
02:25:43,790 --> 02:25:45,390
world.

4258
02:25:45,390 --> 02:25:49,370
And I, I do think that this notion

4259
02:25:50,570 --> 02:25:52,710
that there are already these cybernetic

4260
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:57,990
systems that are either melding the intelligence

4261
02:25:59,190 --> 02:26:00,420
of multiple people together

4262
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:02,939
or melding the intelligence of multiple people

4263
02:26:02,939 --> 02:26:04,090
and technology together

4264
02:26:05,650 --> 02:26:08,540
to form something which is dramatically

4265
02:26:08,540 --> 02:26:11,130
more intelligent than any individual on the,

4266
02:26:11,130 --> 02:26:15,590
in the world, um, is something that seems to exist

4267
02:26:17,389 --> 02:26:18,880
and that we seem to be able to

4268
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:23,720
harness in a productive way for our society as long

4269
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:25,140
as we basically build these structures

4270
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:26,700
and balance with each other.

4271
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:28,790
Um, so I don't know.

4272
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:31,680
I mean, that, that at least gives me hope

4273
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:33,370
that as we advance the technology,

4274
02:26:33,370 --> 02:26:35,170
and I don't know how long exactly it's going to be, but

4275
02:26:35,170 --> 02:26:37,020
you asked when is this going to exist?

4276
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:38,680
I think to some degree we already have

4277
02:26:39,549 --> 02:26:41,030
many organizations in the world

4278
02:26:41,030 --> 02:26:42,880
that are smarter than a single human.

4279
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:44,450
And, and that seems to be something

4280
02:26:44,450 --> 02:26:46,900
that is generally productive in advancing humanity.

4281
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:50,220
And somehow the individual AI systems empower

4282
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:52,300
the individual humans and the interaction between

4283
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:56,110
those humans to make that collective intelligence machinery

4284
02:26:56,110 --> 02:26:57,860
that you're referring to smarter.

4285
02:26:57,860 --> 02:27:00,570
So it's not like AI is becoming super intelligent.

4286
02:27:00,570 --> 02:27:02,560
It's just becoming the, uh,

4287
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:04,950
the engine that's making the collective intelligence

4288
02:27:04,950 --> 02:27:07,070
is primarily human, more intelligent.

4289
02:27:08,190 --> 02:27:09,650
Yeah.

4290
02:27:09,650 --> 02:27:10,730
It's, it's educating the humans better.

4291
02:27:10,730 --> 02:27:12,880
It's making them better informed.

4292
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:14,460
It's, um,

4293
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:17,260
making it more efficient for them to communicate effectively

4294
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:19,060
and debate ideas.

4295
02:27:19,060 --> 02:27:20,490
And through that process,

4296
02:27:20,490 --> 02:27:22,560
just making the whole collective intelligence more

4297
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:24,309
and more and more

4298
02:27:24,309 --> 02:27:27,010
intelligent, maybe faster than the individual AI systems

4299
02:27:27,010 --> 02:27:29,309
that are trained on human data anyway,

4300
02:27:29,309 --> 02:27:32,070
are becoming maybe the collective intelligence

4301
02:27:32,070 --> 02:27:34,429
and human species might outpace the development of AI.

4302
02:27:34,429 --> 02:27:38,380
I think there's a balance in here because I mean,

4303
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:39,810
if, if like, you know,

4304
02:27:39,810 --> 02:27:41,339
if a lot of the input that,

4305
02:27:42,559 --> 02:27:43,860
that the systems are being trained

4306
02:27:43,860 --> 02:27:45,800
on is basically coming from

4307
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:47,730
feedback from people,

4308
02:27:47,730 --> 02:27:49,680
then a lot of the development does

4309
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:51,710
need to happen in human time, right?

4310
02:27:51,710 --> 02:27:52,999
It's,

4311
02:27:52,999 --> 02:27:55,220
it's not like a machine will just be able

4312
02:27:55,220 --> 02:27:57,820
to go learn all the stuff about, about how people think

4313
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:59,460
about stuff.

4314
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:01,010
There's, there's a cycle to how this needs to work.

4315
02:28:01,010 --> 02:28:03,240
This is an exciting world

4316
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:04,700
we're living in.

4317
02:28:04,700 --> 02:28:07,540
And then you're at the forefront of developing.

4318
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:09,599
One of the ways you keep yourself humble,

4319
02:28:09,599 --> 02:28:11,600
like we mentioned with Jiu Jitsu,

4320
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:14,470
is doing some really difficult challenges,

4321
02:28:14,470 --> 02:28:16,200
mental and physical.

4322
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:18,230
One of those you've done

4323
02:28:18,230 --> 02:28:21,559
very recently is the Murph challenge

4324
02:28:21,559 --> 02:28:22,980
. And you got a really good time.

4325
02:28:22,980 --> 02:28:24,860
It's 100 pull-ups, 200

4326
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:25,670
push-ups, 300 squats,

4327
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:28,920
and a mile before and a mile around after.

4328
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:32,430
You got under 40 minutes on that.

4329
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:35,870
What was the hardest part?

4330
02:28:35,870 --> 02:28:37,460
I think a lot of people were very impressed.

4331
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:38,620
It's very impressive time.

4332
02:28:39,889 --> 02:28:41,619
Yeah.

4333
02:28:41,619 --> 02:28:41,846
I was, I was pretty happy.

4334
02:28:41,846 --> 02:28:43,408
How crazy are you?

4335
02:28:43,408 --> 02:28:43,990
It was the question.

4336
02:28:43,990 --> 02:28:45,010
It wasn't my best time,

4337
02:28:45,010 --> 02:28:47,480
but, but I, anything under 40 minutes, I'm happy with.

4338
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:48,860
Yeah.

4339
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:50,699
It wasn't your best time.

4340
02:28:50,699 --> 02:28:52,480
No, I think, I think I've done it a little faster before,

4341
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:54,500
but not much.

4342
02:28:54,500 --> 02:28:56,120
I mean, it's, and, and of my friends,

4343
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:58,170
I did not win on Memorial Day.

4344
02:28:58,170 --> 02:29:00,240
One of my friends

4345
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:01,110
did it actually several minutes faster than me.

4346
02:29:02,009 --> 02:29:04,190
But just to clear up one thing that I think was,

4347
02:29:05,129 --> 02:29:06,960
I saw a bunch of questions about this on the internet.

4348
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:08,580
There are multiple ways to do,

4349
02:29:08,580 --> 02:29:09,580
to do the Murph challenge.

4350
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:12,120
There's a kind of partitioned mode

4351
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:14,830
where you do sets of pull-ups,

4352
02:29:14,830 --> 02:29:17,650
push-ups, and squats together.

4353
02:29:17,650 --> 02:29:19,510
And then there's unpartitioned

4354
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:19,980
where you do the 100 pull-ups,

4355
02:29:21,349 --> 02:29:22,670
and then the 200 push-ups, and

4356
02:29:22,670 --> 02:29:25,810
then the 300 squats in cereal.

4357
02:29:25,810 --> 02:29:28,000
And obviously, if you're,

4358
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,229
you know, if you're doing them

4359
02:29:29,229 --> 02:29:31,060
unpartitioned, then, you know,

4360
02:29:31,060 --> 02:29:33,530
it takes longer to get through

4361
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:33,690
the 100 pull-ups because you, you know,

4362
02:29:33,690 --> 02:29:35,950
anytime you're resting in between the pull-ups, you're not

4363
02:29:35,950 --> 02:29:38,080
also doing push-ups and, and squats.

4364
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:39,570
So, so yeah, so my, my, I'm sure

4365
02:29:39,570 --> 02:29:41,100
my unpartition time would be,

4366
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:42,400
would be quite a bit slower,

4367
02:29:42,400 --> 02:29:45,119
but, but no, I think at the end of this,

4368
02:29:48,269 --> 02:29:49,570
I don't know, first of all, I think it's a good way

4369
02:29:49,570 --> 02:29:50,960
to honor Memorial Day, right?

4370
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:53,059
It's, you know,

4371
02:29:53,059 --> 02:29:56,620
it's this Lieutenant Murphy, basically, this is one of,

4372
02:29:58,120 --> 02:29:59,969
this was one of his favorite

4373
02:29:59,969 --> 02:30:02,140
exercises, and I just try to do it on,

4374
02:30:02,140 --> 02:30:05,560
on Memorial Day each year, and it's a good workout.

4375
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:09,099
I got my older daughters to do it with me this time.

4376
02:30:09,099 --> 02:30:13,000
They, my oldest daughter wants a weight vest

4377
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,160
because she sees me doing it with a weight vest.

4378
02:30:15,160 --> 02:30:16,920
I don't know if a seven-year-old should be using

4379
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:20,730
a weight vest to do pull-ups, but, but, um...

4380
02:30:20,730 --> 02:30:23,240
The difficult question a parent must ask themselves,

4381
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:24,970
yes.

4382
02:30:24,970 --> 02:30:25,680
I was like, maybe I can make you a very light weight vest,

4383
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:26,860
but, but I, I didn't think it was

4384
02:30:26,860 --> 02:30:28,660
good for this.

4385
02:30:28,660 --> 02:30:29,070
So she, she basically did a quarter, Murph,

4386
02:30:29,070 --> 02:30:31,070
so she ran a quarter mile,

4387
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:34,279
and then did, you know, 25 pull-ups, 50 push-ups,

4388
02:30:34,279 --> 02:30:38,230
and, and 75 air squats, then ran another quarter

4389
02:30:38,230 --> 02:30:41,070
mile, and like, in 15 minutes,

4390
02:30:41,070 --> 02:30:43,020
which I was pretty impressed by, um,

4391
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:44,920
and, and my, my five-year-old too,

4392
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:48,380
so I, so I, I was excited about that,

4393
02:30:48,380 --> 02:30:50,759
and I, I'm, I'm glad that I'm teaching them

4394
02:30:50,759 --> 02:30:54,739
kind of the value of, of, of physicality, right?

4395
02:30:54,739 --> 02:30:57,660
I think a, a good day for Max, my daughter,

4396
02:30:57,660 --> 02:30:59,410
is when she gets to like, go to the gym with me

4397
02:30:59,410 --> 02:31:02,970
and cranks out a bunch of pull-ups, and I, I, I love

4398
02:31:02,970 --> 02:31:05,310
that about her.

4399
02:31:05,310 --> 02:31:06,050
I mean, I think it's, it's like, good, she's, you know,

4400
02:31:06,050 --> 02:31:07,390
um, hopefully I'm teaching

4401
02:31:07,390 --> 02:31:09,040
her some good lessons, but...

4402
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:10,720
I mean, the, the broader question

4403
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:12,529
here is, um, given how busy you

4404
02:31:12,529 --> 02:31:14,860
are, given how much stuff you have going on in your life,

4405
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:19,440
what's, um, what's like the perfect

4406
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:23,349
exercise regimen for you to, uh, to keep yourself happy,

4407
02:31:25,400 --> 02:31:27,710
to, uh, keep yourself productive in your

4408
02:31:27,710 --> 02:31:30,069
main line of work?

4409
02:31:30,069 --> 02:31:31,330
Yeah, so I mean, I've, right now,

4410
02:31:31,330 --> 02:31:35,630
I'm focused most of my workouts on, on fighting,

4411
02:31:35,630 --> 02:31:39,844
so, so Jiu Jitsu and MMA, um, but I don't know.

4412
02:31:42,270 --> 02:31:43,960
I mean, maybe if you're a professional, you can

4413
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:45,567
do that every day, I can't, I just can't.

4414
02:31:45,567 --> 02:31:47,639
you know, it's too many,

4415
02:31:47,639 --> 02:31:48,679
too many bruises and things

4416
02:31:48,679 --> 02:31:50,720
that you need to recover from.

4417
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:51,140
So I do that, you know,

4418
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:53,270
three to four times a week.

4419
02:31:53,270 --> 02:31:55,560
And then, and then the other day is,

4420
02:31:56,720 --> 02:31:57,950
I just try to do a mix of things,

4421
02:31:57,950 --> 02:31:59,530
like just cardio conditioning,

4422
02:31:59,530 --> 02:32:01,280
strength building, mobility.

4423
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:02,620
So you try to do

4424
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:04,170
something physical every day?

4425
02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:06,070
Yeah, I try to, unless I'm just so tired

4426
02:32:06,070 --> 02:32:08,530
that I just need to, need to relax.

4427
02:32:08,530 --> 02:32:09,660
But then I'll still try to like go

4428
02:32:09,660 --> 02:32:11,739
for a walk or something.

4429
02:32:11,739 --> 02:32:13,770
I mean, even here, I don't know,

4430
02:32:13,770 --> 02:32:14,910
have you been on the roof here yet?

4431
02:32:14,910 --> 02:32:16,370
No.

4432
02:32:16,370 --> 02:32:16,930
We'll go on the roof after this.

4433
02:32:16,930 --> 02:32:18,530
But it's like, we designed this building

4434
02:32:18,530 --> 02:32:20,460
and I put a park on the roof.

4435
02:32:20,460 --> 02:32:22,320
So that way, that's like my meetings

4436
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:24,199
when I'm just doing kind of a one-on-one

4437
02:32:24,199 --> 02:32:25,230
or talking to a couple of people.

4438
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:27,990
I have a very hard time just sitting.

4439
02:32:27,990 --> 02:32:29,590
I feel like you get super stiff.

4440
02:32:29,590 --> 02:32:30,940
It like feels really bad.

4441
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:35,470
But I don't know, being physical

4442
02:32:35,470 --> 02:32:37,540
is very important to me.

4443
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:39,099
I think it's, I do not believe,

4444
02:32:39,099 --> 02:32:40,389
this gets to the question about AI.

4445
02:32:40,389 --> 02:32:42,199
I don't think

4446
02:32:42,199 --> 02:32:43,930
that a being is just a mind.

4447
02:32:43,930 --> 02:32:46,600
And I think we're kind of meant

4448
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:48,550
to do things

4449
02:32:48,550 --> 02:32:50,100
and like physically

4450
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:52,170
and a lot of the sensations

4451
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:55,580
that we feel are connected to that.

4452
02:32:55,580 --> 02:32:57,920
And I think that that's a lot

4453
02:32:57,920 --> 02:32:58,529
of what makes you a human

4454
02:32:58,529 --> 02:33:00,880
is basically having those,

4455
02:33:01,770 --> 02:33:04,620
having that set of sensations

4456
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:08,170
and experiences around that

4457
02:33:08,170 --> 02:33:09,200
coupled with a mind

4458
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:10,259
to reason about them.

4459
02:33:11,880 --> 02:33:13,400
But I don't know,

4460
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:16,389
I think it's important for balance

4461
02:33:17,770 --> 02:33:18,960
to kind of get out,

4462
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:20,510
challenge yourself in different ways,

4463
02:33:20,510 --> 02:33:22,590
learn different skills, clear your mind.

4464
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:26,160
Do you think AI in order

4465
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:27,510
to become super intelligent

4466
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:28,829
and AGI should have a body?

4467
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:35,379
It depends on what the goal is.

4468
02:33:35,379 --> 02:33:38,150
I think that there's this assumption

4469
02:33:38,150 --> 02:33:40,290
in that question

4470
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:42,150
that intelligence should

4471
02:33:42,150 --> 02:33:44,270
be kind of person-like.

4472
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:46,870
Whereas, as we were just talking about,

4473
02:33:48,860 --> 02:33:50,810
you can have these greater

4474
02:33:50,810 --> 02:33:52,950
than single human

4475
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:54,810
like the stock market,

4476
02:33:54,810 --> 02:33:56,300
which obviously do not have bodies

4477
02:33:56,300 --> 02:33:57,950
and do not speak a language, right?

4478
02:33:57,950 --> 02:34:02,950
And just kind of have their own system.

4479
02:34:03,550 --> 02:34:06,670
But so I don't know,

4480
02:34:06,670 --> 02:34:09,110
my guess is there will be limits

4481
02:34:09,110 --> 02:34:12,250
to what a system that is purely in intelligence

4482
02:34:12,250 --> 02:34:15,060
can understand about the human condition

4483
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:17,060
without having the same,

4484
02:34:17,060 --> 02:34:18,090
not just senses,

4485
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:21,210
but like our body's changes

4486
02:34:21,210 --> 02:34:22,630
we get older, right?

4487
02:34:22,630 --> 02:34:24,099
And we kind of evolve

4488
02:34:24,099 --> 02:34:27,650
and let those very subtle

4489
02:34:29,080 --> 02:34:32,370
physical changes just drive a lot

4490
02:34:32,370 --> 02:34:33,440
of social patterns

4491
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:35,560
and behavior around like

4492
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:37,330
when you choose to have kids, right?

4493
02:34:38,480 --> 02:34:40,389
That's not even subtle,

4494
02:34:40,389 --> 02:34:41,670
that's a major one, right?

4495
02:34:41,670 --> 02:34:42,330
But like how you design things

4496
02:34:42,330 --> 02:34:44,109
around the house.

4497
02:34:44,109 --> 02:34:47,889
So yeah, I think if the goal

4498
02:34:47,889 --> 02:34:50,150
is to understand people

4499
02:34:50,150 --> 02:34:50,770
as much as possible, I think that that's

4500
02:34:52,950 --> 02:34:54,330
trying to model those sensations

4501
02:34:54,330 --> 02:34:55,570
is probably somewhat important,

4502
02:34:55,570 --> 02:34:57,300
but I think that there's a lot of value

4503
02:34:57,300 --> 02:34:59,240
that can be created

4504
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:00,529
by having intelligence,

4505
02:35:00,529 --> 02:35:00,559
even that is separate

4506
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:02,520
from that is a separate thing.

4507
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:04,620
So one of the features of being human

4508
02:35:04,620 --> 02:35:07,420
is that we're mortal, we die.

4509
02:35:08,310 --> 02:35:09,860
We've talked about AI a lot,

4510
02:35:10,710 --> 02:35:13,250
but potentially replicas of ourselves.

4511
02:35:13,250 --> 02:35:15,600
Do you think there will be AI replicas

4512
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:17,690
of you and me

4513
02:35:17,690 --> 02:35:18,880
that persist long after we're gone,

4514
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:21,650
that family and loved ones can talk to?

4515
02:35:24,619 --> 02:35:26,120
I think we'll have the capacity

4516
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:27,340
to do something like that.

4517
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:29,130
And I think one of the big questions

4518
02:35:30,410 --> 02:35:32,470
that we've had to struggle

4519
02:35:32,470 --> 02:35:34,919
with in the context

4520
02:35:34,919 --> 02:35:36,050
of social networks is who gets

4521
02:35:36,050 --> 02:35:38,060
to make that?

4522
02:35:38,060 --> 02:35:41,459
And my answer to that in the context

4523
02:35:41,459 --> 02:35:42,719
of the work

4524
02:35:42,719 --> 02:35:43,740
that we're doing is that should be your choice.

4525
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:46,420
I don't think anyone should be able to choose

4526
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:47,640
to make a Lex spot

4527
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:52,130
that people can choose to talk to

4528
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:54,180
and get to train that.

4529
02:35:54,180 --> 02:35:55,410
And we have this precedent

4530
02:35:55,410 --> 02:35:56,650
of making some of these calls

4531
02:35:56,650 --> 02:36:00,090
where someone can create a page

4532
02:36:00,090 --> 02:36:03,420
for a Lex fan club

4533
02:36:03,420 --> 02:36:04,880
but you can't create a page

4534
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:06,960
and say that you're a Lex, right?

4535
02:36:08,650 --> 02:36:11,280
So I think that similarly, I think,

4536
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:14,450
I mean, maybe someone maybe can make a,

4537
02:36:14,450 --> 02:36:15,509
should be able to make an AI

4538
02:36:15,509 --> 02:36:17,539
that's a Lex admirer

4539
02:36:17,539 --> 02:36:19,969
that someone can talk to,

4540
02:36:19,969 --> 02:36:21,640
be your call

4541
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:23,720
whether there is a Lex AI.

4542
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:26,599
Well, I'm open sourcing the Lex.

4543
02:36:29,210 --> 02:36:31,279
So you're a man of faith.

4544
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:34,299
What role has faith played in your life

4545
02:36:34,299 --> 02:36:35,590
and your understanding of the world

4546
02:36:35,590 --> 02:36:37,940
and your understanding of your own life

4547
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:41,180
and your understanding of your work

4548
02:36:41,180 --> 02:36:44,430
and how did your work impacts the world?

4549
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:48,814
Yeah, I think that

4550
02:36:48,814 --> 02:36:48,840
there's a few different parts of this

4551
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:51,880
that are relevant.

4552
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,569
There's sort of a philosophical part

4553
02:36:53,569 --> 02:36:55,590
and there's a cultural part.

4554
02:36:55,590 --> 02:36:58,710
And one of the most basic lessons

4555
02:36:58,710 --> 02:37:01,110
is right at the beginning of Genesis, right?

4556
02:37:01,110 --> 02:37:02,889
It's like God creates

4557
02:37:02,889 --> 02:37:04,470
the earth and creates people

4558
02:37:04,470 --> 02:37:06,930
and creates people in God's image.

4559
02:37:06,930 --> 02:37:08,130
And there's the question of,

4560
02:37:09,009 --> 02:37:11,230
what does that mean?

4561
02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:12,190
that you have about God

4562
02:37:12,190 --> 02:37:13,340
at that point in the Old Testament

4563
02:37:13,340 --> 02:37:15,660
is that God has created things.

4564
02:37:15,660 --> 02:37:17,400
So I always thought that one

4565
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:18,410
of the interesting lessons

4566
02:37:18,410 --> 02:37:21,980
from that is that there's a virtue

4567
02:37:21,980 --> 02:37:23,340
in creating things

4568
02:37:24,370 --> 02:37:27,070
that is like whether it's artistic

4569
02:37:27,070 --> 02:37:30,000
or whether you're building things

4570
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,180
that are functionally useful

4571
02:37:31,180 --> 02:37:34,420
for other people.

4572
02:37:34,420 --> 02:37:39,420
I think that that by itself is a good.

4573
02:37:39,540 --> 02:37:43,560
And that kind of drives a lot

4574
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:46,400
of how I think about morality

4575
02:37:46,400 --> 02:37:49,170
and my personal philosophy around

4576
02:37:49,170 --> 02:37:50,740
like what is a good life?

4577
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:53,910
I think it's one

4578
02:37:53,910 --> 02:37:56,690
where you're helping the people around you

4579
02:37:56,690 --> 02:37:59,960
and you're being a kind

4580
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:01,660
of positive creative force

4581
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:03,339
in the world that is helping

4582
02:38:03,339 --> 02:38:05,210
to bring new things

4583
02:38:05,210 --> 02:38:07,519
into the world,

4584
02:38:07,519 --> 02:38:09,570
whether they're amazing other people, kids,

4585
02:38:09,570 --> 02:38:14,129
or just leading to the creation

4586
02:38:15,030 --> 02:38:16,970
of different things

4587
02:38:16,970 --> 02:38:17,150
that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.

4588
02:38:17,150 --> 02:38:18,790
And so that's a value

4589
02:38:18,790 --> 02:38:20,620
for me that matters deeply.

4590
02:38:20,620 --> 02:38:23,669
And I just love spending time

4591
02:38:23,669 --> 02:38:25,269
with the kids

4592
02:38:25,269 --> 02:38:25,810
and seeing that they sort of,

4593
02:38:25,810 --> 02:38:27,820
trying to impart this value to them.

4594
02:38:27,820 --> 02:38:30,610
And it's like, I mean,

4595
02:38:30,610 --> 02:38:31,880
nothing makes me happier than like

4596
02:38:31,880 --> 02:38:34,030
when I come home from work

4597
02:38:34,030 --> 02:38:37,200
and I see like my daughters

4598
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:39,020
like building Legos on the table or something.

4599
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:41,140
It's like, all right,

4600
02:38:41,140 --> 02:38:41,590
I did that when I was a kid,

4601
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:43,279
so many other people were doing this.

4602
02:38:43,279 --> 02:38:45,340
And like, I hope you don't lose that spirit

4603
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:46,910
where when you kind of grow up

4604
02:38:46,910 --> 02:38:48,170
and you wanna just continue

4605
02:38:48,170 --> 02:38:49,820
building different things

4606
02:38:49,820 --> 02:38:53,140
no matter what it is, to me,

4607
02:38:53,140 --> 02:38:54,140
that's a lot of what matters.

4608
02:38:55,309 --> 02:38:56,320
That's the philosophical piece.

4609
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:58,510
I think the cultural piece

4610
02:38:58,510 --> 02:39:01,110
and values and that part of things,

4611
02:39:01,110 --> 02:39:02,840
I think has just

4612
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:05,220
since I've had kids.

4613
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:06,370
You know, it's almost autopilot

4614
02:39:06,370 --> 02:39:08,330
when you're a kid,

4615
02:39:08,330 --> 02:39:09,750
you're in the kind of getting imparted

4616
02:39:09,750 --> 02:39:10,990
to phase of your life,

4617
02:39:10,990 --> 02:39:14,240
but, and I didn't really think about religion

4618
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:16,620
that much for a while, you know,

4619
02:39:16,620 --> 02:39:18,610
I was in college,

4620
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:20,980
you know, before I had kids

4621
02:39:20,980 --> 02:39:22,880
and then I think having kids

4622
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:25,590
has this way of really making you think

4623
02:39:25,590 --> 02:39:27,300
about what traditions you want to impart

4624
02:39:28,179 --> 02:39:30,000
and how you want to celebrate

4625
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,510
and like what balance you want in your life.

4626
02:39:34,510 --> 02:39:35,889
And I mean,

4627
02:39:35,889 --> 02:39:38,220
a bunch of the questions

4628
02:39:38,220 --> 02:39:38,520
that you've asked

4629
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:39,440
and a bunch of the things

4630
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:43,640
Just the irony of the curtains coming down

4631
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:46,809
as we're talking about mortality.

4632
02:39:46,809 --> 02:39:49,389
Once again, same as last time,

4633
02:39:49,389 --> 02:39:52,879
this is just, the universe works in,

4634
02:39:52,879 --> 02:39:53,920
we are definitely living

4635
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:55,790
in a simulation,

4636
02:39:55,790 --> 02:39:57,680
but go ahead on community tradition

4637
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:59,800
and the values, the faith

4638
02:39:59,800 --> 02:40:02,089
and religion is still.

4639
02:40:02,089 --> 02:40:02,360
A lot of the topics

4640
02:40:02,360 --> 02:40:03,130
that we've talked about today

4641
02:40:03,130 --> 02:40:07,940
are around how do you balance, you know,

4642
02:40:09,740 --> 02:40:11,549
whether it's running a company

4643
02:40:11,549 --> 02:40:13,970
or different responsibilities with this,

4644
02:40:16,280 --> 02:40:18,000
I don't know, yeah,

4645
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:18,940
how do you kind of balance that?

4646
02:40:18,940 --> 02:40:20,990
And I always also just think

4647
02:40:20,990 --> 02:40:23,429
that it's very grounding

4648
02:40:23,429 --> 02:40:25,940
to just believe that there is something

4649
02:40:25,940 --> 02:40:28,260
that is much bigger

4650
02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:28,340
than you that is guiding things.

4651
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:33,320
That amongst other things gives you

4652
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:34,320
a bit of humility.

4653
02:40:35,460 --> 02:40:39,700
As you pursue that spirit

4654
02:40:40,650 --> 02:40:41,949
of creating these,

4655
02:40:41,949 --> 02:40:43,420
that you spoke to creating beauty

4656
02:40:43,420 --> 02:40:45,590
in the world.

4657
02:40:45,590 --> 02:40:45,700
As Dostoevsky said,

4658
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:47,219
beauty will save the world.

4659
02:40:48,299 --> 02:40:50,380
Mark, I'm a huge fan of yours.

4660
02:40:51,550 --> 02:40:53,290
Honored to be able to call you a friend

4661
02:40:53,290 --> 02:40:58,020
and I am looking forward to both kicking your ass

4662
02:40:58,020 --> 02:40:59,140
and you kicking my ass

4663
02:40:59,140 --> 02:41:00,840
on the mat tomorrow in Jiu-Jitsu.

4664
02:41:02,549 --> 02:41:03,600
This incredible sport

4665
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:06,900
and art that we both participate in.

4666
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:08,200
Thank you so much for talking to me.

4667
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:09,510
Thank you for everything you're doing

4668
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:11,220
in so many exciting realms

4669
02:41:11,220 --> 02:41:14,000
of technology and human life.

4670
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,330
I can't wait to talk to you again

4671
02:41:15,330 --> 02:41:17,240
in the metaverse.

4672
02:41:17,240 --> 02:41:18,099
Thank you.

4673
02:41:18,099 --> 02:41:20,040
Thanks for listening

4674
02:41:20,040 --> 02:41:20,920
to this conversation

4675
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:21,580
with Mark Zuckerberg.

4676
02:41:21,580 --> 02:41:22,150

4679
02:41:25,150 --> 02:41:26,560
And now let me leave you

4680
02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:28,210
with some words from Isaac Asimov.

4681
02:41:29,170 --> 02:41:31,910
It is change, continuing change,

4682
02:41:31,910 --> 02:41:33,670
inevitable change

4683
02:41:33,670 --> 02:41:34,850
that is the dominant factor

4684
02:41:34,850 --> 02:41:36,019
in society today.

4685
02:41:37,090 --> 02:41:38,240
No sensible decision

4686
02:41:38,240 --> 02:41:40,090
can be made any longer

4687
02:41:40,090 --> 02:41:41,719
without taking into account not

4688
02:41:41,719 --> 02:41:43,720
only the world as it is,

4689
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:45,610
but the world as it will be.

4690
02:41:46,990 --> 02:41:49,030
Thank you for listening

4691
02:41:49,030 --> 02:41:49,670
and hope to see you next time.
