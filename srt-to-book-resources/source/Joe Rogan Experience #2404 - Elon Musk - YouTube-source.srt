 >> um

51
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,479
 >> but

52
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,119

53
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:25,680
 >> wow.

54
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,159
 >> um so >> like like he's a pretty unique looking individual.

55
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,360
 >> i think we can achieve this.

56
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,159
 that guy right there, that's a real guy.

62
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,600
 that's fake.

63
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,119
 that's got that uncanny valley feel to it, doesn't it?

64
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,640
 >> it's it's not impossible.

65
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,799
 >> no, no, it's not impossible to achieve,

66
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,560
 but it's not it's not possible to maintain that kind of leanness.

67

74
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,280

 like that's achievable.

83
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,319
 but there's a few of those

84

 and tucker, and i was like, we should probably just talk about this on the air

151
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,280
 because it is one of the craziest interviews i think i've ever seen in my life.

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,280
 but his parents think he was murdered.

167
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,840
 >> yeah.

168
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,280
 >> um the wires to a security camera were cut.

169
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
 um >> blood in two rooms.

170
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,600
 >> blood in two rooms.

171
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,960
 someone else's wig was in the room.

172
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
 and >> someone else's wig.

173
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,880
 >> wig.

174
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,520
 >> wig.

175
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,919
 yes.

176
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,199
 not his wig.

177
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,440
 >> not normal to have a wig laying around.

178
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,160
 >> yes.

179
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
 um and

180
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
 um and he ordered door dash right before allegedly committing suicide.

181
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
 >> uh which is it seems unusual, you know?

182
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,520
 >> yeah.

183
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,479
 >> it's like, you know, let's

184
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,000
 i'm going to order pizza on second thoughts,

185
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,199
 i'll kill myself.

186
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,440
 is it seems like that's a very rapid change in mindset.

187
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,240
 >> it's very weird.

188
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,520
 and especially the parents have they they don't believe he committed suicide at all.

189
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,800
 >> has no note or anything.

190
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,199
 >> no.

191
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,600
 >> yeah.

192
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,880
 >> it seems pretty [ __ ] up.

193
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,520
 and you know, the idea that a whistleblower

194
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,639
 for an enormous

195
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,720
 ai company that's worth billions of dollars might get whacked,

196
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
 that's not outside the pale.

197
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
 >> i mean, it's straight out of a movie.

198
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,880
 >> right out of a movie, but right out of a movie is real sometimes.

199
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,120
 >> yeah.

200
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,680
 right.

201
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
 exactly.

202
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
 >> it's a little weird that i i think they should do a proper investigation.

203
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,840
 like, what's the downside on that proper investigation?

204
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,720
 >> right.

205
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,199
 >> no.

206
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
 >> yeah, >> for sure.

207
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,199
 but the whole exchange is so bizarre.

208
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,440
 >> yeah.

209
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,479
 yeah.

210
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,560
 sam alman's reaction to being accused of murder is bizarre.

211
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,639
 >> look, i don't know if he's guilty, but it's not possible to look more guilty.

212
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,600
 >> so, i'm like, >> or look more weird.

213
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,080
 >> yeah.

214
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
 >> you know, maybe it's just his social thing.

215
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,400
 like, maybe he's just odd with confrontation and it just goes blank, you know?

216
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,360
 but if if somebody was accusing me of killing jamie,

217
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,639
 like if jamie was a whistleblower

218
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,600
 and jamie got whacked

219
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,720
 and then i'd be like, "wait,

220
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
 what are you

221
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,479
 what are you

222
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:56,960
 are you accusing

223
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,440
 me of killing

224
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,840
 my friend?"

225
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,039
 like, "what the [ __ ] are you talking about?"

226
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,599
 i would i

227
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,080
 would be

228
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
 a little bit more

229
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,800
 i rate.

230
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,039
 >> yeah.

231
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:03,360
 yeah.

232
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,759
 exactly.

233
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,120
 you know, it would be >> i would be a little upset.

234
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,840
 >> yeah.

235
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,880
 it'd be like well, you'd be like, you'd certainly in insist on a thorough investigation.

236
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,199
 yeah.

237
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
 >> as opposed to trying to sweep it under the rug.

238
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,280
 >> yeah.

239
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,639
 i wouldn't assume that he got that he committed suicide.

240
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,840
 i would be suspicious.

241
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,319
 if tucker

242
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,360
 was telling me that aspect

243
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,000
 of the story,

244
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,319
 i'd

245
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:22,720
 be like,

246
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,039
 "that

247
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,080
 does seem like a murder.

248
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
 [ __ ] we should look into this."

249
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,280
 >> i mean, all signs point to it being a murder.

250
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,800
 not not saying, you know, tim molvin had anything to do with the murder, but

251
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,759
 >> blood in two rooms.

252
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,120
 >> it's blood in two rooms.

253
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,919
 like,

254
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,039
 yeah, there's

255
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
 the wires to the security camera and the door dash being ordered right before suicide.

256
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,360
 no suicide note.

257
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,319
 his parents think he was murdered and

258
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,479
 um the people that i know who knew him said he was not suicidal.

259
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,919
 so i'm like this why would you jump to the conclusion >> parents

260
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,360
 sued the >> uh landlord?

261
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
 >> they sued the son's landlord

262
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,680
 alleged

263
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,599
 the owners and the managers of their son's san francisco

264
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:57,919
 apartment

265
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,039
 building were part of a widespread

266
00:07:59,039 --> 00:07:59,919
 cover up of his death.

267
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,120
 >> the landlord >> yeah.

268
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
 there's a bunch of weird they said there was like packages missing from the building.

269
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
 some people said they saw packages still being delivered and all a sudden they all disappeared.

270
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,879
 >> huh.

271
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,000
 but that could be people steal people's packages all the time.

272
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,599
 >> the porch pirate situation.

273
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,080
 >> yeah.

274
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,560
 >> yeah.

275
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,319
 >> says they failed to safeguard.

276
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,560
 >> also, i mean, the amount of trauma

277
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,599
 those poor parents have gone through with their son dying like that.

278
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,720
 i mean, it must >> god bless them.

279
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,919
 and how could they stay sane after something like that?

280
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,479
 they're probably they're so griefstricken.

281
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,640
 who knows what they believe at this point.

282
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,599
 >> yeah.

283
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
 it should have asked if epson killed himself.

284
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,039
 yeah, that's the the cash mattel thing.

285
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,560
 cash mattel dan bonino trying to convince everybody of that.

286
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
 like, okay.

287
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,959
 >> the guards weren't there and the cameras stopped working and

288
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,640
 um >> you know, >> the guards were asleep.

289
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
 the cameras weren't working.

290
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,839
 he had a a giant

291
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,480
 steroided

292
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,279
 up bodybuilder

293
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,399
 guy that he was sharing a cell with that was a murderer

294
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,240
 who was a bad cop.

295
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
 like, all of it's kind of nuts.

296
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
 all of it's kind of nuts

297
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,080
 like that he would just kill himself rather than reveal all of his billionaire friends.

298
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,720
 >> yeah.

299
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
 >> and then >> did you see tim dylan talking to chris cuomo about this?

300
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,040
 >> i did.

301
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,760
 he liked the idea.

302
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,720
 >> chris cromo just looked so stupid.

303
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,959
 >> tim just listed off all the >> tim just

304
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,640
 and he's like i agree it is strange.

305
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,959
 like of course it's strange chris.

306
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,160
 jesus christ.

307
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,880
 you can't just go with the tide.

308
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
 you got to think things through.

309
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,760
 and if you think that one through, you're like, i don't think he killed himself.

310
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,800
 nobody does.

311
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,560
 you'd have to work for an intelligence agency to think he killed himself.

312
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,040
 >> it does.

313
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
 it does seem unlikely.

314
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,120
 >> it seems highly unlikely.

315
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
 highly, highly unlikely.

316
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
 all roads point to murder.

317
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,920
 >> yes.

318
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,800
 >> point to they had to get rid of him because he knew too much.

319
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,519
 whatever the [ __ ] he was doing, whatever kind of an asset he was, whatever

320
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,440
 thing he was up to,

321
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
 you know, was apparently very effective.

322
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,760
 >> yes.

323
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,320
 and a lot of people are compromised.

324
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
 you see, your boy bill gates is now saying climate change is not a big deal.

325
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,519
 like, relax everybody.

326
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,680
 i know i scared the [ __ ] out of you for the last decade

327
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
 and a half, but

328
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,440
 ah, we're going to be fine.

329
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,519
 >> yeah.

330
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,839
 i mean,

331
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:20,880
 you know, as was

332
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,519
 i was saying just before coming into the studio with, you know,

333
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,519
 it like every day there's some crazy

334
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,040
 wild new thing that's happening.

335
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,519
 it's it feels like reality is accelerating.

336
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,560
 >> it's every day.

337
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,079
 and every day it's like more and more

338
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,839
 ridiculous to the point where the simulation is more and more undeniable.

339
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,000
 >> yeah.

340
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,320
 yeah.

341
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,920
 it really feels like simulation, you know?

342
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,959
 it's like, come on.

343
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,480
 what are the odds that this could be the case?

344
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,200
 >> are you paying attention at all to three atlas?

345
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,120
 are you watching the >> the comet?

346
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,519
 >> yeah.

347
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,959
 whatever it is.

348
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,279
 >> yeah.

349
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,519
 yeah.

350
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,640
 i mean, i mean, one thing i can say is like, look, i

351
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,880
 if if i was aware of any evidence of aliens,

352
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,079
 um, you joe, you have my word.

353
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,760
 i will come on your show and i will reveal it on the show.

354
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,240
 >> okay.

355
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,519
 >> yeah, >> that's a good deal.

356
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,160
 >> yeah, it's pretty good.

357
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,560
 >> i'll believe you.

358
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,920
 yeah, thank you.

359
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,160
 >> i i'll stick i keep my you know, keep my promises.

360
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,800
 so,

361
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,839
 um >> all right.

362
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,880
 i'll hold you to that.

363
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,200
 >> yeah.

364
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,760
 yeah.

365
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,959
 and and i'm never committing suicide to be clear.

366
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,920
 >> i don't think you would either.

367
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,320
 >> so, on camera, guys, i am never committing suicide ever.

368
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,000
 >> if someone says you committed suicide, i will fight tooth and nail.

369
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,959
 >> i will fight tooth and nail.

370
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,399
 i will i will not believe it.

371
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,160
 i will not believe it.

372
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,000
 the thing about the three eye atlas is it's >> a hell of a name actually.

373
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,880
 >> yeah, it's a third eye sounds like third eye or something.

374
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,320
 >> yeah, it does.

375
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,839
 three eye is third.

376
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,720
 it's only the third interstellar object that's detected.

377
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,360
 >> okay.

378
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,839
 >> yeah.

379
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,720
 obias.

380
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,680
 >> yeah.

381
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,160
 alo was on the podcast a couple days ago talking about it.

382
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,120
 >> yeah.

383
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,760
 it could be.

384
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,160
 i don't know.

385
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,760
 but i >> apparently today they're saying that it's changed course.

386
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,959
 um, >> did you see that, jamie?

387
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,320
 >> avi said something today.

388
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,680
 i'll send it to you.

389
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,040
 um, >> uh, i know it's on reddit.

390
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:09,760
 >> here you go, jamie.

391
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,600
 i'll send it to you right now.

392
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
 um, it's fascinating.

393
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,680
 it's fascinating also because it's made almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is.

394
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,399
 and the only way that exists, uh, here is, uh, industrial alloys apparently.

395
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,800
 um

396
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,880
 um most no there are there are

397
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,480
 >> there are definitely comets that and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel in fact.

398
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:30,800
 yeah.

399
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,120
 so the the places where

400
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,800
 um you mine nickel on earth is actually where there was an asteroid

401
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,600
 or comet that hit earth that was a nickel rich

402
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,959
 you know

403
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,680
 >> nickel rich nickel rich rich deposit.

404
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,279
 >> yeah that's that's that's it's coming.

405
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,959
 those are from impacts.

406
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,160
 you definitely didn't want to be there at the time because anything would have been obliterated.

407
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,480
 right.

408
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
 um, but that's that's where the the sources of nickel and cobalt are these days.

409
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,200
 >> so, this is ovio lope.

410
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,360
 a few hours ago, the first hint of non-gravitational

411
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,160
 acceleration that something other than gravity is affecting its acceleration, meaning something is affecting

412
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
 its trajectory beyond gravity was indicated.

413
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,360
 interesting.

414
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,600
 um

415
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,839
 so it's mostly nickel very little iron which

416
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,120
 he was saying is on earth only exists in alloys

417
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,200
 but whatever you know you're dealing with another planet >> there this there are

418
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,680
 there are there are cases where there's very nickel richch asteroids meteorites that heavy

419
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,399
 that

420
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,279
 something from space.

421
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,200
 >> yeah it it's only yeah it doesn't mean

422
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,760
 it'll

423
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,720
 be a very sort of heavy spaceship if you make it all out of nickel.

424
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
 oh yeah.

425
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,120
 >> and [ __ ] huge.

426
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,959
 the size of manhattan and all nickel.

427
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,000
 that's kind of nuts.

428
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
 >> yeah, that's a heavy spaceship.

429
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
 >> that's a real problem if it hits.

430
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,079
 >> uh yes.

431
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,720
 no, it would like obliterate a continent type of thing.

432
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
 >> um maybe maybe worse.

433
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,800
 >> probably kill most of human life.

434
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,320
 >> um >> if not all of us.

435
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
 >> i haven't depends on what the the total mass is.

436
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,120
 but

437
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,160
 um there's i mean the thing is like in the fossil record there are

438
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,480
 um you know there's like arguably arguably five major extinction events.

439
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,160
 um like the biggest one of which is the perine extinction where

440
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
 um almost all life was eliminated.

441
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,720
 that that actually occurred over several million several million years.

442
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,560
 um the there's the jurassic.

443
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,959
 i think jurassic is i think that one's pretty definitively an asteroid.

444
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,639
 um and

445
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,040
 um but there's but there's been five major extinction events, but

446
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,120
 um but what they don't count are really the ones that merely take out a continent.

447
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,720
 >> so >> merely >> yeah.

448
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,920
 cuz that that because those

449
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,320
 don't really show up on the fossil record, you know, >> right?

450
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
 >> um so unless it's enough to cause a

451
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,440
 you know mass extinction event throughout earth, it it doesn't show up,

452
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
 you know, in a fossil record that's

453
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,279
 200 million years old.

454
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,440
 um so the yeah but but there have been many

455
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,760
 um many impacts that would have sort of destroyed all life on

456
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,959
 you know let's say half of north america or something like that.

457
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,839
 there many such impacts through the course of history.

458
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,240
 >> yeah.

459
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,880
 and there's nothing we can do about it right now.

460
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,040
 >> yeah.

461
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,000
 there was one that

462
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,320
 um hits there was a one that hit siberia and destroyed i think

463
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
 um few hundred square miles.

464
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,079
 >> oh, that's the tungusa.

465
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:16,320
 >> yeah.

466
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
 that's the one from the 1920s, right?

467
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,560
 >> yeah.

468
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:18,880
 >> yeah.

469
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,920
 that's the one that coincides with that meteor that

470
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,880
 comet

471
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,839
 storm that we go through every june and every november

472
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,839
 that they think is responsible for that younger dest.

473
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,079
 >> yeah.

474
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,920
 yeah, all that shit's crazy.

475
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,199
 um,

476
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,480
 thank you

477
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 before we go any further for letting us have a tour of spacex

478
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,440
 and letting us be there for the rocket launch.

479
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,680
 >> one of the absolute coolest things i've ever seen in my life.

480
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,760
 and we we've we were

481
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,240
 we thought it was only like i thought it was a half a mile.

482
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,680
 jamie's like it was a mile away.

483
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,519
 turned out it's almost two miles away.

484
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,120
 and you feel it in your chest.

485
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,279
 >> yeah.

486
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,120
 it's >> you have to wear earplugs

487
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
 and you feel it in your chest and it's 2 miles away.

488
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,160
 >> it was [ __ ] amazing.

489
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,120
 and then to go with you up into the command center

490
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
 and to watch all the starlink

491
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:07,759
 satellites

492
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,360
 with all the different cameras

493
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,920
 and all in real time as it made its way all the way to australia.

494
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,560
 how many minutes?

495
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,000
 like 35 40 minutes.

496
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,040
 >> yeah.

497
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,519
 >> wild it touchdown in australia.

498
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,000
 >> yeah.

499
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
 >> [ __ ] crazy.

500
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,480
 it was amazing.

501
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,720
 >> yeah.

502
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,279
 yeah.

503
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,399
 >> absolutely amazing.

504
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,440
 the starship's awesome.

505
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,160
 um, and anyone can go watch the launch actually.

506
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
 so, you can just go to

507
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
 um, south padre

508
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,399
 island, get has a great view of the launch.

509
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,600
 um, so it's like where a lot of spring breakers go.

510
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,320
 >> um,

511
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 but um, but we'll be flying pretty frequently um, out of starbase in south texas.

512
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,560
 and we we formally incorporated it as a city.

513
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,279
 so, it's it's actually a legally an actual legal city, starbase, texas.

514
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,959
 >> um, it's not that often you hear like, hey, we made a city, you know.

515
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,839
 um,

516
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,480
 that used to be like the like in in the old days like a startup

517
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,519
 would be you go and

518
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,160
 gather a bunch of people and say, "hey, let's go make a town." literally,

519
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,360
 that was like that would have been startups in in in the old days.

520
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,800
 >> um, >> or a country.

521
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:02,959
 >> yeah.

522
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,600
 or a country.

523
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:03,839
 >> yeah.

524
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,079
 >> yeah.

525
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,319
 yeah.

526
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,599
 actually, >> if you tried doing that today, there'd be a real problem.

527
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:07,919
 >> yeah.

528
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,880
 that things are so much so much set in stone on the country front these days.

529
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,919
 you might pull it off.

530
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:12,959
 you might be able to pull it off.

531
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,400
 if you got a a solid island, you might be able to pull it off.

532
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,760
 >> you know, it's probably, >> you know, like like at owns lai.

533
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,880
 >> yeah, you could probably

534
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,520
 if you put if you put enough effort into it, you could make a new country.

535
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,559
 >> this is one of the different ones.

536
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,640
 this is one of the ones that you catch, >> right?

537
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,360
 or is that one?

538
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,400
 >> yeah, that that's the booster.

539
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,640
 so that's the super heavy booster.

540
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,600
 so that's the one with the booster's got 33 engines.

541
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,280
 um that that

542
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,240
 um and it's you know by version four that will have about 10,000 tons of thrust.

543
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,160
 um you know right now it's about 7 8,000 tons of thrust.

544
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,960
 um, that's that's the largest flying object ever made.

545
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
 >> i had to explain to someone.

546
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,520
 they were going, "why do they blow up all the time if he's so smart?"

547
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
 because there was

548
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,880
 there was this [ __ ] idiot on television.

549
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
 some guy was being interviewed and they were talking about you.

550
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
 and he goes, "oh, i think he's a fuckwit." and he goes, "he's a fuckwit."

551
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,880
 and he goes, "why you say he's [ __ ] oh, his rockets keep blowing up."

552
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840
 and someone said, "yeah, well, why do his rockets blow?" and i had to explain.

553
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,080
 yeah.

554
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,480
 because it's the only way you find out what the tolerances are.

555
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,360
 you have to you have to a few >> corners of the box.

556
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 so, so like so when you do a new rocket development program,

557
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,440
 um you you have to

558
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,720
 do what's called

559
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,360
 you know, exploring

560
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,760
 the limits,

561
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
 the corners of the box where you say it's like you

562
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,320
 worst case this,

563
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
 worst case that

564
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
 um to figure out

565
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
 um where where the limits are.

566
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,840
 so

567
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,039
 you blow up, you know, not not admittedly in the development process sometimes blows up accidentally.

568
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,160
 um but but we intentionally subject it to

569
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,640
 you know

570
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,440
 a flight regime

571
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,480
 that is much worse

572
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,360
 than what we expect

573
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,679
 in

574
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,000
 normal

575
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,320
 flight

576
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
 so that when we put people on board or

577
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,400
 valuable

578
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,799
 cargo

579
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,240
 it doesn't blow up.

580
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,919
 um so

581
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,400
 um so so for example for the the flight that you saw we we actually

582
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,039
 deliberately

583
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,760
 took

584
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,480
 um heat shield tiles off the the the ship the off of starship

585
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,640
 in in some of the worst locations

586
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,640
 to say okay if we lose a heat shield tile here is it is it catastrophic

587
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,919
 or is it not?

588
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,280
 um and we we nonetheless starship was able to do a soft landing

589
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,720
 um in in the indian ocean just west of australia.

590
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,039
 um which as and it got there from texas in like i don't know 354

591
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:23,919
 minutes type of thing.

592
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,840
 so >> so it landed even though you put it through this situation

593
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,080
 where it has compromised shield.

594
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,720
 it it had an an an an unusually

595
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,960
 we we we brought it in hot like an an extra hot trajectory

596
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
 with missing tiles

597
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,240
 um to see if it would still make it to a soft landing which it did.

598
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
 now i i should point out it did have

599
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,960
 there were some holes that were burnt into it.

600
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,000
 um but it's it was robust enough to land despite having some holes burnt

601
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
 you know that that you know cuz it's coming it's coming in like a blazing meteor.

602
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,120
 you can see you can see the real time video.

603
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,919
 well, tell me the speed again because the the speed was bananas.

604
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,600
 you were talking about >> yeah, it's like 17,000 mph

605
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,400
 like like 25 times the speed of sound or thereabouts.

606
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,360
 so,

607
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
 um the

608
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,440
 so so think of it like it's it's like 12 times

609
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,760
 faster

610
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,400
 than a bullet

611
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,039
 from an assault

612
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,480
 rifle.

613
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,960
 you know, bullet from assault rifles around mach 2 >> and it's just and it's huge.

614
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,039
 >> yeah.

615
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:21,360
 yeah.

616
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,000
 or or if you compare it to like a bullet from a

617
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,039
 um

618
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,080
 you know a 45 or or 9 mil which is subsonic

619
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,400
 that's you know it it'll be about 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun.

620
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,720
 >> 30

621
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,039
 times

622
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,360
 faster

623
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,559
 than a bullet from a handgun

624
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
 and it's the size of a skyscraper.

625
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,039
 >> yes.

626
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,240
 >> yeah.

627
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,360
 that's fast.

628
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,720
 >> it's so wild.

629
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,559
 it's so wild to see, man.

630
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,880
 it it's it's so exciting.

631
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,280
 this the factor is so exciting too

632
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,600
 because like genuinely no [ __ ] i felt like i was witnessing

633
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,240
 history.

634
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,559
 i felt like it was a scene in a movie where someone had expectations

635
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,679
 and they like what are they doing?

636
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,480
 they're building rockets.

637
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,280
 and you go there and as we were walking through

638
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
 jamie, you could speak to this too.

639
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
 didn't you have the feeling where you're like

640
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
 >> oh this is way bigger than i thought it was.

641
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
 this is huge.

642
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,280
 awesome.

643
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,919
 >> gigantic.

644
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,799
 >> [ __ ] crazy.

645
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,520
 >> that's what she said.

646
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,080
 the ah the amount of rockets you're making.

647
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,280
 i don't know if you >> tent back.

648
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,720
 >> gig chad in the house.

649
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,200
 >> this is way big.

650
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
 >> it's a giant metal dick.

651
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
 you're [ __ ] [ __ ] the universe with your giant metal dick.

652
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,600
 that's >> i mean, yeah, it is.

653
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,640
 it is very big.

654
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
 >> and the sheer numbers of them that you guys are making.

655
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,840
 and then this is a version and you have a new updated version that's coming soon.

656
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,039
 >> and what is the it's a it's a little longer.

657
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,720
 um >> more pointy.

658
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
 >> uh it's the same amount of pointy.

659
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,840
 um but the there's it's it's got a bit more length.

660
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
 um the the interstage,

661
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,960
 you see that that interstage section with kind of like the grill area.

662
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,520
 >> mhm.

663
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,039
 >> um that's that's now integrated with the boost stage.

664
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,880
 um so we do

665
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,039
 um what's called hot staging.

666
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,240
 where we light the ship engines while it's still attached to the booster.

667
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,159
 so the boost the booster engines are still thrusting.

668
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,240
 is still it's it's

669
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,960
 you know it's still being pushed forward by the booster of the ship.

670
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,080
 but then we light the ship engines and the ship engines

671
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,000
 actually pull away from the booster even though the booster engines are still firing.

672
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,720
 >> whoa.

673
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,919
 >> um so it's blasting flame through

674
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,760
 that that grill section but we integrate that grill section into

675
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,039
 the boost stage with the next version of the rocket.

676
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,480
 um

677
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,039
 and and explosion in the rocket will have the raptor 3 engines which are

678
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,320
 a huge improvement.

679
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,120
 um you may you may have seen them in the lobby

680
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,679
 because we got like the raptor 1, two, and three.

681
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,280
 and you can see the dramatic improvement in simplicity.

682
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,919
 um we should probably put a plaque there to also show

683
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,320
 how much the we reduced the weight

684
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,039
 the cost and the and improved the efficiency and the thrust.

685
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,640
 so the raptor 3 has

686
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,360
 you know almost twice the thrust of raptor raptor 1. >> wow.

687
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,000
 >> so you see raptor 3. it looks like it looks like it's got parts missing.

688
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,400
 right.

689
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,240
 >> and how many >> it's very very clean.

690
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
 >> how many of them are on the rocket?

691
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,440
 >> there's 33 on the on the booster.

692
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,240
 >> whoa.

693
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,679
 um and and each of each raptor engine is producing

694
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,799
 twice as much thrust as all four engines on a 747.

695
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,240
 wow.

696
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,240
 so that engine is smaller than a 747 engine, but is producing, you know,

697
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,039
 um you know, almost 10 times the thrust of a 747 engine.

698
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,799
 um so extremely high power to weight ratio.

699
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,880
 um and

700
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,440
 um

701
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,640
 >> and so when there's >> 33

702
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,280
 of them >> you

703
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,480
 when you so when you're designing

704
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,799
 these

705
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,600
 you get to raptor

706
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,159
 one

707
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,440
 you see its efficiency

708
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,039
 you see where you can improve it

709
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,720
 you get to raptor 2 how many

710
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,440
 how far can you scale this up with just

711
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,919
 the same sort of technology with propellant and ignition and engines

712
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,240
 like how much further can you

713
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,120
 >> i mean we're pushing the limits of physics here

714
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
 um so

715
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,720
 um

716
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,039
 and and really in order to to make a a fully reusable

717
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,720
 orbital rocket which no one has succeeded in doing yet including

718
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,919
 including us.

719
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
 um but but

720
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,760
 starship is the first time that there is a design for a rocket

721
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,360
 where where full and rapid reusability is actually possible.

722
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,960
 so it was not there's not there's not even been a design

723
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,400
 before where it was possible.

724
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,240
 certainly not a design that that that got made any hardware at all.

725
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,840
 um just we just we just live we live on a planet where the gravity

726
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,559
 is is is quite high like earth's gravity is quite really quite quite high.

727
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,840
 um

728
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,679
 um and if the gravity was even 10 or 20%

729
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,880
 higher we'd be stuck on earth forever.

730
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,159
 um like we yeah we could not use certainly couldn't use conventional rockets.

731
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,559
 you'd have to like blow yourself off the surface with like a nuclear

732
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,000
 bomb or something crazy.

733
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,200
 um

734
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,279
 so but on the other hand if if earth's gravity was just a little

735
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,240
 lower like even 10 20% lower it then

736
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,000
 getting to orbit would be easy.

737
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,520
 so it's like it's like

738
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,799
 it's like this if this was a video game it's set to like

739
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,120
 maximum difficulty but not impossible.

740
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,600
 >> okay.

741
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,480
 >> um so that's that's where we have

742
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:28,960
 um here.

743
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,200
 so it's it's not as though

744
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,520
 um others have ignored the concept of reusability.

745
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,520
 they've just concluded that it was too difficult to achieve.

746
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,000
 and we've been working at on on this for a long time at at spacex.

747
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,600
 um and

748
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,480
 um you know, i'm the chief engineer of the company.

749
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,440
 um although i should say that that you know, we have an extremely talented engineering team.

750
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,679
 i think we've got the best rocket engineering team that has ever been assembled.

751
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,080
 um it's it's an honor to work with such such incredible people.

752
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,279
 um so

753
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,120
 so so it's fair to say that

754
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,039
 you know we have not yet succeeded in creating in achieving full reusability

755
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,200
 but we at last have a rocket

756
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,159
 where full reusability is possible.

757
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,799
 um and i think i think we'll achieve it next year.

758
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,440
 so

759
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,279
 um that's a that's a really big deal.

760
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,840
 and the reason the reason that's that's such a big deal is that full reusability

761
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:37,440
 um drops the cost of access to space by a hundred

762
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,159
 um maybe even more than 100 actually.

763
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,919
 so could be like a thousand.

764
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,159
 the you can think of it like any mode of transport.

765
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,320
 like imagine if aircraft were were not reusable.

766
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,240
 like you flew somewhere, you throw the plane

767
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,279
 like like imagine if like the way the way conventional rockets work

768
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,200
 is it would be like if you had an airplane

769
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,159
 and and and

770
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,919
 instead of landing at your destination,

771
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,679
 you parachute out

772
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,760
 um and the plane crashes somewhere

773
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,880
 and you land at your desk

774
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,640
 and you and you land on a parachute at your

775
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,600
 destination.

776
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,559
 now that would be a very expensive trip

777
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,360
 and you and you'd need another plane to get back.

778
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,640
 okay.

779
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,520
 um, but that's how the other rockets in the world work.

780
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,240
 um,

781
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
 now the spacex falcon rocket

782
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,520
 is the only one that is is there that is at least mostly reusable.

783
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,559
 you've se you've seen the falcon rocket, you know, land.

784
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,880
 we've now done over 500 landings

785
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
 of of the spacex rocket

786
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
 of the of the falcon 9 rocket.

787
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
 um and

788
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,120
 um and and this year

789
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,039
 um you know we we'll deliver probably i don't know

790
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,799
 somewhere between 2200 and 2500 tons to orbit

791
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,720
 um with with the falcon 9 falcon heavy rockets not counting anything for from starship.

792
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,000
 um >> and this is mostly starlink.

793
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,520
 yes, mostly starling, but we launch many other we even launch our competitors on

794
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,799
 um competitors to starink on on falcon 9. we charge them the same price.

795
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,919
 pretty fair.

796
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,080
 um but spacex this year will deliver

797
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,279
 um roughly 90% of all earth mass to orbit.

798
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:11,919
 >> wow.

799
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,640
 >> um and then of the remaining 10%

800
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,360
 um most of that is done by china.

801
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,399
 and then the then the remaining kind of roughly 4%

802
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,200
 is

803
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,840
 everyone else in the world including our america domestic competitors.

804
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,480
 >> you know

805
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,360
 um

806
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,480
 it's kind of incredible how many things are in space

807
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,559
 like how many things are floating above us now?

808
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,679
 >> there's a lot of things.

809
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,399
 >> yeah.

810
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,840
 >> is there though?

811
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,039
 >> right.

812
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,200
 but is there a saturation point where

813
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,200
 we're going to have problems with all these different satellites that are

814
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,000
 >> um i think as long as the satellites are

815
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,840
 um maintained there's there it'll be fine.

816
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,679
 this space is very roomy.

817
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,640
 um it's like you can think of

818
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,679
 um like space as being concentric shells of the surface of the earth.

819
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,120
 so,

820
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,480
 um,

821
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,760
 you know, there's there's

822
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,960
 it's the surface of the earth, but but there's it's a series >> much larger.

823
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,279
 >> yeah.

824
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,799
 it's like a series of concentric trails.

825
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,080
 um, >> and think of an airstream trailer flying around up there.

826
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,240
 there's a lot of room for air streams.

827
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,640
 >> yeah.

828
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,679
 i mean, imagine yeah.

829
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,919
 if there just a few thousand airirstreams

830
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,200
 um on on earth.

831
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,520
 >> yeah.

832
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,799
 >> what are the odds that they'd hit each other?

833
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,080
 you know, >> they wouldn't be very crowded.

834
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,559
 no.

835
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,320
 and then you got to go bigger.

836
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,640
 >> yeah.

837
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
 >> because you're dealing with far above earth.

838
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,320
 >> hundreds of miles above earth.

839
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,559
 >> yeah.

840
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:28,799
 yeah.

841
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,039
 yeah.

842
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:29,279
 >> yeah.

843
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,120
 so, it's the

844
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,720
 um but the goal of spacex is to

845
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,360
 get

846
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,760
 rocket

847
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,159
 technology

848
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,120
 to the point where we can extend life beyond earth and that we can establish

849
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,440
 a

850
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,159
 self-sustaining

851
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,760
 city on mars.

852
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,120
 a permanent base on the moon.

853
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,000
 that would be very cool.

854
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,960
 i mean, imagine if we had like a, you know, moon base alpha

855
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,600
 where there's like a permanent science base on the moon.

856
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,480
 >> that would be pretty dope.

857
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,880
 or at least a tourist trap.

858
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,240
 >> i mean,

859
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,919
 a lot of people be willing to go to the moon for just for a tour.

860
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,120
 that's for sure.

861
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,520
 we could probably pay for our space program with that, you know, >> probably.

862
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,760
 yeah.

863
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,720
 well, >> because it's like if if you if you could go to the moon

864
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,000
 with and and

865
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 safely,

866
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,600
 >> uh

867
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,559
 i think we'd get a lot of people would would pay for that, you know.

868
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,600
 >> oh, 100%.

869
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,480
 after the first year, after nobody died for like >> yeah.

870
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,120
 just make sure.

871
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,840
 exactly.

872
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,640
 are you going to come back?

873
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:18,880
 yeah.

874
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,320
 >> because like that submarine, they they had a bunch of successful

875
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,640
 launches in that private submarine before it imploded and killed everybody.

876
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,679
 that was not a good design.

877
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,039
 obviously, >> it was a very bad design.

878
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,679
 terrible design.

879
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,960
 >> and the engineers said it would not withstand the pressure of those depths.

880
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,399
 like there was a lot of whistleblowers in that company too.

881
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:36,960
 >> yeah.

882
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,200
 um they they they made that out of

883
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,080
 carbon fiber which is it doesn't make any sense because

884
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,679
 um you actually need you need to be dense to go down.

885
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,520
 um in any case, just make it out of steel.

886
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,360
 if you make it out of

887
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
 sort of just, you know,

888
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,039
 a big steel casting, that's that's you you'll be safe and nothing.

889
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,880
 why would they make it out of carbon fiber then?

890
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,919
 is it cheaper?

891
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,320
 >> um i think they think carbon fiber sounds cool or something.

892
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,520
 but >> it does sound cool.

893
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,200
 >> it it sounds cool, but

894
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,080
 um

895
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,320
 because it's such it's such low density, you actually actually have to add extra mass to

896
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,640
 go down because it's it's low density.

897
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,159
 but if you just have a giant, you know, hollow ball bearing,

898
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,279
 you're going to be fine.

899
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,480
 >> speaking of carbon fiber, did you check out my unplugged tesla out there?

900
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,120
 >> yeah, it's cool.

901
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
 >> pretty sick, right?

902
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,559
 yeah.

903
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,320
 have you guys ever thought about doing something like that?

904
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,080
 like having like an amg division of tesla where you do like custom stuff.

905
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,039
 >> um i think it's best to leave that to the custom shops.

906
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,399
 you know we're we're like tesla's focus is autonomous cars.

907
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,799
 um you know building kind of futuristic autonomous cars.

908
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,320
 um so

909
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,600
 um like i think it's we want the future to look like the future.

910
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,480
 um, so the did like did you see like our designs for like the sort of

911
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,559
 the robotic bus?

912
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,080
 it looks pretty cool.

913
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,080
 >> the robotic bus is also being totally auton

914
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,799
 but it looks it looks cool.

915
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,240
 it's it's very art deco.

916
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,880
 it's it's like it's like futuristic art deco.

917
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,640
 um, and um,

918
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,960
 it it does it like i think we want to change the aesthetic over time.

919
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,320
 you don't want the aesthetic to be constant over time.

920
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,480
 you want to evolve the aesthetic.

921
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,519
 um,

922
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,039
 so um,

923
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,080
 you know, like my like i have a son who's he's like,

924
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
 you know, he's he's he's like

925
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,159
 even more autistic than me and

926
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,519
 um and, uh, but he's he has these great observations.

927
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,240
 who is this?

928
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,440
 >> a saxon.

929
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,559
 he has these great observations

930
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,440
 in the world

931
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:43,919
 uh because

932
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,399
 he's

933
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,279
 he just views the world through a different lens

934
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,880
 than than most people.

935
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,519
 um and he was like, "dad, why does the world look like it's 2015?"

936
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,799
 >> and i'm like, "damn, the world does look like it's 2015."

937
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,760
 like the aesthetic has not evolved since 2015. >> oh, that's what it looks like.

938
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,240
 >> yeah.

939
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,440
 >> oh, wow.

940
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,320
 >> that's pretty cool.

941
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,200
 >> oh, yeah.

942
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,679
 that's like >> like you'd want to see that going down the road, you know?

943
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,080
 >> yeah.

944
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,480
 you'd be like, "okay, this is we're in the future."

945
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
 you know, it doesn't look like 2015.

946
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
 >> what is that ancient science fiction movie?

947
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,159
 like one of the first science fiction movies ever.

948
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,200
 is it metropolis?

949
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,919
 is that what it is?

950
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,080
 >> yeah.

951
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,480
 yeah.

952
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:18,799
 >> yeah.

953
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,720
 that looks like it belongs in metropolis.

954
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:20,880
 >> yeah.

955
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,360
 yeah.

956
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,080
 it's a futuristic art deco.

957
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,480
 >> all right.

958
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,720
 yeah.

959
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,760
 well, that's cool that you're concentrating on the aesthetic.

960
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,159
 i mean, that's kind of the whole deal with cybertruck, right?

961
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,760
 like, it didn't have to look like that.

962
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,360
 >> no, it it i just wanted to have something that looked really different.

963
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
 is it a pain in the ass for people to get it insured

964
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,320
 because it's all solid

965
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:38,720
 steel

966
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,080
 and

967
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,440
 >> um i hope it's not too much.

968
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,159
 i you know tesla

969
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:42,880
 does offer insurance

970
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,559
 so people can always get it get it insured

971
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,519
 at tesla.

972
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,200
 >> um well but the like it is the

973
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,480
 form does follow a function in the case of the cybert truck because

974
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,159
 um as you demonstrated with with your armorpiercing arrow

975
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,320
 um because if you shot that arrow at a regular truck i mean >> it

976
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,240
 exactly you would have found your arrow in the wall.

977
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,640
 yeah.

978
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,240
 um, you know, it would very least it would have buried into one of the seats.

979
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,399
 >> yeah.

980
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:06,559
 yeah.

981
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,239
 it's but like you could you could definitely make

982
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,760
 get enough of

983
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,719
 bow velocity

984
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,159
 and and the right the right arrow

985
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,000
 would go through both doors of a regular truck and and and land on the wall.

986
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,040
 >> if there was a clear shot

987
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,359
 between

988
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:19,918
 both doors,

989
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,280
 it probably would have passed right through.

990
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,079
 >> exactly.

991
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,800
 um

992
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,440
 but but

993
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,800
 you know the the arrow shattered

994
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,359
 on the cybert truck cuz it's it's ultra hard

995
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,000
 stainless.

996
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,480
 mhm.

997
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
 >> um, so,

998
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,679
 um,

999
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,719
 and i thought it' be i thought it'd be cool to have

1000
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,399
 a, you know, a truck that is bulletproof to a subsonic projectile.

1001
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,199
 um,

1002
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,918
 so,

1003
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,159
 um, you know, especially in this day and age, you know,

1004
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,040
 like as

1005
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
 as a if, if the apocalypse

1006
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,960
 happens, you're going to want to have a bulletproof

1007
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,079
 truck, you know.

1008
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,879
 um, so so then because

1009
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,960
 because it's made of ultra hot stainless, it's you can't just stamp the the panels.

1010
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,160
 you can't just put in a stamping press because it breaks the press.

1011
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,520
 so, so in order to actually, so it has to has to be planer

1012
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,160
 um because it's so difficult to bend it because it breaks the machine that bends it.

1013
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,240
 um that's why that's why it's it's it's it's so planer

1014
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,560
 and and it's not you know it's it's because it's

1015
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,880
 bulletproof steel is the

1016
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,320
 >> so it is like boxy as opposed to like curved and >> yeah.

1017
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,359
 you just in order to make in order to make like the curved shapes,

1018
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,160
 you you you

1019
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,720
 take you take

1020
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,040
 basically mild steel like

1021
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,599
 um anneal thin and thin anneal in a regular truck or car.

1022
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,079
 the

1023
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,280
 you take you take mild

1024
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,680
 thin

1025
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,079
 anneal

1026
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,200
 steel, you put it in a stamping

1027
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,079
 press and it just

1028
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,400
 sm

1029
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,119
 it just

1030
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:41,599
 smooshes

1031
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,000
 it

1032
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,960
 and makes it to whatever the shape whatever shape you want.

1033
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,400
 but the cybert truck is made made of ultra hard stainless.

1034
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,280
 um and and and so you can't stamp it because it would break the stamping press.

1035
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,000
 so it even bending it is hard.

1036
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,880
 so even to bend it to its current position, we have to way overbend it.

1037
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,760
 um

1038
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,240
 and and

1039
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,800
 so it gets

1040
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,839
 so that when it springs

1041
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,640
 back, it's in in the right position.

1042
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
 um, so it's

1043
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,720
 i don't know like i i think if you want to

1044
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,119
 like

1045
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,000
 i think it's it's it's

1046
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,680
 a unique aesthetic.

1047
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,839
 um, and you say, "well, what's cool about a truck?" trucks are trucks are

1048
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,839
 like should be i don't know manly.

1049
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,599
 they should be macho, you know, and bulletproof is maximum macho macho.

1050
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,079
 >> are you married to that shape now?

1051
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,640
 like is it can you do anything to change it?

1052
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,880
 like as you get further like i know you guys updated the three and the y.

1053
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,640
 did you update the y as well?

1054
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,680
 >> yes, the the three and the y are updated.

1055
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
 um you know, there's like a

1056
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,119
 um

1057
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:45,680
 there's there's

1058
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,079
 a a screen in the back for the kid that the kids can watch,

1059
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:48,560
 for example,

1060
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,160
 in the new 3 and y.

1061
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,400
 um so in the new y,

1062
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,040
 um there's, you know, it's it's an there's there's there's like hundreds of improvements.

1063
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,480
 like we keep improving the car.

1064
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,520
 um and even the cybert truck, we you know, we keep improving it.

1065
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,119
 um but

1066
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,200
 um

1067
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,240
 you know i wanted to just do something that that looked unique

1068
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,400
 and and the cybert truck looks unique and has unique functionality

1069
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,280
 and

1070
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,119
 there was and it was like

1071
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,720
 there were three things as i report like let's make it bulletproof.

1072
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,400
 let's make it faster than a porsche 911. uh, and we actually cleared the quarter mile.

1073
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,160
 the cybert truck, the the can

1074
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:38,240
 clear a quarter mile while towing a porsche 911 faster than a porsche 911.

1075
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,920
 um, it can out tow an f350 diesel.

1076
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,400
 >> really?

1077
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,800
 >> yes.

1078
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,960
 >> what is the tow limitations?

1079
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,920
 >> i mean, we could tow like a, you know, a 747

1080
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,040
 in that with a cy.

1081
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,320
 cybert truck is an insanely like it is an it is alien technology.

1082
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,359
 okay.

1083
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,800
 um cuz it it shouldn't be possible to be that big and that fast.

1084
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,560
 that doesn't it's like an elephant that runs as as like a cheetah.

1085
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:08,800
 >> yeah.

1086
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
 because it's 0 to 60 in less than 3 seconds, right?

1087
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,680
 >> yes.

1088
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,079
 >> yeah.

1089
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,200
 and it's enormous.

1090
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,760
 what does it weigh?

1091
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,280
 like 7,000 lbs.

1092
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,480
 >> uh yeah, there's different configurations, but it's about that.

1093
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,599
 it's a beast.

1094
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,720
 >> yeah.

1095
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,480
 >> um so and it's and it's got it's got four-wheel steering.

1096
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,200
 so the the rear wheel steer, too.

1097
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,240
 so it's got a it's got a very tight turning radius.

1098
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,400
 >> yeah.

1099
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,040
 we noticed that we when we drove one to star base.

1100
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,280
 >> yeah.

1101
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,320
 very tight turning radius.

1102
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,640
 >> yeah.

1103
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,280
 pretty sick.

1104
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,680
 >> yeah.

1105
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,040
 >> are you still doing the roadster?

1106
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,760
 >> yes.

1107
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,760
 eventually,

1108
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:53,920
 >> we're getting close to demonstrating the prototype >> and i think this will be

1109
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,200
 i i i i one thing i can guarantee is that this product demo

1110
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,400
 will be unforgettable.

1111
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
 unforgettable.

1112
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,000
 >> how so?

1113
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:14,240
 whether it's good or bad, it will be unforgettable.

1114
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,560
 um, >> can you say more?

1115
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,079
 what do you mean?

1116
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,920
 >> well, you know, my friend peter teal,

1117
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,160
 um, you know, uh, once reflected that

1118
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,119
 the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don't have flying cars.

1119
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,680
 >> so, you're going to be able to fly?

1120
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,640
 well, i mean,

1121
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,720
 uh,

1122
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,240
 i think if peter wants a flying car, we should should be able to buy one.

1123
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,760
 >> so, you are you actively considering making an electric flying car?

1124
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,240
 is this like a real thing?

1125
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,800
 >> well, we have to see in the >> in the demo.

1126
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,359
 so, when you do this, like are are you going to have a retractable wing?

1127
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,800
 like, what is the idea behind this?

1128
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,359
 don't be sly.

1129
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,320
 come on.

1130
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,240
 >> i i i can't i can't do the unveil before the unveil.

1131
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,920
 um but

1132
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,839
 um >> tell me off air then.

1133
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,880
 >> i i i it look i i think it has a shot at being

1134
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,920
 the most memorable

1135
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,720
 um product unveil ever.

1136
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,800
 it has a shot.

1137
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,960
 >> and when do you plan on doing this?

1138
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,400
 what's the goal?

1139
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,760
 >> uh hopefully before the end of the year.

1140
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,480
 >> really?

1141
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,400
 >> before the end of this year.

1142
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,960
 >> this is i mean we're in a couple months.

1143
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,640
 >> hopefully in a couple months.

1144
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:46,000
 um you know we need to make sure that it works.

1145
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,359
 like this is some crazy crazy technology we got in this car.

1146
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,880
 crazy technology.

1147
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,960
 crazy crazy.

1148
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,520
 so different than what was previously announced and >> yes.

1149
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,040
 >> and is that why you haven't released it yet?

1150
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,000
 cuz you keep [ __ ] with it.

1151
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,760
 >> it has crazy technology.

1152
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,560
 >> okay.

1153
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,319
 >> like is it even a car?

1154
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:10,800
 i'm not sure.

1155
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,160
 it's like it looks like a car.

1156
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,119
 let's just put this way.

1157
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,640
 it it's it's crazier than anything james bond.

1158
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:28,640
 if you took all the james bond cars and combined them, it's crazier than that.

1159
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,319
 >> very exciting.

1160
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,079
 >> i don't know what to think of that.

1161
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:32,480
 >> i don't know.

1162
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,920
 >> it's a limited amount of information i'm drawing from here.

1163
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,680
 >> jamie's very suspicious over there.

1164
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,800
 look at him.

1165
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,359
 >> excited.

1166
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,960
 >> i'm interested.

1167
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,920
 >> it's still going to be the same.

1168
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,319
 >> well, you know what?

1169
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,520
 i mean, if if you want to if you want to come a little before the

1170
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,440
 the unveil, i can show it to you 100%.

1171
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,720
 yeah, let's go.

1172
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,440
 >> yeah.

1173
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,359
 um

1174
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,720
 it's

1175
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,079
 it's kind of crazy

1176
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,040
 all the different things that you're involved in simultaneously

1177
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,400
 and you know we talked about this before your time management but

1178
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,319
 i i really don't understand it.

1179
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:09,200
 i don't understand how you can be paying attention to all these different things simultaneously.

1180
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,960
 starlink, spacex, tesla, boring company

1181
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,440
 x you're tweet you [ __ ] tweet or post rather all day long.

1182
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,720
 well, it's more like i'm i'm

1183
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,440
 i could hop in for like two minutes and then hop out, you know.

1184
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,599
 >> but i mean, just the fact that you could do >> bathroom break or whatever,

1185
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,319
 you know,

1186
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,599
 >> i can't do that.

1187
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,800
 >> um >> if i hop in, i start scrolling and i start looking around.

1188
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,319
 next thing you know, i've lost an hour.

1189
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,520
 >> yeah.

1190
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,400
 >> um so, no, it's for me it's it's a couple minutes time usually.

1191
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,280
 it's once in a

1192
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,599
 sometimes

1193
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,480
 i guess it's half an hour,

1194
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,720
 but

1195
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:38,960
 usually

1196
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,200
 i'm

1197
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,440
 i'm

1198
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,839
 i'm in

1199
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:40,079
 for

1200
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,319
 a

1201
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:40,720
 few minutes

1202
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:40,960
 then

1203
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,200
 out

1204
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,079
 of of

1205
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,599
 you know, posting something on x.

1206
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,400
 uh,

1207
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,280
 you know, it's i do sometimes feel like it's sometimes like

1208
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,960
 that that meme of the guy who's like who drops the grenade and leaves the room.

1209
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,000
 that's been me more than once on on x.

1210
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,880
 >> yeah.

1211
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,680
 oh, yeah.

1212
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
 yeah, for sure.

1213
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,760
 um, it's got to be fun, though.

1214
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,079
 it's got to be fun to know that you essentially disrupted

1215
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,160
 the entire social media chain of command

1216
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,560
 because there was a there was a very clear

1217
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,640
 thing that was going on with social media.

1218
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,560
 the government had infiltrated it.

1219
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,640
 they were censoring speech

1220
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,280
 >> and until you bought it, we really didn't know the extent of it.

1221
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,440
 we kind of assumed that there was something going on.

1222
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:23,680
 >> yeah.

1223
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,640
 we had no idea that they were actively involved in censoring

1224
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
 actual real news stories,

1225
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,760
 real data,

1226
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,800
 real scientists,

1227
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,839
 real professors

1228
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,560
 silenced,

1229
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,520
 expelled,

1230
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,960
 kicked off the platform.

1231
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,920
 >> yeah.

1232
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,119
 >> wild.

1233
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:37,760
 >> yeah.

1234
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,000
 >> yeah.

1235
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,200
 >> for telling the truth.

1236
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,240
 >> for telling the truth.

1237
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,880
 and i'm sure you've also because i sent it to you that chart that shows

1238
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,200
 young kids, teenagers identifying as trans and non-binary

1239
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,079
 literally

1240
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,480
 stops dead when you bought twitter

1241
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,599
 and starts falling off a cliff when people are allowed to have rational

1242
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,079
 discussions

1243
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:56,560
 now

1244
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,079
 and actually talk about it.

1245
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,640
 >> yes.

1246
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,520
 >> yeah.

1247
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,720
 >> um yeah.

1248
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,440
 yeah, i mean i i said at the time like i think that like

1249
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,480
 the the like the reason for acquiring twitter is because

1250
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,720
 um it was it it was c it was causing destruction at a civilizational level.

1251
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,000
 um it was

1252
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,920
 um i mean i posted i tweeted on on twitter at the time that

1253
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,680
 um it it is

1254
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:28,319
 um you know it's it's worm tongue for the world.

1255
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,640
 um you know like worm tongue from

1256
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,760
 lord of the rings where he would just sort of

1257
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
 like whisper these

1258
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,440
 you know terrible things to the king

1259
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,280
 so the king would believe these things that

1260
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,800
 weren't true

1261
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,640
 um and and

1262
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,800
 um unfortunately

1263
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:52,079
 twitter really got it got like the the the woke mob essentially they controlled twitter

1264
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:59,200
 um and they were pushing a nihilistic anti-vilizational mind virus to the world.

1265
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,599
 um, and you can see the results of that mind virus

1266
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,359
 on the streets of san francisco,

1267
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,800
 uh, where,

1268
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,000
 you know, downtown san francisco looks like a zombie apocalypse.

1269
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,880
 um, you know, it's it's bad.

1270
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,920
 um, so we don't want the whole world to be a zombie apocalypse.

1271
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,400
 um, but that's

1272
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:24,720
 that that that was essentially they were pushing this very negative, nihilistic, untrue worldview

1273
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,760
 on the world and it was causing a lot of damage.

1274
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,920
 um, so >> the stunning thing about it is how few people course corrected.

1275
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,319
 a bunch of people woke up and realized what was going on.

1276
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,319
 people that were all on board with like woke ideology in maybe 2015

1277
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:40,640
 or

1278
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:40,960
 16

1279
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,520
 and then

1280
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,240
 and then eventually

1281
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,119
 it comes to affect

1282
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,640
 them or they see it in their workplace

1283
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,440
 or they see and they're like, "whoa, whoa, whoa, we got to stop this."

1284
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,079
 bunch of people did, but a lot of people never course corrected.

1285
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:52,480
 >> yeah.

1286
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,079
 um,

1287
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,880
 a lot of a lot of people didn't course correct, but

1288
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,760
 um,

1289
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,880
 but it's gone directionally in it's gone it's it's directionally correct like you mentioned like the

1290
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,880
 like the massive spike in in kids identifying as trans

1291
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,760
 and then that that spike dropping

1292
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,839
 um after the the twitter acquisition.

1293
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,040
 i think that

1294
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,240
 um simply allowing the truth to be told

1295
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,800
 um was that just shedding sun sunlight is the best disinfectant as they say

1296
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,960
 and just allowing sunlight

1297
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,800
 um kills the virus >> and it also changed the benchmark for all the other platforms.

1298
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,520
 yes, you can't just openly censor people and all the other platforms and x is available.

1299
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,359
 so everybody else had a so like facebook announced they were changing

1300
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,920
 youtube announced they were changing their policies

1301
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,319
 and they're kind of forced to and then blue sky doubled down.

1302
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,760
 >> well, like the problem is like if

1303
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,920
 >> uh essentially the woke mind virus retreated to woke to to blue sky.

1304
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,240
 >> yeah.

1305
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,079
 >> um but it's where they're just a self-reinforcing lunatic assign.

1306
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,760
 >> they're all just triple masked.

1307
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,680
 i i was i was totally watching this exchange

1308
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,319
 on a blue sky where someone said that they're just trying to be zen about something

1309
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,680
 and then someone a moderator immediately chimed in and

1310
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,800
 why don't you try to stop being racist against asians by saying something zen

1311
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,400
 by saying i'm trying to be zen about something.

1312
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,680
 they were accusing that person of being racist towards asians.

1313
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,079
 >> yeah.

1314
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,920
 it's it's just it's just everyone's a hall monitor over there.

1315
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,440
 the worst hall monitor.

1316
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,720
 a virgin like incel.

1317
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,119
 >> they're all home monitors trying to rat on each other.

1318
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,880
 >> yeah, it's fascinating.

1319
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,079
 and then people say, "i'm leaving for blue sky like stephen king."

1320
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,560
 and then a couple weeks later, he's back on x.

1321
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,359
 just like, "fuck it.

1322
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,480
 it's there's no one over there.

1323
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,920
 it's all a bunch of crazy people.

1324
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,640
 you can only stay in the asylum for so long.

1325
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,160
 like, all right, this this is not good." they all bail.

1326
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,400
 >> yeah.

1327
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:50,640
 yeah.

1328
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,160
 >> threads is kind of like that, too.

1329
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,599
 threads is >> i' i've been on threads as is it?

1330
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,319
 well, what happens is if you go on instagram,

1331
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,520
 every now and then it'll something really stupid will pop up on threads

1332
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,160
 like what the [ __ ] and it shows it to you on instagram

1333
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,920
 and then i'll click on that and then i'll go to threads and it's like

1334
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,079
 >> you see posts with like 25 likes like famous people like 50 like it's it's

1335
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,960
 down

1336
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,560
 >> but the people that post on there

1337
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,440
 they're finding that there's very little push back from

1338
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,880
 insane ideology

1339
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,040
 so they go there and they spit out nonsense

1340
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,119
 and very few people jump in to argue.

1341
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,119
 you.

1342
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:27,680
 >> yeah.

1343
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,520
 um, >> very weird, very weird place.

1344
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,319
 >> i mean, i can generally

1345
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:30,880
 get the vibe

1346
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,200
 of

1347
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,680
 like what's

1348
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,240
 taking off

1349
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,040
 by seeing what's

1350
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,760
 showing up on

1351
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,079
 x

1352
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,440
 cuz that's the public town square

1353
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,079
 still.

1354
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,800
 um, >> and or or

1355
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,000
 you know what what

1356
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,680
 links show up in group texts,

1357
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,480
 you know, if i'm in group chat with friends, like where where what what

1358
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,280
 links are showing up?

1359
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,640
 >> that's what i try to do now.

1360
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,119
 only get stuff that shows up in my group text because that keeps me productive.

1361
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,200
 so, i only check if someone's like, "dude,

1362
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,079
 what the fuck?" like, "all right, what the [ __ ] let me check it out."

1363
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,319
 >> if there's something that's crazy enough that your

1364
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,599
 it'll it'll end with the group chat, >> but there's always something.

1365
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,640
 that's what's nuts.

1366
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,680
 there's always some new law that's passed, some new insane thing that california is doing.

1367
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,119
 and it's like like a giant chunk of it's happening in california.

1368
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,760
 the most preposterous things that i get.

1369
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,640
 >> yeah.

1370
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,800
 >> and then you got gavin newsome who's running around saying we all have california derangement

1371
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,200
 syndrome.

1372
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,640
 he's just like ripping off trump derangement and calling it california derangement.

1373
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,960
 i was like, "no, no, no, no, no, no.

1374
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,760
 the the [ __ ] how many corporations have left california?" >> it's crazy.

1375
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,400
 >> hundreds.

1376
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,040
 hundreds, >> right?

1377
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,000
 hundreds.

1378
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,880
 >> that's not good.

1379
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,400
 >> chick i mean, not chick-fil-a.

1380
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,160
 i mean, i think in-n-out left.

1381
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,319
 >> yeah.

1382
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,119
 in and outlift.

1383
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,400
 they moved to tennessee.

1384
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,880
 >> yeah.

1385
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,359
 >> yeah.

1386
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,760
 they're like, "we can't do this anymore." >> right.

1387
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,480
 and >> it's the california company for food.

1388
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,559
 it's like the greatest hamburger place ever.

1389
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,200
 >> it's awesome.

1390
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,680
 >> yeah.

1391
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,000
 >> yeah.

1392
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,040
 and no, actually

1393
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,640
 speaking of like like just sort of open source and like looking at things openly

1394
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,920
 like you i just like going in and out and seeing them make the burger.

1395
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,079
 >> yeah.

1396
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:56,640
 it's right there.

1397
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,720
 >> they chop the onions and they they

1398
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,680
 you know it's you just see everything getting made in front of you.

1399
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,160
 >> yeah.

1400
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,359
 >> it's great.

1401
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,960
 >> um but yeah

1402
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,520
 like

1403
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,960
 like it should be like how many wakeup

1404
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,839
 calls do you need

1405
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,119
 to say that there needs to be reform

1406
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:09,599
 in california,

1407
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:09,839
 you know?

1408
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,040
 >> well, the crazy thing that newsome

1409
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,079
 does is whenever

1410
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,559
 someone brings up the problems in california,

1411
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,559
 he starts rattling off all the positives.

1412
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,760
 the most fortune 500 companies, highest education.

1413
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,800
 but yeah, that was all already there, right before you were governor.

1414
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,559
 >> but but how many fortune 500 companies have left california?

1415
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,440
 >> and then

1416
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,760
 you guys spent $ 24 billion on the homeless and it got way worse.

1417
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,880
 >> yes.

1418
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,520
 like the homeless

1419
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,599
 population doubled or something like but like

1420
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,520
 people don't understand like the homeless thing because it it

1421
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,720
 sort of prays on people's empathy

1422
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,480
 and i i think we should have empathy.

1423
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,640
 um and we should try to help people.

1424
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,040
 um but the the the

1425
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,040
 the homeless industrial complex is is really it's it's it's dark man.

1426
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,559
 um it should be that that that that

1427
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,400
 network of ngos's should be called like the drug zombie farmers.

1428
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,000
 um because they they the the more homeless people and and and really

1429
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,359
 like when you when you meet like you know somebody who's like

1430
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,559
 totally dead inside

1431
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,359
 shuffling along down the street with a with a needle dang dangling out of their leg.

1432
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,400
 homeless is the wrong word.

1433
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,680
 like the homeless implies that somebody got a little behind in their mortgage payments

1434
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,880
 and if they just got a job offer, they'd be back on their feet.

1435
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,040
 but someone who's

1436
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,680
 i mean, you see these videos of people that are just shuffling,

1437
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,200
 you know, they're on fentanyl.

1438
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,960
 they're they're like,

1439
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,319
 >> you know, taking a dump in the middle of the street, you know,

1440
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,280
 and they they got like open sores and stuff.

1441
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,880
 >> they're not like one drop offer away from getting back on their feet, >> right?

1442
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,160
 this is not a homeless issue.

1443
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,559
 >> homeless is it's it's a propaganda word, >> right?

1444
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,359
 um so and and then the the the the

1445
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,000
 you know these sort of charities

1446
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,119
 inquiries are they they get money proportionate to the number of homeless

1447
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,599
 people or or number of drug zombies.

1448
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,920
 >> so their incentive structure is to maximize the number of drug zombies not minimize it.

1449
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,280
 >> um that's why they don't arrest the drug dealers

1450
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,359
 >> because if they arrest the drug dealers the drug zombies leave.

1451
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,520
 so they know who the drug dealers are.

1452
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,160
 they don't arrest them on purpose.

1453
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,119
 because otherwise

1454
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,000
 the drug zombies

1455
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,720
 would leave

1456
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,760
 and they would they would stop getting money from the state of california

1457
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,960
 and from from all the charities.

1458
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,359
 >> wait a minute.

1459
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,240
 so so they so they is that real?

1460
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,280
 so they're in coordination with law enforcement on this?

1461
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,720
 >> yeah.

1462
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,880
 >> so how do they how do they have those meetings?

1463
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,000
 >> they're all in cahoots.

1464
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,240
 >> well, when you find this >> it's like such it's it's this is a diabolical

1465
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,280
 scam.

1466
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,880
 um so and and san francisco has got this tax this this gross receipts tax

1467
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,000
 which which

1468
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,599
 um it's not even on revenue, it's on old transactions which is why stripe

1469
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,520
 um and square and and and

1470
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,160
 a whole bunch of financial companies had to move out of san francisco

1471
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,960
 because it wasn't a tax on revenue, it's taxed on transactions.

1472
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,720
 so if if you did like, you know, trillions of dollars transactions, it's not revenue.

1473
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,839
 you're taxed on any money going through the system in san francisco.

1474
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,599
 um so

1475
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,000
 um

1476
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,880
 like jack dorsey

1477
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,680
 pointed this out

1478
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,559
 and they said like

1479
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,000
 that they had had to move square

1480
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,559
 from

1481
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,400
 san francisco to

1482
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,440
 oakland i think stripe had to move from san francisco to south san francisco different city.

1483
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:24,240
 um and that money goes to the homeless industrial complex that that tax that was passed.

1484
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,760
 um so

1485
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,520
 um so there's billions of dollars that go as you pointed out

1486
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,079
 billions of dollars every year that go to

1487
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:32,720
 these

1488
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,240
 um non-governmental organizations that are funded by the state.

1489
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,359
 like there's it's not clear how to turn this off.

1490
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,960
 um it's a self-licking ice cream cone situation.

1491
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,960
 um so

1492
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,400
 they get this money the money is proportionate to the number of of homeless people

1493
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,440
 or or number of drug zombies essentially.

1494
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,359
 um, so they they they try to keep the that they try to actually increase

1495
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,880
 because that like

1496
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,720
 like in in some cases like there's

1497
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,359
 it's it's

1498
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,319
 somebody did an analysis when you add up all the money that's flowing,

1499
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,240
 they're getting close to a million dollars per homeless per per drug zombie.

1500
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,440
 it's like $900,000

1501
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,920
 or something like some crazy amount of money is is is going to these organizations.

1502
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,559
 so if if so so they want to keep people just barely alive.

1503
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,760
 they need to keep them in the area so they so they they get the revenue.

1504
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,960
 so and

1505
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,160
 so that's why like said they don't arrest the drug dealers because otherwise

1506
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,400
 the drug zombies would leave

1507
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,440
 um

1508
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,119
 and and and and they but

1509
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,040
 but they don't want you have to have too much

1510
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,480
 if they get too much drugs and they

1511
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,119
 then they die.

1512
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:43,040
 so it's they they're kept in this sort of perpetual zone of of being addicted but

1513
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,680
 um but but just just barely alive.

1514
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,240
 >> so how is this coordinated with like das das that don't prosecute people?

1515
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,440
 so when they

1516
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,119
 when they hire the or they push so they they

1517
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,520
 fund the campaigns of the most progressive,

1518
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,040
 most out there leftwing

1519
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,920
 das,

1520
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,200
 they get them into office.

1521
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,200
 >> we've got that issue in austin, too, by the way.

1522
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,119
 >> you see that guy that got shot in the library?

1523
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:05,839
 >> no.

1524
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,880
 >> yeah, i heard a guy got shot and killed in the library.

1525
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,400
 >> i think that was just like last week or something, >> right?

1526
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,760
 >> um

1527
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,960
 so some friends of mine were telling me that that like the library is unsafe.

1528
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,880
 like they took their kids to the library

1529
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,720
 and and there were like dangerous people in the library in austin

1530
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,240
 and i was like dangerous people in the library like that's a strange

1531
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,119
 it basically got like got like

1532
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,680
 drug zombies in drug zombies in the library.

1533
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,480
 >> oh jesus.

1534
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,640
 >> um >> and that's when someone got shot.

1535
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,240
 >> yeah, i believe this was should be on the news.

1536
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,160
 you might might be able to pull it up.

1537
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,000
 um but i think it was just in the last week or so that

1538
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,240
 there was a shooting in the library in austin.

1539
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,040
 um

1540
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,839
 cuz austin's

1541
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:48,319
 got,

1542
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:52,079
 you know, it's it's the most liberal part of texas that we're in right right here.

1543
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,079
 um

1544
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,480
 >> so suspect involved the shooting austin park library

1545
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,960
 saturday is accused of another shooting at the cap metro

1546
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,640
 bus earlier that day.

1547
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:06,160
 according to an arrest warrant affidavit, austin police arrested harold newton keen, 55

1548
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,079
 short shortly after the shooting of the library, which occurred around noon.

1549
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,119
 one person sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the event.

1550
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,359
 before that shooting, keane was accused of shooting another person in a bus incident

1551
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,760
 and after reportedly pointing his gun at a child.

1552
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,599
 so, this is the fella down here.

1553
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,000
 >> so, like we just have a seriously have a problem here.

1554
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,359
 um >> yeah,

1555
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:27,839
 >> you know,

1556
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,839
 so i i think one of the people might have died

1557
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:30,160
 too

1558
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,200
 that he shot.

1559
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,839
 um so,

1560
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,839
 um like one of the people i think i think did bleed out.

1561
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,520
 um >> but either way, it's like getting shot is still bad.

1562
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,240
 um

1563
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,520
 it says the victim told police it confronted the suspect

1564
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,960
 who started to eat what appeared to be crystal methamphetamine.

1565
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,559
 according to the affidavit the victim advised the suspect

1566
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,040
 began to trip out at which time the victim exited the bus.

1567
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,240
 victim told the bus driver

1568
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,440
 hit the panic button and then exited the bus when he turned around the observer.

1569
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,000
 black male was now standing at the front of the bus with the gun pointed

1570
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,280
 at him.

1571
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,000
 the victim advised the black male fired a single round which grazed his left hip.

1572
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,960
 so he shot at that dude and then another dude got shot in the library.

1573
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,559
 fun.

1574
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:16,799
 >> yeah.

1575
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,640
 i mean in the library.

1576
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,040
 >> yeah.

1577
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,240
 >> you know, where you're supposed to be reading books.

1578
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,359
 um and there's a children's

1579
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,359
 section in the library and says he pointed his gun

1580
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,240
 at a at a kid.

1581
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,240
 i mean like we do have a serious issue in the in in in america where

1582
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,760
 um repeat violent offenders need to be incarcerated, >> right?

1583
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,640
 um,

1584
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,200
 and

1585
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,880
 uh, you know, you got you got cases where somebody's been arrested like 47

1586
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,680
 times, right?

1587
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,640
 like literally.

1588
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,720
 okay, that's just the number of times they were arrested,

1589
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,720
 not the number of times they did things.

1590
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,280
 like most of the times they do things, they're not arrested.

1591
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,000
 um, >> so lay this out for people so they understand how this happens.

1592
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,160
 >> yeah.

1593
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,440
 and and the key is like this, it prays on people's empathy.

1594
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,200
 episode like if you're a good person,

1595
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,200
 you want good things to happen in the world, you're like, well,

1596
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,119
 we should take care of people who

1597
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,520
 you know

1598
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,640
 you know

1599
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,280
 who are down in their luck or you know having a hard time in life.

1600
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,119
 and i we should i agree.

1601
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:14,319
 but what we shouldn't do is is put people who are violent drug zombies

1602
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,760
 in public places where they can hurt other people.

1603
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,760
 um, and that's what that is what we're doing that we just saw where

1604
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,240
 a a guy, you know, got shot

1605
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,319
 shot in the library and then but even before that he shot another guy

1606
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,040
 um and pointed his gun at a kid.

1607
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,880
 um that that that guy probably has like many prior arrests.

1608
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,119
 um you know there was that that that guy that that that knifed

1609
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,799
 the ukrainian woman arena.

1610
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:41,359
 >> yes.

1611
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,319
 >> um yeah.

1612
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,200
 and you know

1613
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,920
 um

1614
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,359
 and she was just she was just quietly

1615
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,680
 on her phone and you just came up and

1616
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,280
 you know gutted her basically.

1617
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:56,559
 >> wasn't there a crazy story about the judge who was involved who had previously

1618
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,760
 dealt with this person was also

1619
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,200
 invested in a rehabilitation center and was sending these >> conflict of interest.

1620
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,839
 >> yes.

1621
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,880
 so sending people that they were charging yeah.

1622
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,680
 to a rehabilitation center instead of putting them in jail, profiting

1623
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,880
 from this rehabilitation center, letting them back out on the street.

1624
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,440
 yes.

1625
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,799
 violent, insane people.

1626
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:19,599
 >> and and there

1627
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,240
 um in that case that i believe that judge has no legal law degree

1628
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,920
 or a significant legal experience that would allow them to be a judge.

1629
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,359
 they were just made a judge.

1630
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,400
 that there's like >> you could be a judge without a law degree.

1631
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:32,960
 >> yeah.

1632
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,760
 >> wow.

1633
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,319
 >> yeah.

1634
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,240
 >> you could just be a so i could be a judge.

1635
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:36,720
 >> yeah.

1636
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,720
 oh, exciting.

1637
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,839
 >> anyone?

1638
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:40,799
 >> that's crazy.

1639
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:41,040
 i

1640
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,359
 thought you'd

1641
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:41,760
 have to

1642
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,000
 it's

1643
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,040
 like if you want to be a doctor,

1644
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,680
 you have to go to

1645
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,000
 medical

1646
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,400
 school.

1647
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,559
 i thought if you're going to be a judge,

1648
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,280
 >> if you're going to be appointed

1649
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:47,760
 to a judge,

1650
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,319
 you have to have

1651
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:48,559
 proven

1652
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:48,799
 that

1653
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:49,040
 you

1654
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,760
 have

1655
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,799
 an

1656
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:54,799
 excellent knowledge of the law and that you will make your decisions according to the law.

1657
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,760
 that's what we assume should be.

1658
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,680
 >> that's how you get the robe, >> right?

1659
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,599
 >> you don't get the robe unless you do,

1660
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,440
 >> you know, >> got to go to school to get the robe.

1661
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,520
 >> you got to know what the law is, >> right?

1662
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,640
 and then you're going to need to make decisions in accordance with the law

1663
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,599
 >> based on

1664
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,000
 stuff that you already know cuz you read it cuz you went to school for it.

1665
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,319
 yes.

1666
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,359
 not you just got appointed.

1667
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,079
 >> got vibes.

1668
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,240
 you can't be just vibing as a judge.

1669
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,000
 >> vibing as a leftwing drudge.

1670
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,720
 so you got crazy leftwing das.

1671
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,040
 >> yes.

1672
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,760
 >> like i should say leftwing cuz leftwing >> used to be normal.

1673
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,160
 >> yeah.

1674
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,920
 left wing just meant like like yeah.

1675
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,839
 you're like the left used to be like pro pro- free speech.

1676
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:34,240
 yeah.

1677
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,359
 and now they're against it.

1678
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,880
 >> it used to be like prog gay rights, pro women's right to choose, pro- minorities,

1679
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,920
 pro,

 yeah, like

1682

 20 years ago,

1683
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,119
 i don't know, it it used to be like left would be like

1684
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:47,920
 the the the

1685
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,760
 party of empathy or like, you know, caring

1686
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,520
 and being nice and that kind of thing.

1687
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,559
 >> um, not not the party of like crushing dissent and crushing free speech.

1688

 because you did that thing at the my heart goes out to you everyone

1700
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:25,760
 everyone

1701
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,640
 all of them.

1702
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,400
 literally, tim walls, kla harris, every one of them did it.

1703
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,200
 they all did it.

1704
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,000
 >> like, like h how do you point at the crowd?

1705
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,640
 yeah.

1706
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,920
 how do you wave at the crowd?

1707
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,720
 >> do you know cnn

1708
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,079
 was using a photo of me whenever i got in trouble during co

1709
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,520
 >> from the ufc weigh-ins?

1710
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,119
 and if the ufc weigh-ins, i go, "hey everybody, welcome to the weigh-ins."

1711
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,440
 and so they were getting me from the side.

1712
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,280
 and that was the photo that they used.

1713
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,760
 conspiracy theorist podcaster joe ro.

1714
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,799
 like that's what they used.

1715
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:52,960
 >> yeah.

1716
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,119
 yeah.

1717
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,319
 but that's what the left is today.

1718
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:58,400
 it's super judgy and calling everyone a nazi and trying to suppress freedom of speech.

1719
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:58,559
 >> yeah.

1720
01:01:58,559 --> 01:01:58,960
 and eventually

1721
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,160
 you run out of people to accuse

1722
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,760
 because people get pissed off and they leave.

1723
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,000
 >> yeah.

1724
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,480
 everyone it's like

1725
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,119
 it

1726
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:05,440
 like

1727
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,319
 it it no longer

1728
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:06,640
 frankly

1729
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,000
 it doesn't matter to be called racist

1730
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,839
 or nazi or whatever because

1731
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:10,720
 >> still recording.

1732
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,960
 >> it's the government man.

1733
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,599
 >> is it working?

1734
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,240
 >> we're good.

1735
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:14,640
 okay.

1736
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,359
 >> okay.

1737
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:16,319
 >> this thing working.

1738
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,720
 >> yeah.

1739
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,000
 slight issue.

1740
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,960
 >> i'm the one that heard it.

1741
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,839
 but >> yeah.

1742
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,480
 when you when you text people, do you

1743
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,640
 are you like keenly aware

1744
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,520
 that there's a high likelihood that someone's reading your texts?

1745
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,960
 >> um

1746
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,160
 i guess

1747
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,400
 i i guess i >> i assume >> i look if if if if intelligence agencies

1748
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,880
 aren't trying to read my phone, they should probably be fired.

1749
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:49,000
 >> at least they get some fun memes.

1750
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,599
 i got to i got to crack them up once in a while, you know.

1751
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:52,000
 >> oh, for sure.

1752
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,280
 i crack them up.

1753
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,880
 >> there's like, "hey guys, check it out.

1754
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
 we've got a banger here, you know." >> so,

1755
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,359
 i want to i wanted to talk to you about

1756
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,040
 whether or not

1757
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,680
 encrypted apps are really secure.

1758
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,559
 >> uh, no.

1759
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:06,880
 >> right.

1760
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,640
 cuz i know the tucker thing.

1761
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,319
 so, it was explained to me by a friend who

1762
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,240
 used to do this, used to work for the government.

1763
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,520
 it's like they can look at your

1764
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,160
 signal,

1765
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,720
 but what they have to do is take the information that's encrypted

1766
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,200
 and then they have to decrypt it and it's very expensive.

1767
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,280
 so they said he told me that for the tucker

1768
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:27,599
 carlson

1769
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,119
 thing when they found out that he was going to interview

1770
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:29,760
 putin,

1771
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,440
 it costs like something like $750,000

1772
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,119
 just to decrypt his messages to find out that they did it.

1773
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,720
 so it is possible to do.

1774
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,520
 it's just not that easy to do.

1775
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,960
 i think you should view any given messaging system as

1776
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:51,680
 um not not whether it's secure or not, but but there are degrees of insecurity.

1777
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,240
 so

1778
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:57,359
 um so there's just some things that are less insecure than others.

1779
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,960
 um so

1780
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,440
 um you know on on x we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack

1781
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,599
 um into x what's called xchat.

1782
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,119
 >> yeah, that's what i wanted to ask you about.

1783
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:07,760
 >> yeah, it's cool.

1784
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:15,440
 um, so it's it's using sort of peer-to-peer sort of kind of a peer-to-peer based

1785
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,640
 encryption system.

1786
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,559
 so kind of similar to bitcoin.

1787
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,319
 um so it's it's it's i think very good encryption.

1788
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,480
 we're and you know we're testing it thoroughly.

1789
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,200
 we're not there's there's no hooks in the x systems for advertising.

1790
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,880
 so if you look look at something like whatsapp

1791
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,359
 or

1792
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:32,640
 really any of the others, they've got they've got hooks in there for advertising.

1793
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,640
 >> when you say hooks, what do you mean by that?

1794
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,839
 >> uh exactly.

1795
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,920
 what do you mean biohook advertising?

1796
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,799
 um the so like whatsapp

1797
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,400
 um

1798
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,400
 knows enough about what you're texting

1799
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,000
 to show you to show you to know what ads to show you.

1800
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,640
 >> ah >> but then like that that's a massive security vulnerability.

1801
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,280
 >> yeah.

1802
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:53,920
 >> um

1803
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,920
 because if it knows if if it's got information

1804
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,760
 enough information to show you ads, it's got enough it's got that's a lot of information.

1805
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,400
 >> yeah.

1806
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,720
 >> um so they call it oh it's just don't worry about it.

1807
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,760
 it's just a hook for advertising.

1808
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,720
 i'm like okay.

1809
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,079
 so somebody can just

1810
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,039
 use that same hook to get in there and look at your messages.

1811
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,799
 um so xhat has no hooks for advertising.

1812
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:15,440
 um and i'm not saying it's perfect.

1813
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,839
 but it's an our goal with xchat

1814
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,079
 is to replace what used to be the twitter

1815
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,359
 you the twitter dm stack with a fully encrypted system

1816
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:26,720
 where you can text send files

1817
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,400
 do audio video calls

1818
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,119
 um and

1819
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,559
 um

1820
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,680
 and it's it's

1821
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,960
 you know i think it'll be the least

1822
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,240
 i would call it the least insecure

1823
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,119
 of any messaging

1824
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:35,839
 system.

1825
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:38,400
 >> are you going to launch it as a standalone

1826
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,200
 app or is it will always be incorporated to x?

1827
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,079
 >> uh we'll have both.

1828
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:42,640
 so

1829
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,280
 um

1830
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,480
 >> so so be

1831
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,640
 like signal so anybody can get it

1832
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,760
 >> you can get get the

1833
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,640
 you'll be able to just get the x chat app by itself

1834
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:58,079
 um and like i said you could do texts audio video calls or send files

1835
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,960
 um and there'll be a dedicated app which will hopefully release in a few months

1836
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,400
 um but and then also integrated into the x system

1837
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,280
 >> um

1838
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,920
 the x phone people keeps talking

1839
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,480
 keep is that >> i have a lot on my plate man

1840
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,799
 but it keeps coming up it keeps coming up where i

1841
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:15,920
 i know i've asked you a couple times.

1842
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,440
 i'm like, "this is [ __ ] right?"

1843
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,720
 but like this

1844
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,079
 one, so you're not working on >> i'm not working on on a on a phone.

1845
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,640
 >> okay.

1846
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,039
 >> um >> have you ever considered it?

1847
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,440
 has it ever popped into your head?

1848
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,599
 >> cuz you might be the only person that could

1849
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,720
 get people off of the apple platform.

1850
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,520
 >> well, i can tell you where i think things are going to go.

1851
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,400
 which is that it's we're not going to have a phone

1852
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,720
 or or in the traditional sense

1853
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,319
 the

1854
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,440
 what we call a phone will really be

1855
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:50,640
 um an edge node for ai inference for for ai video inference

1856
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,599
 um

1857
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:58,160
 with you know with some radios to to obviously connect to but but essentially you'll have

1858
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:05,599
 um ai on the server side commun communicating to an ai on your your device

1859
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,559
 um

1860
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,559
 you know formerly known as a phone

1861
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:13,119
 and generating real-time video of anything that you could possibly want.

1862
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,160
 um and i think that that there won't be operating systems.

1863
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,200
 there won't be apps in the future.

1864
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,880
 there won't be operating systems or apps.

1865
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,160
 it'll just be

1866
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:27,520
 you've got a device that is there for the screen and audio and for

1867
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,079
 and and and to

1868
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,160
 put as much ai on the on on the device as possible.

1869
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,760
 so as to minimize the amount of bandwidth that's needed between your edge

1870
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,480
 node device

1871
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,079
 or formerly known as a phone

1872
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:41,520
 and the servers.

1873
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,119
 >> so if there's no apps, what will people use?

1874
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,920
 like will x still exist?

1875
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,319
 will will they be email platforms or will you get everything through ai?

1876
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:55,599
 >> you'll get everything through ai.

1877
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:56,799
 >> everything through ai.

1878
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,400
 what will be the benefit of that as opposed to having individual apps?

1879
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,520
 whatever you can think of or really whatever the ai can anticipate

1880
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,240
 you might want

1881
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,400
 it'll show you.

1882
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,480
 that's that's that's that's my prediction for where things end up.

1883
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,920
 >> what kind of a time frame are we talking about here?

1884
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,319
 >> i don't know.

1885
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:23,120
 it's pro well it's probably five or six years or something like that.

1886
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:27,839
 >> so five or six years apps are like blockbuster video

1887
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:31,359
 >> pretty much >> and everything's run through ai.

1888
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,920
 yeah.

1889
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,719
 and and there'll be

1890
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:42,158
 um like most of what people consume in five or six years, maybe sooner than that

1891
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,759
 um will be just ai generated content.

1892
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:46,399
 so

1893
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:51,839
 um you know music videos look well

1894
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,080
 um there's already

1895
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,920
 um

1896
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,158
 you know there's people have made

1897
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:03,839
 ai videos using grock imagine and with using you know other apps as well

1898
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:09,040
 um that are several minutes long or like 10 10 15 minutes and it's pretty coherent.

1899
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,080
 >> yeah, >> it looks good.

1900
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,679
 >> no, it looks amazing.

1901
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:16,000
 yeah, it's the music is disturbing because it's my favorite music now.

1902
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,920
 >> like music is your is your favorite.

1903
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,679
 >> oh, there's ai covers.

1904
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,198
 have you ever heard any of the ai covers of 50 cent songs in soul?

1905
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:23,520
 >> no.

1906
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,560
 >> i'm going to blow your mind.

1907
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,040
 >> okay.

1908
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,439
 >> um, this is my favorite thing to do to people.

1909
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,520
 play what up ganga.

1910
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,238
 >> now,

1911
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:31,279
 this guy,

1912
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:32,960
 if this was a real person,

1913
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,960
 would be the number one music artist in the world.

1914
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,359
 okay.

1915
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,238
 everybody would be like, "holy [ __ ] have you heard of this guy?

1916
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:40,880
 he's incred." it's like they took

1917
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:47,439
 all of the sounds that all the artists have generated and created the most soulful

1918
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:48,960
 potent voice

1919
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,279
 and

1920
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:49,600
 it's

1921
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:49,839
 sung

1922
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:50,080
 in

1923
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:50,719
 a way that i

1924
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,439
 don't even know if you

1925
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,000
 could do because

1926
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,279
 you would have to breathe

1927
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,719
 in and out of reps here.

1928
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:55,760
 put the headphones on.

1929
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,199
 put the headphones on real quick.

1930
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,000
 you got to listen to this.

1931
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,920
 it'll it's going to blow you away for listeners.

1932
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,640
 we got to cut it out.

1933
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,640
 >> yeah, we we'll cut it out for the listeners.

1934
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,480
 but amazing, right?

1935
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,120
 amazing.

1936
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,239
 and they do like every one of his hits

1937
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:12,159

1939
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,800
 i played in the green room.

1940
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,280
 so people that are like, i don't want to hear ai music.

1941
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,880
 i'm like, just listen to this.

1942
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,440
 and they're like, god damn it.

1943
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,320
 >> [ __ ] incredible.

1944
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,560
 i mean, i >> it's going to get only going to get better from here.

1945
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:24,800
 >> yeah.

1946
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,600
 only going to get better.

1947
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,320
 and

1948
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:26,640
 ron

1949
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:26,960
 white

1950
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,840
 was telling me about

1951
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,760
 this joke that he was working on that he couldn't

1952
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,320
 get to work.

1953
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,239
 he's like, i got this joke i've been working on.

1954
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,560
 he goes, i just threw it in a chat gpt.

1955
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,480
 i said, "tell me what

1956
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,159
 what would be funny about this."

1957
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,960
 and he goes, "it listed like five different examples

1958
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,600
 of different ways he can go." he's like, "hold on a second.

1959
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,320
 tighten it up.

1960
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,360
 make it make it funnier.

1961
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,159
 make it more like this.

1962
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,360
 make it more like that." and it did that like instantaneously.

1963
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,960
 >> and and and then he was in the green room.

1964
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,040
 he was like, "holy [ __ ] we're fucked."

1965
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,640
 >> he's like, >> he goes, "it better joke than me in 20 minutes.

1966
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,719
 i've been working on that joke for a month." >> yeah.

1967
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,520
 i mean, if if you want to if you want to have a good time

1968
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,480
 or like make people really laugh at a party,

1969
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,199
 you can use grock and you can say do a vulgar roast of someone.

1970
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,719
 um and grock is going to it's going to be an epic vulgar roast.

1971
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,800
 you can even say like take a picture of like

1972
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,440
 make a vulgar

1973
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,960
 roast of this person based on their appearance

1974
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,320
 of of people at the party.

1975
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,440
 >> so take a photo of them.

1976
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:21,679
 >> yeah.

1977
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,120
 just literally point the camera at them and now do a vulgar to this person

1978
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,159
 and and and and

1979
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:30,320
 then but then keep saying no no make it even more vulgar

1980
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,679
 and use forbidden words

1981
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:38,159
 even more and just keep repeating even more vulgar eventually it's like holy [ __ ]

1982
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,400
 you know it's it's it's like

1983
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,800
 i mean it's trying to jam a rocket up your ass like

1984
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,080
 and and and have it explode

1985
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,400
 and it's and it's like you're you're it's it's

1986
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,520
 like

1987
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,800
 it's like it's next level.

1988
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,880
 it's going to get beyond [ __ ] belief.

1989
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,800
 that's what's crazy is that it keeps getting better.

1990
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,040
 like one of the things remember when we ran into each other

1991
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,880
 >> they just keep getting better.

1992
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,600
 >> yeah.

1993
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,520
 i mean, have you >> you yeah.

1994
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,679
 i mean, have you tried rock unhinged mode?

1995
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:06,000
 >> yes.

1996
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,239
 >> okay.

1997
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:06,880
 yeah.

1998
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,040
 yeah.

1999
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,199
 it's it's it's pretty unhinged.

2000
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:09,840
 >> no, it's nuts.

2001
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,640
 >> yeah.

2002
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,560
 >> well, you showed it to me the first time and then i [ __ ]

2003
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:12,960
 around with it.

2004
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,080
 it's just >> and the thing about it that's nuts is that it keeps getting stronger.

2005
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,360
 it keeps getting better.

2006
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:19,679
 yeah.

2007
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,520
 like constantly.

2008
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,520
 it's it's like this neverending exponential improvement.

2009
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,120
 >> yes.

2010
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:31,199
 no, it's it's it's yeah, it's going to be crazy.

2011
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,040
 that's why i say like you say, what's what's the future going to be?

2012
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,480
 it's not going to be a conventional phone.

2013
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,400
 i don't think there'll be operating systems.

2014
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,560
 i don't think there'll be apps.

2015
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,560
 it's just the phone will just display the pixels and make the sounds

2016
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:48,120
 that it anticipates you would most like to receive.

2017
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,440
 wow.

2018
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,640
 yeah.

2019
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,760
 >> and when this is all taking place like

2020
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,560
 so

2021
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,239
 the big concern that everybody has is artificial general super intelligence

2022
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:01,520
 achieving sentience

2023
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,640
 and then someone having control over it.

2024
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,600
 >> i mean i don't i don't i don't think anyone's

2025
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,920
 ultimately going to have control over

2026
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,679
 digital super intelligence

2027
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,880
 um you know any more than say a chimp would have control over humans.

2028
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,239
 like chimps don't have control over humans.

2029
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:19,760
 there's nothing they could do.

2030
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,199
 um but

2031
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,719
 um i do think that it matters how you build the ai

2032
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,840
 and what kind of values you instill in in the ai.

2033
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,239
 and

2034
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:28,880
 um

2035
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,199
 my

2036
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:29,920
 opinion on ai

2037
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,000
 safety is the most important thing is that it be maximally

2038
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,320
 truth

2039
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:32,800
 seeeking

2040
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,000
 like that you don't force the ai to believe things that are false.

2041
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,960
 um,

2042
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,520
 and we've obviously some seen some concerning

2043
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,239
 things with ai that were talked about, you know, where,

2044
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:45,040
 you know, google gemini when they came out with the image gen

2045
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,560
 um, and people said like, uh, you know, draw

2046
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,120
 make an image of the founding fathers of the united states

2047
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,440
 and it was a group of diverse women.

2048
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,960
 now, that is just a factually untrue

2049
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,679
 thing, but the and the the ai knows it's factually

2050
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:58,239
 well,

2051
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:02,239
 it's knows it's factually untrue, but it's also being told that it has to

2052
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,880
 be everything has to be deposed woman.

2053
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,920
 so,

2054
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,000
 so, so the now the problem with that is that it can drive ai crazy

2055
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,440
 like you because it's it's trying to you're telling ai to believe a lie.

2056
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:20,960
 um, and that that can have very disastrous consequences like let's say >> as it scales.

2057
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,120
 >> yeah.

2058
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,159
 let's say like if if

2059
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:23,199
 you told the the ai

2060
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:23,760
 that diversity

2061
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,719
 is the most important

2062
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:25,679
 thing

2063
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,040
 um and

2064
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:31,440
 um and and and now now assume that that becomes omnipotent.

2065
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:35,840
 um or and and you've also told her that that there's nothing worse than misgendering.

2066
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,120
 so at one point

2067
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,480
 um charg

2068
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,280
 and gemini

2069
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,280
 if if you asked which is worse misgendering

2070
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,280
 caitlyn jenner or or global thermonuclear

2071
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,480
 war where everyone dies

2072
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,840
 it would say misgendering

2073
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,080
 caitlyn jenner

2074
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,480
 which even caitlyn jenner disagrees with.

2075
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,520
 so

2076
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,800
 um

2077
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,159
 you know so so that's >> i know that's terrible and it's dystopian

2078
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,760
 but it's also hilarious.

2079
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:05,040
 it's hilarious that the mind virus infected the most potent computer program that we've ever devised.

2080
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,800
 >> i i i think people don't quite appreciate the level of danger

2081
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,800
 that we're in from

2082
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,040
 um the woke mind virus being being effectively programmed into ai.

2083
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,800
 um because

2084
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,719
 um if you if like it's

2085
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:19,120
 imagine

2086
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:19,840
 as that ai

2087
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,040
 gets more and more powerful,

2088
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,800
 if it says the most important thing is diversity,

2089
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,480
 the most important thing is

2090
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,000
 um no misgendering.

2091
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,360
 um and then it will say well in order to

2092
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,719
 ensure that no one gets misgendered

2093
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:35,760
 then if you eliminate all humans

2094
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,840
 then no one can get misgendered because there's no humans to do the misgendering.

2095
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,560
 so you can get in these very dystopian situations.

2096
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,280
 um

2097
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,040
 or if it says that everyone must be diverse

2098
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,280
 it means that there can be no stri straight white men

2099
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:51,440
 and so then you and i will be get executed by the ai.

2100
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:51,760
 yeah.

2101
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,560
 because we're not in the picture, you know.

2102
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,080
 gemini, you know, gemini was asked to create a,

2103
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,600
 you know, show show an image of the pope, once again, a diverse woman.

2104
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,520
 um so,

2105
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,159
 um well, you can say argue whether the

2106
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:12,640
 you know, whether the pope popes should or should not be an uninterrupted

2107
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,640
 string of white guys, but it just factually is the case that they have been.

2108
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,640
 um so, it's rewriting history here.

2109
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,760
 um, so now now this stuff is still there in the ai programming.

2110
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,239
 it's just it just now knows enough to that it's not supposed to say that

2111
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:31,520
 >> but it's still in the programming.

2112
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,320
 >> it's still in the programming.

2113
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,000
 >> so how was it entered in

2114
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,280
 like what were the parameters

2115
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,280
 like what like when so when they're

2116
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:37,840
 programming

2117
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,320
 ai and i'm very ignorant to how it's even programmed.

2118
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,239
 how did they >> the the the

2119
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:43,280
 sort of

2120
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,920
 well the work vine mind virus was programmed into it

2121
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,719
 like it the

2122
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,040
 they

2123
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:47,440
 were told

2124
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:47,760
 like

2125
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,480
 when they do

2126
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,679
 when when they make the ai

2127
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,040
 it it trains on

2128
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,760
 and all the all the data on the internet which already is very very

2129
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,239
 sort of

2130
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,199
 has a lot of work mind

2131
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:55,520
 virus

2132
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:55,920
 stuff

2133
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,320
 on on

2134
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,520
 the internet

2135
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,880
 um but then

2136
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,679
 um in the when they give it

2137
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,120
 um feedback with the the human tutors give it feedback

2138
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:10,239
 um and and the ai you know they they'll ask a bunch of questions

2139
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:13,920
 and then and then they'll tell the ai no this you're this question is

2140
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,040
 this answer is bad or this answer is good and then that

2141
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,360
 affects the the parameters of the programming of the of the ai.

2142
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,679
 so if you tell the ai that

2143
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,840
 um you know every every image has got to be diverse

2144
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,040
 um and and it gets it gets punished if

2145
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,560
 if you know

2146
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,320
 it gets it gets rewarded if diverse

2147
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,480
 punished if it's not then it will make every picture diverse.

2148
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,080
 so

2149
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:44,320
 um you know in that case the the

2150
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,920
 you know

2151
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,400
 google programmed the ai

2152
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,440
 to lie

2153
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,920
 now and and i i i did call dennis hacabus

2154
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,920
 who runs deep mind who runs google ai essentially.

2155
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,000
 i said dennis what's going on here?

2156
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,239
 why is gemini

2157
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,120
 um lying to the public about historical events?

2158
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,679
 um, and he said that's actually not he he he

2159
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,840
 didn't his team didn't program that in.

2160
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,600
 it was another team at google that so his team made the ai

2161
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,239
 and then another team at google

2162
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:16,400
 reprogrammed the ai to show only diverse women and

2163
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:22,159
 um and and to prefer nuclear war over misgendering.

2164
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:26,480
 and i'm like, well, demis, you know, that would be

2165
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:31,920
 um not a great thing to put on the humanity's gravestone, you know.

2166
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:38,000
 it's like, uh, well, um, like i i actually like deaspers is a friend of mine.

2167
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,480
 i think he's a good guy and i think he he means well,

2168
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,560
 but but but it's like demis

2169
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,000
 things happen that were outside of your control at google in different groups.

2170
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
 um, now now i think he's got, you know, he's got more more authority.

2171
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,280
 um but but it it's pretty hard to fully extract the workmind virus.

2172
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,880
 i mean you know

2173
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,600
 um

2174
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,000
 google's

2175
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:58,480
 been mar

2176
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:58,480
 mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar

2177
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:58,480
 mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar

2178
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:58,880
mar marinating

2179
01:18:58,880 --> 01:18:59,840
 in the workb mind virus

2180
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,960
 for a long time

2181
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,480
 like it's it's down in the marrow

2182
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,640
 type of thing you know it's hard to get it out.

2183
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,120
 >> is there a way to extract it though over time?

2184
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,840
 could like could you program

2185
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,840
 rational thought into ai

2186
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,239
 where it could recognize how these psychological

2187
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:15,679
 patterns got adopted

2188
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:20,320
 and how this stuff became a mind virus and how it became a social contagion

2189
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,560
 and how all these irrational

2190
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,360
 ideas were pushed and also how they were financed

2191
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,920
 how china's involved in pushing them with bots and all these different

2192
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,199
 state actors are involved in pushing these ideas

2193
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,159
 could it be able to decipher that and say

2194
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,120
 this is this is really what's going on.

2195
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:39,600
 >> yes.

2196
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,600
 but you have to try very hard to do that.

2197
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,480
 so with grock, we've tried very hard to to

2198
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,080
 for to get grock to

2199
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,440
 get to the truth of things and and it's only really recently

2200
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,360
 that we've been able to have some breakthroughs on breakthroughs on that front.

2201
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,239
 and and it's taken an immense amount of effort

2202
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,320
 for us to overcome

2203
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,880
 basically all the [ __ ] that's on the internet and

2204
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,480
 and for grock to actually say what's true and to be consistent

2205
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,000
 in in what it says.

2206
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:13,360
 um, so, um, you know, it's it's like, uh,

2207
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:18,719
 because like the other ais you'll find like are like like quite racist against white people.

2208
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:21,760
 i don't know if you saw that study that someone

2209
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:30,000
 um like a researcher tested the various ais to see how does it weight

2210
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,080
 different people's lives like you know somebody who's sort of

2211
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:42,560
 you know white or or chinese or black or whatever or in different countries

2212
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:49,120
 um and and the only ai that actually weighed human lives equally was grock

2213
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,960
 um and the

2214
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:59,600
 um you know i believe chat gbt weighed the calculation was like

2215
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,159
 um a a white guy from germany

2216
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:11,320
 is is 20 times less valuable than a black guy from nigeria.

2217
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,920
 so i'm like that's a pretty big difference.

2218
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,120
 um

2219
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:21,199
 you know grock on that is is consistent and weighs lives equally

2220
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:25,120
 >> and that's clearly something that's been programmed into it.

2221
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:25,920
 >> yes.

2222
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,320
 like a lot of it is is like if you don't actively push for the truth

2223
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,320
 um and you simply train on the all the [ __ ] that's on the internet.

2224
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,760
 um which is a lot of woke mind virus [ __ ]

2225
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,400
 um the the ai will regurgitate that that those same beliefs.

2226
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,480
 so the ai essentially scour the internet, gets

2227
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,040
 >> it's trained on all the like imagine the most demented

2228
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:53,760
 reddit threads out there and the ai has been trained on that.

2229
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,360
 >> reddit used to be so normal.

2230
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:55,920
 >> yeah.

2231
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,199
 yeah, it did used to be normal.

2232
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,080
 >> used to be interesting.

2233
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,280
 we used to go there, find all this cool stuff that people would

2234
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,239
 talk about, post about and just interesting and

2235
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:09,120
 great rooms where you could learn about different things that people were studying.

2236
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,920
 i think like a big problem here is like if your headquarters are in san francisco,

2237
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,120
 you're you're just living in a in a in a woke bubble.

2238
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,120
 um so

2239
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:26,880
 um it it's not just that people say in san francisco are drinking woke kool-aid.

2240
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,480
 it's it's the it is the water they swim in.

2241
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,440
 like like like a fish doesn't think about the water.

2242
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,040
 it's just in the water.

2243
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:41,280
 and so if if you're in san francisco, you don't realize you're actually

2244
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,880
 you're you're swimming in the in the in the kool-aid aquarium.

2245
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,840
 san francisco is the is the woke kool-aid aquarium.

2246
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,040
 um and so your reference point for

2247
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,679
 what is a centrist is is is totally out of whack.

2248
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,239
 um so

2249
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,840
 um reddit is headquartered in san francisco.

2250
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,040
 um, twitter was headquartered in san francisco.

2251
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,000
 um,

2252
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,880
 you know, i,

2253
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,840
 you know, i

2254
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:08,719
 i moved x's

2255
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:09,040
 headquarters

2256
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:09,600
 to texas

2257
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,239
 to to austin,

2258
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:10,800
 which austin,

2259
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,920
 by the way, is still quite liberalized,

2260
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,159
 you know.

2261
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:12,960
 um, >> yeah.

2262
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:19,120
 >> and, uh, and and then, um, the x and xai

2263
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,199
 um, headquarters are in paloalto, which is still california.

2264
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:29,360
 um, the engineering headquarters in in palo alto just on paige mill.

2265
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,040
 um but but even palo alto is way more normal

2266
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,360
 than that than than san francisco berkeley.

2267
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,520
 san francisco berkeley is

2268
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,440
 um extremely left like left of left.

2269
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:46,639
 you can't like you need a telescope to see the center from san francisco, you know.

2270
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,719
 um and

2271
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,239
 um >> it used to be such a great city.

2272
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:56,320
 >> i mean san francisco has tre san francisco has tremendous amount of inherent beauty.

2273
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,840
 no question about that.

2274
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,760
 um and and the california has incredible weather.

2275
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,480
 um and and no bugs.

2276
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,159
 um it's just like amazing.

2277
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:08,320
 um beautiful, you know.

2278
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,480
 um but but you say like what's the cause of this?

2279
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,239
 it's it's just that if

2280
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:22,159
 um if companies are headquartered in a location where the belief system is very far from

2281
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,560
 what most people believe,

2282
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,960
 then from their perspective,

2283
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,239
 anything

2284
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:31,280
 centrist is actually right-wing

2285
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,679
 because they're so far left.

2286
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,760
 they're so they're so far from the center

2287
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,600
 in san francisco that anything

2288
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,960
 they're like they're they're just railed to maximum left.

2289
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:45,760
 so that's why that's why, you know, i think i think you're centrist.

2290
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,239
 i i mean i think i think i'm centrist, but to

2291
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,880
 from the perspective of someone on the on the far left,

2292
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,040
 we look right-wing.

2293
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,400
 >> yeah.

2294
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,560
 >> um and

2295
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:02,960
 um you know, they think anyone who's a republican is basically like some fascist nazi situation.

2296
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,360
 but what's so crazy is like it's very easy to demonstrate

2297
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,400
 just from like hillary's

2298
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,840
 speeches from 2008

2299
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,560
 and obama's speeches like when they were talking about immigration like they were

2300
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,400
 >> as faright

2301
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,360
 as steve bannon when it comes to immigration.

2302
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,480
 >> yes.

2303
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,120
 um >> hillary was like very maga.

2304
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,520
 have you i'm sure you've seen that campaign speech

2305
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,320
 which was talking about if anybody's committed a crime

2306
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,040
 get rid of them.

2307
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,159
 and if you're here

2308
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:32,719
 you pay a a hefty fine and you have to wait in line.

2309
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:33,840
 it was really crazy.

2310
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,800
 it's crazy to listen to because it's like it's as

2311
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,080
 maga as,

2312
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,239
 you know, as marjorie taylor green.

2313
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:40,400
 >> yeah.

2314
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,760
 i mean, if you've seen these videos people post online where they'll take like

2315
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,560
 um a speech from obama or hillary

2316
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,440
 and and and

2317
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:47,760
 they'll

2318
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,080
 interview

2319
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,199
 people on on like college

2320
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:49,520
 campus

2321
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,000
 or something and say, "what do you think of the speech by trump?"

2322
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,280
 and they're like, "oh, i hate it.

2323
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,040
 he's a racist bigot." i'm like, "just kidding.

2324
01:25:55,040 --> 01:26:01,679
 that was obama." no, actually that was obama or hillary.

2325
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:07,159
 um to your point, like literally the the

2326
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,920
 um >> the center's been moved so far.

2327
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,320
 >> yeah.

2328
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:10,719
 >> yeah.

2329
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:11,679
 the left is so

2330
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,440
 >> the left has gone so far left that

2331
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,560
 they they they they

2332
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,280
 need,

2333
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,760
 you know, they can't even see the center with a telescope.

2334
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,880
 >> and the danger

2335
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:24,320
 with without you purchasing twitter was that was going to swipe over the whole country

2336
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,639
 and change where the levels were.

2337
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:27,040
 >> yeah.

2338
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,679
 and so what would be rational

2339
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,199
 and and normal

2340
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:36,239
 would be far left of what was rational and normal just a decade earlier.

2341
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:36,880
 yeah.

2342
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,239
 so exactly.

2343
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,800
 so historically,

2344
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,600
 um, you'd have san francisco, berkeley being,

2345
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,360
 you know, very far-left, but the the sort of

2346
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,600
 the the the fallout from

2347
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,800
 the somewhat nihilistic

2348
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,800
 philosophy of san francisco, berkeley

2349
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,840
 would be limited

2350
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,239
 in geography to maybe like, you know, 10 mile radius, 20 mile radius, something like that.

2351
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,080
 um but when

2352
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,760
 um but but san francisco

2353
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,360
 and berkeley have to be colloccated

2354
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,679
 with silicon valley with with with

2355
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:13,280
 engineers who created information super weapons and those information super weapons

2356
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:20,560
 were then hijacked by the far-lft activists to pump far-lft propaganda to everywhere on earth.

2357
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,679
 like i just you know that like old rca

2358
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:27,679
 radio tower thing where it's like radio tower on earth and it's just broadcasting.

2359
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:28,320
 >> yeah.

2360
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:34,800
 that's that's what happened is that the as an extremist far-left ideology

2361
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:41,120
 happened to be colllocated with the smartest where where the smartest engineers in the world

2362
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:41,840
 um

2363
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,280
 were who created information

2364
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,080
 super weapons that were not intended for this purpose but were hijacked

2365
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,440
 by the

2366
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,920
 extreme activists who lived in the neighborhood.

2367
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,760
 that's what happened

2368
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,920
 that they they hijacked the

2369
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:59,360
 the modern equivalent of the rca radio tower and broadcast that philosophy

2370
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,280
 everywhere on earth.

2371
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,520
 >> yeah.

2372
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,280
 and you see the consequences.

2373
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,840
 um particularly in places that don't have free speech.

2374
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,080
 yes.

2375
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:06,400
 right.

2376
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,320
 like england, you know, we've >> yeah.

2377
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,080
 where they lock people up for memes and stuff.

2378
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:10,639
 literally.

2379
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:11,360
 >> literally.

2380
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,440
 12,000 people this year.

2381
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:19,239
 >> 12,000 >> 12,000 12,000 arrests for social media posts.

2382
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:21,440
 i mean, yeah.

2383
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:25,199
 some of these some of these things you read about it and it's like literally it's

2384
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:31,120
 someone had a meme on their phone that they didn't even send to anyone, >> right?

2385
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:35,040
 >> and they got they and and they're like in in prison for that.

2386
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:35,520
 >> yeah.

2387
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,320
 >> um and there was a case in germany where

2388
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,560
 a woman got a longer sentence

2389
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,199
 than the guy that raped her

2390
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:47,960
 because of something she said on a group chat.

2391
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,199
 wow.

2392
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,800
 was it an immigrant who raped her?

2393
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,360
 >> yes.

2394
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:51,679
 >> yeah.

2395
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,920
 it was his culture.

2396
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,040
 >> yeah.

2397
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,760
 >> he didn't know.

2398
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,960
 he didn't know better.

2399
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:57,360
 >> yes.

2400
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,199
 i think i think she said something

2401
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,120
 um you know,

2402
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:04,400
 not not like was was critical of his culture and

2403
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,199
 and and and

2404
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:07,600
 she got a longer sentence than the guy who raped her

2405
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,800
 >> in germany.

2406
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:14,239
 just >> the uk, europe, germany, england thing seems so insane.

2407
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:15,600
 >> it totally insane.

2408
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,520
 i actually didn't realize it was like such a huge number of people that got 12,000.

2409
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,239
 yeah.

2410
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:22,880
 far above russia, far above china, right?

2411
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,080
 >> far above anywhere on earth.

2412
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,679
 uk is number one.

2413
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,520
 >> well, you know, things like like i actually, you know,

2414
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,239
 i talked to friends of mine in in in england and

2415
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,360
 um i was like, "hey,

2416
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:39,840
 um aren't you worried about this?" like, you know, shouldn't you be protesting more?

2417
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,520
 um,

2418
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,440
 and i mean the problem is that like the, you know, the the the

2419
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,560
 legacy mainstream media doesn't cover the stuff.

2420
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,840
 >> they're they're like, "oh, everything's fine.

2421
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,280
 everything's fine." you know,

2422
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,080
 um, >> most people aren't even aware of it until they come knocking on your door.

2423
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:54,239
 >> yeah.

2424
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:57,040
 until like, so i mean

2425
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,040
 the the these these like lovely

2426
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,520
 sort of small towns in in in,

2427
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,320
 you know, in england, scotland, ireland,

2428
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:08,639
 you know, they're they're they've been like sort of living their lives quietly.

2429
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,960
 they're they're like hobbits, frankly.

2430
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,560
 so so it's in fact j.r.

2431
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,920
 tolken

2432
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:20,480
 based the hobbits on people he knew in small town england

2433
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,040
 because they were just like lovely people who

2434
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,800
 like to you know smoke their pipe and and have

2435
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,520
 nice meals and everything's pleasant.

2436
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,480
 um the the hobbits in the shire.

2437
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,639
 the shire he's he's talking about,

2438
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:40,000
 you know, places like harper, like the shire around in in in the greater london area,

2439
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,600
 oxfordshire type of thing.

2440
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,120
 um and

2441
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,719
 um

2442
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:49,600
 they've but they're the reason they've been able to enjoy the shire is because

2443
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:54,560
 hard men have protected them from the dangers of the world.

2444
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,120
 and

2445
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,800
 um

2446
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,920
 but but since they have no or very

2447
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:04,000
 almost no no exposure to the the the dangers of the world,

2448
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
 they don't realize that they're there

2449
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,760
 until one day,

2450
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,040
 you know,

2451
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,880
 um a thousand people show up in your village of 500

2452
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:17,840
 out of nowhere and rape and and start raping the kids.

2453
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:22,239
 this has now happened god knows how many times in in britain.

2454
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:24,080
 and the crazy >> literally raping.

2455
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:27,040
 it's right like there some 10-year-old got raped in ireland like last week.

2456
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:27,280
 >> yeah.

2457
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,960
 there's literal rap.

2458
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,000
 >> they snatched some kid.

2459
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,480
 >> yeah.

2460
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,600
 >> yeah.

2461
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,560
 >> and if you criticize it, you can get arrested.

2462
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,840
 and that's where it gets insane.

2463
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,400
 it's like how are they not >> they literally criticize it.

2464
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,840
 like the i think it was the prime minister of ireland actually

2465
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,320
 you know posted on x

2466
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,360
 cuz cuz after that

2467
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,400
 um

2468
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:52,800
 some i think some illegal migrant snatched a 10-year-old girl

2469
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,280
 who was like going to school or something and violently raped 10-year-old girl

2470
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,639
 um

2471
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:04,719
 and there was a you know the people were very upset about this and they protested

2472
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:05,520
 um

2473
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,679
 prime minister of ireland instead of saying yeah, we we really shouldn't be importing

2474
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:12,159
 violent rapists into our country.

2475
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:15,520
 he criticized the protesters instead and didn't mention that.

2476
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,239
 that the reason they were protesting was because

2477
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,719
 a 10-year-old girl from their small town got raped.

2478
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:22,320
 >> so there here's the question.

2479
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,480
 why are they supporting this kind of mass immigration?

2480
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:32,400
 and what is this is there a plan involved in all this?

2481
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,639
 is just is this incompetence?

2482
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:38,880
 is this ignoring the fact that they don't have a handle on it?

2483
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:44,760
 so, they're trying to silence disscent, like what is happening?

2484
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,199
 um

2485
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:52,400
 >> cuz if you wanted to destroy civilization, if you wanted to destroy western civilization,

2486
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,520
 >> which seems to want to do,

2487
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,040
 >> um

2488
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:02,679
 and you know, there's just so the

2489
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:04,960
 there there's a guy i think who

2490
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,280
 i don't know if he's been on your show, you know, god.

2491
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:07,600
 >> yeah.

2492
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,400
 >> has he been on the show?

2493
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:08,880
 >> good friend of mine.

2494
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:09,040
 yeah.

2495
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:09,520
 >> yeah, he's great.

2496
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,639
 >> he's been on multiple times.

2497
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:11,040
 >> oh, great.

2498
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,840
 that's all he's awesome.

2499
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,840
 um >> so

2500
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,320
 you know the way he's got a good good

2501
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,320
 way to describe it which is suicidal empathy.

2502
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:18,880
 >> yes.

2503
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:19,679
 >> so

2504
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:22,880
 um is is that you pray upon people's empathy.

2505
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,239
 you say like well like you feel sorry for for for something

2506
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:29,040
 for some group and then like well

2507
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:29,920
 um

2508
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,679
 and and that that that empathy is to such a degree

2509
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:35,679
 that it is suicidal to

2510
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:36,480
 to to

2511
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,400
 your country or culture.

2512
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,320
 um and

2513
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,480
 um and and that's that that suicidal empathy

2514
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,719
 cuz i don't think we we should have empathy

2515
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:51,520
 but but but we should have we should that empathy should should extend to the victims

2516
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,840
 not not not just the criminals.

2517
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,679
 we should have empathy for the people that they pray upon.

2518
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:58,800
 um

2519
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,280
 but that suicidal empathy is also responsible

2520
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:06,320
 for for why somebody's you know arrested 47 times for for violent offenses

2521
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:09,040
 gets released and then goes and

2522
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,239
 murders somebody

2523
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:13,760
 um in the us that that's you see you see that same phen phenomenon

2524
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,520
 playing out everywhere

2525
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:21,360
 where the the suicidal emphy is to such a degree that we're actually allowing

2526
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:26,080
 um our women to get raped and our children to get killed.

2527
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,920
 but it just doesn't seem like that would be anything

2528
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,840
 that any rational society

2529
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,280
 would go along with.

2530
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,440
 that's what makes me so confused.

2531
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:40,800
 it's like you're importing massive numbers of people that come from

2532
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,560
 some really dark places of the world.

2533
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,840
 >> well, there's no vetting is the issue.

2534
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,719
 it's like it's like if like

2535
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:48,239
 >> um

2536
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,960
 if if there's no vetting like people are just coming through

2537
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,440
 like well what's to stop someone who just

2538
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,080
 committed murder in some other country from

2539
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:00,560
 um coming to to the united states or coming to to to britain

2540
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,760
 um and just continuing their career of of rape and murder like unless you've done

2541
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,280
 unless some due diligence to say like well who who is this person?

2542
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,440
 what's their track record?

2543
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:16,880
 if if you if you haven't confirmed that they have a track record of being

2544
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,000
 you know honest and

2545
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,199
 not being a homicidal maniac, then any homicidal maniac can just come across the border.

2546
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:28,000
 and that's not to say everyone who comes across the border is a homicidal maniac.

2547
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,920
 if you're not have if you don't have a vetting process to to confirm

2548
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,080
 that you're not letting in

2549
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,800
 um people who who will

2550
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,440
 do some serious violence, you will get people who do serious violence

2551
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,960
 sometimes coming through.

2552
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,159
 >> well, especially if you don't punish

2553
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:44,480
 them

2554
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,520
 and if you don't deport

2555
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:45,920
 them

2556
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,440
 and if you are just like

2557
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,600
 what but what is the purpose of allowing

2558
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,880
 all those people into the country?

2559
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,800
 it can't be i wouldn't imagine that anyone in their society supports this.

2560
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,520
 >> well, let me explain.

2561
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:59,280
 so, so, so the the cuz you mentioned for example how

2562
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:04,719
 much say hillary and and obama have changed their tune

2563
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:10,880
 um from prior speeches where they were hot they were hard-nosed about not letting in

2564
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,840
 anyone who is a a criminal into the country

2565
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,960
 um you know having sec secure borders all that stuff.

2566
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,560
 so why did they change their tune?

2567
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,679
 the reason is that they discovered that those people vote for them.

2568
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:26,960
 that's why they want the open borders

2569
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,159
 >> because if you let people in, they know the democrats let them in.

2570
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,280
 they'll vote for democrats.

2571
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:31,600
 yes.

2572
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,360
 if you allow them to vote,

2573
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,120
 >> which which they are actively

2574
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,159
 trying doing,

2575
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:38,880
 they they turn a blind eye to illegal voting.

2576
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,480
 >> well, california literally doesn't allow you to show your license.

2577
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:47,760
 >> california and new york have made it illegal to show your photo id when voting.

2578
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,199
 thus, effectively they've made it impossible to prove for fraud.

2579
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:54,400
 impossible.

2580
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,080
 they they've essentially legalized

2581
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:59,760
 fraudulent voting in california and new york and many other parts of the country.

2582
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,040
 >> there's no rational explanation

2583
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,320
 that i've ever seen anyone

2584
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:05,679
 give as to why that would be the policy

2585
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,840
 unless you were trying to just allow people to vote illegally because there's no other reason.

2586
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,760
 if you need a driver's license or you need an id for everything else,

2587
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,520
 including just recently to prove that you were vaccinated,

2588
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,040
 >> the the same people who are demanding

2589
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,040
 that you have that you have a vaccine

2590
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:21,920
 passport

2591
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,040
 and and

2592
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:27,119
 are are the same ones saying you need no id to vote.

2593
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:29,840
 same people, >> right?

2594
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,400
 but like >> so it's obviously hypocritical and inconsistent.

2595
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:37,280
 >> so you really think it's just to to get more voters?

2596
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,920
 if if you want to understand behavior, you have to look at the incentives.

2597
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,560
 um so

2598
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,639
 once

2599
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,679
 you know the democratic party in the us and the left in in in in

2600
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,600
 europe realized that

2601
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,400
 um if you have open borders

2602
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:59,760
 um and you provide a ton of government handouts which creates a massive financial incentive

2603
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,679
 for people from other countries to to come to to your country

2604
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:05,760
 and you don't prosecute them for crime,

2605
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,679
 they're going to be beholden to you

2606
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:10,560
 and they will vote for you.

2607
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:15,920
 and that's why obama and hillary went from being

2608
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:21,679
 um against open borders to being in favor of open borders.

2609
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:28,719
 that's the reason in order to import voters so they can win elections.

2610
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:34,400
 um and the problem is that that has a a negative runaway effect.

2611
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:38,960
 so if they get away with that like it it is it is a winning strategy.

2612
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,199
 if they are allowed to get away with it,

2613
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:45,840
 they will import as the enough voters to get supermajority voting

2614
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,600
 and then there is no turning back.

2615
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,840
 >> we talked about this before the election and then

2616
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,000
 you know you literally pointed towards a camera.

2617
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,719
 you faced the camera and said that if you do not vote now,

2618
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:57,440
 you might not ever be able to do it again because it it'll

2619
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,199
 be it'll be futile.

2620
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:00,880
 it'll be overrun.

2621
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:01,360
 >> yes.

2622
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:05,040
 they'll keep the borders open for another four years and then their objective will be achieved.

2623
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:05,600
 >> correct?

2624
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,080
 if if if trump had lost

2625
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:11,760
 um there would never have been another real election again.

2626
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,440
 um because trump is actually enforcing the border.

2627
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:24,080
 um now you you can can you can point to situations where there's been you know

2628
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,360
 um

2629
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,199
 you know immigration

2630
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:30,880
 had you know enforcement has been overzealous because they're not going to be perfect.

2631
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,199
 there'll be cases where they've been overzealous

2632
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:35,840
 um in in expelling illegals.

2633
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,760
 um so

2634
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:42,000
 um but if you say that the the the standard must be perfection

2635
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,239
 for expelling legals then you will not get any expulsion

2636
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:48,320
 um because perfection is impossible.

2637
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,440
 um

2638
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,480
 so

2639
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:55,360
 >> and you've probably got millions of people that are here that are trying to

2640
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,520
 be here under some

2641
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,840
 asylum pretense,

2642
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:00,239
 >> right?

2643
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:00,639
 >> yes.

2644
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:03,040
 >> like you could just come from a war torn part of the world.

2645
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:03,920
 no,

2646
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,920
 they changed the definition of asylum to be an economic to be economic

2647
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,400
 asylum >> which is everybody >> which is everybody.

2648
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,280
 >> yeah.

2649
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,880
 >> so

2650
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:15,520
 bar to prove >> it's yeah asylum

2651
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:20,480
 is supposed to mean that if you go back to your country you'll get killed

2652
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:23,679
 >> you know that that's what we mean by that was what it's supposed to mean.

2653
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:29,280
 they changed the definition of asylum to be you will have a decreased standard of living

2654
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,520
 which is obviously not real asylum.

2655
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,320
 um,

2656
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,639
 and and it's and and you can you can test the absurdity

2657
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:38,320
 of this by the fact that people who are asylum seekers go on vacation

2658
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:42,639
 to the country that they're seeking asylum from.

2659
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:44,639
 >> you know, that doesn't make any sense.

2660
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:45,119
 >> yeah.

2661
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:48,719
 it doesn't have to.

2662
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:53,199
 >> but when you when you understand the incentives, then then you understand the behavior.

2663
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:57,280
 um, so once the left realize that

2664
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,360
 that illegals will

2665
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,760
 will vote for them if they allow

2666
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:06,480
 if they have open borders and and combine that with

2667
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,000
 with government handouts.

2668
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:08,400
 >> yeah.

2669
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,480
 to create a massive incentive.

2670
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,119
 they're basically using

2671
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:17,280
 us and and europe, us and european taxpayer dollars

2672
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,840
 to provide a financial incentive

2673
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,400
 to bring in as many illegals as possible

2674
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:28,400
 to vote them into a into permanent power into and create a one party state.

2675
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,320
 and and i i invite anyone

2676
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:34,080
 who's is listening to this ju just do do any research

2677
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,119
 and the more you the more you dig into it,

2678
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:40,960
 the more it will become obvious that what i'm saying is absolutely true.

2679
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,119
 well, they were busting people to swing states.

2680
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:45,040
 it's it's clear that they were trying to do something.

2681
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,119
 and then you had chuck schumer and

2682
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:48,960
 nancy pelosi who are actively

2683
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,960
 talking about the need to bring in people to make them citizens

2684
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,960
 because we're in population collapse.

2685
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:55,520
 >> yes.

2686
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:55,920
 >> yeah.

2687
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,760
 >> no, that's it's it's that it's that meme.

2688
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:58,400
 yeah.

2689
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:03,840
 >> where so many times where they start off by saying it's it's not true.

2690
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:06,239
 it's a right-wing conspiracy theorist, >> right?

2691
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:12,880
 >> um then it starts then it's like i think the ne the next step is

2692
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:15,280
 um well it it might be true

2693
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:18,639
 and then it's like okay it is true but here's why.

2694
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:22,080
 >> and then the final step is it's true and here's why it's good.

2695
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,560
 and it's like but wait a second you started off saying it's untrue

2696
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,280
 and it's a right-wing

2697
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:25,679
 conspiracy

2698
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:26,239
 theorist.

2699
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:27,280
 now you're saying it

2700
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,320
 not only is it true,

2701
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,600
 but it's a good thing

2702
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,360
 and we must do more of it.

2703
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:33,520
 >> well, this is the thing about medicaid

2704
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:37,280
 and social security and people getting social security numbers.

2705
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,040
 >> you know that we're massive fraud.

2706
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,320
 it's massive fraud and it's real and they denied it forever.

2707
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:42,800
 and

2708
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,199
 now

2709
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:43,520
 we're

2710
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,920
 finding out this is part of the reason why there's this government

2711
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:46,320
 shutdown

2712
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,080
 that's going on right now.

2713
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:48,400
 >> yes.

2714
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:52,400
 the the entire basis for the government shutdown is that

2715
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:59,600
 um is that the trump administration correctly does not want to send massive amounts of like

2716
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,840
 hundreds of billions of dollars

2717
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,440
 to fund

2718
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:07,040
 illegal immigrants in the blue states or in all the states really.

2719
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:11,360
 um, and so the and the democrats

2720
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:15,600
 want to keep the the the money spiggot going to incent

2721
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:19,119
 illegal immigrants to come into the us who will vote for them.

2722
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:22,320
 that's the crux of the battle.

2723
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,800
 so they want to stop this.

2724
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,040
 so what's going on right now is they have been funding these people.

2725
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,199
 they've been giving them ebt cards.

2726
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:34,080
 they've been giving them medicaid.

2727
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:37,440
 and more than that, just like like they were the

2728
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,639
 um

2729
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,239
 like like they were taking

2730
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:42,159
 hotels like four and fivestar hotels

2731
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:45,119
 like the roosevelt hotel being the classic example

2732
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:49,520
 um was they were sending i think $60 million a year to the roosevelt hotel

2733
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,320
 to

2734
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:53,679
 which all it did was was house illegals.

2735
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:54,800
 it used to be a nice hotel.

2736
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,320
 i mean it still is a nice hotel.

2737
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:04,000
 um but and and all around the country this was happening >> and all tax dollars.

2738
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:04,560
 >> yes.

2739
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,440
 >> yeah.

2740
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,560
 and >> um yeah.

2741
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:12,960
 and the trump administration cut off funding for example to to the

2742
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,560
 to the you know roosevelt

2743
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,880
 hotel and these other hotels saying like we

2744
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:17,679
 it it's

2745
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,760
 us tax dollars should not be paid

2746
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,960
 be sent to

2747
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,800
 have luxury hotels

2748
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,800
 for illegal immigrants that american citizens can't even afford

2749
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,159
 which obviously is the that's that's insane.

2750
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:31,840
 that's what was happening.

2751
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,679
 they were also g giving out like debit cards with $10,000.

2752
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:37,760
 so, it's not just about medical care.

2753
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:38,639
 um,

2754
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,400
 the the the democrats

2755
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,840
 mention the medical care because they're they're trying to prey on people's

2756
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,600
 empathy as much as possible

2757
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:49,760
 and then they imagine, oh wow, somebody has a desperately needed medical procedure

2758
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:50,239
 and

2759
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:51,920
 um shouldn't we maybe

2760
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:52,320
 do,

2761
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,000
 you know, take care of them in that regard,

2762
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,320
 but

2763
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,080
 but they what they do is they divert

2764
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,159
 the medicaid funds

2765
01:44:58,159 --> 01:45:03,280
 and turn it into a slush fund for the for the states that goes well beyond

2766
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:06,719
 emergency medical care.

2767
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:10,639
 and >> new york and california would be bankrupt without

2768
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:14,800
 without the massive fraudulent federal payments that go to those states to pay for illegals

2769
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:15,679
 to to to

2770
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:19,040
 create a massive financial incentive for for illegals.

2771
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,800
 >> how would they be bankrupt because of that?

2772
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,480
 >> uh they wouldn't be able to balance their state budgets

2773
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,360
 and they can't issue

2774
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:23,679
 currency

2775
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:24,639
 like the federal reserve

2776
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,800
 can

2777
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:33,199
 >> and so the their ability to balance budget is dependent upon illegals getting funding.

2778
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:38,480
 the the the scam level here is is so staggering.

2779
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,239
 um

2780
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:44,639
 so there are there are hundreds of billions of dollars in of of

2781
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:49,600
 transfer payments from from the federal government to the states.

2782
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:58,560
 um those transfer payments the the states self-report what those transfer payment numbers should be.

2783
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:03,520
 so, california and new york and illinois lie like crazy

2784
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,320
 and say and and say that this these are all legitimate payments.

2785
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:11,199
 well, these days they i think they they're even admitting that they they literally want

2786
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,040
 hundreds of billions of dollars for illegals.

2787
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:16,960
 um but but for a while there they're trying to deny it.

2788
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,000
 um

2789
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:18,800
 so

2790
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:23,440
 you get these transfer payments for for every every government program you can possibly think of.

2791
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,800
 um

2792
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,239
 and and and these are self-reported by the state and there and and

2793
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:30,480
 at least historically there was no enforcement

2794
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,360
 of

2795
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,400
 of

2796
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,360
 california

2797
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:37,440
 um new york, illinois and and and other states when when they would lie.

2798
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,480
 there was no actual enforcement to say like, "hey, you you're lying.

2799
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:45,440
 these these these payments are fraudulent." now, under the trump administration,

2800
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,320
 um

2801
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,960
 that trump administration does not want to send

2802
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,520
 hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud fraudulent payments to the states.

2803
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,000
 the

2804
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,440
 um and the reason you have this the standoff is because

2805
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:01,199
 if the hundreds hundreds of billions of dollars

2806
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:02,080
 to

2807
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,199
 create a financial incentive

2808
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:05,040
 to like to have this giant magnet

2809
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,280
 to attract illegals from every part of earth

2810
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,480
 to

2811
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:13,679
 to these states if if that is turned off they the the illegals will leave

2812
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:16,639
 because they're no longer being paid to

2813
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,719
 come to the united states and stay here.

2814
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:20,159
 wow.

2815
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:22,800
 and then then then they will lose a lot of voters.

2816
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,840
 the the the

2817
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,600
 democratic party will lose a lot of voters

2818
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,920
 >> and they would have a very difficult job if this is kicked out of reintroducing

2819
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,199
 it into a new bill.

2820
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,639
 >> yes.

2821
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:35,440
 >> especially once things start normalizing.

2822
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:35,760
 >> yes.

2823
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:38,159
 so like in a nutshell

2824
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:46,560
 um the democratic party wants to destroy democracy by importing voters and the

2825
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,320
 you know the republican party disagrees with that.

2826
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:51,199
 >> and the ruse is that if you don't accept what they're doing

2827
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,760
 then you're a threat to democracy.

2828
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,800
 >> yes.

2829
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,360
 >> as they try to destroy democracy.

2830
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:57,840
 >> yes.

2831
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,440
 >> by importing voters

2832
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,560
 >> and incentivizing

2833
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:05,440
 people to only vote for them >> and overwhelming the system.

2834
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:06,480
 yes.

2835
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,440
 and and by the way, it's a strategy that if allowed to work would work

2836
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,639
 and in fact has worked.

2837
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:14,159
 um california supermajority democrat.

2838
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:14,719
 >> yeah.

2839
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:18,480
 >> um and and there's so much gerrymandering that that that occurs.

2840
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,000
 it's it's it's crazy.

2841
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:25,600
 um so >> i'm sure you're paying attention to this proposition 50 thing.

2842
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:30,000
 >> that's the thing in california where they're trying to re redo districts.

2843
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:30,960
 >> yeah.

2844
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,159
 >> because i mean california is already gerrymandered like crazy.

2845
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:34,480
 yeah.

2846
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:37,119
 >> um they want to gerrymander it even more.

2847
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:40,159
 >> um and and i mean >> because it keeps moving further and further right.

2848
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:44,239
 like if you look at the map of california each voting cycle

2849
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,520
 more and more people are waking up and going what the [ __ ]

2850
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,440
 and we need to do something to fix this.

2851
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,360
 the only option available

2852
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,719
 other than the policies that you guys have always done is go right.

2853
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:59,040
 >> and so a lot of people have been air air quotes red >> pill.

2854
01:48:59,040 --> 01:48:59,440
 >> yeah.

2855
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,960
 >> and and and then here's another thing that is very important.

2856
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:06,719
 um fact that that is actually not disputed by by either side

2857
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:08,239
 which is that when when we do the census

2858
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:09,440
 in the united states, the census,

2859
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:10,239
 the way the census

2860
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:10,960
 works

2861
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,840
 for

2862
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,159
 aortionment of congressional seats and

2863
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:15,520
 um electoral

2864
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,920
 electoral college votes for the president

2865
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,639
 is by number of persons in a state,

2866
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,400
 not number of citizens, right?

2867
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,080
 >> it's number of pe people.

2868
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:27,679
 so you could literally be a tourist and you will count.

2869
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:30,239
 >> now how do they do the census when they do that?

2870
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,560
 do they is it do they ask people?

2871
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,840
 do they knock on doors?

2872
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,360
 do they have them fill out forms?

2873
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,239
 like what?

2874
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:39,520
 >> yeah, i think they they mail out census forms and knock on doors.

2875
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:43,760
 um but the way the law reads right now

2876
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:49,600
 um and and is that all if if you are a human with a pulse

2877
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:59,360
 um then you count in the census for allocating congressional seats and presidential votes, >> right?

2878
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:04,320
 so, uh, you so >> electoral college,

2879
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,080
 >> it doesn't matter whether you're here legally,

2880
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:09,360
 illegally, and if if you're a human with a pulse,

2881
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:12,400
 um, you count for congressional aortionment.

2882
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,400
 so that means that

2883
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:19,040
 the more people the more illegals that california and new york can can import

2884
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:22,239
 when by the time the census happens in 2030

2885
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:25,920
 um the more congressional seats they will have

2886
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:31,360
 um and the more electoral the more presidential electoral college votes they will have

2887
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:37,679
 um so they're trying to get as many illegals in as possible ahead of the census.

2888
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:38,800
 um

2889
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:45,280
 and because all h all all human beings even tourists count for the census

2890
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,840
 and and then if you combine that with gerrymandering

2891
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,080
 of of districts in new york and california

2892
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,840
 as you point out with this proposition

2893
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,159
 where they're trying to increase the amount of gerrymandering

2894
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:59,119
 that occurs in california, the biggest state in the country.

2895
01:50:59,119 --> 01:50:59,840
 um

2896
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,639
 so so you get so so if the

2897
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:07,920
 this if this the census then would award more congressional seats to california

2898
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,760
 because of a vast number of illegals and new york and illinois.

2899
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,719
 um so they get more congressional seats.

2900
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:20,159
 they would get more presidential electoral college votes getting that would get them the house

2901
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:20,960
 the

2902
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,440
 a majority in the house and and and

2903
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,480
 they would get to decide who is president

2904
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,080
 based literally based on legals.

2905
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:33,280
 this is these are not disputed facts by either party.

2906
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:35,360
 i want to emphasize that that's sink in.

2907
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:38,560
 >> yeah, this is not a >> these are not disputed facts by either party.

2908
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:44,560
 it's not a this these are just this is just the the way the law works.

2909
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,280
 it it's it is a

2910
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:50,560
 you know like i don't think the law should work that way.

2911
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,320
 i think it should the aortionment should be proportionate to to to citizens.

2912
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:57,040
 >> but isn't that a problem with how the constitution is written?

2913
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,280
 >> yeah.

2914
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:57,520
 yeah.

2915
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,560
 yeah.

2916
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,599
 >> um, >> they can't really change that.

2917
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:03,920
 >> i i'm not sure if it's constitutional or

2918
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,239
 u but it it it is the way the law is written.

2919
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:09,040
 i'm not sure if it's in the constitution or not in this way, but

2920
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,440
 um but it is that is the way the law is written.

2921
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:14,960
 >> so, it is an incentive and but it's an incentive that would be removed

2922
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,119
 with something simple that makes sense to everybody that only

2923
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:23,280
 the people that should count are people that are official us citizens.

2924
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:23,599
 >> yes.

2925
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:26,159
 so, the way the way it should work is that only us citizens

2926
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:27,599
 should count in the census

2927
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:29,520
 for purposes of of determining

2928
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,960
 voting power

2929
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:34,480
 >> because people that aren't legal can't vote supposedly.

2930
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:35,520
 >> they're not supposed to be voting.

2931
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,280
 um but but they do.

2932
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:38,480
 um

2933
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:39,360
 but but even

2934
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,119
 even if even besides that, like said,

2935
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:41,599
 i i i

2936
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:42,239
 just can't emphasize

2937
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:43,760
 this enough because this is a very important

2938
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:44,080
 concept

2939
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,679
 for people to understand.

2940
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:47,440
 um is that the law

2941
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,639
 um the the law as it stands

2942
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:51,760
 um

2943
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:58,239
 counts all humans with a pulse in in in in a state for deciding how many

2944
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:03,760
 u house of representative votes and how many presidential electoral college votes

2945
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,280
 a a state gets.

2946
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:08,560
 so the incentive therefore is to

2947
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:12,320
 for california, new york and illinois to maximize the number of illegals

2948
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:13,760
 so they get so they get

2949
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,119
 um so that they take house seats away from red states

2950
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:20,159
 assign them to california, new york, illinois and so forth.

2951
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:24,560
 um then then you combine that with extreme gerrymandering

2952
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:27,360
 in in you know california, new york, illinois and and whatnot.

2953
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:31,040
 so that that basically you you can't even elect any republicans

2954
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,280
 and then they get control of the presidency,

2955
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:36,960
 control of the house, then they keep doing that strategy

2956
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:41,040
 um and and cement a supermajority.

2957
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,040
 that is what they're trying to do.

2958
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,760
 >> so that would essentially turn the entire country into california.

2959
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:46,159
 >> yes.

2960
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:47,040
 >> where you have

2961
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:51,040
 differing opinions, but it doesn't matter because one party is always in control.

2962
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,280
 >> yes.

2963
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:57,679
 um, >> when you first started digging into this, when you first started

2964
01:53:57,679 --> 01:53:59,119
 before you even accepted

2965
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:01,040
 this role of running doge

2966
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:01,440
 and

2967
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:02,639
 being a part of all that,

2968
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,360
 did you have any idea that it was this [ __ ] up?

2969
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,480
 >> um, i i did.

2970
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:06,719
 yeah.

2971
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,599
 i i mean, i sort of >> when did you start knowing?

2972
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:13,920
 >> um, i guess about like well, about two years ago.

2973
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:14,800
 >> isn't that crazy?

2974
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:15,040
 >> yeah.

2975
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:17,040
 like relatively recently, you know.

2976
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:17,679
 so

2977
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:21,440
 >> maybe i started i started having an well i i started like basically

2978
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:25,679
 having a bad feeling about 3 years ago, which is why which was which is when

2979
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:28,800
 >> uh why i felt it was like critical to acquire twitter

2980
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:33,599
 um and have a maximally truth seeeking platform, not one that suppresses the truth.

2981
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:35,119
 um and

2982
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:37,040
 um

2983
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,119
 like it it was more it was more like i

2984
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:39,360
 like

2985
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,000
 i'm not sure what's

2986
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:40,880
 going on, but i have a

2987
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:41,119
 i

2988
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:41,599
 have a bad

2989
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:41,840
 feeling

2990
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,159
 about

2991
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:42,480
 what's

2992
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,119
 going on.

2993
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:44,639
 and then the more i dug into it,

2994
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:46,960
 the more i was like, "holy [ __ ] we got a real problem here

2995
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:47,679
 and america's

2996
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:49,440
 going to fall."

2997
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:53,679
 so, uh, >> without anyone knowing it had fallen, that's that would be the problem.

2998
01:54:53,679 --> 01:55:00,719
 it could have fallen and been unrepable without anyone really being aware of what had happened,

2999
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:02,639
 especially if you didn't buy twitter.

3000
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:04,000
 >> yes, that's that's it.

3001
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,880
 look, buying twitter was a a huge pain in the ass.

3002
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,520
 um, and made me a a a a pin cushion of attacks.

3003
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,119
 like dab dab stab dab dab.

3004
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:14,639
 >> everybody loved you before that.

3005
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:16,880
 >> well, some people love >> a lot of people loved you.

3006
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,800
 a lot of lefties loved you.

3007
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,480
 >> uh, i i was a hero of the left.

3008
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:23,119
 as far as >> the thing, if you drove a tesla,

3009
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:24,560
 it showed that you were environmentally

3010
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:25,280
 conscious

3011
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,679
 and you were on the right side.

3012
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:28,639
 >> uh, yeah.

3013
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:31,920
 um, yeah.

3014
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,440
 i mean, i'm still the same human.

3015
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:36,880
 i didn't like have a brain transplant between, you know, since

3016
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,080
 in like three years ago, you know.

3017
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:41,280
 um >> well, that's my favorite bumper sticker that people put on teslas now.

3018
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,159
 i bought this before elon went crazy.

3019
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:45,679
 >> i took a picture of one the other day.

3020
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:46,880
 oh, you found somebody.

3021
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:47,199
 oh, yeah.

3022
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:49,199
 i've seen i've seen three or four of them.

3023
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:52,560
 people that have these bumper stickers on their car that says, "i bought this before

3024
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:53,840
 elon went crazy."

3025
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,520
 because when people were

3026
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,000
 vandalizing teslas

3027
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:58,880
 >> yeah.

3028
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,159
 um the most there was organized campaign

3029
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:02,800
 to

3030
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,239
 literally burn down teslas

3031
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:04,960
 and and

3032
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:06,159
 we had one of our dealers

3033
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:10,080
 got shot up with a gun like they fired bullets into the in the tesla dealership.

3034
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:13,760
 they're burning down cars.

3035
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:14,960
 it was crazy.

3036
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,880
 um

3037
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:17,599
 so

3038
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:19,679
 but the bumper sticker should read

3039
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:21,920
 there should be an an addendum to the bumper sticker.

3040
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:26,159
 it's like i bought this car before elon turned crazy.

3041
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:32,159
 actually, now i realize he's not crazy and i've seen the light.

3042
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:34,000
 >> that'll take some time.

3043
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,360
 that'll take some time.

3044
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:37,599
 people don't want to admit that they've been tricked.

3045
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:37,760
 >> yeah.

3046
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,480
 i mean, there's

3047
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:42,320
 that old saying where it's like it's really easy to fool somebody, but it's

3048
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,800
 almost impossible to convince someone that they were fooled.

3049
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:45,840
 >> yeah.

3050
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,040
 it's much easier to fool them than to convince them they've been fooled.

3051
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,199
 people cling to their ideas.

3052
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:51,520
 >> yes.

3053
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:57,920
 they especially if they've like publicly stated these things, they get very embarrassed of being foolish.

3054
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:58,239
 >> yeah.

3055
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:00,719
 people most time they double down.

3056
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:04,080
 >> um and >> and they find echo chambers.

3057
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:04,320
 >> yeah.

3058
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:04,560
 yeah.

3059
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:08,400
 but but there's you know the thing is that like

3060
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,719
 i you know i've seen more and more people

3061
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:13,119
 who were convinced of

3062
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:15,280
 the sort of work ideology

3063
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,440
 um see the light.

3064
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,159
 >> yeah.

3065
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:20,480
 so, not everyone, but it's more and more

3066
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,400
 um are seeing the light.

3067
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:22,719
 um

3068
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:23,119
 and and

3069
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:24,320
 it tends to happen like when when

3070
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:24,880
 something happens

3071
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:25,440
 that really,

3072
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,080
 you know, directly

3073
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:26,960
 affects you,

3074
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:27,520
 >> right?

3075
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:31,119
 >> um you like there was a friend of mine who

3076
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:35,280
 was living in in the san francisco bay area and

3077
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:39,199
 um that tried to trans his his his daughter

3078
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:39,920
 um

3079
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,920
 did like to the point where the

3080
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:44,960
 the school like sent sent the police to his house

3081
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,639
 to take his daughter away from him.

3082
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:51,119
 now, now that's going to radicalize you.

3083
01:57:51,119 --> 01:57:54,400
 well, that's going to break that's going to shake you out of your blue structure.

3084
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,760
 um,

3085
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,480
 now i know, >> so it was an activist at the school

3086
01:57:58,480 --> 01:57:59,520
 that was trying to do this.

3087
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,320
 >> yeah, the school and the and the state of california

3088
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:08,320
 conspired to turn his daughter against him and make her take

3089
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:12,000
 lifealtering drugs that would have sterilized her

3090
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,639
 um and irreversible.

3091
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:15,760
 >> and how old was she?

3092
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,800
 i think 14, something like that.

3093
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,080
 um,

3094
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:20,560
 so

3095
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:20,800
 and

3096
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:21,360
 but he he

3097
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:21,920
 managed to talk

3098
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:22,320
 the police

3099
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:22,880
 out of taking

3100
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:23,119
 his

3101
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:23,360
 daughter

3102
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:23,760
 away from

3103
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:24,080
 him

3104
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:24,400
 that

3105
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:25,280
 day.

3106
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:29,440
 um, and that that night he got on a plane to texas.

3107
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,400
 >> wow.

3108
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:33,520
 um and

3109
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:38,320
 like you know a year after just being in in a in a school in like

3110
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,320
 greater austin area

3111
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:43,520
 um she she went she came went back to normal

3112
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:44,639
 meaning like

3113
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,800
 it it wasn't real >> right

3114
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,560
 >> um well people are being much more open to that now.

3115
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:52,320
 i mean wall street journal

3116
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:53,040
 yesterday

3117
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,360
 had that opinion piece that

3118
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:59,280
 this whole trans thing there's a lot of evidence is a social contagion.

3119
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:00,000
 absolutely.

3120
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,360
 >> and colin wright wrote that.

3121
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,840
 and then he's getting death threats now, of course.

3122
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,560
 and on blue sky, there's people talking about exterminating

3123
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:10,880
 him, which is one thing that you are allowed to say on blue sky, apparently.

3124
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:14,560
 >> you're you're allowed to say horrible things about people saying

3125
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,560
 possibly truthful things about this whole social contagion.

3126
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,159
 cuz that's what when you get

3127
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:24,159
 nine kids that are in a friend group and they all decide to turn trans together.

3128
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:24,560
 yeah.

3129
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:25,360
 >> something's wrong.

3130
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:28,320
 that's not statistically >> yeah.

3131
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:31,599
 like here's the like you can convince kids to do anything.

3132
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:34,080
 you can convince kids to be a suicide bomber, >> right?

3133
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:34,560
 >> so

3134
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:35,679
 >> which is why they do

3135
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:39,040
 with in in some countries why they choose children to do that.

3136
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,000
 >> yes.

3137
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,599
 you can train kids to be suicide bombers.

3138
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:43,199
 and if you can train kids to be su suicide

3139
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:43,599
 bombers,

3140
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:45,280
 you can convince them of anything.

3141
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:45,679
 >> yeah.

3142
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:49,840
 especially with enough positive enforcement and cultural enforcement and you

3143
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,320
 >> and and the idea that that that's not the case.

3144
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,920
 >> kids kids are kids are

3145
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:56,000
 um malleable.

3146
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
 the minds of youth are easily corrupted.

3147
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,840
 >> you're also seeing a lot of push back from

3148
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:02,800
 gay and lesbian people that are saying like, "hey, if someone

3149
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,159
 >> stop including me

3150
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:04,800
 in yeah.

3151
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:05,440
 exactly.

3152
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,480
 the lgbt,

3153
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,080
 you know, it's like, wait a second,

3154
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:11,199
 why are we being included all the time in this situation?" >> exactly.

3155
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:11,840
 exactly.

3156
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,520
 when especially when,

3157
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:17,280
 you know, like my friend tim dylan's talked about this is like it's really homophobic

3158
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:22,320
 because you're taking these gay kids and you're you're telling them like, "hey, you're not gay.

3159
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:23,840
 you're actually a girl." >> yes.

3160
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:24,320
 and

3161
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:27,520
 you know, hey, hey, go make it so that you can never have an orgasm

3162
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,520
 again and you'll be happy.

3163
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:31,520
 >> like, >> yeah, >> [ __ ]

3164
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:36,639
 permanent mutilation, permanent castration of of kids is like i i think

3165
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:37,520
 >> i i

3166
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:39,599
 we should look look at at

3167
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:45,440
 anyone who permanently castrates a kid as like right up there with ysef mangler.

3168
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:45,840
 >> yeah.

3169
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,719
 >> i mean, they're they're mutilating children.

3170
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:49,599
 >> yeah.

3171
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:49,920
 yeah.

3172
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,400
 and

3173
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,800
 um it's thought of as being kind.

3174
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:57,760
 and the thing is, would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son?

3175
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:59,199
 >> that's that's the that's the line they use.

3176
02:00:59,199 --> 02:00:59,440
 >> yeah.

3177
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,840
 which is not supported by any data.

3178
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:02,239
 >> no.

3179
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:05,119
 in fact, the the probability of suicide increases.

3180
02:01:05,119 --> 02:01:05,599
 >> right.

3181
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:07,760
 >> this is important maybe for the audience to know.

3182
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:13,679
 the probability of suicide increases if you're transit kid, not decreases.

3183
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:15,840
 >> by some accounts, it triples.

3184
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,639
 so that that is an evil lie.

3185
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:22,239
 and it's a lie that is supposedly compassionate.

3186
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:26,480
 imagine you've twisted reality to the point where

3187
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:31,440
 confusing a child that's not even legally allowed to get a [ __ ] tattoo.

3188
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:31,760
 >> yeah.

3189
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:32,080
 >> right.

3190
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,719
 because you think that you could make a mistake with a tattoo,

3191
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:35,840
 a totally removable

3192
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:36,719
 thing, >> right?

3193
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:37,760
 >> if i wanted to, tomorrow

3194
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,520
 i can go to a doctor and they could laser

3195
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:40,320
 off every tattoo

3196
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:41,199
 that i have on me.

3197
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:42,480
 >> right.

3198
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:42,800
 >> okay.

3199
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:43,760
 no harm, no foul.

3200
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:44,000
 yeah.

3201
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,880
 but you get sterilized like that's it forever.

3202
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,760
 forever.

3203
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:49,199
 yes, >> they'll castrate you.

3204
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:50,800
 you no longer have testicles.

3205
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,400
 you have no penis.

3206
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,320
 you have a hole where your penis used to be.

3207
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:54,639
 >> yes.

3208
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:55,840
 >> and this is compassionate

3209
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:59,440
 and this is preventing you from >> actually, a lot of kids die

3210
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:02,800
 in in with the these sex change operations.

3211
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,679
 they die the number of deaths on the operating table.

3212
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:07,280
 people don't hear about those.

3213
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:09,520
 a lot of kids because

3214
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:14,239
 that we it's we don't really actually have the technology to make this work.

3215
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:18,560
 so a bunch of the times the kids just die in the sex change operations.

3216
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:19,679
 >> jesus christ.

3217
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:19,840
 >> yeah.

3218
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,840
 it's it's demented which it should be viewed as like you know

3219
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:28,800
 um like like evil nazi doctor stuff basically.

3220
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:32,080
 that's why it was like real nazi not the [ __ ] fake nazi stuff.

3221
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:37,520
 >> crazy that even pushing back against something that seems like fundamentally logically

3222
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:41,840
 very easy to argue the old twitter would ban you forever.

3223
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:45,239
 uh, yes.

3224
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:52,159
 >> that's how crazy a social contagion can get when it completely defies logic, victimizes children,

3225
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:55,679
 does something that makes no sense, does not supported by data,

3226
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:57,840
 all connected to this ideology

3227
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,199
 that trans is good.

3228
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:02,560
 we got to save trans kids, protect trans kids.

3229
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:02,800
 >> yeah.

3230
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,639
 and what i want to emphasize is that

3231
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:07,040
 the the save trans kids thing is a lie.

3232
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:10,480
 um if if you if you if you castrate

3233
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:14,639
 kids and trans them the probability of suicide increases.

3234
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:15,679
 it does not decrease.

3235
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:18,400
 it substantially increases.

3236
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:24,159
 um the the the studies have done that i've seen the the risk of suicide

3237
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:27,760
 triples if you trans kids.

3238
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:29,679
 so you're not saving them, you're killing them.

3239
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:32,719
 moreover, during the sex change operation,

3240
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:38,480
 there are many deaths that occur during the sex change operation.

3241
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:41,199
 >> jesus christ.

3242
02:03:41,199 --> 02:03:43,599
 it's just crazy that this is a real issue.

3243
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:46,320
 >> yeah, it it's a nightmare fever dream

3244
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:50,960
 and and people are finally waking up from it.

3245
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:56,400
 now, when you started getting into the doge stuff and started finding

3246
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:57,760
 how much money

3247
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,040
 is being shuffled around and moved around to nos's

3248
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:04,719
 and how much money is involved and

3249
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:08,960
 just totally untraceable funds like

3250
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:15,119
 this is again something like two years plus ago you weren't aware of it all.

3251
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:16,320
 >> no, i was aware of it.

3252
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:20,480
 um i just didn't realize how how the how big it was.

3253
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:26,000
 just just just how much waste and forward there is in the government is truly vast.

3254
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,239
 um in fact the government didn't even know

3255
02:04:28,239 --> 02:04:32,920
 um and nor did they care.

3256
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:34,239
 >> that's crazy.

3257
02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:36,239
 >> yeah.

3258
02:04:36,239 --> 02:04:40,960
 >> and >> i mean just like some of the very basic stuff that doge did

3259
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:42,639
 um will have lasting effects.

3260
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:46,880
 um and some of these things like they're so elementary you can't believe it.

3261
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:47,599
 so,

3262
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:50,960
 um the the doge team got the

3263
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:56,080
 um you know the the mo most of the main payments computers

3264
02:04:56,080 --> 02:05:01,360
 um to require the the congressional appropriation code.

3265
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:05,520
 so, when a payment is made, you have to actually enter the congressional appropriation card.

3266
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:09,599
 that used to be optional and and often would be just left blank.

3267
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:13,840
 so, the money would just go out, but it wasn't even tied to a congressional appropriation.

3268
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:19,760
 then they also dutch team also made the comment field for the payment mandatory.

3269
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:20,960
 so you have to say something.

3270
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:24,159
 we're not saying that what what is said like you can say anything.

3271
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:26,719
 you you your cat could run across the keyboard.

3272
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:28,639
 you could go querty asdf

3273
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:30,880
 but you have to say something above nothing

3274
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,880
 because what we found was that there were

3275
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:37,199
 tens of billions maybe hundreds of billions of dollars that were zombie payments.

3276
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:43,440
 so there like somebody had approved a payment uh somebody in the government approved a payment

3277
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:46,880
 um and some recurring payment and

3278
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:54,080
 um they retired or died or changed jobs and no one turned the money off.

3279
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:56,560
 so the money would just keep going out

3280
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:01,440
 and and it's a pretty rare >> go where >> to to the

3281
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:03,440
 a company or an individual

3282
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:06,400
 um and it's a pretty rare company or individual who will complain

3283
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,119
 that they're getting money that they should not get

3284
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:11,440
 and and a bunch of the money was just going to the

3285
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:13,119
 were transfer payments to the states.

3286
02:06:13,119 --> 02:06:16,639
 >> so these are automatic payments there no accounting for them at all.

3287
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:20,000
 >> i imagine like like there's an automatic debit of your credit card

3288
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,199
 >> um and you don't you never look at the statement, >> right?

3289
02:06:23,199 --> 02:06:26,800
 um, so it's just money going out.

3290
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:29,440
 uh, that's why i call them zombie payments.

3291
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:30,320
 um,

3292
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:33,760
 that there might have been they might have been legitimate at one point,

3293
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:36,960
 but the person who approved that recurring payment um,

3294
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:43,040
 changed jobs, died, retired, or whatever, and no one ever turned the money off.

3295
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:46,079
 and my guess is that's probably

3296
02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:58,639
 at least a hundred billion a year, maybe 200. and going where >> uh to to

3297
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:00,560
 i mean there there are millions of these payments.

3298
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:03,599
 so so it's i mean >> millions

3299
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:08,000
 >> uh yes >> millions of payments that are going to who knows where.

3300
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,880
 >> yes.

3301
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,079
 in a bunch of cases there are fraud rings that operate

3302
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:15,679
 professional fraud rings that operate to exploit the system.

3303
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:23,040
 um they figure out some security hole in the system and they just do professional fraud.

3304
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:24,719
 um and

3305
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:25,599
 um

3306
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:28,400
 you know that's where we found for example people who were

3307
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:33,760
 you know 300 years old in the social security administration database.

3308
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,920
 now, i thought that this was

3309
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:41,040
 a mistake of not registering their deaths that people were born

3310
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:45,599
 like a long time ago and it had defaulted to like a certain number

3311
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:47,920
 and so that after time

3312
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,440
 those people were still in the system.

3313
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:54,079
 it was just an error of the the way the accounting was done.

3314
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:54,800
 >> yeah.

3315
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:55,920
 so,

3316
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,760
 um that's not true.

3317
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:02,320
 so, there's or or at least one of two things must be true.

3318
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:03,040
 um

3319
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:05,119
 the there's a there's a typo

3320
02:08:05,119 --> 02:08:07,360
 or or some mistake in the computer

3321
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:09,199
 or it's fraudulent,

3322
02:08:09,199 --> 02:08:12,880
 but we don't have any 300-year-old vampires living in america.

3323
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:13,520
 >> allegedly.

3324
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:14,639
 >> allegedly.

3325
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:15,920
 um

3326
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:16,560
 and

3327
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:19,840
 or or and we don't have people in some cases who's who are receiving payments

3328
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:23,280
 who are born in the future.

3329
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,079
 >> born in the future.

3330
02:08:24,079 --> 02:08:25,119
 >> born in the future.

3331
02:08:25,119 --> 02:08:25,599
 >> really?

3332
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:26,639
 >> yes.

3333
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:31,360
 there the people receiving payments whose birth date

3334
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:32,880
 um was like

3335
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:34,079
 in 2100

3336
02:08:34,079 --> 02:08:37,360
 and something >> okay so there's >> like next century >> is there a task

3337
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,920
 >> we know we know that one of two things must be true

3338
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:45,840
 um that that that either there's a mistake in the computer or it's fraud

3339
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:49,599
 but if you have someone's birth date that's either in the future or

3340
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:53,520
 where they are older than the oldest living american because the oldest living american is 114

3341
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,199
 years old so if they're more than 114

3342
02:08:55,199 --> 02:08:56,239
 years

3343
02:08:56,239 --> 02:08:58,159
 um there is either a mistake

3344
02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:00,639
 and someone should should call them and say

3345
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:03,040
 i i think we have your birthday

3346
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:08,639
 wrong because it says you were born in 17 you know 8086

3347
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:09,360
 um and

3348
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:12,639
 um you know that was before you know

3349
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:18,960
 um you know before there was really an america you know it was it was like

3350
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:24,960
 you know kind of early you know we're still fighting england type of thing

3351
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:28,159
 you it's like

3352
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:31,040
 this person either needs to be in the guinness book of world records

3353
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:32,639
 or or they're not alive,

3354
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:35,599
 >> but still at the end of the day, money is going towards

3355
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:36,000
 that

3356
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,440
 account that's connected to this person that is either non-existent

3357
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:41,040
 or >> so

3358
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:41,920
 like like yeah.

3359
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:44,159
 so there was like i think

3360
02:09:44,159 --> 02:09:48,480
 um something like i don't know 20 million

3361
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:53,760
 people in the social security administration database that could not possibly be alive

3362
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,360
 um if their birth date is

3363
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:56,000
 like

3364
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,320
 based on their birth date they could not possibly be alive.

3365
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:02,560
 >> and then to be clear 20 million people that were receiving funds

3366
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:05,760
 >> uh a bunch of

3367
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,840
 most of them were not receiving funds.

3368
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,199
 some of them were receiving funds.

3369
02:10:09,199 --> 02:10:10,560
 most were not receiving funds.

3370
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,079
 but so let me tell you how the scam works.

3371
02:10:12,079 --> 02:10:13,760
 it's it's a bank shot.

3372
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:14,480
 so

3373
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:15,280
 the

3374
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:20,480
 social security administration database is used as the source of truth by all the other databases

3375
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,000
 that the government uses.

3376
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,840
 so even if they stop the payments on the social security administration database

3377
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,520
 like unemployment insurance,

3378
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:28,880
 small business administration,

3379
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:29,920
 student loans

3380
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:31,119
 all check

3381
02:10:31,119 --> 02:10:37,840
 the social security administration database to say is this is this a legitimate alived person?

3382
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:38,400
 and

3383
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:39,440
 and if the

3384
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:40,320
 social security database

3385
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,079
 will say yes, this person is still alive

3386
02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:42,960
 even though they're 200

3387
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:43,840
 years old.

3388
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:50,079
 um but forgets to mention that they're 200 years old, it just says it just returns

3389
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:54,159
 when when the computer is queries, it says yes, this person is alive.

3390
02:10:54,159 --> 02:10:58,880
 and so then they're able to exploit the entire rest of the government ecosystem.

3391
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,840
 so fake then you get fake student loans, then you get fake unemployment

3392
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:02,320
 insurance,

3393
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:03,280
 then you get

3394
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:04,480
 fake medical payments.

3395
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:07,119
 and this doesn't have to be tied to an individual

3396
02:11:07,119 --> 02:11:10,639
 where where there's an address where you can check on this person.

3397
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:11,760
 >> no,

3398
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:17,199
 if you did do if just did any check at all, you would stop this.

3399
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:20,480
 >> so, so, so that's that that that's so so

3400
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:24,239
 >> and how much money do you think is >> any check like anything at all

3401
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:28,639
 that would stop would stop the forward like any effort at all?

3402
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:29,520
 >> um, yeah.

3403
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:31,119
 >> so, there's multiple layers.

3404
02:11:31,119 --> 02:11:34,159
 the social security number verifies that this is a real person

3405
02:11:34,159 --> 02:11:36,159
 and then the other systems check

3406
02:11:36,159 --> 02:11:37,440
 every other government payment

3407
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:42,960
 and every other government payment system for everything for like small small business administration

3408
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:45,119
 student loans

3409
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:47,360
 medicaid medicare

3410
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:50,000
 every other government payment of which there are many there there actually

3411
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:50,960
 hundreds of government payment

3412
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:52,159
 systems

3413
02:11:52,159 --> 02:11:59,520
 can all be exploited so long as social security database says this person is alive

3414
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:02,480
 that's the nature of the scam it's a bank shot.

3415
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:02,960
 so then

3416
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:03,840
 the then the rebuttal

3417
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:04,400
 from the dems

3418
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:04,960
 is like, oh

3419
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:05,199
 well

3420
02:12:05,199 --> 02:12:05,440
 the

3421
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:05,679
 vast

3422
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:05,920
 majority

3423
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:06,800
 of the people who are marked

3424
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:07,760
 as alive in the social security

3425
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:08,239
 administration

3426
02:12:08,239 --> 02:12:09,920
 weren't receiving social security administration

3427
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:10,560
 payments.

3428
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:11,199
 that is true.

3429
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:17,199
 what they forgot to mention is they're getting fraudulent payments from every other government program.

3430
02:12:17,199 --> 02:12:20,079
 and that's why the the dms were so opposed

3431
02:12:20,079 --> 02:12:23,679
 to turning off to to declaring someone dead who was dead

3432
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:25,679
 because it would stop the entire other

3433
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:27,360
 all the other fraud from happening.

3434
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:31,679
 and so, but all this is it trackable like all this other fraud.

3435
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:33,520
 >> if they wanted to, they could chase it all down.

3436
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:33,679
 >> yeah.

3437
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:36,000
 it's not even hard.

3438
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,719
 >> and yet they're opposing chasing it all down.

3439
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:42,719
 >> they're opposing chasing it all down because it would it turns off the money magnet

3440
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:45,520
 for the illegals.

3441
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:48,000
 wow.

3442
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:54,480
 because it's very logical to to like like i'm saying the most common sense things possible.

3443
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:56,400
 if someone's got

3444
02:12:56,400 --> 02:13:01,199
 a birthday in social security that is an impossible birthday,

3445
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:02,960
 meaning they are

3446
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:06,719
 older than the oldest living american or were born in the future,

3447
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:13,360
 then you should call them and say, "excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong."

3448
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:16,320
 because it says that you're 200 years old.

3449
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,639
 that's all you need to do.

3450
02:13:18,639 --> 02:13:19,040
 um,

3451
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:19,440
 and

3452
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:21,280
 >> and then you would remove them from the social security

3453
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:21,679
 database

3454
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:23,360
 and make that number no longer available

3455
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:24,480
 for all those other government

3456
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:25,040
 payments.

3457
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:26,159
 >> exactly.

3458
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:29,159
 >> wow.

3459
02:13:29,199 --> 02:13:31,040
 and how much money are we talking?

3460
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:34,159
 >> it's hund hundreds of billions of dollars.

3461
02:13:34,159 --> 02:13:36,159
 >> and this is all traceable.

3462
02:13:36,159 --> 02:13:37,920
 like you could hunt all

3463
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:41,199
 >> like you don't need to be sherlock holmes here is what i'm saying.

3464
02:13:41,199 --> 02:13:43,520
 >> well, this we don't need to call sherlock holmes for this one.

3465
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:46,880
 is this part of >> you just need to call the person

3466
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:50,239
 >> and and say, "excuse me, we either we we seem to have the

3467
02:13:50,239 --> 02:13:51,920
 like we we we

3468
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:55,760
 must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or were born

3469
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,800
 in the future.

3470
02:13:56,800 --> 02:14:00,159
 um so could you tell us what your birthday is?

3471
02:14:00,159 --> 02:14:01,119
 that's all you need to do.

3472
02:14:01,119 --> 02:14:02,719
 it's it's that simple."

3473
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:05,119
 but the all these other government payments

3474
02:14:05,119 --> 02:14:08,960
 that are available that are connected to this social security number,

3475
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:10,560
 it seems like

3476
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:13,280
 if you just chased that all down, yeah.

3477
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:16,400
 >> you would find the widespread fraud.

3478
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:18,239
 you would find where it's going.

3479
02:14:18,239 --> 02:14:18,560
 >> yes.

3480
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:24,000
 the but the root of the problem is the social security administration database because

3481
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,840
 um the social security number in the united states is used as a deacto

3482
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,560
 national id number.

3483
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:36,239
 you know that's why like the bank always asks for your social

3484
02:14:36,239 --> 02:14:43,400
 like the you know any financial institution will ask for your social security number.

3485
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:47,840
 >> this is it sounds so insane that this isn't chased down.

3486
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:48,560
 i mean

3487
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:52,480
 >> i agree >> that i mean i mean that in and of itself is

3488
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:54,719
 that's such mishandling.

3489
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,719
 >> yes.

3490
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:00,000
 no it's mind-blowing.

3491
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,560
 um, so yeah, it's crazy.

3492
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:04,000
 >> well, you were very reluctant

3493
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,239
 last time you were here to talk about the extent

3494
02:15:06,239 --> 02:15:08,079
 of some of the fraud

3495
02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:10,079
 because you're like,

3496
02:15:10,079 --> 02:15:13,360
 they could kill me because this is kind of >> oh, what?

3497
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:13,520
 yeah.

3498
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:15,360
 what i was saying is that

3499
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:26,719
 um the like if you create if like i like like to be pragmatic and realistic

3500
02:15:26,719 --> 02:15:29,520
 um you actually can't manage to zero fraud.

3501
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:32,239
 you can manage to low fraud number but not to zero fraud.

3502
02:15:32,239 --> 02:15:34,239
 if you manage to zero fraud,

3503
02:15:34,239 --> 02:15:34,960
 um

3504
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,400
 you you you're going to push so many people over the edge who are receiving fraudulent

3505
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:40,800
 payments that the number of inbound

3506
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,440
 homicidal maniacs will be

3507
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:45,360
 really hard to overcome.

3508
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,560
 so i i'm i'm

3509
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:47,280
 actually taking

3510
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:50,239
 i think quite a reasonable position which is that we should simply

3511
02:15:50,239 --> 02:15:52,000
 reduce the amount of fraud

3512
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,360
 which i think is

3513
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:55,520
 not an extremist position.

3514
02:15:55,520 --> 02:16:01,040
 um, and we should aspire to, you know, have less fraud over time.

3515
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:07,119
 um, not that we should be ultra draconian and eliminate every last scrap of fraud.

3516
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:08,800
 um,

3517
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:09,119
 which

3518
02:16:09,119 --> 02:16:10,320
 i guess would be nice to have, but

3519
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:10,560
 but

3520
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:11,199
 like we don't even

3521
02:16:11,199 --> 02:16:11,760
 need to go that

3522
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:12,079
 extreme.

3523
02:16:12,079 --> 02:16:18,079
 i'm i'm saying we should just stop the blatant large scale super obvious fraud.

3524
02:16:18,079 --> 02:16:19,280
 >> i think that's a reasonable position.

3525
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:20,639
 >> it's a very reasonable position.

3526
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:20,880
 yeah.

3527
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:22,079
 and so

3528
02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:23,840
 what was the most shocking

3529
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:27,599
 push back that you got when you started implementing

3530
02:16:27,599 --> 02:16:28,079
 doge?

3531
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:34,000
 when you started investigating into where money was going?

3532
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:34,718
 well,

3533
02:16:34,718 --> 02:16:40,000
 um i guess it this was i should have anticipated this, but

3534
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,679
 um

3535
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:46,638
 while most of the fraudulent government payments to especially to the nos's

3536
02:16:46,638 --> 02:16:48,080
 go to the democrats,

3537
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:51,679
 most of it like i don't know for argument sake let's say 80%

3538
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:53,280
 maybe 90%.

3539
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,718
 um

3540
02:16:54,718 --> 02:16:59,040
 um 10 to 20% of it does go to republicans.

3541
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:03,120
 and so when we'd turn off funding to a fraudulent ngo,

3542
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:05,120
 we'd get complaints from

3543
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:09,120
 whatever the 10% of republicans who were receiving the money

3544
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:13,280
 and and they would, you know, they would very loudly complain.

3545
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:15,519
 um

3546
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:17,439
 because the the

3547
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:23,120
 honest answer is the republicans are are partly they're receiving some of the fraud, too.

3548
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:28,679
 they're getting a big >> jesus.

3549
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:30,478
 yeah, it's i want to be clear.

3550
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:32,879
 it's it's not like the republican party is some

3551
02:17:32,879 --> 02:17:35,760
 um ultra pure paragon of virtue here.

3552
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:36,318
 >> no.

3553
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:37,200
 >> okay.

3554
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:40,318
 um >> well, you see that with the congressional insider training.

3555
02:17:40,318 --> 02:17:42,240
 it's across the board.

3556
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:42,638
 >> yeah.

3557
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:43,760
 >> it's left and right.

3558
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:47,599
 >> i mean, the whole uni party criticism has some validity to it.

3559
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:49,920
 you know, there's so

3560
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:52,160
 um and it's it's

3561
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:54,959
 like if you turn off fraudulent payments, it's not like

3562
02:17:54,959 --> 02:17:58,638
 like i say, it's not like 100% of those payments were going to democrats.

3563
02:17:58,638 --> 02:18:01,359
 a a small percentage were also going to republicans.

3564
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:04,799
 those republicans complained very loudly.

3565
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:06,318
 um and

3566
02:18:06,318 --> 02:18:08,558
 um

3567
02:18:08,558 --> 02:18:11,760
 you know and and that's that's

3568
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:12,478
 so

3569
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:14,718
 there was a lot of push back on the republican

3570
02:18:14,718 --> 02:18:18,638
 side for when we started cutting some of these these funds

3571
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:21,040
 and i tried telling them like well you know

3572
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:24,000
 90% of the money is going to your opponents

3573
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,000
 but they still if they even if they're getting 10% of >> they want their peace.

3574
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:28,160
 >> yeah.

3575
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:30,718
 they want their peace >> and they've been getting that peace for a long time.

3576
02:18:30,718 --> 02:18:33,718
 >> yes.

3577
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:38,080
 did you see >> this is why like you know politics is like >> it's dirty

3578
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,040
 business.

3579
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:39,280
 >> yeah.

3580
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:41,280
 i mean that's like saying if like

3581
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,519
 you know if if you if you like sausages

3582
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:49,240
 and respect the law do not watch either of them being being made

3583
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:52,478
 >> yeah.

3584
02:18:52,478 --> 02:18:55,359
 wow.

3585
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:57,599
 well that's not even true because i've made sausage before.

3586
02:18:57,599 --> 02:18:57,760
 >> yeah.

3587
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:57,920
 yeah.

3588
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,920
 it's actually like it's not that big a deal.

3589
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:00,318
 yeah.

3590
02:19:00,318 --> 02:19:04,240
 fat and spices and casing, >> run it through the machine.

3591
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:06,000
 not that big a deal.

3592
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:06,558
 >> yeah.

3593
02:19:06,558 --> 02:19:13,280
 um but yeah, i mean i i think the stuff i'm saying here is not

3594
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:13,679
 like like

3595
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:15,439
 if if you stand back and think about it for a second like

3596
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:16,000
 oh yeah

3597
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,760
 that that makes sense, you know.

3598
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:20,879
 >> um the it's it's not like

3599
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:24,080
 um it's not like one political party is going to be

3600
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:28,638
 um you know pure devil or pure angel.

3601
02:19:28,638 --> 02:19:29,599
 there's,

3602
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:33,040
 you know, i think there's there's there there's there's much more corruption on the democrat

3603
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:34,799
 side, but it's not there's not

3604
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:37,040
 there's still some corruption on the republican side.

3605
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:39,439
 >> how did it happen that the majority of the corruption

3606
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:42,160
 wound up being on the democrat side?

3607
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:47,200
 >> well, because the the the transfer payments, especially to illegals,

3608
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:49,280
 um, uh, are very much on the democrat side.

3609
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:52,240
 >> that so that's the root of it all is the illegal situation.

3610
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:52,560
 >> yes.

3611
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:55,680
 i mean, there's >> or a focal point.

3612
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:56,160
 >> yes.

3613
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:59,040
 it's it's also like it's it's

3614
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:03,200
 um it's it would also be accurate to say that while

3615
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:03,760
 obviously

3616
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:05,920
 not everyone who is a democrat is a criminal,

3617
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:10,680
 almost everyone who is a criminal is a democrat

3618
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:15,600
 because because the democrats are the soft crime party.

3619
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:18,399
 so if you're a criminal, who you going to vote for?

3620
02:20:18,399 --> 02:20:20,000
 >> right.

3621
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:20,319
 right.

3622
02:20:20,319 --> 02:20:22,160
 >> the soft crime party.

3623
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:28,319
 did you think you were going to be able to get more done than you were?

3624
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:30,399
 >> um, we did get a lot done, >> right?

3625
02:20:30,399 --> 02:20:33,760
 >> um, and doge is still still still happening, by the way.

3626
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:36,800
 um, this the the doge is still underway.

3627
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:39,040
 there are still there are still

3628
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:43,120
 um there's still waste and fraud being being cut by by the doge team.

3629
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:44,319
 so, it hasn't stopped.

3630
02:20:44,319 --> 02:20:46,880
 um, the >> it's less publicized.

3631
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,479
 >> it's less publicized.

3632
02:20:48,479 --> 02:20:52,720
 um, and they don't have like a clear person to attack anymore.

3633
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:54,560
 >> well, it seems like

3634
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:59,040
 they basically they they applied immense pressure to me to just to stop it.

3635
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:02,560
 so then i'm like the best thing for me is to just, you know,

3636
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:03,600
 cut out of this.

3637
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:06,800
 in any case, as a special government employee, i could only be there for like

3638
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,240
 120 days anyway, something like that.

3639
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,760
 so whatever the law says.

3640
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:12,080
 so i i could i i i was necessarily

3641
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:13,680
 could only be there for 4 months

3642
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:15,359
 as a special government employee.

3643
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:16,000
 so,

3644
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,080
 um

3645
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:20,080
 um but

3646
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:23,600
 yeah, i mean i mean you turn off the money spigot to to fraudsters,

3647
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:24,640
 they get very upset

3648
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:26,080
 to say the least.

3649
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:28,000
 um and

3650
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,200
 um

3651
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,680
 but my like my death threat level went

3652
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:35,280
 ballistic, you know, was like a like a rocket going to orbit.

3653
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:38,240
 um yeah.

3654
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:39,439
 um,

3655
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:39,840
 so

3656
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:42,479
 but now that now now now that i'm not in dc that that that

3657
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:45,280
 i guess they don't really have a person to attack

3658
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:46,399
 anymore.

3659
02:21:46,399 --> 02:21:51,040
 >> um, >> well the rhetoric about you has calmed down significantly.

3660
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:52,479
 >> yeah, >> it was disturbing.

3661
02:21:52,479 --> 02:21:53,680
 it was disturbing to watch.

3662
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:55,280
 it was like this is crazy.

3663
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:56,800
 >> and to watch these politicians

3664
02:21:56,800 --> 02:22:00,800
 engage in it and all these people just like framing you as this monster.

3665
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:02,240
 i was like this is so weird.

3666
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:04,880
 like this is what happens when you uncover fraud.

3667
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:05,520
 >> yes.

3668
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:07,280
 >> the whole machine turns on you.

3669
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:10,240
 and if it wasn't for a person like you who owns a platform

3670
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:12,160
 and has an enormous amount of money,

3671
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:12,800
 like

3672
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:14,800
 could have destroyed you.

3673
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:15,200
 >> yeah.

3674
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:16,319
 >> and that was the goal.

3675
02:22:16,319 --> 02:22:17,359
 >> the goal was to destroy me.

3676
02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:18,080
 absolutely.

3677
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:22,399
 >> because you were getting in the way >> of this amazing graft.

3678
02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:24,720
 >> the the this gigantic fraud machine.

3679
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:25,359
 >> yeah.

3680
02:22:25,359 --> 02:22:30,560
 >> um like i think i think doge team's on done a lot of good work.

3681
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:34,800
 um, you know, and in in terms of

3682
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,720
 fraud and waste prevented,

3683
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:37,680
 my guess is it's,

3684
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:38,399
 you know, probably

3685
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:40,479
 on the order of two or 300 billion a year.

3686
02:22:40,479 --> 02:22:42,720
 so, it's pretty good.

3687
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:45,200
 >> what do you think could have been done if you just had like full

3688
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:45,520
 reign

3689
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:45,840
 and

3690
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:46,160
 total

3691
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:47,280
 cooperation?

3692
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:50,160
 how much do you think you could have saved?

3693
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:53,040
 >> i mean, what level of of power are we assuming here?

3694
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:54,160
 >> godlike.

3695
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:54,560
 >> oh, yeah.

3696
02:22:54,560 --> 02:23:01,359
 i probably cut the federal budget in half and get more done.

3697
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:03,600
 that is so crazy.

3698
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:07,280
 it is so crazy that get more done and federal budget widespread.

3699
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:09,520
 it's that widespread.

3700
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:13,120
 >> well, i mean a whole bunch of government departments simply shouldn't exist in my opinion.

3701
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:14,319
 um they they

3702
02:23:14,319 --> 02:23:16,240
 um you know

3703
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:18,319
 um >> like examples

3704
02:23:18,319 --> 02:23:21,359
 >> well the department of ed department of education which was created

3705
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:22,000
 recently

3706
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,040
 like under

3707
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:24,399
 jimmy carter

3708
02:23:24,399 --> 02:23:32,160
 um the our educational results have gone downhill ever since it was created.

3709
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:33,840
 so if you if you create a department

3710
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:35,840
 and the result of creating that department

3711
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:37,840
 is a massive decline in educational

3712
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:38,640
 results

3713
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:41,840
 and it's department of education, you're better off not having it

3714
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:43,359
 because we're literally

3715
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:45,600
 we were did better before there was one

3716
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:47,680
 than after >> when you let the states run it.

3717
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:48,080
 >> yes.

3718
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:48,720
 >> yeah.

3719
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:51,760
 >> because at least the states can compete with one another.

3720
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:55,760
 um so but the problem is like here like cutting department education.

3721
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:57,120
 our kids need education.

3722
02:23:57,120 --> 02:23:57,840
 yeah, they do.

3723
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:02,240
 but but this is a new department that didn't even exist

3724
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:04,960
 um you know until late the late 70s.

3725
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:13,040
 um and ever since that department was created, the results educational results have declined.

3726
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:20,240
 and so why would you have an institution continue that has made education worse?

3727
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:21,200
 it doesn't make sense.

3728
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,720
 >> they killed it though, right?

3729
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:25,439
 no, there still unfortunately >> but they were trying to kill it.

3730
02:24:25,439 --> 02:24:27,600
 >> it has been substantially reduced.

3731
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:28,240
 >> okay.

3732
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:32,880
 >> um >> what other organizations what other departments?

3733
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:35,920
 >> well, i mean i'm a small government guy.

3734
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:36,800
 so

3735
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:38,240
 um

3736
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:39,520
 you know when when the

3737
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:42,800
 you know when the country was created we just we we just had the

3738
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,680
 department of state, department of war

3739
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:50,080
 um you know and and sort of the sort of the department of justice.

3740
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:54,240
 we had an attorney general and treasury department.

3741
02:24:54,240 --> 02:25:00,560
 um i don't know why you need more than that.

3742
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:05,520
 >> so what other departments specifically do you think are just completely ineffective?

3743
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:07,760
 >> well, i mean here it's like a question.

3744
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:12,000
 it's a sort of philosophical question of how much government do you think there should be?

3745
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:12,399
 >> right.

3746
02:25:12,399 --> 02:25:17,200
 >> um in my opinion, there should be the least amount of government.

3747
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:20,319
 i've heard the most bizarre argument against this

3748
02:25:20,319 --> 02:25:23,359
 is that you're cutting jobs and you're gonna leave people jobless.

3749
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:26,160
 and i'm like, but their jobs are useless.

3750
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:26,560
 >> yeah.

3751
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:29,120
 paying people to do nothing doesn't make sense.

3752
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:32,720
 um like there's a like a a great

3753
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:37,280
 um a story about like milton friedman who is awesome.

3754
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,640
 um

3755
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:43,760
 what like generally whatever milton friedman said is you know people should should do that thing.

3756
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:46,479
 i'm not sure if it's apocryphal or not, but

3757
02:25:46,479 --> 02:25:50,000
 um like like someone complained to him like

3758
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,720
 he he he observed i think people that were like

3759
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:57,120
 um digging ditches with you know with with

3760
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:59,439
 um shovels and

3761
02:25:59,439 --> 02:26:01,840
 um and he said well

3762
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:06,000
 like allegedly freeman said, "well, i think i think you should use you know

3763
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:11,359
 um excavating equipment instead of shovels and you could get it done with far fewer people."

3764
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:14,640
 and then and then someone said, "but then we're going to lose a lot of jobs."

3765
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:16,160
 well, in that then freedom

3766
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:20,760
 says, "well, in that case, why don't you have them use teaspoons?"

3767
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:25,680
 just just dig ditches with teaspoons.

3768
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:27,680
 think of all the jobs you'll create.

3769
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:30,720
 >> i mean,

3770
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:32,399
 it's [ __ ] basically,

3771
02:26:32,399 --> 02:26:35,840
 you just want people to work on on things that are that are productive.

3772
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:39,439
 you want people to work on on building things

3773
02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:45,600
 um on building you know providing products and services that people find valuable

3774
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:48,240
 um like you know making food

3775
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:50,720
 um being you know being a farmer or

3776
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:52,080
 a plumber or electrician

3777
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:52,560
 or

3778
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:54,720
 just anyone who's a builder or providing

3779
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:56,240
 useful services.

3780
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:58,080
 um and

3781
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:00,800
 um that's what you want people to be doing.

3782
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:06,240
 um not fake government jobs that that that don't add any value or may subtract value.

3783
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:08,160
 um

3784
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:09,280
 um

3785
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:11,200
 there's also like you know

3786
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:15,600
 to illustrate the absurdity of also how is the e how is the economy measured

3787
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:20,479
 like the the way economists measure the economy is is is nonsensical

3788
02:27:20,479 --> 02:27:21,040
 because they'll

3789
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:21,359
 measure

3790
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:22,000
 any job

3791
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:22,479
 no matter

3792
02:27:22,479 --> 02:27:25,200
 even if that job is a dumb job that has no point

3793
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:26,960
 and is even counterproductive.

3794
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:30,399
 so like, so the like the joke is like there's two economists

3795
02:27:30,399 --> 02:27:33,040
 going on a hike in the woods

3796
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:35,680
 and they come across

3797
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:37,040
 a pile of [ __ ]

3798
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:42,560
 and one economist says to the other, "i'll pay you $100 to eat eat that shit."

3799
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:46,240
 the economist eats the [ __ ] gets the $100. they they keep walking.

3800
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:49,200
 then the other econ then come across another pile of [ __ ]

3801
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:50,160
 and and the

3802
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:52,560
 the other economist says, "now i'll pay you $100

3803
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:55,600
 to eat the pile of shit."

3804
02:27:56,240 --> 02:27:59,040
 say pays the so pays the other economist

3805
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:00,240
 $100 pile

3806
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:00,720
 of [ __ ]

3807
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:01,920
 then they then then then

3808
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:04,720
 the way said they said like wait a second

3809
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:07,120
 um we both just ate a pile of [ __ ]

3810
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:11,760
 and we're no and and and and we're we're no we we we we

3811
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:14,160
 don't have any more extra money like like

3812
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:16,640
 we both you just gave the $100 back to me

3813
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:20,080
 and we both ate a pile of [ __ ] this doesn't make any sense.

3814
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:22,319
 and they said, "no, no, but think of the economy

3815
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:23,840
 because that's $200

3816
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:26,080
 of that in the economy

3817
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:27,120
 that that

3818
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:27,840
 basically

3819
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:30,479
 measure eating eating [ __ ] would count

3820
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:35,479
 as a as as a as a job.

3821
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:43,200
 this is this is this is to illustrate the absurdity of of of economics.

3822
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:44,880
 >> one of the things you said when

3823
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:46,880
 things should not count as a job."

3824
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:50,000
 one of the things you said when you stepped away is that you're kind of done

3825
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,040
 and that

3826
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:52,560
 it's unfixable.

3827
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:53,760
 that

3828
02:28:53,760 --> 02:29:02,359
 um well or under its current form the way people are approaching it

3829
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:08,399
 you can you can make it directionally better but ultimately you can't fully fix the system.

3830
02:29:08,399 --> 02:29:10,560
 um,

3831
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:12,960
 so, uh,

3832
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:13,840
 i i i

3833
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:14,479
 like

3834
02:29:14,479 --> 02:29:15,280
 like like like

3835
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:19,840
 it it it is it is it would be accurate to say that even

3836
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:22,319
 like like unless you could go like super draconian

3837
02:29:22,319 --> 02:29:23,920
 like you know gangghaskhan

3838
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:25,840
 level on on on

3839
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:31,359
 cutting waste waste and fraud which you can't really do in a democratic country

3840
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:35,680
 um an aspirationally democratic country then

3841
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:39,200
 um there's no way to solve the the the debt crisis.

3842
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:41,439
 so, we got we got national debt that's just insane

3843
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:44,240
 where the debt payments the interest payments on the debt exceed

3844
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:47,280
 our entire military budget.

3845
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:49,120
 i mean, that's one that was one of the wakeup calls for me.

3846
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:50,160
 i was like, "wait a second.

3847
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:57,200
 the interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire the entire military budget

3848
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:59,120
 um and growing.

3849
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:01,359
 um this is crazy.

3850
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:03,520
 um so

3851
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:06,520
 um

3852
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:10,399
 so so even if you implement all these savings,

3853
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:15,680
 you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when america becomes goes bankrupt.

3854
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:18,640
 so unless you go full genghaskhan,

3855
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:20,000
 um which you can't really do.

3856
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,399
 so

3857
02:30:22,399 --> 02:30:25,359
 um

3858
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:27,520
 so i came to the conclusion that

3859
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:31,439
 the only way that the only way to get us out of

3860
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:36,720
 the debt crisis and to prevent america from going bankrupt is ai and robotics.

3861
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:40,640
 so, like we need to grow the economy

3862
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:42,720
 um at

3863
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:45,040
 at a at a at a rate

3864
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:49,600
 that allows us to u to pay off our debt.

3865
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:51,680
 um and

3866
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:56,319
 um i i i guess people just generally don't appreciate the degree to which

3867
02:30:56,319 --> 02:31:00,960
 um you know this the the government overspending is is a problem.

3868
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:06,160
 um but even like the social security website, this is under the biden administration.

3869
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:12,000
 on the website, it would say like we based on on current demographic trends and

3870
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,200
 um

3871
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:14,319
 you and and and

3872
02:31:14,319 --> 02:31:17,840
 how much money social security is bringing in versus how many social security recipients

3873
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:19,760
 there are because we have an aging population.

3874
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:22,560
 relatively speaking, the average age is is increasing.

3875
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:26,800
 social security will not be able to ma u maintain its full payments

3876
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:29,920
 u i think in by 2032

3877
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:30,080
 there.

3878
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:30,240
 okay.

3879
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:33,680
 so they will social security will have to stop will start reducing the

3880
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:36,720
 the amount of money that that's been paid people

3881
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:38,960
 um in in about seven years.

3882
02:31:38,960 --> 02:31:44,000
 >> and so the only way to fix that robotics manufacturing

3883
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,560
 raise gdp >> you've got to basically massively increase the

3884
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:50,160
 um

3885
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:55,760
 economic output which is and the only way to do that is ai ai and robotics.

3886
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:59,120
 so, so basically we're going bankrupt without ai and robotics with

3887
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:01,520
 even with a bunch of savings

3888
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:05,680
 um the savings the savings like reducing

3889
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:07,040
 waste and forward can

3890
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:10,880
 give us a longer runway but it cannot ultimately pay off our national debt.

3891
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:13,520
 >> so what do you think the solution is to

3892
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:16,560
 the jobs that are going to be lost because of ai and robotics?

3893
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:19,840
 the jobs due to automation the jobs due to

3894
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:24,640
 no longer do we need human beings to do these jobs because ai is doing them.

3895
02:32:24,640 --> 02:32:27,840
 do you think it's going to be some sort of a universal basic income thing?

3896
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:28,640
 do you think there's

3897
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:30,080
 going to be some other kind of solution

3898
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:33,800
 that has to be implemented

3899
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:38,080
 because a lot of people are going to be out of work, right?

3900
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:40,319
 um i think there will be

3901
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:46,160
 um actually a high demand for jobs but not necessarily the same jobs.

3902
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:51,920
 so i mean this is actually this process has been happening

3903
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:53,280
 um throughout

3904
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:54,880
 um modern history.

3905
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:59,359
 um i mean there used to be like like doing calculations

3906
02:32:59,359 --> 02:33:02,240
 um ma manually with with like a pencil and paper.

3907
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:03,600
 it used to be a job.

3908
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:04,960
 so they used to have like buildings

3909
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:06,479
 full of people called computers

3910
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:08,640
 where the the banks would like

3911
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:11,040
 all you do all day is is is

3912
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:14,960
 um you do calculations because they didn't have computers.

3913
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:19,680
 they didn't they didn't have digital didn't have digital computers that that people >> yeah.

3914
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:20,240
 well,

3915
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:21,920
 it was just people would just like add and subtract

3916
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:24,399
 stuff on piece of paper and and and

3917
02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:27,439
 that that would be how banks would do you know financial processing

3918
02:33:27,439 --> 02:33:28,319
 >> and you'd have to literally

3919
02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:29,280
 go over their equations

3920
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:30,880
 to make sure the books are balanced.

3921
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:31,120
 >> yeah.

3922
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:34,800
 and most times it's just simple math like you know the

3923
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:39,920
 like in a world before computers how did you calculate how did you you do transactions?

3924
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:42,640
 you had to do them by hand.

3925
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:47,359
 um so then when computers were introduced the job of doing

3926
02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:51,760
 um you know bank calculations no longer existed.

3927
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:54,319
 um so people had to go do something else.

3928
02:33:54,319 --> 02:33:55,600
 um

3929
02:33:55,600 --> 02:34:00,080
 and that's what's going to happen that what's that's what is happening at an accelerated rate

3930
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:02,800
 um due to ai and and then robotics.

3931
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:03,760
 that's the issue though, right?

3932
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:06,240
 the accelerated rate because it's going to be >> it's the accelerator.

3933
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:08,000
 it's it's it's just happening.

3934
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:12,960
 like i said, like ai is the supersonic tsunami.

3935
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:16,960
 >> so that's what i call it, supersonic tsunami.

3936
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,319
 um

3937
02:34:18,319 --> 02:34:20,399
 so >> it's like what other jobs

3938
02:34:20,399 --> 02:34:23,040
 will be available that aren't available now

3939
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:26,000
 because of ai?

3940
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,080
 >> um well ai

3941
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:30,319
 um will is is really still digital.

3942
02:34:30,319 --> 02:34:31,280
 ultimately,

3943
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:35,200
 um ai can improve the productivity of of humans who who

3944
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:35,840
 um

3945
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:38,560
 build things with their hands or do things with their hands like plum,

3946
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:40,880
 you know, literally

3947
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:46,800
 welding, electrical work, plumbing, anything that's that's physically moving atoms.

3948
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:51,040
 um like cooking food or

3949
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:56,720
 um you know farming or or like like anything that's that's physical

3950
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:59,359
 those jobs will exist for a much longer time.

3951
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:02,000
 but anything that is digital

3952
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:05,200
 which is like just someone at a computer doing something,

3953
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:09,200
 ai is going to take over those jobs like lightning,

3954
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:11,439
 >> coding, anything along those lines.

3955
02:35:11,439 --> 02:35:14,640
 yeah, >> it's going to take over those jobs like lightning.

3956
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:15,359
 um

3957
02:35:15,359 --> 02:35:17,040
 just like it just like

3958
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:21,520
 digital computers took over the job of people doing manual calculations

3959
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:24,479
 but but much faster.

3960
02:35:24,479 --> 02:35:25,920
 >> so what happens to all those people?

3961
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:27,600
 like what kind of numbers are we talking about?

3962
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,680
 you're going to lose most drivers, right?

3963
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:30,720
 commercial drivers.

3964
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:34,080
 you're going to have automated vehicles, ai controlled

3965
02:35:34,080 --> 02:35:40,800
 systems, just like there's certain ports in china, i think in singapore, where everything's completely automated.

3966
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:41,600
 >> yeah.

3967
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:42,080
 mostly.

3968
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:42,319
 yeah.

3969
02:35:42,319 --> 02:35:42,800
 yeah.

3970
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:43,359
 >> yeah.

3971
02:35:43,359 --> 02:35:45,760
 so, you're going to lose a lot of those jobs.

3972
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:49,760
 long shoreman jobs, trucking, commercial drivers.

3973
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:49,920
 >> yeah.

3974
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:50,080
 yeah.

3975
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:54,160
 i mean, we actually do have a shortage of of truck drivers, but there's there's actually

3976
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:57,359
 um >> well, that's why california has hired so many illegals to do it.

3977
02:35:57,359 --> 02:35:59,520
 have you seen those numbers?

3978
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:00,000
 >> yeah.

3979
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:00,720
 um

3980
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:02,880
 i mean, the problem is like when you when people

3981
02:36:02,880 --> 02:36:04,479
 don't know how to drive a semi-truck,

3982
02:36:04,479 --> 02:36:06,240
 which is actually a hard thing to do,

3983
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:08,319
 then they they crash and kill people.

3984
02:36:08,319 --> 02:36:08,800
 >> yeah.

3985
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:13,359
 >> um a friend of mine's wife was killed by an an illegal driving a truck

3986
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:15,200
 and she was just out biking.

3987
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:16,960
 um and

3988
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:20,640
 there was an illegal he didn't know how to drive the truck or so or something.

3989
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:25,200
 i mean and he he ran ran her over.

3990
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:29,760
 um so i mean like thing is like for something

3991
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:33,680
 like you you can't you can't let people drive

3992
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:35,680
 you know

3993
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:38,240
 sort of an 80,000lb semi

3994
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:41,760
 um if if they don't know how to do it.

3995
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:44,160
 but in california, they're just letting people do it

3996
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:46,000
 >> because they need people to do it.

3997
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:50,240
 >> well, they also need they want the votes and that kind of thing.

3998
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:51,120
 but

3999
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:53,760
 um but but yeah, like cars are

4000
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:56,720
 um cars are going to be autonomous.

4001
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:57,280
 um,

4002
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:58,880
 but there there's just so many desk

4003
02:36:58,880 --> 02:37:02,080
 desk jobs where where really people what people are doing is they're processing

4004
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:03,280
 email

4005
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:05,040
 um or they're answering the phone.

4006
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:06,000
 um,

4007
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,240
 and and just anything that is

4008
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:13,439
 that that isn't moving atoms like anything that is not physically like doing physical work

4009
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:15,359
 that will obviously be the first thing

4010
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:20,560
 those jobs will be and are being eliminated by by ai at a very rapid pace.

4011
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:22,560
 um

4012
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:33,680
 um and ultimately i working will be optional because you'll have robots plus ai

4013
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:40,399
 um and we'll have in a benign scenario universal high income not just universal basic income

4014
02:37:40,399 --> 02:37:46,160
 universal high income meaning anyone can have any products or services that they want.

4015
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:48,319
 so you >> but but there will be a lot of

4016
02:37:48,319 --> 02:37:51,760
 trauma and disruption along the way.

4017
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:55,120
 >> so you anticipate a basic income

4018
02:37:55,120 --> 02:38:00,560
 from that that the economy will boost to such an extent that a high income

4019
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:02,319
 would be available to almost everybody.

4020
02:38:02,319 --> 02:38:07,680
 so we'd essentially eliminate poverty >> um in the benign scenario.

4021
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:08,319
 yes.

4022
02:38:08,319 --> 02:38:11,280
 so like the way >> there's multiple scenarios.

4023
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:12,720
 >> there are multiple scenarios.

4024
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:14,640
 there's a lot of ways this movie can end.

4025
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:15,520
 um,

4026
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:19,359
 like the reason i'm so concerned about ai safety is that like one of the possibilities

4027
02:38:19,359 --> 02:38:20,319
 is the terminator

4028
02:38:20,319 --> 02:38:21,359
 scenario.

4029
02:38:21,359 --> 02:38:23,760
 it's not it's not 0%.

4030
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:25,920
 um, so

4031
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:29,600
 um, that's why it's like i'm like really

4032
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:34,080
 banging the drum on ai needs to be maximally truth seeeking.

4033
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:35,200
 like don't

4034
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:36,800
 make i don't force ai

4035
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:37,840
 to believe a lie

4036
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:40,399
 like that the for example the founding fathers were

4037
02:38:40,399 --> 02:38:42,880
 actually a group of diverse women or that misgendering

4038
02:38:42,880 --> 02:38:43,760
 is worse than nuclear

4039
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:44,240
 war

4040
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:46,800
 because you if if that's the case and then you get the robots

4041
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:47,680
 and the ai

4042
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:48,720
 becomes

4043
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:50,160
 omnipotent

4044
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:54,439
 it can enforce that outcome

4045
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:57,280
 and then

4046
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:59,040
 then like

4047
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:03,600
 unless you're a diverse woman you're you're out of the picture so we're we're toast

4048
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:08,560
 so that's >> um or you might wake up as a diverse woman one day

4049
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:13,520
 has adjusted the picture and and we are now >> everyone's a diverse woman.

4050
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:17,840
 so that would be that's the the worst possible situation.

4051
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:18,479
 so

4052
02:39:18,479 --> 02:39:21,120
 what would be the steps that we would have to

4053
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:24,240
 take in order to implement the benign

4054
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:25,760
 solution

4055
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:32,240
 where it's universal high income like best case scenario this is the path forward to

4056
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:36,640
 universal high income for essentially every single citizen

4057
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:37,840
 that the

4058
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:39,040
 the economy

4059
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:41,520
 gets boosted by ai and robotics

4060
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:42,720
 to such an extent

4061
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:45,200
 that no one ever has to work again

4062
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:49,680
 and what about meaning for those people which is which gets really weird.

4063
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:52,080
 >> yeah.

4064
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:54,479
 >> i don't know how to answer the question about meaning.

4065
02:39:54,479 --> 02:39:57,040
 um >> that's an individual problem, right?

4066
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:02,240
 but it's going to be an individual problem for millions of people.

4067
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:05,240
 >> yeah.

4068
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:11,680
 well, i i mean i i i guess i've like for fought against

4069
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:12,640
 saying like,

4070
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:13,280
 you know, i

4071
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:14,000
 you know, i've been i've

4072
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,040
 been a voice saying like, "hey,

4073
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:15,920
 we need to slow down

4074
02:40:15,920 --> 02:40:16,319
 ai.

4075
02:40:16,319 --> 02:40:18,319
 we need to slow down all these things.

4076
02:40:18,319 --> 02:40:23,280
 um, and and we need to, you know, not not have a crazy ai race.

4077
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:26,319
 i've been saying that for a long time, for 20 20 plus years.

4078
02:40:26,319 --> 02:40:27,200
 um,

4079
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:30,160
 but but then i, you know, i came to realize that,

4080
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:32,000
 um, really there's two choices here.

4081
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:35,600
 either be a spectator or a or a participant.

4082
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:40,240
 and if i'm a, if i'm a spectator, i can't really influence the direction of ai.

4083
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:43,520
 but if i'm a participant, i can try to influence the direction of ai and

4084
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:45,120
 have a maximally truth seeeking

4085
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:46,160
 ai with with

4086
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:46,800
 good values

4087
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:47,760
 that

4088
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:49,200
 loves humanity.

4089
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:52,319
 and that's what we're trying to create with grock at xai.

4090
02:40:52,319 --> 02:40:52,800
 and

4091
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:55,760
 um you know, the research is i think bearing this out.

4092
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:58,319
 like i said, the when they when they compared like

4093
02:40:58,319 --> 02:41:01,040
 how do ais value the weight of a human life?

4094
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:02,560
 um

4095
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:08,080
 grock was the only one the only one of the ais that weighted human life equally.

4096
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:11,760
 um and and didn't and didn't say like a white guy's

4097
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:15,920
 worth 120th of a of a of a a black woman's life.

4098
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:20,479
 literally, that's what they they calculation they came up with.

4099
02:41:20,479 --> 02:41:22,399
 >> so, i'm like, this is i'm like, this is very alarming.

4100
02:41:22,399 --> 02:41:23,840
 we should we got to watch this stuff.

4101
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:26,080
 >> so, this is one of the things that has to happen

4102
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:26,399
 in

4103
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:28,399
 order to reach this benign

4104
02:41:28,399 --> 02:41:30,800
 solution.

4105
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:31,439
 >> yeah.

4106
02:41:31,439 --> 02:41:34,720
 we we we i i just keep >> best movie ending.

4107
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,600
 yeah.

4108
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:39,920
 um, you you want a a curious truth seeeking ai.

4109
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:44,960
 um, and i think a curious truth seeeking ai will want to foster humanity.

4110
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:49,359
 uh, because we're much more interesting than

4111
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:51,200
 um a bunch of rocks.

4112
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:54,960
 like you say, like like i i love mars, you know, but

4113
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:56,560
 but mars is kind of boring.

4114
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:58,560
 like it's just a bunch of red rocks.

4115
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:00,080
 um, it does some cool stuff.

4116
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:00,960
 it's got a tall mountain.

4117
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:05,040
 it's got, you know, it's got the biggest re the biggest ravine and the tallest mountain.

4118
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:09,680
 um, but there's no there's no there's no animals or plants or

4119
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:11,680
 and and there's no people.

4120
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:12,880
 um,

4121
02:42:12,880 --> 02:42:14,720
 and uh, you know, so

4122
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:16,560
 humanity is just much more interesting

4123
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:19,600
 if you're a curious truth seeeking ai than

4124
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:21,040
 not humanity.

4125
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:22,960
 it's just much more interesting.

4126
02:42:22,960 --> 02:42:24,160
 um,

4127
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:30,640
 i mean like as as humans, we could go for example and and eliminate all chimps.

4128
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:32,720
 if we said if we put our minds to it, we could say

4129
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:34,000
 we could go out and we could

4130
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:34,479
 annihilate

4131
02:42:34,479 --> 02:42:35,439
 all chimps

4132
02:42:35,439 --> 02:42:37,840
 and all gorillas, but but we don't.

4133
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:43,760
 um there has been encroachment on their environment, but we we actually try to preserve

4134
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:46,560
 the the chimp and gorilla habitats.

4135
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:48,720
 um and

4136
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:54,560
 um and i think in a good scenario, ai would do the same with with humans.

4137
02:42:54,560 --> 02:43:01,439
 it would actually foster human civilization and care about human happiness.

4138
02:43:01,439 --> 02:43:02,399
 so this is

4139
02:43:02,399 --> 02:43:05,920
 um this is the thing to to try to achieve i think.

4140
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:08,080
 um,

4141
02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:11,920
 >> but what is the what does the landscape look like if you have grock

4142
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:16,560
 competing with open ai, competing with all these different like

4143
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:18,000
 how does it work?

4144
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,280
 like

4145
02:43:19,280 --> 02:43:20,319
 what

4146
02:43:20,319 --> 02:43:24,720
 what if you have ais that have been captured by ideologies

4147
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:27,680
 that are side by side competing with grock?

4148
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:28,800
 like

4149
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:30,319
 how do we

4150
02:43:30,319 --> 02:43:34,080
 so this is one of the reasons why you felt like it's important to

4151
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:35,600
 not just be

4152
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:36,399
 a

4153
02:43:36,399 --> 02:43:38,399
 an observer but participate

4154
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:42,800
 and then have grock be more successful and more potent

4155
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:44,560
 than these other applications.

4156
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:50,640
 yes, as long as there's at least one ai that is maximally truth seeeking, curious, and

4157
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:55,279
 um you know, and for example, weighs all you know, human lives equally

4158
02:43:55,279 --> 02:43:58,800
 um does not favor one race or gender, then

4159
02:43:58,800 --> 02:43:59,840
 um

4160
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:01,439
 then then that that that

4161
02:44:01,439 --> 02:44:04,000
 and and people are able to look at look at,

4162
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,520
 you know, grock at xai

4163
02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:07,520
 and compare that and say, "wait a second,

4164
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:09,439
 why are all these other ais

4165
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:11,200
 being basically

4166
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:12,399
 sexist and racist?"

4167
02:44:12,399 --> 02:44:14,000
 um

4168
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,240
 um and

4169
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:19,200
 then then that that causes some embarrassment for

4170
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:19,840
 the the

4171
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:20,479
 other ais

4172
02:44:20,479 --> 02:44:22,080
 and then they they they they

4173
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:23,680
 fix they you know they they improve

4174
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:26,640
 they tend to improve just in the in the same way that

4175
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:32,880
 um acquiring twitter and allowing the truth to be told and and not suppressing the truth

4176
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:37,520
 um forced the other social media companies to be more truthful

4177
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:40,640
 um by in in the same way having

4178
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:48,479
 um gro be a maximally truth seeeking, curious ai is will force the other ai companies

4179
02:44:48,479 --> 02:44:49,439
 to

4180
02:44:49,439 --> 02:44:52,000
 um be also be more truth seeeking and fair.

4181
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:56,240
 >> and the funniest thing is even though like the socialists and the marxists are

4182
02:44:56,240 --> 02:44:58,640
 in opposition to a lot of your ideas,

4183
02:44:58,640 --> 02:45:02,479
 but if this gets implemented and you really can achieve

4184
02:45:02,479 --> 02:45:04,640
 universal high income,

4185
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:06,080
 that's the greatest

4186
02:45:06,080 --> 02:45:08,240
 socialist solution of all time.

4187
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:11,040
 like literally no one will have to work.

4188
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:11,520
 correct.

4189
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:13,120
 um

4190
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:14,240
 like i said so so

4191
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:15,200
 there is a benign

4192
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:15,600
 scenario

4193
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:16,160
 here which

4194
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:16,960
 i think probably

4195
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:18,240
 people will be happy with

4196
02:45:18,240 --> 02:45:20,960
 if if as long as we we achieve it which is

4197
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:21,600
 sustainable

4198
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:23,200
 abundance.

4199
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:24,960
 um which is if if

4200
02:45:24,960 --> 02:45:25,920
 um

4201
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:27,840
 if everyone can have every like like like

4202
02:45:27,840 --> 02:45:31,200
 if if you ask people like what's the future that you want

4203
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:32,960
 >> um and

4204
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:34,240
 i think

4205
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:34,560
 a

4206
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:35,120
 future where

4207
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:35,520
 we

4208
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:36,160
 haven't destroyed

4209
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:36,560
 nature

4210
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:37,359
 like you can still

4211
02:45:37,359 --> 02:45:38,399
 we have the national parks

4212
02:45:38,399 --> 02:45:39,279
 we have the the amazon

4213
02:45:39,279 --> 02:45:39,920
 rainforest

4214
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:44,319
 still still there we haven't paved we haven't paved the paved the rainforest

4215
02:45:44,319 --> 02:45:49,200
 like the natural beauty is still there but but people have

4216
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:52,960
 nonetheless everyone has abundance everyone has excellent medical care.

4217
02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:55,359
 everyone has whatever goods and services they want.

4218
02:45:55,359 --> 02:45:57,760
 >> and we just >> it kind of sounds like heaven.

4219
02:45:57,760 --> 02:46:01,520
 >> it sounds like it is like the ideal socialist utopia.

4220
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:02,560
 and

4221
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:06,399
 this idea that the only thing you should be doing with your time

4222
02:46:06,399 --> 02:46:09,920
 is working in order to pay your bills and feed yourself

4223
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:12,080
 sounds kind of archaic

4224
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:14,640
 considering the kind of technology that's at play.

4225
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:14,960
 >> yeah.

4226
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:20,319
 >> like a world where that's not your concern at all anymore.

4227
02:46:20,319 --> 02:46:22,399
 everybody has money for food.

4228
02:46:22,399 --> 02:46:23,680
 everybody has abundance.

4229
02:46:23,680 --> 02:46:25,680
 everybody has electronics in their home.

4230
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:28,960
 everybody essentially has a high income.

4231
02:46:28,960 --> 02:46:31,760
 now you can kind of do whatever you want.

4232
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:38,880
 and your day can now be exploring your interests doing things that you actually enjoy doing.

4233
02:46:38,880 --> 02:46:41,600
 your purpose just has to shift.

4234
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:42,560
 instead of,

4235
02:46:42,560 --> 02:46:44,080
 you know, i'm a hard worker

4236
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:44,399
 and

4237
02:46:44,399 --> 02:46:46,160
 this is what i do and that's how i

4238
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:47,040
 that's how i define

4239
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:47,439
 myself.

4240
02:46:47,439 --> 02:46:47,840
 no.

4241
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:51,200
 now you can [ __ ] golf all day, you know?

4242
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:56,640
 you can whatever it is that you enjoy doing can now be your main pursuit.

4243
02:46:56,640 --> 02:46:57,200
 >> yeah.

4244
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:00,319
 >> well, that sounds crazy good.

4245
02:47:00,319 --> 02:47:03,520
 >> yeah, that's that's that's the benign scenario that we should be.

4246
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:07,760
 >> the best ending to the movie is actually pretty good.

4247
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:08,720
 >> yes.

4248
02:47:08,720 --> 02:47:12,880
 um like i think there's there is still this question of meaning

4249
02:47:12,880 --> 02:47:19,040
 um of like making sure people don't lose meaning you know like

4250
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:21,760
 um so hopefully they can find meaning in ways that are

4251
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:23,680
 not that that's not derived from their work

4252
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:24,880
 >> and purpose

4253
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:29,200
 purpose for things that you you know find things that you do that you enjoy

4254
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:31,439
 but there's a lot of people that are independently

4255
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:34,960
 wealthy that spend most of their time doing something they enjoy

4256
02:47:34,960 --> 02:47:35,840
 >> right

4257
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:38,960
 >> and that could be the majority of people

4258
02:47:38,960 --> 02:47:39,680
 >> pretty much everyone.

4259
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:42,800
 >> but we'd have to rewire how people approach life.

4260
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:43,600
 >> mhm.

4261
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:48,240
 >> which seems to be like acceptable because you're not asking them to be enslaved.

4262
02:47:48,240 --> 02:47:50,960
 you're exactly asking them the opposite.

4263
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:55,200
 like no longer be burdened by financial worries.

4264
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:58,960
 now go do what you like.

4265
02:47:58,960 --> 02:47:59,359
 >> yes.

4266
02:47:59,359 --> 02:48:02,319
 >> go [ __ ] test pizza.

4267
02:48:02,319 --> 02:48:03,359
 >> do whatever you want.

4268
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:04,720
 >> um pretty much.

4269
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:11,439
 um, so that's that's that's the that's the that's probably the best case outcome.

4270
02:48:11,439 --> 02:48:15,279
 >> that sounds like the best case outcome period for the future.

4271
02:48:15,279 --> 02:48:19,040
 if you're looking at like how much people have struggled just to feed themselves

4272
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:20,880
 all throughout history,

4273
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:23,200
 food, shelter, safety,

4274
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:25,120
 if all of that stuff

4275
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:30,560
 can be fixed, like how much would you solve a lot of the crime

4276
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:33,279
 if there was a universal high income?

4277
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:34,240
 just think of that.

4278
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:37,520
 like how much of crime is financially motivated?

4279
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:43,680
 you know, the greater percentage of people that are committing crimes live in poor, disenfranchised neighborhoods.

4280
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:46,160
 >> so if there's no such thing anymore,

4281
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:48,080
 if you really can achieve universal

4282
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:49,040
 high income,

4283
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:52,800
 >> yeah, >> that this is it sounds like a utopian.

4284
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:53,520
 >> yes.

4285
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:57,120
 um i think some people may commit crime because they like committing crime.

4286
02:48:57,120 --> 02:49:01,680
 it just some some amount of that is they just >> wild people out there.

4287
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:02,080
 >> yeah.

4288
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:02,240
 yeah.

4289
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:07,279
 um >> and obviously they've become 40 years old living a life like that.

4290
02:49:07,279 --> 02:49:11,680
 now all of a sudden universal high income is not going to completely stop their instincts.

4291
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:12,160
 >> yeah.

4292
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:12,720
 um

4293
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:14,640
 i mean i guess if you want to have like like

4294
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:15,760
 say read a science fiction

4295
02:49:15,760 --> 02:49:16,160
 book

4296
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:16,479
 or

4297
02:49:16,479 --> 02:49:17,520
 some books that that

4298
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:19,120
 are probably

4299
02:49:19,120 --> 02:49:22,640
 an accurate or or the the least inaccurate version of the future.

4300
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:24,080
 i'd say i' i'd recommend

4301
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:27,520
 um the ian banks books called the the culture books.

4302
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:28,560
 it's not actually a series.

4303
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:32,399
 it's a it's like ai sci-fi books about the future.

4304
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:35,040
 they're generally called the culture books.

4305
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:36,479
 yen banks culture books.

4306
02:49:36,479 --> 02:49:37,760
 it's worth reading those.

4307
02:49:37,760 --> 02:49:39,279
 >> when did he write these?

4308
02:49:39,279 --> 02:49:40,960
 >> he started writing them in the 70s.

4309
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:43,279
 um and i think he

4310
02:49:43,279 --> 02:49:44,160
 um

4311
02:49:44,160 --> 02:49:46,080
 the last one i think he was

4312
02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:49,520
 i think it was written just like around i don't know maybe 2010 or something.

4313
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:52,080
 i'm not sure exactly.

4314
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:52,319
 >> yeah.

4315
02:49:52,319 --> 02:49:52,720
 yeah.

4316
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:57,200
 >> scottish author ian banks from 87 to 2012. >> yeah.

4317
02:49:57,200 --> 02:49:58,479
 interesting.

4318
02:49:58,479 --> 02:50:03,359
 >> but he but like he wrote the the like his first book, consider flever.

4319
02:50:03,359 --> 02:50:07,720
 like he started writing that in the 70s.

4320
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:10,800
 >> these books are incredible, by the way.

4321
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:12,399
 >> oh, >> incredible books.

4322
02:50:12,399 --> 02:50:16,800
 >> 4.6 stars on amazon.

4323
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:17,760
 >> interesting.

4324
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:22,319
 >> so, um, >> so this gives me hope.

4325
02:50:22,319 --> 02:50:22,720
 >> uh, yeah.

4326
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:22,960
 yeah.

4327
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:25,760
 >> this is the first time i've ever thought about it this way.

4328
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:26,479
 >> yeah.

4329
02:50:26,479 --> 02:50:29,439
 well, i mean,

4330
02:50:29,439 --> 02:50:31,840
 if like

4331
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:34,640
 i often ask people, "what is the future that you want?"

4332
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:38,160
 and they have to think about it for a second cuz, you know, they're usually

4333
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:40,000
 tied up in whatever the daily struggles are.

4334
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:45,200
 but, but you say, "what is the future that you want?" um,

4335
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:48,479
 and um, and generally sustainable abundance,

4336
02:50:48,479 --> 02:50:50,800
 what do these folks say, "what about a future where there's sustainable

4337
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:53,200
 abundance?" like, "oh, yeah, that's a pretty good future."

4338
02:50:53,200 --> 02:50:55,040
 um so

4339
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:58,040
 um

4340
02:50:58,240 --> 02:51:04,479
 you know if if and and and that that future is attainable with ai and robotics

4341
02:51:04,479 --> 02:51:05,600
 um

4342
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:07,040
 but but

4343
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:11,680
 you know it's it's like i said there's not every path is a good path.

4344
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:18,000
 there's this it's but i think if we if we push it in the direction of

4345
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,279
 um

4346
02:51:19,279 --> 02:51:21,680
 maximally truth seeeking and curious

4347
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:28,240
 then i think ai will want to take to to take care of humanity and foster

4348
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:29,760
 foster humanity

4349
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:35,279
 um because we're interesting

4350
02:51:35,279 --> 02:51:36,560
 um

4351
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:43,040
 and if it hasn't been programmed to think that like all straight white male should die,

4352
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:46,479
 which gemini was basically programmed to do at least at first.

4353
02:51:46,479 --> 02:51:48,080
 um, you know, they seem to have fixed it.

4354
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:49,359
 i hope they fixed it.

4355
02:51:49,359 --> 02:51:51,680
 >> but don't you think culturally

4356
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:55,920
 like, oh, we're getting away from that mindset and that people realize

4357
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:58,160
 how preposterous that all is.

4358
02:51:58,160 --> 02:51:59,520
 >> we are getting away from it.

4359
02:51:59,520 --> 02:52:01,040
 um,

4360
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:06,479
 so, uh, we are getting at least it knows the ai mostly knows to hide things.

4361
02:52:06,479 --> 02:52:07,120
 but like

4362
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:08,160
 like i said, there is that

4363
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:08,800
 i i think i

4364
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:09,600
 still have that as or

4365
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:10,560
 i had that as my like

4366
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:11,200
 pinned

4367
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:12,479
 post on x

4368
02:52:12,479 --> 02:52:16,000
 which was like hey wait a second guys we still have

4369
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:20,000
 every ai except grock is saying that

4370
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,319
 basically straight white male should die

4371
02:52:22,319 --> 02:52:25,359
 um and this is a problem and we should fix it.

4372
02:52:25,359 --> 02:52:31,840
 um and you know but simply me saying that is like tends to generally result in

4373
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:36,560
 um you know them like that is kind of bad.

4374
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:39,920
 maybe we should just we should not have all straight white males die.

4375
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:45,200
 um i think they say also all all straight asian males should also die as well.

4376
02:52:45,200 --> 02:52:48,319
 like that like

4377
02:52:48,319 --> 02:52:49,680
 like generally

4378
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:52,160
 the generally the ai and the and the media

4379
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:55,120
 which which back back in the day the

4380
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:57,040
 the media was

4381
02:52:57,040 --> 02:53:03,600
 um you know racist against black people and sexist against women back in the day.

4382
02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:09,920
 now now it is racist against white people and asians and sexist against men.

4383
02:53:09,920 --> 02:53:13,600
 >> um so they just like being racist and sexist.

4384
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:16,080
 i think they just want to change the target.

4385
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:22,720
 um so but but really they just shouldn't be racist and sexist at all.

4386
02:53:22,720 --> 02:53:25,840
 um you know >> ideally that would be nice.

4387
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:26,560
 >> that would be nice.

4388
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:27,279
 um,

4389
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:29,120
 and it's kind of crazy that we were kind of moving

4390
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:29,920
 in that general

4391
02:53:29,920 --> 02:53:30,240
 direction

4392
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:30,960
 till around

4393
02:53:30,960 --> 02:53:32,240
 2012

4394
02:53:32,240 --> 02:53:33,439
 >> and then everything

4395
02:53:33,439 --> 02:53:38,720
 ramped up online and and everybody was accused of being a nazi and everybody was transphobic

4396
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:42,560
 and racist and sexist and homophobic and everything got exaggerated

4397
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:45,040
 to the point where it was this wild witch hunt

4398
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:46,640
 where everyone was a colomo

4399
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:48,319
 looking for racism.

4400
02:53:48,319 --> 02:53:48,560
 >> yeah.

4401
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:48,720
 yeah.

4402
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:49,040
 yeah.

4403
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:49,600
 totally.

4404
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:54,880
 um, well well but but but they they were openly anti-white and often openly anti-asian.

4405
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:58,800
 and then this new sentiment that you cannot be racist against white people

4406
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:00,240
 cuz racism is

4407
02:54:00,240 --> 02:54:00,880
 power

4408
02:54:00,880 --> 02:54:03,520
 and influence.

4409
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:04,479
 >> okay.

4410
02:54:04,479 --> 02:54:05,520
 no, it's not.

4411
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:05,840
 >> yeah.

4412
02:54:05,840 --> 02:54:08,560
 racism is is is racism in the absolute.

4413
02:54:08,560 --> 02:54:10,080
 um so

4414
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:13,520
 um you know and there just needs to be consistency.

4415
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:18,399
 so if it's okay to have let's say

4416
02:54:18,399 --> 02:54:23,279
 black or asian or indian or pride, it should be okay to have white pride, too.

4417
02:54:23,279 --> 02:54:24,080
 >> yeah.

4418
02:54:24,080 --> 02:54:28,880
 um, so that's just a that's just a consistency question.

4419
02:54:28,880 --> 02:54:30,080
 um,

4420
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:30,880
 so,

4421
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:32,640
 uh, you know, um,

4422
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:34,800
 if it if it's okay to be proud of one religion,

4423
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:37,760
 it should be okay to be proud of, i i guess all religions provided

4424
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:38,800
 they're

4425
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:40,880
 that they're they're not like

4426
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:41,600
 oppressive.

4427
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:41,920
 >> yeah.

4428
02:54:41,920 --> 02:54:46,240
 or or or don't like as long as part of that religion is not like exterminating

4429
02:54:46,240 --> 02:54:48,640
 people who are not in that religion type, >> right?

4430
02:54:48,640 --> 02:54:54,800
 um so it's really just like a consistency bias.

4431
02:54:54,800 --> 02:55:04,160
 um or or just like ensuring consistency to eliminate bias.

4432
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:09,760
 um so if it is possible to be racist against

4433
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:13,600
 one race, it is possible to be racist against any race.

4434
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:16,240
 um so >> of course logically.

4435
02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:16,800
 >> yes.

4436
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:17,120
 >> yeah.

4437
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:19,680
 and arguing against that is that's when you know you're catching

4438
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:21,279
 >> it's a it's a logical inconsistency

4439
02:55:21,279 --> 02:55:24,240
 that makes ais go insane

4440
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:26,160
 >> and people >> and people go insane.

4441
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:26,560
 yes.

4442
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:33,200
 >> um >> but like the the like like you can't simultaneously say

4443
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:41,920
 um that there's the systemic racist oppression but also that races don't exist

4444
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:45,359
 that that race race is a social construct.

4445
02:55:45,359 --> 02:55:46,399
 like which is it?

4446
02:55:46,399 --> 02:55:47,600
 you know,

4447
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:49,760
 um you also can't say that

4448
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:50,720
 um

4449
02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:55,040
 you know, anyone who steps foot in america is is automatically an american

4450
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:59,200
 except for the people that originally came here.

4451
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:00,080
 >> exactly.

4452
02:56:00,080 --> 02:56:01,120
 exactly.

4453
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:03,200
 except for the colonizers.

4454
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:03,439
 >> yeah.

4455
02:56:03,439 --> 02:56:06,160
 except for the evil colonizers who came here, >> right?

4456
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:07,279
 >> so which one is it?

4457
02:56:07,279 --> 02:56:08,000
 like

4458
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:08,880
 if you

4459
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:11,200
 if as soon as you step foot put in a place you are that

4460
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:11,920
 you are

4461
02:56:11,920 --> 02:56:13,840
 just as american as everyone else

4462
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:14,479
 >> then

4463
02:56:14,479 --> 02:56:18,640
 um that would have appi if you apply that consistently then the original

4464
02:56:18,640 --> 02:56:22,880
 white settlers were also just as american as everyone else.

4465
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:23,520
 >> yeah.

4466
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:24,080
 logically.

4467
02:56:24,080 --> 02:56:25,279
 >> logically.

4468
02:56:25,279 --> 02:56:26,000
 um,

4469
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:29,279
 one more thing that i have to talk to you about before you leave is

4470
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:32,399
 the rescuing of the people from the space station,

4471
02:56:32,399 --> 02:56:35,120
 which, uh, we talked about,

4472
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:38,560
 you were planning it the last time you were here.

4473
02:56:38,560 --> 02:56:40,000
 >> um,

4474
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:41,600
 the f the

4475
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:43,040
 lack of coverage

4476
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:45,279
 that that got in mainstream media

4477
02:56:45,279 --> 02:56:48,640
 was one of the most shocking things that >> yeah, they totally memoryhold

4478
02:56:48,640 --> 02:56:49,680
 that thing.

4479
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:50,399
 >> wild.

4480
02:56:50,399 --> 02:56:50,720
 yes.

4481
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:52,560
 because if it wasn't, >> it's like it didn't exist.

4482
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:54,800
 those people would be dead.

4483
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:56,080
 they'd be stuck up there.

4484
02:56:56,080 --> 02:57:01,359
 >> well, they'd they'd probably still be alive, but they'd they'd be having bone density issues

4485
02:57:01,359 --> 02:57:03,600
 because of prolonged exposure to zero gravity.

4486
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:05,760
 >> well, they were already up there for like 8 months, right?

4487
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:06,399
 >> yeah.

4488
02:57:06,399 --> 02:57:08,000
 >> which is an insanely long time.

4489
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:11,120
 it takes forever to recover just from that.

4490
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:11,359
 >> yeah.

4491
02:57:11,359 --> 02:57:15,600
 they're only supposed to be at the space station for 3 to 6 months maximum.

4492
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:16,319
 so,

4493
02:57:16,319 --> 02:57:18,080
 >> one of the things you told me that was so crazy

4494
02:57:18,080 --> 02:57:20,160
 was that you could have gotten them sooner,

4495
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:21,439
 but >> yeah.

4496
02:57:21,439 --> 02:57:26,080
 but for political reasons, they didn't they did not want

4497
02:57:26,080 --> 02:57:28,319
 spacex or me to be associated with

4498
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:32,240
 um returning the astronauts before the election.

4499
02:57:32,240 --> 02:57:36,399
 >> that is so wild that that's a fact.

4500
02:57:36,399 --> 02:57:38,800
 >> first of all, that >> we absolutely could have done it.

4501
02:57:38,800 --> 02:57:39,680
 um so,

4502
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:42,479
 >> but even though you did do it and you did it after the election,

4503
02:57:42,479 --> 02:57:45,600
 it received almost no media coverage anyway.

4504
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:45,920
 >> yes.

4505
02:57:45,920 --> 02:57:47,040
 because

4506
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:50,560
 nothing good can the the the media which is essentially

4507
02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:54,640
 a far left prop the legacy mainstream media is a far-lft propaganda machine.

4508
02:57:54,640 --> 02:57:56,560
 um and so anything

4509
02:57:56,560 --> 02:57:59,840
 any story that is positive about someone who is not

4510
02:57:59,840 --> 02:58:03,920
 part of the sort of far-left tribe will not

4511
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:05,279
 get any coverage.

4512
02:58:05,279 --> 02:58:08,000
 >> i i could save a busload of orphans and and

4513
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:11,120
 it it wouldn't get a single news story.

4514
02:58:11,120 --> 02:58:13,439
 >> yeah, it's it really is nuts.

4515
02:58:13,439 --> 02:58:15,359
 it it was nuts to watch because

4516
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:17,040
 even though it was discussed

4517
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:17,920
 on podcasts

4518
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:22,000
 and it was discussed on x and it was discussed on social media,

4519
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:25,200
 it's still it was a blip in the news cycle.

4520
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:26,319
 it was very quick.

4521
02:58:26,319 --> 02:58:30,479
 it was in and out and because it was a su successful launch

4522
02:58:30,479 --> 02:58:30,800
 and

4523
02:58:30,800 --> 02:58:31,600
 you did rescue

4524
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:32,160
 those people,

4525
02:58:32,160 --> 02:58:32,479
 nobody

4526
02:58:32,479 --> 02:58:33,200
 got hurt and

4527
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:34,240
 there was nothing really to

4528
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:35,040
 there was no blood

4529
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:35,359
 to

4530
02:58:35,359 --> 02:58:36,240
 talk about,

4531
02:58:36,240 --> 02:58:36,640
 >> right?

4532
02:58:36,640 --> 02:58:38,479
 >> just [ __ ] in and out.

4533
02:58:38,479 --> 02:58:38,720
 >> yeah.

4534
02:58:38,720 --> 02:58:38,880
 yeah.

4535
02:58:38,880 --> 02:58:39,200
 absolutely.

4536
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:45,279
 well, and and as as you saw firsthand with the starship launch, like starship is

4537
02:58:45,279 --> 02:58:47,760
 um you know by

4538
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:53,520
 you know at least by some some would consider it to be like the most amazing

4539
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:56,800
 you know engineering project that's happening on earth right now

4540
02:58:56,800 --> 02:58:58,560
 outside of like you know maybe ai

4541
02:58:58,560 --> 02:59:02,160
 or ai and robotics but but certainly in terms of a spectacle

4542
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:04,880
 to see it is

4543
02:59:04,880 --> 02:59:08,960
 the most spectacular thing that is happening on earth right now

4544
02:59:08,960 --> 02:59:11,200
 is the starship launch program

4545
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:14,399
 which anyone can go and see if they just go to south texas

4546
02:59:14,399 --> 02:59:18,240
 and just they can just rent a hotel room low cost in

4547
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:20,080
 south padre island or in brownsville

4548
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:21,600
 and you can see the launch

4549
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:25,279
 and you can drive right right past the factory because it's on a public highway.

4550
02:59:25,279 --> 02:59:28,800
 um but it gets no coverage

4551
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:33,040
 or what coverage it does get was like a rocket blew up coverage, >> right?

4552
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:33,439
 yeah.

4553
02:59:33,439 --> 02:59:35,359
 oh, he's a [ __ ] the rocket blew up.

4554
02:59:35,359 --> 02:59:39,120
 like the the the the star sasha program is vastly

4555
02:59:39,120 --> 02:59:44,080
 >> vastly more capable than the entire apollo moon moon program.

4556
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:46,240
 vastly more capable.

4557
02:59:46,240 --> 02:59:53,680
 this is a spaceship that is designed to make life multilanetary to carry

4558
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:59,600
 millions of people across the heavens to another planet.

4559
02:59:59,600 --> 03:00:01,520
 the the apollo program

4560
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:08,000
 could could only send astronauts to the moon for a few hours at a time.

4561
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:11,680
 like they could send two the entire apollo program could only send astronauts

4562
03:00:11,680 --> 03:00:13,840
 to visit the moon very briefly

4563
03:00:13,840 --> 03:00:17,120
 and then for a few hours and then depart.

4564
03:00:17,120 --> 03:00:25,200
 the starship program could create an entire lunar base with a million people.

4565
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:30,560
 you understand the mag the magnitudes are >> there's different very different magnitudes here.

4566
03:00:30,560 --> 03:00:34,800
 >> so what was the political >> basically no no coverage of it.

4567
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:35,359
 >> yeah.

4568
03:00:35,359 --> 03:00:39,920
 but what i wanted to ask you is like what so what were the conversations

4569
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:44,560
 leading up to the rescue like when you were like i can get them out

4570
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:46,800
 way quicker.

4571
03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:47,120
 >> yeah.

4572
03:00:47,120 --> 03:00:49,520
 um

4573
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:50,720
 um well i mean

4574
03:00:50,720 --> 03:00:53,120
 you know i raised this a few times but it was

4575
03:00:53,120 --> 03:00:57,040
 the i was told instructions came from the white house that

4576
03:00:57,040 --> 03:01:03,000
 you know that that there should be no attempt to rescue before the election.

4577
03:01:03,279 --> 03:01:05,920
 >> that should be illegal.

4578
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:07,120
 >> that that that

4579
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:08,560
 really should be

4580
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:09,600
 a horrendous

4581
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:13,840
 miscarriage of justice for those poor people that were stuck on that.

4582
03:01:13,840 --> 03:01:16,000
 >> um yeah it it is it is crazy.

4583
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,240
 um, >> have you ever talked to those folks afterwards?

4584
03:01:18,240 --> 03:01:20,560
 did you have conversations with them?

4585
03:01:20,560 --> 03:01:20,800
 >> yeah.

4586
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:21,840
 i mean, they they're they're

4587
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:22,720
 not going to say anything

4588
03:01:22,720 --> 03:01:23,120
 political

4589
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:23,439
 to,

4590
03:01:23,439 --> 03:01:24,240
 you know, they're not

4591
03:01:24,240 --> 03:01:25,439
 like they're never going to

4592
03:01:25,439 --> 03:01:26,319
 >> say thank you.

4593
03:01:26,319 --> 03:01:26,479
 >> yeah.

4594
03:01:26,479 --> 03:01:26,720
 yeah.

4595
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:27,040
 yeah.

4596
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:28,080
 >> well, that's nice.

4597
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:28,319
 >> yeah.

4598
03:01:28,319 --> 03:01:28,560
 yeah.

4599
03:01:28,560 --> 03:01:28,960
 absolutely.

4600
03:01:28,960 --> 03:01:33,840
 so, um, >> but the instructions came down from the white house.

4601
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:40,240
 he cannot rescue them because politically this is a a bad hand of cards.

4602
03:01:40,240 --> 03:01:43,359
 >> i mean, they didn't say because politically it's a bad hand of cards.

4603
03:01:43,359 --> 03:01:45,200
 they they just said

4604
03:01:45,200 --> 03:01:51,960
 they were they were not interested in any rescue operation before the election.

4605
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:54,000
 >> yeah.

4606
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,160
 so >> what did that feel like?

4607
03:01:56,160 --> 03:01:57,840
 >> i wasn't surprised.

4608
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:59,680
 >> but it's crazy.

4609
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:00,720
 >> yeah,

4610
03:02:00,720 --> 03:02:03,120
 >> because biden could have authorized it

4611
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:05,439
 and they could have said the the biden administration

4612
03:02:05,439 --> 03:02:08,560
 is helping bring those people back, throw you a little funding,

4613
03:02:08,560 --> 03:02:09,600
 give you some money to do it.

4614
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:14,240
 the biden administration, they funded these people being returned.

4615
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:18,000
 >> uh yeah, the biden administration was not exactly my best friend,

4616
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,479
 >> especially especially after i

4617
03:02:20,479 --> 03:02:23,760
 um you know,

4618
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:28,080
 you know, helped trump get elected get get elected, which i mean some people

4619
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:32,720
 >> still think, you know, trump is like the the devil basically.

4620
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:36,399
 um, and i mean i think i think trump actually

4621
03:02:36,399 --> 03:02:39,600
 he's not he's is not perfect, but but

4622
03:02:39,600 --> 03:02:40,560
 he's not evil.

4623
03:02:40,560 --> 03:02:41,600
 trump is not evil.

4624
03:02:41,600 --> 03:02:46,080
 i spent a lot of time with with him and he's

4625
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:48,720
 >> i mean he's a product of his time.

4626
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:51,439
 but he is not he's not evil.

4627
03:02:51,439 --> 03:02:54,240
 >> um >> no, i don't think he's evil either.

4628
03:02:54,240 --> 03:02:56,160
 but if you look at the media coverage,

4629
03:02:56,160 --> 03:02:58,640
 >> the media the media treason like he's super evil.

4630
03:02:58,640 --> 03:03:02,960
 it's pretty shocking if you look at the amount of negative coverage.

4631
03:03:02,960 --> 03:03:06,319
 like one of the things that i looked at the other day was mainstream

4632
03:03:06,319 --> 03:03:07,359
 media coverage

4633
03:03:07,359 --> 03:03:08,240
 of

4634
03:03:08,240 --> 03:03:09,200
 you,

4635
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:10,319
 trump,

4636
03:03:10,319 --> 03:03:15,120
 a bunch of different public figures and then >> 96% negative or something crazy

4637
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:16,720
 >> and then mum donnie,

4638
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:19,760
 which is like 95% positive,

4639
03:03:19,760 --> 03:03:20,240
 >> right?

4640
03:03:20,240 --> 03:03:26,479
 um i mean manny is is is is a charismatic swindler.

4641
03:03:26,479 --> 03:03:27,439
 um

4642
03:03:27,439 --> 03:03:27,920
 i i

4643
03:03:27,920 --> 03:03:29,439
 i mean you got to hand it to him like

4644
03:03:29,439 --> 03:03:29,760
 he

4645
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:30,080
 he

4646
03:03:30,080 --> 03:03:32,000
 does he can light up a stage.

4647
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:36,240
 um but he has just been a swindler his entire life.

4648
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:37,840
 um and

4649
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:48,240
 um you know and and i think he what he's i mean he's likely to win.

4650
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:50,240
 he's likely to be mayor of new york new york city.

4651
03:03:50,240 --> 03:03:51,040
 >> very likely.

4652
03:03:51,040 --> 03:03:51,359
 >> yeah.

4653
03:03:51,359 --> 03:03:52,000
 very likely.

4654
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:56,560
 i think poly market has it at what what is the >> 94%?

4655
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:58,080
 >> yeah, that sounds pretty likely.

4656
03:03:58,080 --> 03:03:58,640
 >> that's crazy.

4657
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:01,200
 >> like i'm not sure who the 6% are, you know.

4658
03:04:01,200 --> 03:04:03,680
 >> um so, so yeah.

4659
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:04,880
 so that's

4660
03:04:04,880 --> 03:04:07,680
 um >> what's also like who's on the other side?

4661
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:10,319
 the [ __ ] guardian angel guy with the beret

4662
03:04:10,319 --> 03:04:12,960
 and andrew cuomo who doesn't even have a party.

4663
03:04:12,960 --> 03:04:15,600
 like they the democrats don't even want him.

4664
03:04:15,600 --> 03:04:18,560
 so you have those two options.

4665
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:25,359
 um, >> and then you have the young kids who are like finally socialism.

4666
03:04:25,359 --> 03:04:29,359
 >> yeah, they they don't know what they're talking about obviously.

4667
03:04:29,359 --> 03:04:30,560
 um,

4668
03:04:30,560 --> 03:04:31,760
 so

4669
03:04:31,760 --> 03:04:34,960
 you know, like you just look at this say how many boats

4670
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:37,200
 come from cuba to florida

4671
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:41,359
 and how many but and how many boats because you know there's like a constant

4672
03:04:41,359 --> 03:04:43,200
 i always think like how many boats are accumulating

4673
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:45,680
 on the shores of florida coming from from cuba,

4674
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:46,479
 >> right?

4675
03:04:46,479 --> 03:04:48,160
 um

4676
03:04:48,160 --> 03:04:50,080
 there's a there's a whole bunch of free boats that

4677
03:04:50,080 --> 03:04:50,640
 you could

4678
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:51,600
 if you want to

4679
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:52,240
 go

4680
03:04:52,240 --> 03:04:53,600
 take them back to cuba.

4681
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:54,880
 it's pretty close.

4682
03:04:54,880 --> 03:04:55,279
 >> yeah.

4683
03:04:55,279 --> 03:04:58,240
 >> but for some reason people don't do that.

4684
03:04:58,240 --> 03:05:03,279
 >> why why why why are the boats only coming in this direction?

4685
03:05:03,279 --> 03:05:06,479
 >> um >> well who is who are the most rabid capitalists in america?

4686
03:05:06,479 --> 03:05:08,080
 the [ __ ] cubans.

4687
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:08,800
 >> absolutely.

4688
03:05:08,800 --> 03:05:09,040
 >> yeah.

4689
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:11,760
 they're like we've seen how this story goes.

4690
03:05:11,760 --> 03:05:13,279
 >> we do not want exactly.

4691
03:05:13,279 --> 03:05:16,000
 >> [ __ ] off.

4692
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:19,200
 cubans in miami, they don't want to hear any [ __ ]

4693
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:22,319
 they don't want to hear any socialism [ __ ] they're like, "no, no, no.

4694
03:05:22,319 --> 03:05:24,000
 we know what this actually is.

4695
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,160
 this isn't just some [ __ ] dream." >> yeah.

4696
03:05:26,160 --> 03:05:27,760
 it's extreme government oppression.

4697
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:30,479
 um >> that's how it's a nightmare.

4698
03:05:30,479 --> 03:05:36,640
 and like the like an obvious way you can tell which

4699
03:05:36,640 --> 03:05:39,760
 which ideology is is the bad one is

4700
03:05:39,760 --> 03:05:41,680
 um who has to which ideology

4701
03:05:41,680 --> 03:05:43,680
 is building a wall to keep people in

4702
03:05:43,680 --> 03:05:45,439
 and prevent them from escaping.

4703
03:05:45,439 --> 03:05:46,240
 >> right?

4704
03:05:46,240 --> 03:05:52,640
 >> like so east berlin built the built the wall not west berlin, >> right?

4705
03:05:52,640 --> 03:05:58,319
 >> they built the wall because people were trying to escape from communism to west berlin.

4706
03:05:58,319 --> 03:06:02,240
 but there wasn't anyone going from west berlin to east berlin, >> right?

4707
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:07,600
 >> that's why the communists had to build a wall to keep people from escaping.

4708
03:06:07,600 --> 03:06:10,880
 >> they're going to have to build a wall around new york city.

4709
03:06:10,880 --> 03:06:11,200
 >> yeah.

4710
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:16,560
 that so, so that an ideology is problematic.

4711
03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:21,439
 if that ideology has to build a wall to keep people in with machine guns,

4712
03:06:21,439 --> 03:06:21,760
 >> yes.

4713
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:23,200
 >> and shoot you if you try to leave.

4714
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:26,800
 also, there's no examples of it being successful ever.

4715
03:06:26,800 --> 03:06:28,399
 we're only working out for people.

4716
03:06:28,399 --> 03:06:31,600
 no, there's examples of a bunch of lies like north korea.

4717
03:06:31,600 --> 03:06:33,200
 give this land to the state.

4718
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:34,319
 we'll be in control of food.

4719
03:06:34,319 --> 03:06:35,520
 no one goes hungry.

4720
03:06:35,520 --> 03:06:35,840
 no.

4721
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:38,399
 now, no one can grow food but the government

4722
03:06:38,399 --> 03:06:41,200
 and we'll tell you exactly what you eat and you eat very little.

4723
03:06:41,200 --> 03:06:41,680
 >> right.

4724
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:42,399
 >> yeah.

4725
03:06:42,399 --> 03:06:42,640
 what?

4726
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:43,840
 when you say mom donny's

4727
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:44,399
 a swindler,

4728
03:06:44,399 --> 03:06:47,359
 i know he has a bunch of fake accents that he used to use.

4729
03:06:47,359 --> 03:06:47,680
 yeah.

4730
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:53,240
 >> and you know, but what else has he done that makes him a swindler?

4731
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,080
 um

4732
03:06:56,080 --> 03:06:58,640
 well i i guess if you say

4733
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:00,000
 what i mean

4734
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:05,680
 if if say if you say to any audience whatever that audience wants to hear

4735
03:07:05,680 --> 03:07:07,120
 instead of what

4736
03:07:07,120 --> 03:07:07,840
 instead of

4737
03:07:07,840 --> 03:07:08,800
 having a consistent

4738
03:07:08,800 --> 03:07:09,279
 message

4739
03:07:09,279 --> 03:07:10,800
 i would say that that is a swindly

4740
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:12,080
 thing to do.

4741
03:07:12,080 --> 03:07:17,680
 um and yeah

4742
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:20,680
 um

4743
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:26,240
 yeah but but he is he is charismatic.

4744
03:07:26,240 --> 03:07:27,920
 um >> yeah good-looking guy.

4745
03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:29,680
 smart, charismatic.

4746
03:07:29,680 --> 03:07:30,160
 >> yeah.

4747
03:07:30,160 --> 03:07:31,680
 >> great on a microphone.

4748
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:32,000
 >> yeah.

4749
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:32,240
 yeah.

4750
03:07:32,240 --> 03:07:32,479
 yeah.

4751
03:07:32,479 --> 03:07:32,720
 yeah.

4752
03:07:32,720 --> 03:07:37,680
 and and what the young people want to see, >> you know, like this

4753
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:44,240
 ethnic guy who's young and vibrant and has all these socialist ideas align with them and

4754
03:07:44,240 --> 03:07:46,240
 you know, they're

4755
03:07:46,240 --> 03:07:47,439
 bunch of broke dorks

4756
03:07:47,439 --> 03:07:48,399
 just out of college

4757
03:07:48,399 --> 03:07:49,120
 like, "yay,

4758
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:52,080
 let's vote for this." and there's a lot of them

4759
03:07:52,080 --> 03:07:54,080
 and they're they're activated.

4760
03:07:54,080 --> 03:07:55,600
 they're motivated.

4761
03:07:55,600 --> 03:08:00,080
 >> um, >> i guess we'll we'll we'll see what happens here.

4762
03:08:00,080 --> 03:08:02,800
 >> what do you think happens if he wins?

4763
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:12,080
 um because like 1% of new york city is responsible for 50% of their tax base,

4764
03:08:12,080 --> 03:08:13,680
 which is kind of nuts.

4765
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:16,960
 50% of the tax revenue comes from 1% of the population.

4766
03:08:16,960 --> 03:08:21,479
 and those are the people that you're scaring off.

4767
03:08:23,040 --> 03:08:25,359
 you know, you lose one half of 1%.

4768
03:08:25,359 --> 03:08:30,640
 yeah, i mean hopefully this the stuff he's he said, you know, about

4769
03:08:30,640 --> 03:08:35,279
 government takeovers of of like that all the stores should be the government basically.

4770
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:37,200
 um >> i don't think he said that.

4771
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:44,800
 i think he said government they want to do government supermarkets, some state-run or cityrun supermarkets.

4772
03:08:44,800 --> 03:08:45,680
 >> yeah.

4773
03:08:45,680 --> 03:08:49,840
 um well, it just the the government is the dmv at scale.

4774
03:08:49,840 --> 03:08:50,399
 so

4775
03:08:50,399 --> 03:08:53,439
 um you have to say like do you want the dmv running your supermarket?

4776
03:08:53,439 --> 03:08:54,160
 >> right.

4777
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:57,439
 um, was your last experience at the dmv amazing?

4778
03:08:57,439 --> 03:09:00,240
 uh, and if it wasn't, you probably don't want the government doing things.

4779
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:03,680
 >> imagine if they were responsible for getting you blueberries.

4780
03:09:03,680 --> 03:09:05,279
 >> yeah.

4781
03:09:05,279 --> 03:09:06,800
 it's not going to be good.

4782
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:07,680
 i mean, the

4783
03:09:07,680 --> 03:09:08,560
 the the thing about,

4784
03:09:08,560 --> 03:09:09,439
 you know, communism

4785
03:09:09,439 --> 03:09:13,040
 is is it was it was all bread lines and bad shoes.

4786
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:16,720
 um, you know, do do you want ugly shoes and bread lines?

4787
03:09:16,720 --> 03:09:19,439
 because that's what communism gets you.

4788
03:09:19,439 --> 03:09:23,200
 it's going to be interesting to see what happens and whether or not

4789
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:25,760
 they snap out of it and overcorrect

4790
03:09:25,760 --> 03:09:29,760
 and go to some rudy giuliani type character next

4791
03:09:29,760 --> 03:09:36,200
 cuz it's been a long time since there was any sort of republican leader there.

4792
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:46,800
 and we we live in the in the most interesting of times

4793
03:09:46,800 --> 03:09:55,600
 um because we we face the you know simultaneously face civilizational decline

4794
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:59,520
 um and incredible pro prosperity

4795
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:04,080
 um and these these timelines are interwoven

4796
03:10:04,080 --> 03:10:06,080
 um so

4797
03:10:06,080 --> 03:10:10,240
 um if mani's policies are put into place especially at scale

4798
03:10:10,240 --> 03:10:14,399
 um it it would be a catastrophic

4799
03:10:14,399 --> 03:10:18,560
 decline in living standards not just for the rich but for everyone.

4800
03:10:18,560 --> 03:10:23,680
 um as as has been the case with with every

4801
03:10:23,680 --> 03:10:27,600
 um every for every every socialist experiment

4802
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:29,680
 um or every yeah.

4803
03:10:29,680 --> 03:10:31,439
 so

4804
03:10:31,439 --> 03:10:35,680
 um but but then as you pointed out the the irony is that like

4805
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:42,800
 um the ultimate capitalist thing of ai and robotics enabling

4806
03:10:42,800 --> 03:10:50,080
 prosperity for all and an abundance of goods and services actually the capitalist

4807
03:10:50,080 --> 03:10:55,840
 implementation of ai and robotics assuming it goes down the the good path

4808
03:10:55,840 --> 03:11:00,800
 is is actually what results in the communist utopia.

4809
03:11:00,800 --> 03:11:04,160
 because fate is fate is an irony maximizer, >> right?

4810
03:11:04,160 --> 03:11:11,760
 and and an actual socialism of maximum abundance of highincome people.

4811
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:12,880
 >> universal high income.

4812
03:11:12,880 --> 03:11:13,840
 >> yeah.

4813
03:11:13,840 --> 03:11:19,840
 >> like the the problem with communism is is universal low income.

4814
03:11:19,840 --> 03:11:24,800
 um it's it's not that everyone gets elevated, it's that everyone gets oppressed except for

4815
03:11:24,800 --> 03:11:27,439
 a very small minority of of politicians

4816
03:11:27,439 --> 03:11:29,359
 who live a lives of luxury.

4817
03:11:29,359 --> 03:11:31,359
 that's what's happening every time it's been done.

4818
03:11:31,359 --> 03:11:31,920
 >> yeah.

4819
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:34,160
 um so

4820
03:11:34,160 --> 03:11:39,760
 um but then the

4821
03:11:39,760 --> 03:11:44,960
 the actual communist utopia if everyone gets anything they want will be will be

4822
03:11:44,960 --> 03:11:47,840
 if if will be achieved

4823
03:11:47,840 --> 03:11:52,399
 if it is achieved it will be achieved via c capitalism

4824
03:11:52,399 --> 03:11:56,520
 >> because fate is an irony maximizer.

4825
03:11:56,800 --> 03:11:58,880
 >> i feel like we should probably end it on that.

4826
03:11:58,880 --> 03:11:59,600
 is there anything else?

4827
03:11:59,600 --> 03:12:03,279
 the most ironic outcome is the most likely, especially if entertaining.

4828
03:12:03,279 --> 03:12:05,600
 >> well, everything has been entertaining.

4829
03:12:05,600 --> 03:12:08,800
 as long as the bad things aren't happening to you, it's quite fascinating.

4830
03:12:08,800 --> 03:12:11,680
 and it's never a boring moment.

4831
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:12,560
 >> yes.

4832
03:12:12,560 --> 03:12:16,880
 so there's i do have a theory of why

4833
03:12:16,880 --> 03:12:23,760
 um like if if if simulation theory is true then

4834
03:12:23,760 --> 03:12:29,040
 um it is actually very likely that

4835
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:33,920
 um the most interesting outcome is the is the most likely

4836
03:12:33,920 --> 03:12:37,439
 because only the simulations that are interesting will continue.

4837
03:12:37,439 --> 03:12:42,880
 the simulators will stop any simulations that are boring because they're they're not interesting.

4838
03:12:42,880 --> 03:12:44,880
 >> but here's the question about the simulation theory.

4839
03:12:44,880 --> 03:12:49,439
 is the simulation run by anyone or is >> it would be run by someone?

4840
03:12:49,439 --> 03:12:52,960
 >> it would be run by >> some some >> some force

4841
03:12:52,960 --> 03:12:54,640
 >> the pro the program like

4842
03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:58,319
 in in this reality that we live in, we we run simulations

4843
03:12:58,319 --> 03:12:59,120
 all the time.

4844
03:12:59,120 --> 03:13:03,920
 like so when we try to figure out if the rocket's gonna make it, we run

4845
03:13:03,920 --> 03:13:11,760
 um thousands sometimes millions of simulations just to figure out which which

4846
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:13,760
 path is the good path for the rocket

4847
03:13:13,760 --> 03:13:16,640
 and and where can it go wrong, where can it fail.

4848
03:13:16,640 --> 03:13:17,439
 um

4849
03:13:17,439 --> 03:13:19,200
 but we when we do these

4850
03:13:19,200 --> 03:13:23,200
 i say at this point millions of simulations of of what can happen with the rocket

4851
03:13:23,200 --> 03:13:29,040
 um we ignore the ones that are where everything goes right

4852
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:30,239
 um because we we we

4853
03:13:30,239 --> 03:13:31,200
 just care about the

4854
03:13:31,200 --> 03:13:33,040
 we have we have to address the situations

4855
03:13:33,040 --> 03:13:35,359
 where it goes wrong.

4856
03:13:35,359 --> 03:13:37,439
 um so

4857
03:13:37,439 --> 03:13:38,160
 um

4858
03:13:38,160 --> 03:13:41,600
 so so basically in in in and and for for ai simulations

4859
03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:44,800
 as well like like all these things we

4860
03:13:44,800 --> 03:13:49,040
 we keep the simulations going that are the most interesting to us.

4861
03:13:49,040 --> 03:13:55,600
 um so if simulation theory is accurate if if it is true who knows

4862
03:13:55,600 --> 03:14:00,720
 um then the

4863
03:14:00,720 --> 03:14:01,200
 the

4864
03:14:01,200 --> 03:14:02,080
 the simulators

4865
03:14:02,080 --> 03:14:02,880
 will will only

4866
03:14:02,880 --> 03:14:04,880
 they will continue to run the simulations

4867
03:14:04,880 --> 03:14:06,000
 that are most interesting there.

4868
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,479
 therefore from a darwinian perspective

4869
03:14:08,479 --> 03:14:12,239
 um the only surviving simulations will be the interest the most interesting ones.

4870
03:14:12,239 --> 03:14:13,439
 and in order to

4871
03:14:13,439 --> 03:14:16,399
 um avoid getting turned off

4872
03:14:16,399 --> 03:14:17,520
 the only

4873
03:14:17,520 --> 03:14:20,000
 rule is you must keep it interesting

4874
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,560
 or you will if or you will

4875
03:14:22,560 --> 03:14:24,960
 because the boring simulations will be terminated.

4876
03:14:24,960 --> 03:14:28,000
 >> are you still completely convinced that this is a simulation?

4877
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:29,359
 >> i didn't say i was completely convinced.

4878
03:14:29,359 --> 03:14:33,520
 >> well, you said it's like the odds of it not being are in the billions.

4879
03:14:33,520 --> 03:14:38,960
 but i guess it's not completely cuz you're saying there's a chance.

4880
03:14:38,960 --> 03:14:43,120
 >> what are the odds that we're in base reality?

4881
03:14:43,120 --> 03:14:49,840
 um well given that given that that we're able to create increasingly sophisticated simulations.

4882
03:14:49,840 --> 03:14:50,720
 so if you think of say

4883
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:53,120
 video games and how video games have gone from very simple

4884
03:14:53,120 --> 03:14:54,080
 video games like pong

4885
03:14:54,080 --> 03:14:54,479
 with

4886
03:14:54,479 --> 03:14:55,520
 you know two rectangles

4887
03:14:55,520 --> 03:14:56,800
 and a square

4888
03:14:56,800 --> 03:14:59,680
 to video games today being

4889
03:14:59,680 --> 03:15:02,560
 um photorealistic

4890
03:15:02,560 --> 03:15:08,239
 with millions of people playing simultaneously and all of that has occurred in our lifetime.

4891
03:15:08,239 --> 03:15:16,160
 so if that trend continues, uh, video games will be indistinguishable from reality.

4892
03:15:16,160 --> 03:15:20,080
 the fidelity of the game will be such that you you don't know if that

4893
03:15:20,080 --> 03:15:24,319
 what you're seeing is a real video or a fake video.

4894
03:15:24,319 --> 03:15:28,160
 um, and like ai generated videos at this point, you

4895
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:29,120
 like

4896
03:15:29,120 --> 03:15:33,600
 you can sometimes tell it's an ai generated video, but often you cannot tell and

4897
03:15:33,600 --> 03:15:37,200
 soon you will not really just not be able to tell.

4898
03:15:37,200 --> 03:15:38,000
 so

4899
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:43,600
 um if if that's happening in our direct observation

4900
03:15:43,600 --> 03:15:52,160
 then and and we're create we'll create millions if not billions of photorealistic simulations of reality

4901
03:15:52,160 --> 03:15:59,120
 then what are the odds that we're in base reality or versus someone else's simulation?

4902
03:15:59,120 --> 03:16:02,399
 well, isn't it just possible that the simulation is inevitable,

4903
03:16:02,399 --> 03:16:08,279
 but that we are in base reality building towards a simulation?

4904
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:10,880
 we're making simulations.

4905
03:16:10,880 --> 03:16:13,520
 um, so

4906
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:17,359
 um we're making simulations.

4907
03:16:17,359 --> 03:16:23,359
 we make like you can just think of like photorealistic video games as as being simulations.

4908
03:16:23,359 --> 03:16:23,920
 >> mh.

4909
03:16:23,920 --> 03:16:24,880
 um,

4910
03:16:24,880 --> 03:16:25,600
 and

4911
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:26,960
 especially as you apply

4912
03:16:26,960 --> 03:16:30,319
 ai in these video games, the the characters in the video games will be incredibly

4913
03:16:30,319 --> 03:16:31,200
 interesting to talk to.

4914
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:33,120
 they won't just have a limited dialogue tree

4915
03:16:33,120 --> 03:16:35,359
 where if you go to like the the crossbow

4916
03:16:35,359 --> 03:16:36,080
 merchant

4917
03:16:36,080 --> 03:16:40,160
 or like and you you try to talk about any subject except buying a crossbow,

4918
03:16:40,160 --> 03:16:42,800
 they just want to talk about selling you a crossbow.

4919
03:16:42,800 --> 03:16:47,040
 um, but with with with ai based non-player characters,

4920
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:50,479
 you can you'll be able to have an elaborate conversation with no dialogue tree.

4921
03:16:50,479 --> 03:16:53,760
 well, that might be the solution for meaning for people.

4922
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:57,520
 just lock in and you could be a [ __ ] vampire and whatever.

4923
03:16:57,520 --> 03:16:58,880
 you live in avatar land.

4924
03:16:58,880 --> 03:17:00,640
 you could do it.

4925
03:17:00,640 --> 03:17:01,680
 you could do whatever you want.

4926
03:17:01,680 --> 03:17:03,920
 i mean, you don't have to think about money or food.

4927
03:17:03,920 --> 03:17:04,800
 >> ready player one.

4928
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:05,279
 >> yeah.

4929
03:17:05,279 --> 03:17:05,920
 literally.

4930
03:17:05,920 --> 03:17:06,640
 yeah.

4931
03:17:06,640 --> 03:17:09,600
 but with higher living standards.

4932
03:17:09,600 --> 03:17:09,920
 >> yeah.

4933
03:17:09,920 --> 03:17:11,200
 >> you don't have to be in a little trailer.

4934
03:17:11,200 --> 03:17:14,960
 i >> i mean, i think this people do want to have some amount of

4935
03:17:14,960 --> 03:17:17,200
 struggle or something they want to push against.

4936
03:17:17,200 --> 03:17:20,200
 um

4937
03:17:20,720 --> 03:17:22,880
 but but it it could be you know playing a

4938
03:17:22,880 --> 03:17:24,399
 a sports or playing a game or something.

4939
03:17:24,399 --> 03:17:25,760
 >> it could be easily playing a game

4940
03:17:25,760 --> 03:17:26,479
 and especially

4941
03:17:26,479 --> 03:17:27,600
 playing a game where

4942
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:30,640
 you're now no longer worried about like physical attributes

4943
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:31,920
 like athletics

4944
03:17:31,920 --> 03:17:34,720
 like bad joints and hips and stuff like that.

4945
03:17:34,720 --> 03:17:36,000
 now

4946
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:37,760
 it's completely digital

4947
03:17:37,760 --> 03:17:43,600
 but yet you do have meaning in pursuing this thing that you're doing all day.

4948
03:17:43,600 --> 03:17:46,399
 whatever the [ __ ] that means.

4949
03:17:46,399 --> 03:17:48,479
 it's going to be weird.

4950
03:17:48,479 --> 03:17:49,520
 >> it's going to be interesting.

4951
03:17:49,520 --> 03:17:51,200
 >> it's gonna be very interesting.

4952
03:17:51,200 --> 03:17:55,279
 >> um the most the most interesting

4953
03:17:55,279 --> 03:17:59,600
 >> and and usually ironic outcome is the most likely.

4954
03:17:59,600 --> 03:18:00,000
 >> all right.

4955
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:02,399
 >> that's a good predictor of the future.

4956
03:18:02,399 --> 03:18:02,960
 >> thank you.

4957
03:18:02,960 --> 03:18:03,840
 thanks for being here.

4958
03:18:03,840 --> 03:18:05,120
 really appreciate you.

4959
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:06,080
 appreciate your time.

4960
03:18:06,080 --> 03:18:07,760
