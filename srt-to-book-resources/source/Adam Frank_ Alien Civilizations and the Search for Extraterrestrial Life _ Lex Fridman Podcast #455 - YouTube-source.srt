1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,009
- If we don't ask, how long do they last,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,290
but instead ask, what's the probability

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,960
that there have been any civilizations at all,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,189
no matter how long they lasted,

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,140
I'm not asking whether they exist now or not,

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,040
I'm just asking in general about probabilities

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,460
to make a technological civilization anywhere

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,530
and at any time in the history of the universe,

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,510
and that, we were able to constrain.

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,450
And so what we found was, basically,

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,450
that there have been 10 billion trillion

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,210
habitable zone planets in the universe.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,043
And what that means

14
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:38,340
is those are 10 billion trillion experiments

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,393
that have been run.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,967
And the only way, the only time that this is,

17
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:46,530
you know, this whole process from, you know,

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,290
abiogenesis to a civilization has occurred

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,390
is if every one of those experiments failed, right?

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,910
So therefore, you could put a probability,

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,980
we called it the pessimism line, right?

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,580
We don't really know what nature sets for the probability

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,500
of making intelligent civilizations, right?

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,240
But we could set a limit using this.

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,680
We could say, look,

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,770
if the probability per habitable zone planet

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,110
is less than 10 to the -22,

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,690
1 in 10 billion trillion, then, yeah, we're alone.

29
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,520
If it's anywhere larger than that,

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,840
then there we're not the first,

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,920
it's happened somewhere else.

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,100
And to me, that was mind-blowing.

33
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,970
It doesn't tell me there's anybody nearby.

34
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,410
The galaxy could be sterile.

35
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,693
It just told me that, like, you know,

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,210
unless nature's really has some bias against civilizations,

37
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,560
we're not the first time this has happened.

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,060
This has happened elsewhere

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,803
over the course of cosmic history.

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,780
- The following is a conversation with Adam Frank,

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,210
an astrophysicist interested

42
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,400
in the evolution of star systems

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,930
and the search for alien civilizations in our universe.

44
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,030
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

45
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,863
To support it,

47
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,813
And now, dear friends, here's Adam Frank.

48
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,470
You wrote a book about aliens.

49
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,370
So the big question,

50
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,620
how many alien civilizations are out there?

51
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,060
- Yeah, that's the question, right?

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,050
The amazing thing is that after 2 1/2 millennia

53
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,850
of, you know, people yelling at each other

54
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,620
or setting each other on fire, occasionally,

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,640
over the answer,

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,390
we now actually have the capacity to answer that question.

57
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,000
So in the next 10, 20, 30 years,

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,680
we're gonna have data relevant

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,450
to the answer to that question.

60
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,720
We're gonna have hard data, finally, that will,

61
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,553
one way or the other,

62
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:30,780
you know, even if we don't find anything immediately,

63
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,750
we will have gone through a number of planets,

64
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,460
we'll be able to start putting limits on how common life is.

65
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,080
The one answer I can tell you,

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,300
which was an important part of the problem, is,

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,340
how many planets are there, right?

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,530
And just like people have been arguing

69
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,270
about the existence of life elsewhere for 2,500 years,

70
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,070
people have been arguing about planets

71
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,780
for the exact same amount of time, right?

72
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,990
You can see Aristotle yelling at Democrates about this.

73
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,240
You know, you can see they had very different opinions

74
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,400
about how common planets were gonna be

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
and how unique Earth was.

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,540
And that question got answered, right,

77
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,700
which is pretty remarkable that, in a lifetime,

78
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,340
you can have a 2,500-year old question.

79
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,170
The answer is they're everywhere.

80
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,520
There are planets everywhere.

81
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,400
And it was possible that planets were really rare.

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,560
We didn't really understand how planets formed.

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,460
And so if you go back to, say, the turn of the 20th century,

84
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,810
there was a theory

85
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,630
that said planets formed when two stars passed

86
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,980
by each other closely,

87
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,010
And then material was gravitationally squeezed out,

88
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,730
in which case, those kinds of collisions are so rare

89
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,690
that you would expect one

90
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,280
in a trillion stars to have planets.

91
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,060
Instead, every star in the night sky has planets.

92
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,860
- So one of the things you've done

93
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,160
is simulated the formation of stars.

94
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,270
How difficult do you think it is

95
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,970
to simulate the formation of planets,

96
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,440
like simulate our solar system,

97
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,020
the entire evolution of the solar system?

98
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,310
This is kind of a numerical simulation sneaking up

99
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,680
to the question of, how many planets are there?

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,570
- That, actually, we're able to do now.

101
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,660
You can run simulations of the formation

102
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,580
of planetary system.

103
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,020
So if you run the simulation,

104
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,420
really, where you wanna start is a cloud of gas,

105
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,187
these giant interstellar clouds of gas that may have,

106
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:18,257
you know, a million times the mass of the sun in them.

107
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,570
And so you run a simulation of that. It's turbulent.

108
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,700
The gas is roiling and tumbling.

109
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,050
And every now and then you get a place

110
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,160
where the gas is dense enough that gravity gets hold of it,

111
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,300
and it can pull it downward.

112
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,730
So you'll start to form a protostar.

113
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,197
And a protostar is basically the young star of,

114
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:37,050
you know, this ball of gas

115
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,870
where nuclear reactions are getting started,

116
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,610
but it's also a disk.

117
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,130
So you as material falls inward,

118
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,860
'cause everything's rotating,, as it falls inward,

119
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,110
it'll spin up, and then it'll form a disk.

120
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,840
Material will collect in what's called an accretion disk

121
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,820
or a proto-planetary disk.

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,100
And you can simulate all of that.

123
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,657
Once you get into the disk itself

124
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:58,800
and you wanna do planets,

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,540
things get a little bit more complicated

126
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,130
'cause the physics gets more complicated.

127
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,960
Now you gotta start worrying about dust,

128
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,793
'cause actually, dust,

129
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:07,500
which dust is the wrong word, it's smoke really.

130
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,620
These are the tiniest bits of solids.

131
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,240
They will coagulate in the disk to form pebbles, right?

132
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,640
And then the pebbles will collide to form rocks,

133
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,850
and then the rocks will form boulders, et cetera, et cetera.

134
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,310
That process is super complicated,

135
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,560
but we've been able to simulate enough of it

136
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,220
to begin to get a handle on how planets form,

137
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,470
how you accrete enough material

138
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,990
to get the first protoplanets

139
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,210
or planetary embryos, as we call them.

140
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,830
And the next step

141
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,080
is those things start slamming into each other

142
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,930
to form, you know, planetary-sized bodies.

143
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,510
And then the planetary body slam into each other.

144
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,810
The moon came about because there was a Mars-sized body

145
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,070
that slammed into the Earth

146
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,320
and basically blew off all the material

147
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,420
that then eventually formed the moon.

148
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,200
- And all of them have different chemical compositions,

149
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,420
different temperatures?

150
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,830
- Yeah, so the temperature of the material in the disk

151
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,443
depends on how far away you are from the star.

152
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:08,550
- Got it. - So it decreases, right?

153
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,810
And so there's a really interesting point.

154
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,730
So like, you know, close to the star,

155
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,380
temperatures are really high,

156
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,530
and the only thing that can condense,

157
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,320
that can kind of freeze out is gonna be stuff like metals.

158
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,310
So that's why you find Mercury

159
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,130
is this giant ball of iron, basically.

160
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,540
And then as you go further out,

161
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,280
stuff, you know, the gas gets cooler

162
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,260
and now you can start getting things

163
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,850
like water to freeze, right?

164
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,950
So there's something we call the snow line,

165
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,660
which is somewhere in our solar system

166
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,720
out around between Mars and Jupiter.

167
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,910
And that's the reason why the giant planets

168
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,110
in our solar system,

169
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,690
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune,

170
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,300
all have huge amounts of ice in them,

171
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,250
or water and ice.

172
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,470
Actually, Jupiter and Saturn don't have so much,

173
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,310
but the moons do.

174
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,930
The moons have so much water in them

175
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,820
that there's oceans, right?

176
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,440
That we've got a number of those moons

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,350
have got more water on them than there's water on Earth.

178
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,950
- Do you think it's possible to do that kind of simulation

179
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,370
to have a stronger and stronger estimate

180
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,820
of how likely an Earth-like planet is?

181
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,600
Can we get the physics simulation done well enough

182
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,100
to where we can start estimating,

183
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,710
like, what are the possible Earth-like things

184
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,820
that could be generated?

185
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,930
- Yeah, I think we can,

186
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,780
I think we're learning how to do that now.

187
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,940
So, you know, one part is, like, trying to just figure out

188
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,000
how planets form themselves and doing the simulations.

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,290
Like, that cascade from dust grains

190
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,180
up to planetary embryos,

191
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,400
that's hard to simulate because it's both,

192
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,540
you gotta do both the gas,

193
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,530
and you gotta do the dust

194
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,200
and the dust colliding and all that physics.

195
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,170
Once you get up to a planet-sized body,

196
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,910
then, you know, you kind of have to switch over

197
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,890
to almost like a different kind of simulation.

198
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,420
Often what you're doing is you're doing,

199
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,130
you know, sort of, you're assuming the planet

200
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,900
is this sort of spherical ball,

201
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,860
and then you're doing what, you know,

202
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,630
like a 1D, a radial calculation.

203
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,280
And you're just asking like, all right,

204
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,570
how is this thing going to,

205
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,070
what is the structure of it gonna be?

206
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,290
Like, am I gonna have a solid iron core,

207
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,000
or am I gonna get a solid iron core

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,250
with that liquid iron core out around it,

209
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,630
like we have on Earth?

210
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,610
And then you get, you know, a silicate,

211
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,590
kind of, a rocky mantle and then crust,

212
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,150
all of those details.

213
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,010
Those are kind of beyond being able

214
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,690
to do full 3D simulations from ab initio, from scratch.

215
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,690
We're not there yet.

216
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,960
- How important are those details,

217
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,000
like, the crust and the atmosphere, do you think?

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,060
- Hugely important, so I'm part of a collaboration

219
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,200
at the University of Rochester

220
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,020
where we're using the giant laser.

221
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,429
It's literally, this is called the Laboratory

222
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,809
for Laser Energetics.

223
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,350
We got a huge grant from the NSF to use that laser

224
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,830
to, like, slam tiny pieces of silica

225
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,049
to understand what conditions are like

226
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,280
at, you know, the center of the Earth

227
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,820
or, even more importantly, the center of super-Earths.

228
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,750
This is what's wild.

229
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,720
The most common kind of planet in the universe,

230
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,610
we don't have in our solar system,

231
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,840
which is amazing, right?

232
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,840
So we've been able to study enough

233
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,750
or observe enough planets now to get a census.

234
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,820
You know, we kind of have an idea

235
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,370
of who's average, who's weird.

236
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,990
And our solar system's weird

237
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,450
because the average planet has a mass

238
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,690
between somewhere between a few times the mass of the Earth

239
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,200
to maybe, you know, 10 times the mass of the Earth.

240
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,670
And that's exactly where there are no planets

241
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,780
in our solar system.

242
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,160
So the smaller ones of those we call super-Earths,

243
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,830
the larger ones we call sub-Neptunes.

244
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,880
And they're anybody's guess.

245
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,160
Like, we don't really know what happens to material

246
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,930
when you're squeezed to those pressures,

247
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,170
which is like millions, tens of millions of times

248
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,600
the pressure on the surface of the Earth.

249
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,330
So those details really will matter

250
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,410
of what's going on in there

251
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,330
because that will determine whether or not you have,

252
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,400
say, for example, plate tectonics.

253
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,770
We think plate tectonics may have been really important

254
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,730
for life on Earth,

255
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,010
for the evolution of complex life on Earth.

256
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,770
So it turns out, and this is sort of the next generation

257
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,650
where we're going with the understanding the evolution

258
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,940
of planets in life.

259
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,520
It turns out that you actually have to think hard

260
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,520
about the planetary context for life.

261
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,980
You can't just be like, oh, there's a warm pond, you know,

262
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,300
and then some interesting, you know,

263
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,710
chemistry happens in the warm pond.

264
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,560
You actually have to think about the planet as a whole

265
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,150
and what it's gone through

266
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,370
in order to really understand whether a planet

267
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,440
is a good place for life or not.

268
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
- Why do you think plate tectonics might be useful

269
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,000
for the formation of complex life?

270
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,560
- There's a bunch of different things.

271
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,070
One is that, you know, the Earth went through a couple

272
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,170
of phases of being a snowball planet.

273
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,230
Like, you know, we went into a period of glaciation

274
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,630
where the pretty much the entire planet was under ice.

275
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,180
The oceans were froZen.

276
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,226
You know, early on in Earth history,

277
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:39,870
there was barely any land.

278
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,987
We were actually a water world,

279
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:45,540
you know, with just a couple of Australia-sized cratons,

280
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,283
they called them, protocontinents.

281
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,970
We went through these snowball Earth phases.

282
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,080
And if it wasn't for the fact

283
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,960
that we had kind of an active plate tectonics,

284
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,360
which had a lot of volcanism on it,

285
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,070
we could have been locked in that forever.

286
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,840
Like, once you get into a snowball state,

287
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,647
a planet can be trapped there forever, which is,

288
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:04,950
you know, maybe you already had life form,

289
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,840
but then because it's so cold,

290
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,260
you may never get anything more than just microbes, right?

291
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,790
So what plate tectonics does is,

292
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,150
because it fosters more volcanism,

293
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,070
is that you're gonna get carbon dioxide pumped

294
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,930
into the atmosphere, which warms the planet up

295
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,773
and gets you out of the snowball Earth phase.

296
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,460
But even more, there's even more really important things.

297
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,740
I just finished a paper where we were looking

298
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,360
at something called the hard-steps model,

299
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,550
which is this model that's been out there

300
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,170
for a long time that purports

301
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,740
to say intelligent life in the universe will be really rare.

302
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,260
And it made all these assumptions about the Earth's history,

303
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,093
particularly that the history of life

304
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:42,183
and the history of the planet

305
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:44,160
have nothing to do with each other.

306
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,070
And it turns out, as I was doing the reading for this,

307
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,500
that Earth, probably early on,

308
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,930
had a more mild form of plate tectonics.

309
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,690
And then somewhere about a billion years ago, it ramped up,

310
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,390
and that ramping up changed everything on the planet,

311
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,860
'cause here's a funny thing:

312
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,630
The Earth used to be flat.

313
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,940
What I mean by that, right,

314
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,050
so all the flat-Earthers out there can get excited

315
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:04,883
for one sec.

316
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:05,775
- Clip it.

317
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:06,792
(Adam laughing)

318
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,757
Still is. - What I meant by that,

319
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:09,300
what I mean by that

320
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,150
is that there really weren't many mountain ranges, right?

321
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,320
The beginning of,

322
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,690
I think the term is orogenesis, mountain-building,

323
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,260
the true, Himalayan-style, giant mountains didn't happen

324
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,290
until this more robust form of plate tectonics

325
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,140
where the plates are really being driven around the planet.

326
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,450
And that is when you get the crusts hitting each other,

327
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,830
and they start pushing,

328
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,900
you know, into these Himalayan-style mountains.

329
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,430
The weathering of that,

330
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,970
the erosion of that puts huge amounts of nutrients,

331
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,180
you know, things that microbes wanna use, into the oceans,

332
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,700
and then what we call the net primary productivity,

333
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,000
the, you know, the bottom of the food chain,

334
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,130
how much sugars they're producing,

335
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,200
how much photosynthesis they're doing,

336
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,020
shot up by a factor of almost 1,000, right?

337
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,720
So the fact that you had plate tectonics

338
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,930
supercharged evolution in some sense, you know.

339
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,850
Like, we're not exactly sure how it happened,

340
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,920
but it's clear that the amount of life,

341
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,340
the amount of living activity that was happening

342
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,840
really got a boost from the fact

343
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,240
that suddenly there this new vigorous form

344
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,620
of plate tectonics.

345
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,760
- So it's nice to have turmoil in terms of temperature,

346
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,000
in terms of surface geometries,

347
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,400
in terms of the chemistry of the planet, turmoil.

348
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,750
- Yeah, that's actually really true

349
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,030
because what happens is, if you look at the history of life,

350
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,271
you know, it's a excellent point you're bringing up,

351
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:27,450
if you look at the history of life on Earth,

352
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,480
we get, you know, abiogenesis somewhere

353
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,240
around at least 3.8 billion years ago,

354
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,350
and that's the first microbes.

355
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,630
They kind of take over enough that they really do,

356
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,463
you get a biosphere.

357
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:40,320
You get a biosphere that is actively changing the planet,

358
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,670
but then you go through this period

359
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,320
they call the boring billion,

360
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,370
where, like, it's a billion years,

361
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,080
and it's just microbes, nothing's happening.

362
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,913
It's just microbes.

363
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,630
I mean, microbes are doing amazing things.

364
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,940
They're inventing fermentation.

365
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,643
Thank you very much. We appreciate that.

366
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,640
But it's not until, sort of,

367
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,250
you get probably these continents slamming into each other,

368
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,140
you really get the beginning of continents forming

369
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,300
and driving changes

370
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,837
that evolution has to respond to,

371
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:08,070
that on a planetary scale, this turmoil,

372
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,740
this chaos is creating new niches

373
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,510
as well as closing other ones.

374
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,270
And biology, evolution has to respond to that.

375
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,470
And somewhere around there

376
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,090
is when you get the Cambrian explosion,

377
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,970
is when suddenly every body plan,

378
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,880
you know, evolution goes on an orgy, essentially.

379
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,360
So yeah, it does look like that chaos

380
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,990
or that turmoil was actually very helpful to evolution.

381
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,770
- I wonder if there's some extremely elevated levels

382
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,810
of chaos, almost like catastrophes,

383
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,180
behind every leap of evolution.

384
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,880
Like, you're not gonna have leaps.

385
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,950
Like, in human societies,

386
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,980
we have, like, an Einstein that comes up with a good idea.

387
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,830
But it feels like on an evolutionary timescale,

388
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,180
you need some real big drama going on

389
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,100
for the evolutionary system

390
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,200
to have to come up to a solution to that drama,

391
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,110
like an extra complex solution to that drama.

392
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,700
- Well, I'm not sure if that's true.

393
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,870
I don't know if it needs to be, like,

394
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,880
an almost-extinction event, right?

395
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,350
Because it's certainly true that we have gone

396
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,660
through almost-extinction events, right?

397
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,200
We've had, you know, five mass extinctions,

398
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,970
but you don't necessarily see that, like,

399
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,520
there was this giant evolutionary leap happening

400
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,353
right after those.

401
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:22,590
So, you know, with the comet impact, the K-T boundary,

402
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,170
certainly, you know, lots of niches opened up,

403
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,160
and that's why we're here, right?

404
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,420
Because, you know, our ancestors

405
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,490
were just little basically rodents,

406
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,940
rats living under the footsteps of the dinosaurs.

407
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,800
And it was that comet impact that opened the route for us.

408
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,890
I mean, that still took another, you know, 65 million years.

409
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,900
It wasn't like this thing immediately happened.

410
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,820
But what we found with this hard-steps paper,

411
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,070
'cause the whole idea of the hard-steps paper was,

412
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,010
it was one of these anthropic reasoning kinds of things,

413
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,930
where Brandon Carter said, oh, look,

414
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,743
the intelligence doesn't show up on Earth until about,

415
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,440
you know, almost close to when the end

416
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,270
of the sun's lifetime.

417
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,550
And so he's like, well, there should be no reason

418
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,100
why the sun's lifetime

419
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,840
and the time for evolution

420
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,960
to produce intelligence should be the same.

421
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,030
And so therefore, and he goes through all this reasoning,

422
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,820
anthropic reasoning, and he ends up with the idea that like,

423
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,650
oh, it must be that the odds

424
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,370
of getting intelligence are super low,

425
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,510
and so that's the hard steps, right?

426
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,220
So there was a series of steps in evolution

427
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,960
that were, you know, very, very hard.

428
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,793
And because of that,

429
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:28,410
you can calculate some probability distributions,

430
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,810
and everybody loves a good probability distribution,

431
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,430
and they went a long way with this.

432
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,890
But it turns out that the whole thing is flawed

433
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,560
because, you know, when you look at it,

434
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,650
of course, the timescale for the sun's evolution

435
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,470
and the timescale for evolution on life are coupled

436
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,340
because life and the timescale for evolution of the Earth

437
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,590
is coupled, is about the same timescale

438
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,610
as the evolution as the sun.

439
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,450
It's billions of years.

440
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,760
The Earth evolves over billions of years.

441
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,010
And life and the Earth co-evolve.

442
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,360
That's what Brandon Carter didn't see,

443
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,460
is that, actually, the fate of the Earth

444
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,000
and the fate of life are inextricably combined.

445
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,270
And this is really important for astrobiology too.

446
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,770
Life doesn't happen on a planet. It happens to a planet.

447
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,300
So this is something that David Grinspoon

448
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,530
and Sara Walker both say,

449
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,540
and, you know, I agree with this.

450
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,030
It's a really nice way of putting it.

451
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,480
So, you know, plate tectonics,

452
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,329
the evolution of oxygen, of an oxygen atmosphere,

453
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,133
which only happened because of life,

454
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,730
these things, you know, these are things

455
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,440
that are happening where life

456
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,470
and the planet are sort of sloshing back and forth.

457
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,660
And so rather than, to your point about,

458
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,340
do you need giant catastrophes?

459
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,870
Maybe not giant catastrophes.

460
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,830
But what happens is,

461
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,410
as the Earth and life are evolving together,

462
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,200
windows are opening up, evolutionary windows.

463
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,530
Like, for example, life put oxygen into the atmosphere.

464
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,350
When life invented this new form of photosynthesis

465
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,897
about 2 1/2 billion years ago, that broke water apart to,

466
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:59,943
you know, work to do, its chemical shenanigans.

467
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,420
It broke water apart and pushed oxygen into the atmosphere.

468
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,190
That's why there's oxygen in the atmosphere.

469
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,020
It's only 'cause of life.

470
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,420
That opened up huge possibilities,

471
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,090
new spaces for evolution to happen.

472
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,820
But it also changed the chemistry of the planet forever.

473
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,930
So introduction of oxygen photosynthesis

474
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,340
changed the planet forever,

475
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,490
and it opened up a bunch of windows for evolution

476
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,660
that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

477
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,160
Like, for example, you and I, we need that amount of oxygen.

478
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,280
Big-brained creatures need an oxygen-rich atmosphere

479
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,610
'cause oxygen is so potent for metabolism.

480
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,510
So you couldn't get intelligent creatures 100 million years

481
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,370
after the planet formed.

482
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,740
- So really, on a scale of a planet,

483
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,390
when there's billions, trillions of organisms on a planet,

484
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,933
they can actually have planetary-scale impact.

485
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,450
- Yeah. - So the chemical shenanigans

486
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,720
of an individual organism, once scaled out to trillions,

487
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,010
can actually change a planet.

488
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,710
- Yeah, and we know this for a fact now.

489
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,270
So there was this thing, Gaia theory,

490
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,750
that, you know, with James Lovelock introduced in the '70s,

491
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,760
and then Lynn Margulis, the biologist,

492
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,690
Lin Margulis together.

493
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,180
So this Gaia theory was the idea

494
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,280
that planets pretty much take,

495
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,140
or sorry, life takes over a planet,

496
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,000
life hijacks a planet

497
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,950
in a way that that sum total of life creates these feedbacks

498
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,930
between the planet and the life,

499
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,660
such that it keeps the planet habitable.

500
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,280
It's kind of a homeostasis, right?

501
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,840
I can go out, like, right now, outside,

502
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,870
it's 100 degrees, right?

503
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,820
And I go outside,

504
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,740
but my internal temperature's gonna be the same.

505
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,880
And I can go back to, you know,

506
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,470
Rochester, New York, in the winter,

507
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,510
and it's gonna be, you know, zero degrees,

508
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,340
but my internal temperature's gonna be the same.

509
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,690
That's homeostasis.

510
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,440
The idea of Gaia theory was that the biosphere

511
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,570
exerts this pressure on the planet

512
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,190
or these feedbacks on the planet,

513
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,470
that even as other things are changing,

514
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,580
the planet will always stay

515
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,010
in the right kinds of conditions for life.

516
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,380
Now, when this theory came out, it was very controversial.

517
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,400
People were like, oh my God,

518
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,140
you know, what, are you smoking weed?

519
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,780
You know, and like there were all these Gaian festivals

520
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,850
with Gaian dances.

521
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,440
And so, you know, it became very popular

522
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,210
in the New Age community.

523
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,250
But Lovelock, actually, they were able to show that, no,

524
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,083
this has nothing to do

525
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,550
with, like, the planet being conscious or anything.

526
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,270
It was about these feedbacks that biology,

527
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,313
the biosphere can exert these feedbacks.

528
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,080
We're still unclear whether there are true Gaian feedbacks,

529
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,160
in the sense that the planet

530
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,650
can really exert complete control.

531
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,480
But it is absolutely true

532
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,040
that the biosphere is a major player in Earth's history.

533
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,820
- So the biosphere fights for homeostasis on Earth.

534
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,386
- So, okay, what I would say right now is,

535
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:42,180
I don't know if I can say that scientifically.

536
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,570
I can certainly say that the biosphere does a huge amount

537
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,870
of the regulation of the planetary state

538
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,370
and, over billions of years,

539
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,730
has strongly modified the evolution of the planet.

540
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,643
So whether or not,

541
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:57,540
a true Gaian feedback would be exactly what you said, right?

542
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,700
The biosphere is this somehow,

543
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,200
and Sara Walker and David Grinspoon

544
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,370
and I actually did a paper on this

545
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,980
about the idea of planetary intelligence

546
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,310
or cognition across a planetary scale.

547
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,660
And I think that actually is possible.

548
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,650
It's not conscious,

549
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,410
but there is a kind of cognitive activity going on.

550
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,950
The biosphere, in some sense, knows what is happening

551
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,393
because of these feedbacks.

552
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,423
So it's still unclear

553
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,080
whether we have these full Gaian feedbacks,

554
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,690
but we certainly have semi-Gaian feedbacks.

555
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,690
If there's a perturbation on the planetary scale,

556
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,670
temperature, you know, insulation,

557
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,170
how much sunlight's coming in,

558
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,510
the biosphere will start to have feedbacks

559
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,640
that will damp that perturbation.

560
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,860
Temperature goes up, the biosphere starts doing something,

561
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,210
temperature comes down.

562
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,130
- Now, I wonder if the technosphere

563
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,050
also has a Gaian feedback

564
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,200
or elements of a Gaian feedback such that the technosphere

565
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,710
will also fight to some degree for homeostasis.

566
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,970
Open question, I guess.

567
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,890
- Well, I'm glad you asked that question

568
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,670
because that paper that David and Sara and I wrote,

569
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,990
what we were arguing was,

570
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,930
is that, over the history of a planet, right,

571
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,870
when life first forms, you know, 3.8 billion years ago,

572
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,610
it's kind of thin on the ground, right?

573
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,800
You've got the first species, you know,

574
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,730
these are all microbes, and they have not yet been,

575
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,140
they're not going to enough of them

576
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,900
to exert any kind of these Gaian feedback.

577
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,960
So we call that an immature biosphere.

578
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,540
But then as time goes on, as life becomes more robust,

579
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,180
and it begins to exert these feedbacks,

580
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,020
keeping the planet

581
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,700
in the place where it needs to be for life,

582
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,400
we call that a mature biosphere, right?

583
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,233
And the important thing,

584
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,260
and I'm sure later on,

585
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,360
we're gonna talk about definitions of life and such.

586
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,270
There's this great term called autopoiesis

587
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,790
that Francisco Varela, the neurobiologist,

588
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,440
Francisco Varela came up with.

589
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,420
And he said, you know, one of the defining things about life

590
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,160
is this property of autopoiesis,

591
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,430
which means self-creating and self-maintaining.

592
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,370
Life does not create the conditions

593
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,350
which will destroy itself, right?

594
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,690
It's always trying to keep itself in a place

595
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,580
where it can stay alive.

596
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,460
So the biosphere from this Gaian perspective

597
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,730
has been autopoietic for, you know, billions of years.

598
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,860
Now, we just invented this technosphere

599
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,830
in the last, you know, couple of hundred years.

600
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,240
And what we were arguing in that paper

601
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,730
is that it's an immature technosphere, right?

602
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,050
Because right now, with climate change

603
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,400
and all the other things we're doing,

604
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,380
we know the technosphere right now

605
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,180
is sort of destroying the conditions

606
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,420
under which it needs to maintain itself.

607
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,500
So the real job for us, if we're gonna last over, you know,

608
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,930
geologic timescales, if we want a technosphere

609
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,380
that's gonna last tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands,

610
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,080
millions of years, then we've gotta become mature,

611
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,650
which means to not undermine the conditions,

612
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,160
to not subvert the conditions that you need to stay alive.

613
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,610
So as of right now, I'd say we're not autopoietic.

614
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,720
- Wow, I wonder if we look across thousands,

615
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,390
tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years,

616
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,330
that perturbations, the technosphere

617
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,680
should create perturbations

618
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,210
as a way for developing greater

619
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,450
and greater defenses against perturbations,

620
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,310
which sounds like a ridiculous statement,

621
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,730
but basically, go out and play in the yard

622
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,520
and hurt yourself to strengthen,

623
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,743
or, like, drink water from the pond.

624
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,180
- [Adam] From the pond. Yeah, right.

625
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,620
Get sick a few times.

626
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,210
- To strengthen the immune system.

627
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,650
- Yeah, well, you know what's interesting

628
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,570
with the technosphere, we could talk about this more,

629
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,050
but, like, you know, we're just emerging as a technosphere

630
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,110
in terms of as a interplanetary technosphere, right?

631
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,480
That's really the next step for us is to,

632
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,313
David Grinspoon talks about,

633
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:33,210
I love this idea of anti-accretion,

634
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,820
like, this amazing thing that for the first time,

635
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,590
you know, over the entire history of the planet,

636
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,870
stuff is coming off the planet, right?

637
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,340
Used to be everything just fell down,

638
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,960
all the meteorites fell down.

639
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,180
But now we're starting to push stuff out.

640
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,000
And you know, like the idea of planetary defense or such,

641
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,840
you know, we are actually gonna start exerting perturbations

642
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,790
on the solar system as a whole.

643
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,650
We're gonna start engineering, if we make it, right?

644
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,483
I always like to say

645
00:24:56,483 --> 00:24:57,690
that if we can get through climate change,

646
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,993
the prize at the end is the solar system, right?

647
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,750
So we'll be literally engineering the solar system.

648
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,770
But what you can think of right now

649
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,870
with what's happening with the Anthropocene,

650
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,400
the Great Acceleration that is the technosphere,

651
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,540
you know, is the creation,

652
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,480
that is a giant perturbation on the biosphere, right?

653
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,467
And what you can't do is,

654
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:23,970
you know, the technosphere sits on top of the biosphere,

655
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,320
and if the technosphere undermines the biosphere

656
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,080
for its own conditions of habitability,

657
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,220
then you're in trouble, right?

658
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,330
I mean, the biosphere is not going away.

659
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,410
There's nothing we could do.

660
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,360
Like, the idea that we have to save the Earth

661
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,410
is a little ridiculous.

662
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,910
Like, the Earth is not a furry little bunny

663
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,170
that we need to protect,

664
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,780
but it's the conditions for us, right?

665
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,180
Humanity emerged out of the Holocene,

666
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,460
the last 10,000-years interglacial period.

667
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,120
We can't tolerate very different kinds of Earths.

668
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,730
So that's what I mean about a perturbation.

669
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,570
- Before we forget,

670
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,820
I gotta ask you about this paper, pretty interesting.

671
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,030
There's an interesting table here about hard steps,

672
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,230
abiogenesis, glucose fermentation to pyruvic acid,

673
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,840
all kinds of steps, all the way to homosapiens,

674
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,510
animal intelligence, land ecosystems,

675
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,790
endoskeletons, eye precursor,

676
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:16,790
so formation of the eye, complex multicellularity.

677
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,870
- [Adam] That's definitely one of the big ones.

678
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,130
- Yeah, so interesting.

679
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,420
I mean, what can you say about this chart?

680
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,360
There are all kinds of papers talking about,

681
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,370
what the difficulty of these steps?

682
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,510
- Right, and so this was the idea.

683
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,927
So what Carter said was,

684
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:31,020
you know, using philanthropic reasoning,

685
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,040
he said, there must be a few very hard steps

686
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,870
for the evolution to get through

687
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,870
to make it to intelligence, right?

688
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,550
So some steps are gonna be easy.

689
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,980
So every generation, you know, you roll the dice,

690
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,220
and yeah, it won't take long for you to get that step,

691
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,510
but there must be a few of them.

692
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,980
And he said, you could even calculate

693
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,530
how many there were, five, six,

694
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,030
in order to get to intelligence.

695
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,500
And so this paper here,

696
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,030
this plot is all these different people

697
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,140
who've written all these papers.

698
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,070
And this is the point, actually,

699
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,120
you can see all these papers

700
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,890
that were written on the hard steps,

701
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,410
each one proposing a different set

702
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,540
of what those steps should be.

703
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,310
And there's this other idea from biology

704
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,370
of the major transitions in evolution, MTEs,

705
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,080
that those were the hard steps.

706
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,970
But what we actually found was

707
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,190
that none of those are actually hard.

708
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,780
The whole idea of hard steps,

709
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,720
that there are hard steps, is actually suspect.

710
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,060
So you know, what's amazing about this model

711
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,340
is it shows how important it is

712
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,280
to actually work with people who are in the field, right?

713
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,150
So, you know, Brandon Carter

714
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,470
was a, you know, brilliant physicist,

715
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,150
the guy who came up with this.

716
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,190
And then lots of physicists

717
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,160
and astrophysicists like me have used this,

718
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,740
but the people who actually study evolution

719
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,410
and the planet were never involved, right?

720
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,080
And if you went and talked to an evolutionary biologist

721
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,940
or a biogeophysicist,

722
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,620
they'd look at you, when you explain this to them,

723
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,970
they'd be like, what?

724
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,370
Like, what are you guys doing?

725
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,180
Turns out, none of the details

726
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,890
or none of the conceptual structure of this matches

727
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,010
with what the people actually study the planet

728
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,120
and its evolution.

729
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,860
- Is it mostly about the fact

730
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,500
that there's not really discrete big steps,

731
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,690
is it's a gradual, continual kind of process?

732
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,523
- Well, there's two things.

733
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:15,690
The first most important one was that the planet

734
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,520
and the biosphere have evolved together.

735
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,020
That's something that every,

736
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,380
you know, most bio geophysicists completely accept.

737
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,750
And it was the first thing that Carter kind of rejected.

738
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,730
He said like, no, that's probably not possible.

739
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,350
And yet, you know, like, if he'd only, sort of,

740
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,750
had more discussions with this other community,

741
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,583
would've seemed like no,

742
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,270
you know, there are actually windows that open up.

743
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,310
And then the next thing is this idea

744
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,620
of whether a step is hard or not,

745
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,320
'cause what we mean by a hard step

746
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,420
is that, like I said, every time there's a generation,

747
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,370
every time there's the next generation born,

748
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,240
you're rolling the dice

749
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,253
on whether this mutation will happen.

750
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,580
And the idea of something being a hard step,

751
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,950
there's two ways in which something might even appear

752
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,540
as a hard step and not be,

753
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,130
or actually not be a hard step at all.

754
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,230
One is that you see something that has occurred in evolution

755
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,810
that has only happened once, right?

756
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,730
So let's take the opposite.

757
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,380
You see something that's happened multiple times,

758
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,960
like wings, lots of examples of wings

759
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,390
over lots of different evolutionary lineages.

760
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,360
So that's clearly not, making wings is not a hard step.

761
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,193
There are certain other things

762
00:29:13,193 --> 00:29:15,538
that people say, no, that's a hard step,

763
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:18,780
you know, the oxygen photosynthesis.

764
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,260
But they tend to be so long ago

765
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,520
that we've lost all the information.

766
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,270
There could be other things in the fossil record that,

767
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,670
you know, made this innovation,

768
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,230
but they're just gone now, so you can't tell,

769
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,760
so there's information loss.

770
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,010
The other thing is the idea of pulling up the ladder,

771
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,460
that somebody, you know, some species makes the innovation,

772
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,870
but then it fills the niche,

773
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,010
and nobody else can do it again.

774
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,810
So yeah, it only happened once, but it happened once

775
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:46,440
because, basically, the creature was so successful,

776
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,270
it took over, and there was no space

777
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,890
for anybody else to evolve it.

778
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,510
So, yeah, so the interesting thing about this

779
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,270
was seeing how much,

780
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,810
once you look at the details of life's history on Earth,

781
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,530
how it really shifts you away from this hard-steps model.

782
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,910
And it shows you that those details,

783
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,930
as we were talking about, like,

784
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,001
do you have to know about the planet,

785
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:06,630
do you have to know about plate tectonics?

786
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,130
Yeah, you're going to have to.

787
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,850
- I mean, to be fair to Carter on the first point,

788
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,150
it makes it much more complicated

789
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,630
if life and the planet are co-evolving,

790
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,790
'cause it would be nice to consider the planet

791
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,450
as a static thing that sets the initial conditions.

792
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,640
And then we can sort of, from an outside perspective,

793
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,780
analyze planets based on the initial conditions they create.

794
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:35,250
And there's a binary yes or no, will it create life?

795
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,390
But if they co-evolve,

796
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,060
it's a really complex dynamical system where everything

797
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,150
becomes much more difficult from the perspective of SETI,

798
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,740
of looking out there

799
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,020
and trying to figure out which ones

800
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,820
are actually producing life.

801
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,900
- But I think we're at the point now.

802
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,728
So now there may be other kinds of principles that actually,

803
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,450
'cause you know, coevolution actually has its own,

804
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,780
not deterministic, you're done with determinism, right?

805
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,270
But complex systems have patterns.

806
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,550
Complex systems have constraints,

807
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,530
and that's actually what we're gonna be looking for

808
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,784
are constraints on them.

809
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,430
And so, you know, and again, nothing against Carter,

810
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,800
was a brilliant idea, but it just goes to show,

811
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,633
you know, there's this great,

812
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:16,380
you know, I'm a theoretical physicist, right?

813
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,690
And so I love simplified,

814
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,040
give me a simplified model

815
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,110
with, you know, a dynamical equation,

816
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,210
some initial conditions, I'm very happy.

817
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,070
But there's this great XTC comic where like,

818
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,780
you know, somebody's working something out on the board,

819
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,490
and this physicist is looking over

820
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,610
and saying, "Oh, oh, I just wrote down an equation for that.

821
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,690
I solved your problem.

822
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,313
Do you guys even have a journal for this?"

823
00:31:35,313 --> 00:31:36,397
And, you know, subtitle is,

824
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:38,460
"Why everybody hates physicists."

825
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,650
So sometimes that approach totally works.

826
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,790
Sometimes physicists, you know,

827
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,120
can be very good at like zooming in on what is important

828
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,130
and casting the details aside

829
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,450
so you can get to the heart of an issue.

830
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,690
And that's very useful sometimes.

831
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,610
Other times, it obfuscates, right?

832
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,220
Other times, it clouds over, actually,

833
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,650
what you needed to focus on,

834
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,563
especially when it comes to complexity.

835
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,190
- Speaking of simplifying everything down to an equation,

836
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,560
let's return back to the question

837
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,900
of how many alien civilizations are out there

838
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,390
and talk about the Drake equation.

839
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,330
Can you explain the Drake equation?

840
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,280
- You know, people have various feelings

841
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,870
about the Drake equation.

842
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,970
You know, it can be abused, but basically,

843
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,580
the story actually is really interesting.

844
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,070
So Frank Drake, in 1960,

845
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,650
does the first ever astrobiological experiment.

846
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,590
He gets a radio telescope, points it at a couple of stars,

847
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,090
and listens for signals.

848
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,700
That was the first time anybody done any experiment

849
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,360
about any kinda life in the history of humanity.

850
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,193
And he does it,

851
00:32:40,193 --> 00:32:41,640
and he's kind of waiting for everybody to make fun of him.

852
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,470
And still, he gets a phone call from the government,

853
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,740
says, hey, we want you to do a meeting

854
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,680
on interstellar communications, right?

855
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,820
So he's like, okay.

856
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,760
So they organize a meeting with like just eight people,

857
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,253
a young Carl Sagan is gonna be there as well.

858
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,620
And like, the night before,

859
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,800
Drake has to come up with an agenda.

860
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,720
How do you come up with an agenda

861
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,770
for a meeting on a topic

862
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,070
that no one's ever talked about before, right?

863
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,740
What he does, what's so brilliant about the Drake equation

864
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,660
is he breaks the problem

865
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,300
of how many civilizations are there out there

866
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,217
into a bunch of sub-problems, right?

867
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:20,130
And he breaks it into seven sub-problems.

868
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,520
Each one of them is a factor in an equation,

869
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,840
that when you multiply them all together,

870
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,120
you get the number of civilizations out there

871
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,740
that we could communicate with.

872
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,790
So the first term is the rate at which stars form.

873
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,860
The second term is the fraction of those stars

874
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,810
that have planets, F sub-p.

875
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,730
The next term is the number of planets

876
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,960
in the habitable zone,

877
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,510
the place where we think life could form.

878
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,810
The next term after that is the fraction of those planets

879
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:50,280
where, actually, an abiogenesis event, life forms, occurs.

880
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,710
The next one is the fraction of planets

881
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,100
on which you start to get intelligence.

882
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,770
After that, it's the fraction of planets

883
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,770
where that intelligence goes on to create a civilization.

884
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,360
And then finally, the last term,

885
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,390
which is the one that we really care about, is the lifetime.

886
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,100
You have a civilization. Now how long does it last?

887
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,570
- [Lex] Why do you say we humans?

888
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,402
- We humans, right?

889
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:12,120
'Cause we're standing, we're staring at the,

890
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,766
you know, multiple guns pointing at us.

891
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:17,699
You know, nuclear war, climate change, AI.

892
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,139
So, you know, how long, in general,

893
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,340
does civilizations last?

894
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,570
Now, each one of these terms,

895
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,400
what was brilliant about what he did was,

896
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,233
what he was doing

897
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:26,580
was he was quantifying our ignorance, right?

898
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,340
By breaking the problem up into these seven sub-problems,

899
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,320
he gave astronomers something to do, right?

900
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,340
And so, you know, this is always,

901
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,690
with a new research field,

902
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,190
you need a research program,

903
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,870
or else you just have a bunch of vague questions,

904
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,530
You don't even know really what you're trying to do.

905
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,570
So, you know, the star people could figure out

906
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,070
how many stars were forming per year.

907
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,750
The people who were interested in planets

908
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,989
could go out and find techniques to discover planets,

909
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,219
et cetera, et cetera.

910
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,100
- I mean, these are their own fields.

911
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,929
Essentially by creating this equation,

912
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,489
he's launching new fields.

913
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:59,190
- Yeah, he gave astrobiology,

914
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,740
which wasn't even a term then, a roadmap.

915
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,210
Like, okay, you guys go do this,

916
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,587
you go do that, you go do that.

917
00:35:04,587 --> 00:35:09,180
And it had such far-reaching effect on astrobiology

918
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,800
because it did break the problem up

919
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,800
in a way that gave useful, you know, sort of marching orders

920
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:16,950
for all these different groups.

921
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,350
Like, for example, it's because of the Drake equation.

922
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,080
in some sense, that people

923
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,900
who were involved in SETI pushed NASA

924
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,540
to develop the technologies for planet hunting.

925
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,850
There was this amazing meeting in 1978 and,

926
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,520
two meetings, 1978 and 1979

927
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,290
that were driven, in some part,

928
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,450
by the people who were involved in SETI,

929
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,573
getting NASA together to say, look, okay, look,

930
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:40,500
you know, what's the roadmap

931
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,100
for us to develop technologies to find planets?

932
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,560
So yeah, so, you know, the Drake equation

933
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,300
is absolutely foundational for astrobiology,

934
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,660
but we should remember that it's not a law of nature, right?

935
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,420
It's not something that's, it's not E = mc squared.

936
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,820
And so you can see it being abused in some sense.

937
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,680
People, you know, it's generated a trillion papers.

938
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,880
Some of those papers are good.

939
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,170
I've written some of those,

940
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,060
and some of those papers are bad.

941
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,890
You know, I'm not sure where my paper fits in on those.

942
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,940
I'm saying, you know,

943
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,160
one should be careful about what you're using it for.

944
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,460
But in terms of understanding the problem

945
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,650
that astrobiology faces,

946
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,473
this really broke it up in a useful way.

947
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,810
- We could talk about each one of these,

948
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,050
but let's just look at exoplanets.

949
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,610
So that's a really interesting one.

950
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,530
I think when you look back,

951
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,540
you know, hundreds of years from now,

952
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,640
was it in the '90s when they first detected the first-

953
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,510
- Yeah, '92 and '95.

954
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,700
'95 to me was really, that was the discovery

955
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,490
of the first planet orbiting a sun-like star.

956
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,920
To me, that was the water, the dam being broken.

957
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,770
- I think that's, like, one of the greatest discoveries

958
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,270
in the history of science.

959
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,680
- I agree. I agree.

960
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,680
- Right now, I guess nobody's celebrating it too much

961
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,160
because you don't know what it really means.

962
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,240
But I think,

963
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,420
once we almost certainly will find life out there,

964
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,170
it will obviously allow us to generalize

965
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,950
across the entire galaxy, the entire universe.

966
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,260
So if you can find life on a planet,

967
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,940
even in the solar system,

968
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,057
you can now start generalizing across the entire universe.

969
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:13,680
- You can. All you need is one.

970
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,790
Like, right now, it's an any,

971
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,590
you know, our understanding of life.

972
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,130
We have one example. We have N = 1 example of life.

973
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,140
So that means we could be an accident, right?

974
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,200
It could be that we're the only place in the entire universe

975
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,500
where this weird thing called life has occurred.

976
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,480
Get one more example, and now you're done.

977
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,597
Because if you have one more example,

978
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:33,930
you know, you don't have to find all the other examples.

979
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,820
You just know that it's happened more than once.

980
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,420
And now you are, you know, from a Bayesian perspective,

981
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,100
you can start thinking like, yeah, yeah,

982
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,200
life is not something that's hard to make.

983
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,020
- Well, let me get your sense of estimates

984
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,950
for the Drake equation.

985
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,320
You also written a paper expanding on the Drake equation,

986
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,960
but what do you think is the answer?

987
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,790
- So the paper, there was this paper we wrote,

988
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,000
Woody Sullivan and I in 2016, where we said, look,

989
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,280
we have all this exoplanet data now, right?

990
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,680
So the thing that exoplanet science

991
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,590
and the exoplanet census I was talking about before

992
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,960
have nailed is F sub-p,

993
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,320
the fraction of stars that have planets, it's one.

994
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,840
Every fricking star that you see

995
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,450
in the sky hosts a family of worlds.

996
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,078
I mean, it's mind-boggling,

997
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:20,520
'cause those are all places, right?

998
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,670
They're either, you know, gas giants, probably with moons,

999
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,250
so the moons are places you can stand and look out,

1000
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,750
or they're like terrestrial worlds,

1001
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,570
where even if there's not life, there's still snow falling,

1002
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,810
and there's oceans washing up on, you know, on shorelines.

1003
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,960
It's incredible to think how many places

1004
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,030
and stories there are out there.

1005
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,650
So right, the first term was F sub-p,

1006
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,720
which is how many stars have planets.

1007
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,150
The next term is how many planets

1008
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,850
are in the habitable zone, right, on average.

1009
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,340
And it turns out to be 1/5, right?

1010
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,020
So, you know, you know, around 0.2.

1011
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,190
So that means you just count five of them.

1012
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,110
Go out at night and go one, two, three, four, five.

1013
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,020
One of them has an Earth-like planet,

1014
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,600
you know, in the habitable zone, like, whoa.

1015
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,400
- So what defines a habitable zone?

1016
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,090
- Habitable zone is an idea that was developed

1017
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:11,090
in 1958 by the Chinese American astronomer, Shu Shang,

1018
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,600
and it was a brilliant idea.

1019
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,443
It said, look,

1020
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:17,550
you know, I can do the simple calculation if I take a planet

1021
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,520
and just stick it at some distance from a star of,

1022
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,380
what's the temperature of the planet?

1023
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,850
What's the temperature of the surface?

1024
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,900
So now all you're gonna ask,

1025
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,733
you give it a standard kind of,

1026
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,990
you know, Earth-like atmosphere and ask,

1027
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,060
could there be liquid water on the surface, right?

1028
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,210
We believe that liquid water is really important for life.

1029
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,010
There could be other things that's happening, fine,

1030
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,800
but you know, if you were to start off trying to make life,

1031
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,280
you'd probably choose water as your solvent for it.

1032
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,930
So basically, the habitable zone

1033
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,680
is the band of orbits around a star

1034
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,092
where you can have liquid water on the surface.

1035
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:50,340
You could take a, you know, glass of water,

1036
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,960
pour it on the surface, and it would just pool up.

1037
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,520
It wouldn't freeze immediately,

1038
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,320
which would happen if your planet is too far out,

1039
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,880
and it would just boil away

1040
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,350
if your planet's too close in.

1041
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,800
So that's the formal definition of the habitable zone.

1042
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,660
So it's a nice strict definition.

1043
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,520
There's probably way more going on than that,

1044
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,740
but this is a place to start, right?

1045
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,660
- Well, we should say it's a place to start.

1046
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,940
I do think it's too strict of a constraint.

1047
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,773
- [Adam] I would agree.

1048
00:40:12,773 --> 00:40:15,570
- We're talking about temperature

1049
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,300
where water can be on the surface.

1050
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,950
There's so many other ways

1051
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,640
to get the aforementioned turmoil

1052
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,230
where the temperature varies,

1053
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,190
whether it's volcanic, so interaction of volcanoes and ice

1054
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,993
and all of this on the moons of planets

1055
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:32,980
that are much farther away, all this kind of stuff.

1056
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,140
- Yeah, well, for example,

1057
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,820
we know in our own solar system,

1058
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,700
we have, say, Europa, the moon of Jupiter,

1059
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,720
which has got 100-mile deep ocean

1060
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,490
under 10 miles of ice, right?

1061
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,660
That's not in the habitable zone.

1062
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,160
That is outside the habitable zone.

1063
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,630
And that may be the best place.

1064
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,240
It's got more water than Earth does.

1065
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,170
All of its oceans are,

1066
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,760
you know, it's twice as much water on Europa

1067
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,780
than there is on Earth.

1068
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,210
So, you know, that may be a really great place

1069
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,043
for life to form.

1070
00:40:58,043 --> 00:40:59,155
And it's outside the habitable zone.

1071
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:01,530
So, you know, the habitable zone is a good place to start,

1072
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,610
and it helps us,

1073
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,190
and there's reasons why you do wanna focus

1074
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,660
on the habitable zone, because like Europa,

1075
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,070
I won't be able to see from across telescopic distances

1076
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,180
across light-years.

1077
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,190
I wouldn't be able to see life on Europa

1078
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,410
because it's under 10 miles of ice, right?

1079
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:21,180
So the important thing about planets in the habitable zone

1080
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,300
is that we're thinking they have atmospheres.

1081
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,400
Atmospheres are the things we can characterize

1082
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,650
for across 10, 50 light-years,

1083
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,230
and we can see biosignatures, as we're gonna talk about.

1084
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,000
So there is a reason why the habitable zone

1085
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,140
becomes important for the detection of extrasolar life.

1086
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,260
- But for me, when I look up at the stars,

1087
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,930
it's very likely that there's a habitable planet

1088
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:47,100
or moon in each of the stars, habitable defined broadly.

1089
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,460
- Yeah. I think that's not unreasonable to say.

1090
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,220
I mean, especially since the formal definition,

1091
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,327
you get one in five, right?

1092
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:56,550
One in five is a lot. There's a lot of stars in the sky.

1093
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,250
So yeah, saying that, in general, when I look at a star,

1094
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,420
there's a pretty good chance

1095
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,970
that there's something habitable orbiting it

1096
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,570
is not a unreasonable scientific claim.

1097
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,900
- To me, it seems like

1098
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,203
there should be alien civilizations everywhere.

1099
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:17,430
Why the Fermi paradox? Why haven't we seen them?

1100
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,410
- Okay. The Fermi paradox.

1101
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,480
Let's talk about the, I love talking about the Fermi paradox

1102
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,600
because there is no Fermi paradox.

1103
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,250
Dun-dun-dun-dun.

1104
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,450
Yeah, so the Fermi paradox,

1105
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,570
let's talk a about the Fermi paradox and the history of it.

1106
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,000
So Enrico Fermi, it's 1950,

1107
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,710
he's walking with his friends

1108
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,130
at Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab to the cantina.

1109
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,360
And there had been this cartoon in "The New Yorker."

1110
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,650
They all read "The New Yorker."

1111
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,660
And the cartoon was trying to explain

1112
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,830
why there had been this rash

1113
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,280
of garbage cans disappearing in New York.

1114
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,814
And this cartoon said, oh, it's UFOs,

1115
00:42:51,814 --> 00:42:53,100
'cause this is already, you know, it's 1950.

1116
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,860
The first big UFO craze happened in '47.

1117
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,260
So they were laughing about this as they're walking.

1118
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,520
And being physicists,

1119
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,050
started talking about interstellar travel,

1120
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,150
interstellar propulsion, blah, blah, blah.

1121
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,650
You know, conversation goes on for a while,

1122
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,330
conversation turns to something else.

1123
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,490
You know, they've gone to other things.

1124
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,007
About 40 minutes later, over lunch, Fermi blurts out,

1125
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,800
"Well, where is everybody?" right?

1126
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,120
Typical Fermi sort of thing.

1127
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,860
He'd done the calculation in his head,

1128
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,660
and he suddenly realized that, look,

1129
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,930
you know, if intelligence is common,

1130
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,708
that even traveling at sublight speeds,

1131
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:27,420
a civilization could cross,

1132
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,150
you know, kind of hop from one star system to the other

1133
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,280
and spread it out across the entire galaxy

1134
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,380
in a few hundred thousand years.

1135
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,213
And he realized this,

1136
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:36,750
and so he was like, why aren't they here now?

1137
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:40,050
And that was the beginning of the Fermi paradox.

1138
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,080
It actually got picked up as a formal thing in 1975

1139
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,610
in a paper by Hart

1140
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,980
where he actually kind of went through this calculation

1141
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,950
and showed and said, well, there's nobody here now,

1142
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,440
therefore, there's nobody anywhere that, you know.

1143
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,080
Okay, so that is what we will call the direct Fermi paradox.

1144
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,610
Why aren't they here now?

1145
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,043
But something happened where after SETI began,

1146
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,130
there's this idea of the great silence.

1147
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,690
People got this idea in their head that like, oh,

1148
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,810
we've been looking for decades now

1149
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,880
for signals of extraterrestrial intelligence,

1150
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,380
and we haven't found any,

1151
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,480
therefore, there's nothing out there.

1152
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,490
So we'll call that the indirect Fermi paradox.

1153
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,220
And there absolutely is no indirect Fermi paradox,

1154
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,460
for the most mundane of reasons, which is money.

1155
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,680
There's never been any money to look.

1156
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,830
SETI was always done by researchers

1157
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,930
who were kind of like scabbing some time,

1158
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,000
you know, some extra time from their other projects

1159
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,160
to, you know, look a little bit,

1160
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,480
you know, at the sky with a telescope.

1161
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,860
Telescopes are expensive.

1162
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,560
So Jason Wright, one of my collaborators,

1163
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,730
he and his students did a study

1164
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,030
where they looked at the entire search space for SETI.

1165
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,200
You know, and imagine that's an ocean.

1166
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,330
All the different stars you have to look at,

1167
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,280
the radio frequencies you have to look at,

1168
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,140
when you look, how often you look.

1169
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,660
And they looked, then they summed up all the SETI searches

1170
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,493
that had ever been done.

1171
00:44:52,493 --> 00:44:53,730
They went through the literature.

1172
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,520
And what they found was if that search space,

1173
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,610
if the sky is an ocean and you're looking for fish,

1174
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,040
how much of the ocean have we looked at?

1175
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,110
And it turns out to be a hot tub.

1176
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,240
That's how much of the ocean that we've looked up.

1177
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,720
We've dragged an a hot tub's worth of ocean water up,

1178
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,920
and there was no fish in it.

1179
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,150
And so now are we gonna say,

1180
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,220
up, well, there's no fish in the ocean, right?

1181
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,050
So there is absolutely,

1182
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,270
positively no indirect Fermi paradox.

1183
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,090
We just haven't looked.

1184
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:21,960
But we're starting to look,

1185
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,610
so that's what's, you know, finally we're starting to look,

1186
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,020
that's what's exciting.

1187
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,580
The direct Fermi paradox,

1188
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,170
there are so many ways out of that, right?

1189
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,003
There's a book called

1190
00:45:29,003 --> 00:45:31,770
"Seventy-Seven Solutions to the Fermi Paradox"

1191
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,930
that it just, you know, you can pick your favorite one.

1192
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,910
It just doesn't carry a lot of weight

1193
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,530
because there's so many ways around it.

1194
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,690
We did an actual simulation, my group,

1195
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,000
Johnson Carroll, one of my collaborators,

1196
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,650
we actually simulated the galaxy,

1197
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,560
and we simulated probes moving at sublight speed

1198
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,020
from one star to the other,

1199
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,690
gathering resources, heading to the next one.

1200
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:54,330
And so we could actually track the expansion wave

1201
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,360
across the galaxy, have one abiogenesis event,

1202
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,330
and then watch the whole galaxy get colonized or settled.

1203
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,090
And it is absolutely true that that wave crosses,

1204
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,890
you know, Hart was right, Fermi was right,

1205
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,930
that wave crosses very quickly.

1206
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,480
But civilizations don't last forever, right?

1207
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,850
So one question is, when did they visit?

1208
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,190
When did they come to Earth, right?

1209
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,980
So if you give civilizations a finite lifetime,

1210
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,410
you know, let them last 10,000, 100,000 years,

1211
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,030
what you find is you now have a steady state.

1212
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,680
Civilizations are dying.

1213
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,120
You know, they're coming back,

1214
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,680
they're traveling between the stars.

1215
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,960
What you find then is you can have big holes opened up.

1216
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,120
You can have regions of space where there is nobody

1217
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,770
for, you know, millions of years.

1218
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,300
And so if we're living

1219
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,670
in one of those bubbles right now,

1220
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:36,930
then maybe we were visited,

1221
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,450
but we were visited 100 million years ago,

1222
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,280
and there was a paper that Gavin Schmidt and I did

1223
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,930
that showed that if there was a civilization,

1224
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,790
whether it was, like, dinosaurs

1225
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:47,460
or aliens that was here 100 million years ago,

1226
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,870
there's no way to tell.

1227
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,700
There's no record left over.

1228
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,560
The fossil record is too sparse.

1229
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,030
The only way maybe you could tell

1230
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:57,690
is by looking at the isotopic strata

1231
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,520
to see if there was anything reminiscent

1232
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,900
of an industrial civilization.

1233
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,810
But the idea that, you know, you'd be able to find,

1234
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:06,540
you know, iPhones or toppled buildings

1235
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,600
after 100 million years, there's no way.

1236
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,830
- So if there was an alien camp here,

1237
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,077
an alien village, a small civilization,

1238
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:17,567
maybe even a large civilization.

1239
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:19,050
- [Adam] Even a large civilization,

1240
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,307
even if it was a large. - 100 million years ago.

1241
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:21,930
- And it lasted 10,000 years,

1242
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,820
fossil record's not gonna have it.

1243
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,850
Yeah, yeah. The fossil record is too sparse, right?

1244
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,550
Most things don't fossilize.

1245
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,770
And 10,000 years is a, you know, blink in the eye

1246
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:33,390
of geological time.

1247
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:36,270
So we call, or Gavin called this the Silurian hypothesis

1248
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,470
after the "Doctor Who" episode

1249
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,567
with the lizard creatures, the Silurians.

1250
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:41,880
But that paper got a lot of press,

1251
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,347
but it was a, you know, it was an important idea,

1252
00:47:45,347 --> 00:47:46,800
and it was really Gavin's,

1253
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,780
I was just helping with the astrobiology,

1254
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,987
that to recognize that like, yeah,

1255
00:47:49,987 --> 00:47:52,710
you know, we could have been visited a long time ago.

1256
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,210
There just would be no record.

1257
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,520
Yeah. It's kinda mind-blowing.

1258
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,353
- It's really mind-blowing.

1259
00:47:57,353 --> 00:48:00,210
And it's also a good reminder that we've been,

1260
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,900
intelligent species have been here

1261
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,310
for a very short amount of time.

1262
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,897
- Very short amount of time. Yeah.

1263
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:07,867
And this is not to say that there was.

1264
00:48:07,867 --> 00:48:10,260
Like, so, oh, whenever I gave, you know,

1265
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,470
like, I was on Joe Rogan for exactly this paper,

1266
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,520
and I had to always emphasize,

1267
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,360
we're not saying there was a Silurian, you know,

1268
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,800
but we're just saying that if there was,

1269
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,480
that's why I love Gavin's question.

1270
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,850
Gavin's question was just like, how could you tell, right?

1271
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,640
It was a very beautifully scientific question.

1272
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,740
That's what we were really showing is that you really,

1273
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,290
you know, unless you did a very specific kind of search,

1274
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,880
which nobody's done so far,

1275
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,400
that, you know, there's not an obvious way to tell

1276
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,553
that there could have been civilizations here earlier on.

1277
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,460
- I've actually been reading a lot

1278
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,580
about ancient civilizations,

1279
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,590
and it just makes me sad

1280
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,370
how much of the wisdom of that time is lost

1281
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,920
and how much guessing is going on,

1282
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,230
whether it's in South America,

1283
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,450
like what happened in the jungle.

1284
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,180
- Yeah. Like, the Amazon, like the Amazon.

1285
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,090
You know, the conquistors came and wiped everybody out.

1286
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,693
And just even, like, the plague may have decimated.

1287
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,480
So yeah, how much of that civilization.

1288
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,860
- And there's a lot of theories,

1289
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:15,860
and you know, because of archeology only looks at cities,

1290
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,230
they don't really know the origins of humans.

1291
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,480
And there's a lot of really interesting theories,

1292
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,680
and they're, of course, controversial,

1293
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,410
and there's a lot of controversial people

1294
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,380
in every discipline,

1295
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,497
but archeology is like, yeah, it's a fascinating one

1296
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,583
'cause we know so little.

1297
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:31,020
They're basically storytellers.

1298
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,330
You're assembling the picture

1299
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:35,280
from just very few puzzle pieces.

1300
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,330
And it's fascinating.

1301
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,780
It's humbling and it's sad

1302
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,930
that there could be entire civilizations,

1303
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:46,710
ancient civilizations that are either almost entirely

1304
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:48,150
or entirely lost.

1305
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,540
- Yeah, well, like the indigenous peoples of North America,

1306
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,760
there could have been, like, millions and millions.

1307
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,500
You know, we get this idea that like, oh, you know,

1308
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,650
the Europeans came and it was empty, you know?

1309
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,420
But it may have only been empty

1310
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,760
because the plague gets swept up from the, you know,

1311
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,220
from the what happened in Mesoamerica.

1312
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,140
So, and yeah, and they didn't really build cities,

1313
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,400
but they had,

1314
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,340
I mean, they didn't build wooden, or stone cities.

1315
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,560
They built wooden cities, you know?

1316
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,750
- Everybody seems to be building pyramids,

1317
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,010
and they're really damn good at it.

1318
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:17,850
I don't know what- - What does that have to do

1319
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,830
with a, like, why does that apply?

1320
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,173
Like, what archetype in our brain is that?

1321
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,920
- And it is also really interesting, speaking of archetypes,

1322
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,630
is that independent civilizations formed,

1323
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,513
and they had a lot of similar kind of dynamics.

1324
00:50:33,513 --> 00:50:34,893
Like human nature,

1325
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,490
it builds up hierarchies in a certain way,

1326
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,130
it builds up myths and religions in a certain way,

1327
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,130
it builds pyramids in a certain way,

1328
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,600
it goes to war, all this kind of stuff,

1329
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,330
independently emerges, fascinating.

1330
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,290
- Santa Fe Institute,

1331
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,090
the stuff the Santa Fe Institute does on this

1332
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,100
as complex systems, you know, the origin

1333
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,680
of hierarchies and such, very cool.

1334
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,120
- Yeah, Santa Fe folks.

1335
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,110
Complexity, in general,

1336
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:00,390
is really cool. - Really cool.

1337
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,650
- What phenomena emerge

1338
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,830
when a bunch of small things get together and interact.

1339
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,577
Going back to this paper,

1340
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:09,300
"A New Empirical Constraint on the Prevalence

1341
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,190
of Technological Species in the Universe,"

1342
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,400
this paper that expands on the Drake equation,

1343
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,260
what are some interesting things in this paper?

1344
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,610
- Well, so the main thing we were trying to do

1345
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,720
with this paper is say, look,

1346
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,300
we have all of this exoplanet data, right?

1347
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,100
It's gotta be good for something,

1348
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,810
especially since two of the terms

1349
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,210
that have been nailed down empirically

1350
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,280
are two terms in the Drake equation.

1351
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,620
So F sub-p, that's the second term,

1352
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,270
fraction of stars that have planets.

1353
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,790
And then N sub-e, the average number of planets

1354
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:36,870
in the habitable zone.

1355
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,750
Those are the second and third term in the Drake equation.

1356
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,583
So what that means

1357
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,330
is all the astronomical terms have been nailed.

1358
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,760
And so we said like, okay, how do we use this

1359
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,497
to do something with the Drake equation?

1360
00:51:46,497 --> 00:51:49,590
And so we realized is, well, okay, we gotta get rid of time.

1361
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:52,620
The lifetime thing, we can't say anything about that.

1362
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:56,190
But if we don't ask, how long do they last,

1363
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:59,100
but instead ask, what's the probability

1364
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,770
that there have been any civilizations at all,

1365
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,000
no matter how long they lasted?

1366
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,920
I'm not asking whether they exist now or not.

1367
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,850
I'm just asking in general about probabilities

1368
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:12,240
to make a technological civilization anywhere

1369
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,340
and at any time in the history of the universe,

1370
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,350
and that, we were able to constrain.

1371
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:19,230
And so what we found was, basically,

1372
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:24,230
that there have been 10 billion trillion

1373
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:28,020
habitable zone planets in the universe.

1374
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,853
And what that means

1375
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:33,150
is those are 10 billion trillion experiments

1376
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,203
that have been run.

1377
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,777
And the only way that we're the only time that this is,

1378
00:52:37,777 --> 00:52:41,310
you know, this whole process from, you know,

1379
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,070
abiogenesis to a civilization has occurred

1380
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,200
is if every one of those experiments failed, right?

1381
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,720
So therefore you could put a probability,

1382
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,760
we called it the pessimism line, right?

1383
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,390
We don't really know what nature sets for the probability

1384
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,310
of making intelligent civilizations, right?

1385
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,050
But we could set a limit using this.

1386
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,810
We could say, look, if the probability

1387
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,550
per habitable zone planet

1388
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:06,300
is less than 10 to the -22, 1 in 10 billion trillion,

1389
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,500
then, yeah, we're alone.

1390
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,330
If it's anywhere larger than that,

1391
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:10,650
then there we're not the first.

1392
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,730
It's happened somewhere else.

1393
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,130
And to me, that was mind blowing.

1394
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,780
Doesn't tell me there's anybody nearby.

1395
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,220
The galaxy could be sterile.

1396
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,503
It just told me that, like, you know,

1397
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,990
unless nature's really has some bias against civilizations,

1398
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,370
we're not the first time this has happened.

1399
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,900
This has happened elsewhere

1400
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,940
over the course of cosmic history.

1401
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,220
- 10 billion trillion experiments.

1402
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,400
- Yeah. That's a lot of experiments.

1403
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,583
- That's a lot. - Right.

1404
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,340
- 1,000 is a lot. - Yeah.

1405
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,603
- 100 is a lot. - Yeah.

1406
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,530
- If we, normal humans, saw 100 experiments

1407
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:48,530
and we knew that, at least one time,

1408
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,450
there was a successful human civilization built.

1409
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,280
I mean, we would say for sure,

1410
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,810
in 100, you'll get another one.

1411
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:55,800
- Yeah. Yeah, so that's what,

1412
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,960
I mean, so this, you know, these kinds of arguments,

1413
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,220
you have to be careful with what they can do.

1414
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,470
But I felt like what this paper showed

1415
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,150
was that, you know, the burden of proof

1416
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,920
is now on the pessimists.

1417
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,770
Right, so that's why we called it the pessimism line.

1418
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,080
You know, throughout history there's been a,

1419
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,540
you know, alien pessimists and alien optimists,

1420
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,590
and they've been yelling at each other.

1421
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,790
That's all they had to go with, right?

1422
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,340
You know, and like with Giordano Bruno in 1600,

1423
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,450
they burned the guy

1424
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,580
at the stake for being an alien optimist.

1425
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,730
But nobody really knew what pessimism or optimism meant.

1426
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,650
You know, we sort of thought this was like the plank length.

1427
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,630
This was sort of the plank length of astrobiology,

1428
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:30,000
gave you an actual number that, you know,

1429
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,860
if you could somehow calculate

1430
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,510
what the probability, you know,

1431
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:36,000
of forming a technological civilization was,

1432
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,610
this thing sort of shows you where the limit is.

1433
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,650
As long as you're above 10 to the -22,

1434
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,000
then, absolutely, it has occurred in the history,

1435
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,320
other civilizations have occurred

1436
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,160
in the history of the universe.

1437
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,620
- So to me, at least, the big question is fe,

1438
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,320
which is basically abiogenesis.

1439
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,020
How hard is it for life to originate in a planet?

1440
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,350
'Cause all the other ones seem very likely.

1441
00:54:58,350 --> 00:54:59,640
Everything seems very likely.

1442
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,780
The only open question to me

1443
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,240
is like, how hard is it for life to originate?

1444
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,100
- There's lots of ways to, again, you know,

1445
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,630
we don't know unless we look,

1446
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,580
and, you know, you had Sara Walker

1447
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,570
on not too long ago.

1448
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:12,120
You know, she's very interested in origins of life.

1449
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,330
So, you know, lots of people are working on this.

1450
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,217
But I think it's hard looking at the history of the Earth,

1451
00:55:18,217 --> 00:55:22,110
you know, and again, you can do Bayesian arguments on this,

1452
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,740
but yeah, forming life, I don't think is hard.

1453
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,540
Getting, like, basic biology started,

1454
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,740
I don't think is hard.

1455
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,790
It's still wild.

1456
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:30,960
It's an amazing process

1457
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,230
that actually, I think, requires some deep rethinking

1458
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,560
about how we conceptualize what life is and what life isn't.

1459
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,020
That's one of the things I like about Sara's work.

1460
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,330
We're pursuing on a different level

1461
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,420
about the life as the only process,

1462
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,450
or the only system that uses information.

1463
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,780
But still, regardless of all those kinds of details,

1464
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,246
life is probably easy to make.

1465
00:55:53,246 --> 00:55:54,683
That's my gut feeling, you know?

1466
00:55:54,683 --> 00:55:58,260
- Yeah. I mean, day by day, this changes for me.

1467
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,740
But I just see that once you create bacteria,

1468
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,510
it's off to the races.

1469
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,370
You're gonna get complex life.

1470
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,230
As long as you have enough time,

1471
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,300
I mean, that boring billion,

1472
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,960
but I just can't imagine a habitable planet

1473
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,823
not having a couple of billion to spare,

1474
00:56:15,823 --> 00:56:17,204
couple years. - Yeah, a couple billion years

1475
00:56:17,204 --> 00:56:19,350
to spare, you know, there is a mystery there

1476
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,300
about why did it take so long,

1477
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,710
like, with the Cambrian explosion,

1478
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,830
but that may be, again, about these windows

1479
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:27,750
that, like, it couldn't happen until the window,

1480
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,720
the planet and the life had evolved together enough

1481
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,580
that they, together, kind of opened the window

1482
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,710
for the next step.

1483
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,490
You know, intelligent life and how long intelligent,

1484
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,320
civil and technological civilizations,

1485
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,510
I think there's a big question about how long those last.

1486
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:45,531
And you know, I'm hopeful, you know,

1487
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:48,090
but in terms of just, like,

1488
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:50,460
I think life is absolutely gonna be common,

1489
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,260
you know, pretty common in the universe.

1490
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,930
- Yeah, I think it's absolutely, like, I think, again,

1491
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,330
if I were to bet everything,

1492
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,363
even advanced civilizations are common.

1493
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:06,240
So to me, then, the only explanation is the L.

1494
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,420
Our galaxy is a graveyard of civilizations.

1495
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,620
- Yeah, because, you know, you think about it,

1496
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,540
we've only been around, I mean,

1497
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,510
truly, you know, when we think about, in Drake's definition,

1498
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:16,680
you had to have radio telescopes,

1499
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,513
that's been 100 years.

1500
00:57:17,513 --> 00:57:19,943
You know, and if we got another 10,000,

1501
00:57:19,943 --> 00:57:22,560
100,000 years of history,

1502
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,990
for us, it'd be pretty amazing, right?

1503
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,400
But that's still, that wouldn't be long enough

1504
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,980
to really pop up the number of civilizations

1505
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,510
in the galaxy.

1506
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,130
So you really need it to be, like,

1507
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:33,930
hundreds of millions of years.

1508
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:37,380
And that raises a question, which I am very interested in,

1509
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,420
which is, how do you even talk about,

1510
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,340
I call it the billionaire civilization, right?

1511
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,380
How do we even begin to hypothesize

1512
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,170
or think about, in any kind of systematic way,

1513
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,780
what happens to a technological civilization

1514
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,710
across hundreds of millions to a billion years?

1515
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,410
- Yeah, like, how do you even simulate the trajectories

1516
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:59,070
that civilizations can take across that kind of timescale

1517
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,411
when all the data we have

1518
00:58:00,411 --> 00:58:02,660
is just for the 10,000 years or or so,

1519
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:07,230
20,000 years that humans have been building civilizations?

1520
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,300
And then just, I don't know what you put it at,

1521
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,120
but maybe 100 years that we've been technological.

1522
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,280
- Yeah, and we're ready to blow ourselves to bits

1523
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,230
or, you know, drive ourselves off the planet.

1524
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,340
Yeah. No, it's really interesting.

1525
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,173
But there's gotta be a way.

1526
00:58:18,173 --> 00:58:19,530
I think that's really a frontier.

1527
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,440
So you had David Kipping on not too long ago,

1528
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,090
and David and I did a paper,

1529
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,310
and Caleb Scharf, David really drove this,

1530
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,470
where we, you know, it was a Bayesian calculation

1531
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,490
to sort of ask the question,

1532
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,980
if you were to find a detection,

1533
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,060
if you were to find a signal

1534
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,130
or, you know, a technosignature,

1535
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,750
would that come from a civilization

1536
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,050
that was younger, your age, or older?

1537
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:40,883
And you could see,

1538
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:41,790
I mean, this is not hard to do,

1539
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,597
but it was great, the formalism was hard.

1540
00:58:43,597 --> 00:58:45,480
You know, it's kind of intuitive,

1541
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,550
but the formalism was hard to show that,

1542
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,500
yeah, they're older, you know, probably much older.

1543
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,990
So it means you really do need to think about like, okay,

1544
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:55,470
how do billion-year civilizations manifest themselves?

1545
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,300
What signatures will they leave?

1546
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,770
And yeah, can you even...

1547
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,060
I mean, what's so cool about it,

1548
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,049
it's so much fun because you gotta, like,

1549
00:59:03,049 --> 00:59:05,010
you have to imagine the unimaginable.

1550
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,070
Like, you know, I mean, obviously, biological evolution

1551
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:10,620
can happen, you know, on those kinds of timescales.

1552
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,120
So you wouldn't even really be the same thing

1553
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,310
you started out as, but social forms,

1554
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,620
what kind of social forms can you imagine

1555
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,810
that would be continuous over that?

1556
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:20,310
Or maybe they wouldn't be continuous,

1557
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,210
they drop out, you know,

1558
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:23,010
they destroy themselves, and then they come back.

1559
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:27,630
So maybe it's, you know, it's a punctuated evolution.

1560
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,670
I mean, but we gotta sort of, this is the fun part,

1561
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,960
we have to sort of work this out.

1562
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,600
- Mm-hmm, well, I mean, one way to approach that question

1563
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:38,370
is like, what are the different ways to achieve homeostasis

1564
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,490
as you get greater and greater technological innovation?

1565
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,820
So, like, if you expand out into the universe

1566
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,954
and you have optic Kardashev scale,

1567
00:59:47,954 --> 00:59:51,090
what are the ways you can avoid destroying yourself?

1568
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,480
Just achieve stability while still growing?

1569
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,500
And I mean, that's an interesting question.

1570
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,630
I think it's probably simulatable.

1571
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,520
- Could be, I mean, you know, agent-based modeling,

1572
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,480
you could do it with.

1573
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,150
So you know, our group has used agent-based modeling

1574
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,830
to do something like the Fermi paradox.

1575
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,600
That was agent-based modeling.

1576
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,770
But you can also do this,

1577
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:11,940
people at Santa Fe have done this,

1578
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,050
other groups have done this,

1579
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,490
to use agent-based modeling

1580
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:17,970
to track the formation of hierarchies,

1581
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:20,670
the formation of stable hierarchies.

1582
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:23,460
So I think it's actually very doable,

1583
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,220
but understanding the kind of assumptions

1584
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,360
and principles that are going into it

1585
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,010
and what you can extract from those,

1586
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,143
that is what is sort of the frontier.

1587
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:34,713
- Do you think if humans colonize Mars,

1588
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,970
the dynamic between the civilization on Earth

1589
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:41,790
and Mars will be fundamentally different

1590
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:45,090
than the dynamic between individual nations

1591
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:45,923
on Earth right now?

1592
01:00:45,923 --> 01:00:47,610
Like, that's a thing to load

1593
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,310
into the agent-based simulation we're talking about.

1594
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,450
- If we settle it,

1595
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:53,520
Mars will very quickly wanna become its own nation.

1596
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,840
- Well, no, there's already gonna be nations on Mars.

1597
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,855
That's guaranteed.

1598
01:00:58,855 --> 01:00:59,688
- Yeah, go be your own- - Moment you have

1599
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:01,110
2 million people,

1600
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,490
the moment you have 1 million people,

1601
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,870
there's gonna be two tribes.

1602
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:04,703
- [Adam] Right.

1603
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,267
- And then they're going to start fighting.

1604
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:07,100
- [Adam] Right.

1605
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,420
- And the question is, interplanetary fighting,

1606
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,860
how quickly does that happen?

1607
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:13,465
And does it have a different nature to it,

1608
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:14,910
because of the distances, you know?

1609
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:16,980
- Are you a fan of "The Expanse"?

1610
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,390
Have you watched "The Expanse"?

1611
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:19,950
Great show, 'cause it's all about the,

1612
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,480
I highly recommend to everybody.

1613
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,220
It's based on a series of books that are excellent.

1614
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,810
It's on Prime, six seasons,

1615
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,850
and it's basically about the settled solar system.

1616
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,500
It takes place about 300 years from now,

1617
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,090
and the entire solar system is settled.

1618
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,690
And it is the best show about interplanetary politics.

1619
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,637
The first season, actually, the journal, what was it?

1620
01:01:36,637 --> 01:01:40,533
"Foreign Affairs" said the best show on TV about politics.

1621
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,730
It's interplanetary, so yeah, I think, you know,

1622
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,560
human beings being human beings, yes,

1623
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,910
there will be warfare, and there will be conflict.

1624
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,660
And I don't think it'll be necessarily all that different,

1625
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,710
you know, because really,

1626
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,450
I think within a few hundred years,

1627
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:57,237
we will have lots of people in the solar system.

1628
01:01:57,237 --> 01:01:58,620
And it doesn't even have to be on Mars.

1629
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,440
We did a paper where we look based on,

1630
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,870
'cause I always wanted to know about whether an idea

1631
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:05,550
in "The Expanse" was really possible.

1632
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,830
In "The Expanse," the asteroid belt,

1633
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,140
what they've done is they have colonized the asteroid belt

1634
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,300
by hollowing out the asteroids and spinning them up

1635
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,980
and living on the inside, right?

1636
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,540
Because they have the Coriolis force.

1637
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,280
And I thought like, wow, what a cool idea.

1638
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,230
And when I ran the blog for NPR,

1639
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,850
actually talked to the guys and said,

1640
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:23,730
did you guys calculate this, see whether it's possible?

1641
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,080
Sadly, it's not possible.

1642
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,360
The rock is just not strong enough

1643
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,430
that if you tried to spin it up to the speeds,

1644
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:32,070
you need to get 1/3 gravity,

1645
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,770
which is what I think the minimum you need for human beings,

1646
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:36,270
the rock would just fall apart, it would break.

1647
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,010
But we came up with another idea,

1648
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,900
which was that if you could take small asteroids,

1649
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,690
put a giant bag around them, a nanofiber bag,

1650
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:45,270
and spin those up, it would inflate the bag.

1651
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:47,160
And then even a small couple

1652
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,463
of kilometer-wide asteroid would expand out to,

1653
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,780
you could get like a Manhattan's worth of material inside.

1654
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,990
So forget about even colonizing Mars. Space stations, right?

1655
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:01,350
Or space habitats with millions of people in them.

1656
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,000
So anyway, the point is that I think,

1657
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,100
you know, within a few hundred years,

1658
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,960
it is not unimaginable

1659
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,210
that there will be millions, if not billions,

1660
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,580
of people living in the solar system.

1661
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,860
- And so you think most of them will be in space habitats

1662
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,547
versus on Mars, on the planetary surface?

1663
01:03:15,547 --> 01:03:17,580
- You know, it's a lot easier,

1664
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,413
on some level, right?

1665
01:03:18,413 --> 01:03:21,120
It depends on how, like, with nano fabrication and such.

1666
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,300
But, you know, getting down to gravity well is hard, right?

1667
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,800
So, you know, there's a certain way

1668
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,880
in which there's a lot of, you know,

1669
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,300
it's a lot easier to build real estate out of the asteroids,

1670
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,170
but we'll probably do both.

1671
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,510
I mean, I think what'll happen is, oh, you know, the next,

1672
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,740
should we make it through climate change

1673
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,350
and nuclear war and all the other, and AI,

1674
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:40,470
the next thousand years of human history

1675
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,060
is the solar system, right?

1676
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,880
And so, you know, I think we'll settle every nook

1677
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,040
and cranny we possibly can.

1678
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,870
And it's, you know, it's a beautiful,

1679
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,280
what I love about what's hopeful about it

1680
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,310
is this idea you're gonna have all of these pockets,

1681
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:54,300
and, you know, I'm sure there's gonna be

1682
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,790
a Mormon space habitat, like, you know?

1683
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:57,930
There's gonna be whatever you want,

1684
01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:59,760
a libertarian space habitat.

1685
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,680
Everybody's gonna be able to kind of create their,

1686
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,170
there'll be lots of experiments in human flourishing.

1687
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:07,350
And those kinds of experiments will be really useful for us

1688
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,750
to sort of figure out better ways for us to interact

1689
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,450
and have maximum flourishing, maximum wellness,

1690
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,670
maximum democracy, maximum freedom.

1691
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:17,580
- Do you think that's a good backup solution

1692
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,500
to go out into space,

1693
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,080
so to avoid the possibility

1694
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,540
of humans destroying themselves completely here on Earth?

1695
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,373
- Well, I think, you know,

1696
01:04:25,373 --> 01:04:27,660
I wanna be always careful with that because, like I said,

1697
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,120
it's centuries that we're talking about, right?

1698
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,465
So, you know, the problem with climate change,

1699
01:04:32,465 --> 01:04:33,750
you know, and same with nuclear wars,

1700
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,010
breathing down our necks now.

1701
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,810
So it's not a, you know,

1702
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:41,610
trying to establish a base on Mars is gonna be so hard

1703
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:44,610
that it is not even gonna be close to being self-sufficient

1704
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,730
for a couple of, you know, a century at least.

1705
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:50,310
So it's not like a backup plan now.

1706
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,530
You know, we have to solve the problem of climate change.

1707
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,430
We have to deal with that.

1708
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:54,720
There's still enough nuclear weapons

1709
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,000
to really do, you know, horrific things

1710
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,070
to the planet for human beings.

1711
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:01,200
So I don't think it's like a backup plan in that way.

1712
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,450
But I do think, like I said, it's the prize.

1713
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,250
You know, if we get through this,

1714
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,860
then we get the entire solar system

1715
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,897
to sort of play around in and experiment with

1716
01:05:09,897 --> 01:05:11,520
and do really cool things with.

1717
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,780
- Well, I think it could be a lot less

1718
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:17,130
than a couple of centuries if there's a urgency,

1719
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:19,800
like a real urgency, like a catastrophe,

1720
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,790
like maybe a small nuclear war breaks out

1721
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:26,790
where it's like, holy shit, this is for sure,

1722
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,280
for sure a bigger one is looming.

1723
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,200
Maybe if, geopolitically,

1724
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,020
the war between China and the United States escalates

1725
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,300
where there's this tension that builds and builds and builds

1726
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,910
and it becomes more obvious that we need to really,

1727
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:40,013
really, really excavate. - Yeah.

1728
01:05:40,013 --> 01:05:42,540
I think my only dilemma with that

1729
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,420
is that I just think that a self-sufficient base

1730
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:49,140
is so far away that, like, say, you start doing that

1731
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,240
and then there is a full scale nuclear exchange.

1732
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,220
That base is, you know, it's not gonna last

1733
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,240
'cause it's just, you know,

1734
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,540
the self-sufficiency requires a kind of economy,

1735
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,090
like, literally a material economy

1736
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,340
that we are so far from with Mars

1737
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,750
that we are centuries from.

1738
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:04,800
Like I said, you know,

1739
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,510
three centuries, which is not that long.

1740
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,850
Two to three centuries, you know, look at 1820,

1741
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:11,580
nobody had traveled faster than 60 miles an hour

1742
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,590
unless they were falling off a cliff, right?

1743
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:15,870
And now, we routinely travel at 500 miles an hour.

1744
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:17,940
But it is sort of centuries long.

1745
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,520
So that's why I think we'd be better off trying

1746
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,610
to solve these problems than,

1747
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:24,840
you know, I just think the odds

1748
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,860
that we're gonna be able

1749
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:29,370
to create a self-sufficient colony on Mars

1750
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:33,810
before that threat comes to head is small.

1751
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,280
So we'd have to deal with the threat.

1752
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,870
- Yeah, it's an interesting scientific

1753
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,490
and engineering question of

1754
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,890
how to create a self-sufficient colony on Mars

1755
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:43,110
or out in space as a space habitat,

1756
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:46,140
like where Earth entirely could be destroyed,

1757
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,037
you could still survive.

1758
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:47,870
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause it's really what about,

1759
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,373
you know, thinking about complex systems, right?

1760
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,420
A space habitat, you know, would have to be

1761
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,875
as robust as an ecosystem, as the kind of thing,

1762
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:59,070
you know, you go out and you see a pond

1763
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:01,770
with all the different webs of interactions.

1764
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:04,080
You know, that's why I always think that, you know,

1765
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,390
if this process of going out into space

1766
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:10,620
will help us with climate change

1767
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:11,683
and with thinking about making

1768
01:07:11,683 --> 01:07:14,640
a long-term sustainable version of human civilization,

1769
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,280
'cause you really have to think about these webs,

1770
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,900
the complexity of these webs

1771
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,360
and recognize the biosphere has been doing this forever.

1772
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,370
The biosphere knows how to do this, right?

1773
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,920
And so, A, how do we build a vibrant,

1774
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,340
powerful technosphere that also doesn't,

1775
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,320
you know, mess with the biospheres,

1776
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,300
mess with the biosphere's capacity

1777
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,920
to support our technosphere?

1778
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,030
So, you know, by doing this,

1779
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,410
by trying to build space habitats,

1780
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:38,340
in some sense, you're thinking

1781
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:40,860
about building a small-scale version of this.

1782
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,450
So I think the two problems

1783
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:44,430
are gonna kind of feed back on each other.

1784
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:47,370
- Well, there's also the other possibility of,

1785
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:51,330
like, the movie Darren Aronofsky's "Postcard From Earth"

1786
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:53,850
where we can create this kind of life gun

1787
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,110
that just shoots,

1788
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:59,100
so as opposed to engineering everything,

1789
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:02,130
basically seeding life on a bunch of places

1790
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:03,810
and letting life do its thing,

1791
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:06,720
which is really good at doing, it seems like.

1792
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,910
So as opposed to, like, with a space habitat,

1793
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:11,940
you basically have to build the entire biosphere

1794
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:13,560
and technosphere, the whole thing

1795
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,470
by yourself. - The whole thing, yeah.

1796
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,100
You know, if you just,

1797
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,370
hey, the aforementioned cockroach with some bacteria,

1798
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,412
place it in Europa,

1799
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:24,870
I think you'd be surprised what happens.

1800
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:25,703
- Yeah. Yeah. - Right?

1801
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:30,330
Like, honestly, if you put a huge amount of bacteria, like,

1802
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:33,189
a giant number of organisms from Earth

1803
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,170
on Mars, on some of these moons

1804
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:41,760
of the other planets in the solar system,

1805
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,140
like, I feel like some of them

1806
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,796
would actually find a way to survive.

1807
01:08:44,796 --> 01:08:46,319
- You know, the moon is hard

1808
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:47,153
'cause the moon is just, like, there's no,

1809
01:08:47,153 --> 01:08:49,710
you know, the moon may be really hard,

1810
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,880
but, you know, I mean, I wonder,

1811
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,439
somebody must have done these experiments, right?

1812
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:54,540
Like, 'cause we know there are extremophiles, right?

1813
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,970
We know that you can go down, you know,

1814
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,770
10 miles below the Earth's surface,

1815
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:01,080
and there are things where there's no sunlight.

1816
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,630
There's, you know, the conditions are so extreme,

1817
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,689
and there's lots of microbes having a great time,

1818
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:09,510
living off the radioactivity, you know, in the rocks.

1819
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:11,670
But, you know, they had lots of time

1820
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:13,170
to evolve to those conditions.

1821
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:16,740
So I'm not sure if you dumped a bunch of bacteria,

1822
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,990
you know, like, somebody must have done these experiments.

1823
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:22,260
Like, you know, how fast

1824
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:25,170
could microbial evolution occur

1825
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,970
in under harsh conditions

1826
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:30,120
that you maybe get somebody who figures out,

1827
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:30,953
okay, I can deal with this.

1828
01:09:30,953 --> 01:09:32,910
I think the moon's too much 'cause it's so sterile,

1829
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:35,970
but you know, Mars, I don't know, maybe, I don't know.

1830
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,680
We'd have to that, but it's an interesting idea.

1831
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,720
- I wonder if somebody has done those experiments.

1832
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,890
- Yeah, you think somebody would.

1833
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:43,290
Like, let's take a bunch of microbes-

1834
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:44,819
- Take the harshest possible condition

1835
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:46,247
of all different kinds, temperature, all this kind of stuff.

1836
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:48,600
- Right, pressure, salinity,

1837
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,100
and then just, like, dump a bunch of things

1838
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,750
that are not used to it.

1839
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:53,970
And then just see, does everybody just die?

1840
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:54,960
You know, that's it? There's, you know-

1841
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,110
- The thing about life,

1842
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:59,370
it flourishes in a non-sterile environment

1843
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:01,380
where there's a bunch of options for resources,

1844
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,690
even if the condition is super harsh.

1845
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:04,523
In the lab, I don't know

1846
01:10:04,523 --> 01:10:07,500
if you can reconstruct harsh conditions

1847
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,930
plus options for survival.

1848
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:11,379
You know what I mean?

1849
01:10:11,379 --> 01:10:15,330
Like, you have to have the huge variety

1850
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:19,290
of resources that are always available on a planet somehow,

1851
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,626
even when it's a super harsh condition.

1852
01:10:21,626 --> 01:10:24,243
So that's actually not a trivial experiment.

1853
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,220
If somebody did that experimental in the lab,

1854
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,113
I'd be a little bit skeptical,

1855
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:32,100
'cause I could see bacteria doesn't survive

1856
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,230
in this kinds of temperature,

1857
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,434
but then I'd be like, eh, I don't know, I don't know.

1858
01:10:36,434 --> 01:10:37,327
- Is there enough? Right.

1859
01:10:37,327 --> 01:10:39,510
You know, are there other options?

1860
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:41,580
Like, you know, is the condition rich enough?

1861
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,413
- [Lex] Rich enough, yeah.

1862
01:10:42,413 --> 01:10:44,130
- You know, there's an alternative view though,

1863
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:46,320
which is, there's this great book

1864
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,180
by Kim Stanley Robinson called "Aurora."

1865
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:51,480
You know, so there's been a million century ship stories,

1866
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,507
like where, you know, Earth sends out a,

1867
01:10:52,507 --> 01:10:54,960
you know, generation ship or century ship,

1868
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,280
and it goes to another planet,

1869
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,020
and they land, and they colonize.

1870
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,670
And on this one, they get all the way there,

1871
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,680
and they think the planet's gonna be habitable.

1872
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,727
And it turns out that it's not habitable for Earth life.

1873
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:05,940
You know, there's, like, you know,

1874
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,440
bacteria are prions actually,

1875
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,660
you know, super that just, like, you know,

1876
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:12,060
kill people in the simplest way.

1877
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,130
And the important thing about this book

1878
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,600
was the idea that, like, you know, life

1879
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,990
is actually very tied to its planet.

1880
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:19,230
It may not be so easy.

1881
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,580
I just thought this was a really interesting idea.

1882
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,930
I'm not saying necessarily supporting it,

1883
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:26,460
but that actually life reflects the planetary conditions,

1884
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,140
not the planetary, the planet itself,

1885
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,990
the whole lineage, the whole history of the biosphere.

1886
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,657
And it may not be so easy just to just sort of be like,

1887
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:35,327
oh, just drop it over here and it'll, you know,

1888
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:36,900
'cause the bacteria,

1889
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,360
even though they're individual examples of life,

1890
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,030
and I kind of believe this, the true unit of life,

1891
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:43,800
it's not DNA, it's not a cell,

1892
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,850
it's the biosphere,

1893
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:46,740
it's the whole community. - The whole thing.

1894
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:47,880
- Yeah.

1895
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,950
- That's actually an interesting field of study,

1896
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:53,190
is how, when you arrive from one planet to another,

1897
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:56,430
so we humans arrive to a planet that has a biosphere,

1898
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:58,320
maybe a technosphere,

1899
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,413
what is the way to integrate

1900
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,210
without killing yourself or-

1901
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:07,043
- [Adam] Or the the other one.

1902
01:12:07,043 --> 01:12:08,160
- Or the other one.

1903
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,780
Let's stick to biology,

1904
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,613
Like, that's an interesting question.

1905
01:12:10,613 --> 01:12:15,613
I don't know if we have a rigorous way

1906
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,330
of investigating that.

1907
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,507
- Because everything on life is,

1908
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:21,330
you know, has the same lineage.

1909
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,500
We all come from LUCA,

1910
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,420
you know, the last universal common ancestor.

1911
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,740
And what you see is, often, in science fiction,

1912
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,720
people will do things like, oh, well, it's okay

1913
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,390
because, like, that bio,

1914
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,220
that metabolism, that biochemistry

1915
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,140
is so different from ours that we can coexist

1916
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,249
because they don't even know each other.

1917
01:12:35,249 --> 01:12:36,840
You know, right? Like, the...

1918
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,640
You know, and then the other version is you get there,

1919
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,410
you land and instantly, you know, the nose bleeds,

1920
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,050
and you're dead, so it's...

1921
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,910
- Unfortunately, I think it's the latter.

1922
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:46,350
- Yeah, it sort of feels like

1923
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,300
the more alien kind of thing. - Is the more likely.

1924
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,850
So as we look out there,

1925
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:53,400
according to the Drake equations we just discussed,

1926
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,660
it seems impossible to me

1927
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,730
that there's not civilizations everywhere.

1928
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,580
So how do we look at them? This process of SETI.

1929
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,750
- I have to put on my scientist hat

1930
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,700
and just say my gut feeling

1931
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,130
is that dumb life, so to speak, is common.

1932
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,480
I am a little agnostic about,

1933
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,620
I can see ways

1934
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,761
in which intelligent civilizations may be sparse,

1935
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:12,330
but, you know, we gotta go look.

1936
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:15,840
It's all armchair astronomy.

1937
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,970
- That's from a sort of rigorous scientific perspective.

1938
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:20,580
From my bro-science perspective, it seems,

1939
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:23,040
again, smoking the aforementioned weed.

1940
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,990
- Smoking the weed, yeah, after the bong.

1941
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:26,250
Yeah, it seems right. - I mean, honestly.

1942
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,180
- Yeah.

1943
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:30,000
- It's really just seems impossible to me

1944
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,660
that there's not potentially dead,

1945
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,580
but advanced civilizations everywhere

1946
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,656
in our galaxy.

1947
01:13:36,656 --> 01:13:38,640
- Yeah, yeah, the potentially dead part, I think, right.

1948
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,490
It could be that, like, making civilizations is easy,

1949
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,540
they just don't last long.

1950
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,680
So when we went out there,

1951
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,660
we'd find a lot of extinct civilizations.

1952
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:49,470
- Extinct civilizations. Yeah, apex predators don't survive.

1953
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,270
Like, they get better, better, better, better,

1954
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:54,270
and they die and kill themselves all.

1955
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:56,710
Anyway, so, just, how do we find them?

1956
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:58,230
- Yeah, so SETI,

1957
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,000
search for extraterrestrial technology,

1958
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,050
is a term that I am not fond of using anymore.

1959
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:06,703
I mean, some people in my field are, so I'm sorry, folks,

1960
01:14:06,703 --> 01:14:11,160
but what I really like is the idea of technosignatures.

1961
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,630
I think, you know, to me,

1962
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:14,490
SETI is the, first of all, intelligence.

1963
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:15,600
We're not really looking for intelligence.

1964
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,740
We're looking for technology.

1965
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:19,410
I mean, you know, and SETI,

1966
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:21,720
the classic idea of SETI is the radio telescopes,

1967
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,570
you know, in "Contact," Jodi Foster with the headphones.

1968
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:27,090
That whole thing is still part, it's still active,

1969
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,440
there's still great things going on with it,

1970
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,780
but suddenly, this whole new window opened up.

1971
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:32,730
When we discovered exoplanets,

1972
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:37,440
we now found a new way to look for intelligent civilizations

1973
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,210
or life, in general,

1974
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:41,520
in a way that doesn't have any of the assumptions

1975
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,860
that had to go into the classic radio study.

1976
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:46,170
And specifically what I mean is we're not looking

1977
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,880
for somebody sending us a beacon.

1978
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,060
You really needed that with a classic model

1979
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,560
for a bunch of different reasons.

1980
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,360
You had to assume they wanted to be found.

1981
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,520
And they were sending you a super powerful beacon.

1982
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,790
Now, because we know exactly where to look

1983
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:01,800
and we know exactly how to look,

1984
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,460
we can just go about looking for passive signatures

1985
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,780
of the civilization

1986
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,660
going about its civilizationing business,

1987
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,400
you know, without asking

1988
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,960
whether they wanna be contacted or not.

1989
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,030
So this is what we call a biosignature

1990
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:16,830
or a technosignature.

1991
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:20,780
It is an imprint in the light from the planet

1992
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:23,370
of the activity of a biosphere or a technosphere.

1993
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:24,203
And that's really important.

1994
01:15:24,203 --> 01:15:26,910
You know, that is why kind of the whole Gaia idea

1995
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:28,800
ends up being astrobiological,

1996
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,580
that biospheres and technospheres are so potent,

1997
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,710
they change the entire planet.

1998
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:36,720
And you can see that from 20 light-years.

1999
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,880
So let's give an example of a biosignature

2000
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:39,713
to start off with,

2001
01:15:39,713 --> 01:15:44,070
which would be a signature of a biosphere: oxygen, right?

2002
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:45,420
On Earth, at least, we know

2003
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,670
that oxygen is only in the atmosphere

2004
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:49,290
because life put it there.

2005
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,450
If life went away, the oxygen,

2006
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,850
and particularly oxygen and methane, that pair,

2007
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,130
they would disappear, you know, very quickly.

2008
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:58,170
They'd react away. They'd all be gone.

2009
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:01,680
So if you find a planet with oxygen and methane,

2010
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,610
that's a good bet that there's a biosphere there.

2011
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,350
Okay, what about technospheres?

2012
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,060
Technospheres, this is what, you know,

2013
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,620
so I'm the principal investigator

2014
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:13,350
on the first grant NASA has ever given

2015
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:15,903
to do these kind of exoplanet technosignatures.

2016
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:18,750
For reasons we can talk about,

2017
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,640
NASA had gotten pretty gun-shy

2018
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,130
about funding anything about intelligent life.

2019
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,680
But, okay, what's an example of a technosignature?

2020
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,960
Well, one could be atmospheric pollution.

2021
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,730
I'm gonna put pollution in quotes here

2022
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:30,870
'cause it doesn't have to be pollution,

2023
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:33,150
but gases like chlorofluorocarbons.

2024
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:35,340
So we've dumped, you know, we dumped a huge amount

2025
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,820
of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere by mistake.

2026
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:40,230
It was affecting the ozone.

2027
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:42,111
But we put so much in there that, actually,

2028
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,140
this is one of the things we did.

2029
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,460
We did a paper where we showed,

2030
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:47,190
you could detect it across interstellar distances.

2031
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:49,350
You could look at the atmosphere,

2032
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:51,840
look at the light coming from a distant planet,

2033
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,520
pass the light through a spectrograph

2034
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,280
and see the spectral lines, the fingerprint,

2035
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,020
the spectral fingerprint

2036
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,750
of chlorofluorocarbons in an atmosphere.

2037
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,910
And that would for sure tell you

2038
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,430
that there was a technological civilization there,

2039
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:08,460
because there's no other way to make chlorofluorocarbons

2040
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:11,550
except through some kind of industrial process.

2041
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,470
- So you're looking for, in the case of the biosphere,

2042
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:17,820
you're looking for anomalies in the spectrograph.

2043
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,530
- I wouldn't necessarily call these anomalies.

2044
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:22,440
I'm looking for things that, for biosignature,

2045
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,986
I'm looking for things that a geosphere, right,

2046
01:17:24,986 --> 01:17:25,950
you know, that just rock

2047
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:28,170
and air wouldn't produce on its own.

2048
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:29,910
- What kind of chemicals would life produce?

2049
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:31,350
- Right, and that's part of the,

2050
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,283
that's the interesting thing, right?

2051
01:17:33,283 --> 01:17:35,280
You know, so we can use Earth as an example, right?

2052
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,330
We can say, look, oxygen,

2053
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,170
we know there would be no oxygen in the atmosphere

2054
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,440
if it wasn't for dimethyl sulfide,

2055
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,650
which is a compound that phyloplankton dump

2056
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:44,820
into the atmosphere, a lot of it.

2057
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,110
That's sometimes mentioned.

2058
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:48,330
And there was even, there was a paper that somebody wrote,

2059
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,730
where it was like, well, we're not saying we see it,

2060
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:52,590
but, you know, there's a bunch of noise

2061
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:54,750
in the spectra right there.

2062
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,300
So, you know, there's a whole list of things

2063
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,580
that Earth has done that are in the atmosphere

2064
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:00,810
that might be biosignatures.

2065
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,790
But now we're reaching an interesting point.

2066
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:04,230
The field has matured to the point

2067
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:07,830
where we can start asking about agnostic biosignatures,

2068
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:11,190
things that have nothing to do with Earth's history.

2069
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:14,220
But we think that that would still be indications

2070
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,830
of this weirdness we call life, right?

2071
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:19,860
What is it, in general, that life does

2072
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:20,910
that leaves an imprint?

2073
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:24,840
So one of these things could be the structure of the network

2074
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,890
of chemical reactions,

2075
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:27,630
that biology always produces

2076
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:29,130
very different chemical networks,

2077
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:32,970
who's reacting with who, than just rock and water, right?

2078
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:35,160
So there's been some proposals

2079
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:39,390
for networked, you know, biosignatures.

2080
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:42,390
Information theory, you can try and look at the information

2081
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:45,880
that is in the different compounds

2082
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,120
that you find in the atmosphere.

2083
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,917
And maybe that information shows you, like,

2084
01:18:49,917 --> 01:18:51,810
oh, there's too much information here.

2085
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,160
There must have been biology happening,

2086
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,120
it's not just rock.

2087
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,110
Same thing for techno.

2088
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:56,520
That's what we're working on right now,

2089
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,650
that for technosignatures as well.

2090
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:01,770
- So how do you detect technosignatures?

2091
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,120
- Okay, so with technosignatures,

2092
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,800
I gave the example of chlorofluorocarbon.

2093
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,060
So that would be an example of,

2094
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,250
and again, that one is a non-agnostic one

2095
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:09,180
because we sort of, like, "Oh,

2096
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,010
we produced chlorofluorocarbons.

2097
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:12,270
Maybe they will," right?

2098
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:13,980
And there's solar panels, right?

2099
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:16,630
You can actually, the glint off of solar panels

2100
01:19:18,313 --> 01:19:21,270
the way the light is reflected off of solar panels,

2101
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,340
no matter what it's made out of, actually.

2102
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,620
There was a paper that Manasvi Lingam

2103
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:28,620
and Avi Loeb did in, I think it was 2017,

2104
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:29,910
we've just followed up on it.

2105
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:32,190
That actually could act as a technosignature.

2106
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:34,260
You'd be able to see, in the reflected light,

2107
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,980
this sort of big jump that would occur because of...

2108
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:40,860
City lights, city artificial illumination,

2109
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,510
if there's really like,

2110
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,880
you know, large-scale cities like, you know,

2111
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,370
Coruscant in "Star Wars" or Trantor

2112
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:51,090
in the foundation, those city lights would be detectable,

2113
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:52,860
you know, the spectral imprint of those,

2114
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:55,290
across 20, 30 light-years.

2115
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,910
So, you know, our job in this grant

2116
01:19:56,910 --> 01:20:00,780
is to develop the first ever library of technosignatures.

2117
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:03,060
Nobody's really ever thought about this before.

2118
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:06,990
So we're trying to come up with all the possible ideas

2119
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:09,210
for what a civilization might produce

2120
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:11,520
that could be visible across,

2121
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,560
you know, interstellar distances.

2122
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,480
And are these good ones,

2123
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,280
or is these ones gonna be hard to detect or such?

2124
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,490
- City lights, so if a planet is all lit up

2125
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:24,360
with artificial light across 20 to 30 light-years,

2126
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,193
we can see it.

2127
01:20:25,193 --> 01:20:26,730
- Yeah, if you looked at Earth at night

2128
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,490
from a distance where, you know, looked at spectra

2129
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:31,860
and you had sensitive enough instruments,

2130
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,180
you'd be able to see all the sodium lights.

2131
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:34,650
And the reflected light off of, you know,

2132
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:37,320
they bounce off the ground, right?

2133
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,370
The light bounces off the ground.

2134
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:41,670
So you'd convolve the sodium lamps

2135
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,890
with the reflected spectra from the ground,

2136
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:45,900
and yeah, you'd be able to see that there's city lights.

2137
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:48,690
Now, increase that by a factor of 1,000,

2138
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:51,240
you know, if you had a Trantor,

2139
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,520
and you'd be able to detect that across interstellar.

2140
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,550
Thomas Beatty did this work, who's now working with us.

2141
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,383
- What do you think

2142
01:20:57,383 --> 01:21:01,260
is the most detectable thing about Earth?

2143
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,480
- Wow, this is a fun.

2144
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,520
Sophia Sheik, who's part of our collaboration,

2145
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,353
just did a paper.

2146
01:21:06,353 --> 01:21:07,186
We did Earth from Earth.

2147
01:21:07,186 --> 01:21:10,890
If you were looking at Earth with Earth technology

2148
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,780
for a bunch of different technosignatures,

2149
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:15,720
how close would you have to be to be able to detect them?

2150
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,980
And most of them turn out to be,

2151
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:17,970
you'd have to be pretty close,

2152
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,230
at least out to the Oort cloud.

2153
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:21,780
But actually, it is our radio signatures, still,

2154
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,400
that is still most detectable.

2155
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,080
- By the way, when you said you had to be pretty close

2156
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,180
and then you said the Oort cloud, that's not very close.

2157
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:29,120
But you mean, like, from an interstellar

2158
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,180
perspective. - Interstellar distance.

2159
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:31,410
'Cause the real, you know, what we really wanna know

2160
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:32,490
is, like, I'm sitting here on Earth,

2161
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,350
I'm looking at these exoplanets,

2162
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:36,570
the nearest star is four light-years away.

2163
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:38,853
So that's, like, the minimum distance.

2164
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,150
If I'm looking at exoplanets,

2165
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:44,100
what kind of signals could I see?

2166
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,410
- What is detectable about Earth

2167
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:49,740
with our current technology from our nearest solar system?

2168
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,030
- Oh my God. There's all kinds of stuff.

2169
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:54,390
Well, like, the chlorofluorocarbons.

2170
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,760
You know, you can see Earth's pollution and, you know,

2171
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,880
I think city lights, you had to be within,

2172
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,680
you know, within the solar system.

2173
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,140
- If they do direct imaging of Earth-

2174
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:06,030
- They're gonna need much more powerful.

2175
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:07,230
But let me tell you what's,

2176
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,730
let's talk about direct imaging for a moment

2177
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:09,563
'cause I just have to go on,

2178
01:22:09,563 --> 01:22:10,740
this is such a cool idea, right?

2179
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,790
So what we really want

2180
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,760
in the next generation of space telescopes and such

2181
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,200
is we're trying to do direct imaging.

2182
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,630
We're trying to get, you know, an image

2183
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:20,850
of a planet separated from its star

2184
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,470
to be able to see the reflected light

2185
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,458
or the actual emission from the planet itself.

2186
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:26,550
- Yeah, by the way, just to clarify,

2187
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:29,100
direct imaging means literally, like, a picture.

2188
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,290
- A picture, but the problem is,

2189
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:35,290
is that even with the thing that's gonna come after JWST,

2190
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:36,570
it's gonna be a pixel, right?

2191
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:38,070
You're not gonna get any kind of resolution.

2192
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:39,330
You'll be able to get the light from it,

2193
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,860
which you'll be able to pass through a spectrograph,

2194
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,510
but you're not gonna be able to take a picture.

2195
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:43,920
But there is this idea

2196
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,740
called the solar gravity lens telescope,

2197
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,790
I think that's what it is.

2198
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:49,500
And the idea is insane, right?

2199
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,030
So the general relativity says, look,

2200
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:52,710
massive bodies distort space.

2201
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:55,020
They actually curve spacetime.

2202
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,717
So the sun is a massive body.

2203
01:22:57,717 --> 01:22:59,460
And so that means that the light passing

2204
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:03,300
through the sun gets focused like a lens, right?

2205
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,360
So the idea is to send a bunch of telescopes out,

2206
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,040
kind of into the Oort cloud

2207
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,470
and then look back towards the sun

2208
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:12,750
towards an exoplanet that is behind,

2209
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:13,950
not directly behind the sun,

2210
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,110
but is, you know, in the direction of the sun.

2211
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:18,720
And then let the sun act like a lens

2212
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:22,560
and collect, focus the light onto the telescope,

2213
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:23,760
and you would be able to get,

2214
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,380
and they've done, like, it's amazing.

2215
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,240
Like, this idea is insane.

2216
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,370
They'd be able to get, if everything works out,

2217
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:32,040
24-kilometer resolution.

2218
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,460
You'd be able to see Manhattan on a exoplanet.

2219
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,200
And this thing, it sounds insane,

2220
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,090
but actually, you know,

2221
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,830
the team has already gotten through, like, sort of,

2222
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:42,720
three levels of NASA.

2223
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,700
You know, there's the NASA program for, like,

2224
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,560
give us your wackiest idea, right?

2225
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,810
And then the ones that survive that are, like, okay,

2226
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:51,630
tell us whether that wacky idea, you know, is even feasible.

2227
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:53,070
And they're marching along.

2228
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,317
And the idea is that, like, you know,

2229
01:23:55,317 --> 01:23:56,940
and they even have plans for how you'd be able

2230
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:59,790
to get these probes out into the Oort cloud

2231
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:01,740
on relatively fast timescales.

2232
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:04,080
You need to be about 500 times

2233
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,200
as far from the sun as Earth is.

2234
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,910
But right now, everything looks,

2235
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,260
the idea seems to hold together.

2236
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:12,630
So probably when I'll be dead,

2237
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,670
but when you're an old man,

2238
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,470
it's possible that something like this,

2239
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:17,850
could you imagine having, like,

2240
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:19,350
yeah, that kind of resolution,

2241
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:23,790
a picture of an exoplanet down to, you know, kilometers?

2242
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:25,723
So I'm very excited about that. You know I'm game.

2243
01:24:25,723 --> 01:24:28,740
- I can only imagine having a picture like that,

2244
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:32,460
and then there's some mysterious artifacts

2245
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,560
that you're seeing. - Yeah. Yep.

2246
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,110
- I mean, it's both inspiring

2247
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:41,223
and almost heartbreaking that we can see, like,

2248
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,970
I think we would be able to see a civilization

2249
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:46,770
where there's, like, a lot of scientists agree

2250
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,750
that this is very likely something,

2251
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,680
and then we can't-

2252
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:50,820
- We can't get there.

2253
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:51,750
But, you know, I mean, again,

2254
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,310
this is the thing about being long-lived.

2255
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:54,360
We've gotta get to the point

2256
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,790
where we're long-lived enough that,

2257
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:57,623
so let's say we found,

2258
01:24:57,623 --> 01:24:58,500
like, this is what I always like to,

2259
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,150
let's imagine that we find,

2260
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:03,420
say, 10 light-years away, we find a planet

2261
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,460
that looks like it's got technosignatures, right?

2262
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:06,293
It doesn't end there.

2263
01:25:06,293 --> 01:25:08,160
Like, that would be the most important discovery

2264
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,450
in the history of humanity.

2265
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:11,217
And it wouldn't be like, well, okay, we're done.

2266
01:25:11,217 --> 01:25:13,620
The first thing we do is we'd big bigger telescope

2267
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:15,330
to try and do those imaging, right?

2268
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:16,350
And then the next thing after that,

2269
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:17,973
we plan a mission there, right?

2270
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:20,130
We would figure out,

2271
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:22,563
like, with Breakthrough Starshot,

2272
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:26,550
there was this idea of trying to use, you know, giant lasers

2273
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:30,210
to propel small spacecrafts, light sails,

2274
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:31,500
almost to the speed of light.

2275
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,930
So they would get there in 10 years and take pictures.

2276
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:36,240
And so, you know, if we actually made this discovery,

2277
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,090
there would be the impulse, there would be the effort

2278
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:42,390
to actually try and send something to get there.

2279
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:44,440
Now, you know, we probably couldn't land,

2280
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:48,870
you know, so maybe we take 30 years to build,

2281
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:52,290
10 years to get there, 10 years to get the picture back.

2282
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:54,510
Okay, you're dead, but your kids are, you know what I mean?

2283
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:57,090
So it becomes now this multi-generational project.

2284
01:25:57,090 --> 01:25:58,560
How long did it take to build the pyramids?

2285
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,380
How long did it take to build the giant cathedrals, right?

2286
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,690
Those were multi-generational projects.

2287
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:07,230
And I think we're on the cusp of that kind of project.

2288
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:08,833
- I think that would probably unite humans.

2289
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:10,980
- I think it would play a big role.

2290
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:11,813
I think it would be helpful.

2291
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:13,560
I mean, human beings are a mess, let's face it.

2292
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,300
But I think having that,

2293
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,070
that's why I always say to people,

2294
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:18,600
discovery of life, of any kinda life,

2295
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,760
even if it was microbial life, it wouldn't matter,

2296
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,590
that to know that we're not an accident,

2297
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:24,240
to know that there is probably,

2298
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,740
if we found one example of life,

2299
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:26,940
we'd know that we're not an accident,

2300
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:28,500
and there's probably lots of life.

2301
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,550
And that we're a community.

2302
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:32,400
We're part of a cosmic kind of community of life.

2303
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,610
And who knows what life has done, right?

2304
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,990
All bets are off with life.

2305
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:39,810
- Since we're talking about the future of telescopes,

2306
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:42,030
let's talk about our current super-sexy,

2307
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,610
awesome telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope

2308
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:46,290
that I still can't believe actually worked.

2309
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,563
- [Adam] I can't believe it worked either.

2310
01:26:47,563 --> 01:26:48,750
I was really skeptical.

2311
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:51,810
I was like, okay, guys, all right, sure.

2312
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:52,980
- We only got one shot

2313
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:57,750
for this incredibly complicated piece of hardware to unfold.

2314
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,790
So what kind of stuff can we see with it?

2315
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:02,580
I've been just looking through different kinds

2316
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,050
of announcements that have been detected.

2317
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:06,000
There's been some direct imaging,

2318
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,650
- [Adam] Yes, like a single pixel.

2319
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:10,830
- The kinds of exoplanets we're able to direct image,

2320
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:13,230
I guess would have to be hot.

2321
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:15,240
- Hot, usually far away from the,

2322
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,890
you know, reasonably far away from the star.

2323
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:19,050
I think JWST's really kind of at the hairy edge

2324
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:20,460
of being able to do much with this.

2325
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:23,790
What's more important, I think, for JWST is the spectra.

2326
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:24,623
And the problem with spectra

2327
01:27:24,623 --> 01:27:25,920
is that there's not sexy pictures.

2328
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,870
It's like, hey, look at this wiggly line.

2329
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:29,370
But be able to find

2330
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:31,590
and characterize atmospheres

2331
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:36,570
around terrestrial exoplanets is the critical next step.

2332
01:27:36,570 --> 01:27:37,860
That's where we are right now.

2333
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,240
In order to look for life,

2334
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,720
we need to find planets with atmospheres, right?

2335
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,553
And then we need to be able

2336
01:27:43,553 --> 01:27:45,270
to do this thing called characterization,

2337
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:47,490
where we look at the spectral fingerprints

2338
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:48,870
for what's in the atmosphere.

2339
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:50,490
Is there carbon? Is there carbon dioxide?

2340
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:52,440
Is there oxygen? Is there methane?

2341
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,780
And that's the most exciting thing.

2342
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:57,450
For example, there was this planet K2-18b,

2343
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:00,720
which they did a beautiful job getting the spectra.

2344
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,780
And the spectra indicated it may be an entirely new kind

2345
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:06,810
of habitable world called a hycean world.

2346
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:10,170
Hycean meaning hydrogen ocean world.

2347
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:13,290
And that is a kind of planet that it would be a,

2348
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:14,520
you know, kind of in the super-Earth,

2349
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,620
sub-Neptune domain we were talking about,

2350
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:19,290
you know, maybe eight times that mass of the Earth.

2351
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:20,940
But it's got a layer of hydrogen,

2352
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,680
of an atmosphere of hydrogen.

2353
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,740
Hydrogen is an amazing greenhouse gas.

2354
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:30,000
So hydrogen will keep the planet underneath it warm enough

2355
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,320
that you could get liquid water.

2356
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:35,580
You can get a giant ocean of liquid water.

2357
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,860
And that's an entirely different kind of planet

2358
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:38,820
that could be habitable.

2359
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:41,820
You know, it could be a 60-degree warm ocean.

2360
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:45,420
So the data that came out of JWST

2361
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:47,400
for that planet was good enough

2362
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,280
to be able to indicate, like, oh, yeah, you know what,

2363
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,420
from what we understand about the models,

2364
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,880
this looks like it's could be a hycean world.

2365
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,270
- And it's 120 light-years away from Earth.

2366
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:58,923
- Yeah, and so isn't that amazing?

2367
01:28:58,923 --> 01:29:00,570
It's 120 light-years away,

2368
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:02,160
but we can see into the atmosphere.

2369
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,663
We can see into the atmosphere so well

2370
01:29:03,663 --> 01:29:06,060
that we can be like, oh, look, methane.

2371
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,490
Methane was a five-sigma detection.

2372
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:10,560
Like, you knew that the data were so good

2373
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,830
that it was like the gold standard of science.

2374
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:15,180
- What about detecting,

2375
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:19,620
maybe through direct imaging or in other ways,

2376
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:23,970
megastructures that the civilizations build?

2377
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:25,470
- You know, what's great about megastructures is,

2378
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:26,610
first of all, it's fun to say.

2379
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:27,900
Who doesn't wanna say megastructure?

2380
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,460
Alien megastructure, right?

2381
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:32,460
Every morning, I'm looking for an opportunity to say that.

2382
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:36,240
So the er example of this is the Dyson sphere, right,

2383
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,431
which is amazing 'cause, you know,

2384
01:29:37,431 --> 01:29:39,510
it was literally 1960 that this idea came up.

2385
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:40,696
- Can you explain the Dyson sphere?

2386
01:29:40,696 --> 01:29:42,300
- Yeah, the Dyson sphere, so Freeman Dyson,

2387
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,880
you know, one of the greatest physicists ever

2388
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,350
who was very broad minded

2389
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:47,460
and thought about a lot of different things,

2390
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:48,910
he recognized that, you know,

2391
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:51,630
as civilizations progress,

2392
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:54,900
what they're gonna need is evermore energy to do evermore,

2393
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,700
you know, amazing things.

2394
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:58,920
And what's the best energy source in a solar system?

2395
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,690
It's the star, right?

2396
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:03,300
So if you surrounded the star

2397
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,280
with solar-collecting machines,

2398
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,650
sunlight-collecting machines,

2399
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:10,440
and the limit of this would actually build a sphere

2400
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,300
and an actual sphere around your star

2401
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,010
that had all solar panels on the inside,

2402
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:17,010
you could capture every photon the star produced,

2403
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:19,260
which is, you know, this insane amount of light.

2404
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,730
You would have enough power now

2405
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:24,090
to do anything, to re-engineer your solar system.

2406
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:25,080
So that was a Dyson sphere.

2407
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,597
It turns out that a Dyson sphere doesn't really work

2408
01:30:26,597 --> 01:30:30,420
'cause it's unstable, you know, but a Dyson swarm,

2409
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,650
and that's really what he meant,

2410
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:35,970
you know, this large collection of large orbiting structures

2411
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,710
that were able to collect light.

2412
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:42,510
- Yeah, so he didn't actually mean a rigid sphere structure.

2413
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,070
He basically meant a swarm.

2414
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:46,020
So like you said,

2415
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,120
then the limit basically starts to look-

2416
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,130
- People started to say, yeah, it was like a sphere.

2417
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:52,040
And we actually almost thought we might have found one

2418
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:55,980
of these back with Boyajian's Star.

2419
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,810
You know, the way we detect planets

2420
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:00,330
is through the transit method where the planet passes

2421
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,340
in front of the star, and there's a dip in the starlight.

2422
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,990
It's a little eclipse, basically.

2423
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,670
And we know exactly what they should look like.

2424
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:06,960
And then with this one star,

2425
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,450
there were these really weird transits

2426
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:11,790
where, like, it was like this little dragon's tooth.

2427
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:13,440
And then there'd be another one and another one

2428
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,720
and another one, and then nothing, and then three more.

2429
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,600
And in the paper that was written about this,

2430
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,490
they, you know, they went through the list of,

2431
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:21,330
oh, it could be comets,

2432
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:23,147
could be chunks of a broken-up planet,

2433
01:31:23,147 --> 01:31:25,763
and it could also be an alien megastructure.

2434
01:31:25,763 --> 01:31:27,270
And of course, the news picked up on this

2435
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:29,467
and, like, everybody's, you know, newsfeed the next day,

2436
01:31:29,467 --> 01:31:31,380
"Alien megastructures discovered."

2437
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:34,350
Turns out, sadly, they were not alien megastructures.

2438
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:37,050
They were probably gas or dust clouds.

2439
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:38,370
But it raised the possibility,

2440
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:39,570
like, oh, these are observable.

2441
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:41,790
And people have worked out the details

2442
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:43,290
of what they would look like.

2443
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,490
You don't really need direct imaging.

2444
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:45,480
You can do transits, right?

2445
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,460
They're big enough that when they pass in front of the star,

2446
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,887
they're gonna produce a little blip of light,

2447
01:31:48,887 --> 01:31:50,340
'cause that's what they're supposed to, right?

2448
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,810
They're absorbing starlight.

2449
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:53,550
So people have worked out, like,

2450
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:55,860
well, a square one or a triangular one.

2451
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,180
- But that wouldn't be a Dyson sphere.

2452
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:58,470
That would be, like, one object that's-

2453
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:00,600
- One object, right, which if it's a swarm,

2454
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,070
you'd expect, like, the light to be, like,

2455
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:04,870
blinking in and out as these things pass in front of.

2456
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:06,960
You know, if you've got thousands of these,

2457
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,180
much of the time, they'll be blotting out the star.

2458
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:10,530
Sometimes they won't be, right,

2459
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:12,390
and so you're gonna get an irregular

2460
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:15,330
sort of signal, transit signal.

2461
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:17,220
- Yeah, one you wouldn't expect from a star

2462
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:18,210
that doesn't have anything.

2463
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:21,090
- Exactly, or just a planet, right, or a couple of planets.

2464
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:22,050
There'd be so many of these

2465
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:23,880
that it would be like beep, beep, blip, blip, blip,

2466
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:24,750
blip, blip, blip.

2467
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:29,190
- And that usually doesn't happen in a star system

2468
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:31,770
because there's only just a handful of planets.

2469
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:33,360
- That's exactly what it is.

2470
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,860
You know, and a stable solar system,

2471
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:37,500
you get a handful of planets, you know, 5, 10.

2472
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,660
That's it, probably, and nothing else.

2473
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:41,430
So if now suddenly you see all lots

2474
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:43,650
of these little microtransits,

2475
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,060
you're telling you there's something else

2476
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,160
that's big enough to create a transit,

2477
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,350
but, you know, too many of them.

2478
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:52,230
And also within a regular shape, the transit itself,

2479
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:54,420
that these could be megastructures.

2480
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:58,110
- How many people are looking for megastructures now?

2481
01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:01,830
- Well, the main groups looking for megastructures

2482
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:05,730
are again, Jason Wright at Penn State and collaborators.

2483
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:06,810
The way they're looking for it, though,

2484
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:07,920
is for infrared light,

2485
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,260
Because, you know, the second law of thermodynamics says,

2486
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:13,110
look, if you capture all of this starlight,

2487
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:15,030
you're gonna warm up the,

2488
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:17,700
you know, your thing's gonna warm up and emit an infrared.

2489
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:19,320
It's gonna be waste heat,

2490
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:21,753
waste heat and waste light from this.

2491
01:33:21,753 --> 01:33:25,063
- That feels like a louder, clearer way to deduct it.

2492
01:33:25,063 --> 01:33:26,760
- And that's actually, you know, Dyson,

2493
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,050
that's actually why Dyson proposed it.

2494
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:30,510
He wasn't really proposing it because, like, he was saying,

2495
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:32,370
this is what civilizations are gonna do.

2496
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:33,720
He proposed it 'cause he was like, oh,

2497
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,150
we wanna start looking for alien civilizations,

2498
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:39,930
here's something that would have a detectable signature.

2499
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:42,540
So Jason and company have done,

2500
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,860
you know, pretty good searches.

2501
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:46,740
And recently, they made news because, you know,

2502
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:48,690
they were able to eliminate a lot of places.

2503
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:49,710
No, these are not Dyson spheres,

2504
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:51,900
but they did have a couple that were, like, anomalous enough

2505
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:53,310
that they're like, well,

2506
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:54,660
this is kind of what it would look like.

2507
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:55,620
It's not a detection,

2508
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:57,570
and they would never say it's a detection,

2509
01:33:57,570 --> 01:34:00,270
but they were like, they were not non-detections.

2510
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:01,103
- They're potential candidates.

2511
01:34:01,103 --> 01:34:02,670
- Potential candidates, yeah.

2512
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:05,070
- Love it, we have megastructure candidates.

2513
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:06,360
That's inspiring.

2514
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,657
What other megastructures do you think that could be?

2515
01:34:08,657 --> 01:34:10,310
I mean, so Dyson sphere

2516
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:12,420
is about capturing the energy of a star.

2517
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:14,340
- Yeah. - Or there could be other...

2518
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:17,280
- Well, there's something called the Clark belt, right?

2519
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,810
So we have a bunch of satellites

2520
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:20,640
that are in geosynchronous orbit.

2521
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,350
Nothing naturally is gonna end up

2522
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:23,700
in geosynchronous orbit, right?

2523
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,410
Geosynchronous orbit is one particular orbit

2524
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:27,780
that's really useful if you wanna beam things straight down

2525
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,130
or if you wanna put a space elevator up, right?

2526
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:33,553
So there's this idea that if, you know,

2527
01:34:33,553 --> 01:34:35,880
a civilization becomes, you know,

2528
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,940
advanced enough that it's really using geosynchronous orbit,

2529
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:39,960
that you actually get a belt,

2530
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,000
something that would actually be detectable

2531
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,250
from a distance via a transit.

2532
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:47,220
There's been a couple papers written about the possibility

2533
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:50,700
of these Clark belts, densely-occupied Clark belts

2534
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:52,410
being a megastructure.

2535
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:54,990
It's not as mega as a Dyson swarm,

2536
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:57,090
but it's, you know, kind of planetary scale.

2537
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:58,680
- You think it's detectable, Clark belt?

2538
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,513
- It could be.

2539
01:34:59,513 --> 01:35:01,500
I mean, like, in our list of technosignatures,

2540
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,360
it would be down there.

2541
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,490
Again, if you had an advanced enough civilization

2542
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:08,610
that did enough of this, it would certainly,

2543
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:09,870
you'd have a Clark belt.

2544
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,610
And the question is whether or not it's detectable.

2545
01:35:11,610 --> 01:35:13,410
- Yeah, probably Dyson sphere is the,

2546
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:14,243
that's the more exciting.

2547
01:35:14,243 --> 01:35:15,076
- That's the go-to one.

2548
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,080
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

2549
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,400
- Speaking of the Dyson sphere,

2550
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,980
let's talk through the Kardashev scales.

2551
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:23,970
What is the Kardashev scale, and where are humans on it?

2552
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:26,070
- Right, so the Kardashev scale was the same time,

2553
01:35:26,070 --> 01:35:27,480
this is this golden age of SETI,

2554
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:31,680
like, kind of like '60, '59 to '65 when it just starts.

2555
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,450
Like, this is, you know,

2556
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:35,940
Frank Drake has done his first experiment.

2557
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:38,550
People are like, oh my God, this is even possible.

2558
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:40,500
And so people are just thrown out these ideas.

2559
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,330
And as I, you know, said in the book,

2560
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:43,650
science is conservative.

2561
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:46,410
And what I mean by that is it holds onto its best ideas.

2562
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:49,290
So Kardashev comes up with this idea that, look,

2563
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:51,540
again, it's always about detectability.

2564
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:54,390
If we're looking for civilizations, we should think about,

2565
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:56,820
what are the natural stages,

2566
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:59,850
natural in quotes, that a civilization goes through?

2567
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:02,520
And he was thinking in terms of energy use,

2568
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,050
which, like a good physicist.

2569
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:06,330
So he said, look,

2570
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:10,440
the first hurdle in terms of energy

2571
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,690
or threshold that a civilization will go through

2572
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:15,960
is using all the starlight that falls onto a planet.

2573
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,330
He called that a type I civilization.

2574
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:19,620
In whatever way you're doing it,

2575
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:21,480
some large fraction of the starlight

2576
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,270
that falls on your planet, you're using for your own ends.

2577
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:27,690
The next would be to use all the starlight there is

2578
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:29,340
from that star, right?

2579
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,510
So that's the Dyson sphere.

2580
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:34,440
So Dyson had already proposed his idea of the swarm,

2581
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:35,760
and Kardashev was picking up.

2582
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,860
So that's a type II civilization.

2583
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:40,320
Type III is galactic scale,

2584
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,810
a civilization that could use all the starlight

2585
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:44,220
in a galaxy, right?

2586
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:45,600
So where are we now?

2587
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,160
Remarkably, on a log scale,

2588
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,020
we're at 0.7 of a type I.

2589
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,460
- So we're not even type I.

2590
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:51,900
- No, no, no. We're not even type I.

2591
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:54,540
But according to,

2592
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:57,477
there was a paper written by a group that said, you know,

2593
01:36:57,477 --> 01:36:58,860
can we continue on our path,

2594
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:02,010
we'll be at a type one at around 2300.

2595
01:37:02,010 --> 01:37:05,244
- 2300. So this is on a log scale.

2596
01:37:05,244 --> 01:37:09,060
So 0.7, so type I

2597
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:12,030
is about 10 to the 16th watts.

2598
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:14,649
type II is 10 orders of magnitude larger than that,

2599
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:16,170
10 to the 26 watts.

2600
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:18,480
And I think estimate for the galaxy

2601
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,310
is another 10 orders of magnitude.

2602
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:22,440
- Yeah 'cause there's 100 billion star off order,

2603
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,180
100 billion stars, yeah.

2604
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,923
- So that's a lot.

2605
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:27,110
- [Adam] That's a lot of energy.

2606
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:29,253
- Do you think humans ever get to type I?

2607
01:37:30,283 --> 01:37:32,460
- I think you know that there's a problem with type I,

2608
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:33,330
which is that, you know,

2609
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:35,280
we already know about climate change, right?

2610
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,800
The effects of our harvesting energy

2611
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,330
to do the work of civilization

2612
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:42,420
is already changing the climate state, right?

2613
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:43,770
And that's something that, you know,

2614
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:45,520
Kardashev couldn't have recognized.

2615
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:51,300
There's the first law of thermodynamics, right,

2616
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:52,800
which is just about energy,

2617
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,060
you know, the different forms of energy.

2618
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:55,290
Then there's the second law,

2619
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:56,967
which is about when you use that energy

2620
01:37:56,967 --> 01:37:59,430
And Kardashev wasn't thinking about the second law.

2621
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:03,150
If you get all that energy and you use it,

2622
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:04,440
there's waste heat.

2623
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,570
You don't get to use it all, right?

2624
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,920
Second law tells you that if, you know,

2625
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,600
I have a tank of gasoline,

2626
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,340
I can only use a certain fraction

2627
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,450
of the energy in that tank,

2628
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:15,510
and the rest is gonna go to heating up the engine block.

2629
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:16,837
So that second law tells you that,

2630
01:38:16,837 --> 01:38:19,680
you know, you can only use so much energy

2631
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:23,370
before the climate state is like, uh-oh, you know,

2632
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:25,290
sorry, he's gonna change on you.

2633
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:27,210
So there's a way in which we probably can't get

2634
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:30,780
to a type I without, like, devastating the Earth's climate.

2635
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,570
So we're probably gonna have to figure out,

2636
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:35,070
the most important thing, actually, here is probably,

2637
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:36,210
this is why space becomes so,

2638
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,340
the colonization or settlement of space.

2639
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,600
If we have an idea that we've been working on

2640
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,030
for a while called service worlds, right,

2641
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:42,863
that, at some point,

2642
01:38:42,863 --> 01:38:47,190
you probably move a lot of your industry

2643
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:48,900
off-world, right?

2644
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,550
We've got Mercury, for example.

2645
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,040
There's nothing on Mercury. There's no life on Mercury.

2646
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,560
Why don't you put your energy-harvesting there, right?

2647
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,570
Because, you know, you can't mess with the biosphere.

2648
01:38:57,570 --> 01:39:00,090
The biosphere is more powerful than you are, right?

2649
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:04,720
And so, yeah, so there's limits to how much energy

2650
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,950
we can harvest to do work on the Earth

2651
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:10,650
without really adversely affecting the biosphere.

2652
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:13,740
- It does seem that the best response to the climate change

2653
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,360
is not to use less technology,

2654
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,850
but to invent better technology

2655
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:21,510
and to invent technology

2656
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:25,050
that avoids the destructive effects.

2657
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:26,250
- This is the frontier we are,

2658
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:27,817
and that was the topic of my last book,

2659
01:39:27,817 --> 01:39:28,650
"Light of the Stars."

2660
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:29,483
It's like you've got,

2661
01:39:29,483 --> 01:39:32,700
you have to do the astrobiology of the Anthropocene.

2662
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,940
You have to see the transition that we're going through now

2663
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:36,390
of the Anthropocene

2664
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:40,140
on a kind of planetary astrobiological framework.

2665
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:41,790
And you know, that paper we were talking about

2666
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:43,560
with the 10 billion trillion worlds,

2667
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,810
that was actually in service of the work I was doing

2668
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:47,490
for this other book where I wanted to know,

2669
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:49,530
how often do you go through an anthro?

2670
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:52,680
You know, does every technological civilization

2671
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,320
trigger its own planetary crisis,

2672
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:57,420
its own climate Anthropocene crisis?

2673
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:58,680
And the answer we actually came up

2674
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,080
from doing models was like, yeah, probably.

2675
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,060
And then the question is, are you smart enough

2676
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,800
to figure out how to readjust

2677
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,450
what you're doing technologically

2678
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:08,790
so that you're not, you know, that all boats rise, right?

2679
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:10,110
You wanna figure out how to do this

2680
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:13,170
so that the biosphere becomes even more productive

2681
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:15,750
and healthy and resilient.

2682
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:18,840
So, yeah, right, it's the kind of technology.

2683
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,550
I think there's probably absolutely limits

2684
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:22,950
on how much energy you can use,

2685
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:24,540
but how do you use that energy?

2686
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,820
And then also, yeah, getting off planet eventually,

2687
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:30,077
if you want to use 10 times more energy than that,

2688
01:40:30,077 --> 01:40:33,150
you're not gonna do it on-world.

2689
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:37,133
- So how do we detect alien type I, II,

2690
01:40:37,133 --> 01:40:39,030
and III civilizations?

2691
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:40,530
So we've been kind of talking

2692
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:43,308
about basically type I civilization detection.

2693
01:40:43,308 --> 01:40:44,790
- Yeah, yeah, right.

2694
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:46,140
- Maybe with the Dyson sphere,

2695
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:49,170
you start to get, like, a little bit more type II.

2696
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:52,260
But it feels like if you have a type II civilization,

2697
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:54,090
it won't be just a Dyson sphere.

2698
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:55,380
- [Adam] Right.

2699
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:56,250
- It feels like that

2700
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,140
just for the same reason you mentioned,

2701
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:02,760
climate change, but now at the star system level,

2702
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,800
they're probably expanding, right?

2703
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,040
So how would you detect a type II?

2704
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,380
- How about propulsion plumes, right?

2705
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:11,878
If you're expanding, no, no-

2706
01:41:11,878 --> 01:41:12,975
- Yeah, that's great.

2707
01:41:12,975 --> 01:41:14,130
That's great. - I literally just put in

2708
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:15,990
a NASA proposal now.

2709
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:17,430
Thomas Beatty, who's joined us from,

2710
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:19,260
he's at the University of Wisconsin,

2711
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:22,683
has an idea to look for plumes, right?

2712
01:41:23,754 --> 01:41:27,113
If you have a solar system-wide civilization, right,

2713
01:41:27,113 --> 01:41:29,137
and you got space truckers going back and forth, right,

2714
01:41:29,137 --> 01:41:30,567
you know, from Mars to,

2715
01:41:30,567 --> 01:41:33,270
you know, they're doing the Enceladus run,

2716
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:35,550
they're accelerating and decelerating

2717
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:36,450
the whole way there, right?

2718
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:38,760
If you want to get to Mars in a couple weeks,

2719
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:42,720
you have your fusion drive on the entire way out there.

2720
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:44,047
You flip and burn and have it on,

2721
01:41:44,047 --> 01:41:46,590
you know, so you're also always have gravity,

2722
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:47,850
you have thrust gravity.

2723
01:41:47,850 --> 01:41:50,760
So would those plumes be detectable?

2724
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,860
'Cause now you've got spaceships going all over the place,

2725
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:54,090
and the odds that like, you know,

2726
01:41:54,090 --> 01:41:56,760
the plume is gonna cross your field of view

2727
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,110
could become pretty high.

2728
01:41:58,110 --> 01:42:01,530
So yeah, I think that's a good way of looking for,

2729
01:42:01,530 --> 01:42:04,710
that's one idea of looking for,

2730
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:08,130
you know, large-scale, interplanetary,

2731
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:11,370
which is kind of, like, when you're getting to a type II.

2732
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:13,470
Another possibility is looking for the tailings

2733
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:14,670
of asteroid mining.

2734
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:18,690
This was an idea, it was a group at Harvard Smithsonian,

2735
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:20,430
that, you know, to be able to look for,

2736
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:22,230
if you're really chewing up asteroids

2737
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:23,880
to build space habitats,

2738
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:26,310
can, you know, there'd be dust particles left around,

2739
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:28,980
and would they look different from just, say, the dust,

2740
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:30,900
you know, from just regular collisions?

2741
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,610
- So pollution of all different kinds.

2742
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:33,660
- Pollution of all different kinds.

2743
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:34,860
- And trash also.

2744
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,540
- Okay, so trash is an interesting idea

2745
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:39,630
when you come to the actual solar system, right?

2746
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:42,540
There's a whole other field of technosignatures,

2747
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:44,520
which are things in the solar system.

2748
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:48,300
What if somebody came by a billion years ago, you know,

2749
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,670
and left some stuff, right?

2750
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:52,680
So the Earth has been showing biosignatures

2751
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:53,513
for billions of years.

2752
01:42:53,513 --> 01:42:57,150
And you know, a species like us looking at our level,

2753
01:42:57,150 --> 01:42:59,040
looking at Earth, would've been able to know

2754
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,200
that Earth had life on it,

2755
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:03,540
had a biosphere, for billions of years.

2756
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:06,150
So maybe somebody sent something by, you know,

2757
01:43:06,150 --> 01:43:07,770
a half a billion years ago.

2758
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:11,580
So this idea of looking, say, at the moon

2759
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:14,640
for artifacts that have been there for a long time

2760
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:17,220
is something that people, a number of people are doing.

2761
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:19,380
We're just working on a paper where we just calculated,

2762
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,430
this was super fun,

2763
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:25,410
we calculated how long would the Lunar Lander exist

2764
01:43:25,410 --> 01:43:27,360
on the moon before micrometeorites

2765
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,770
just chewed it down, right?

2766
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:30,210
How long would you be able to land on the moon

2767
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:31,992
and go, oh, look, there's, you know,

2768
01:43:31,992 --> 01:43:34,950
somebody was here and left some debris.

2769
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:36,480
So there's this process called gardening,

2770
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,830
which is just the micrometeorite,

2771
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:39,792
constant rain of micrometeorites.

2772
01:43:39,792 --> 01:43:42,120
You know, and that's where you get the lunar regolith,

2773
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:45,720
that fine powder on the moon is because of this gardening.

2774
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:48,900
And it turns out it is literally hundreds of millions

2775
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:50,040
to billions of years-

2776
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:50,890
- [Lex] Oh, nice.

2777
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:54,780
- Yeah, that the Lunar Lander will be visible.

2778
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:57,450
- Oh, so we should be able to find artifacts.

2779
01:43:57,450 --> 01:43:59,280
- Yeah, if there are artifacts on,

2780
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,660
and people have proposed doing this

2781
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:02,767
with artificial intelligence.

2782
01:44:02,767 --> 01:44:04,800
You know, the moon has been mapped down

2783
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,170
to, like, a couple of meters with various probes,

2784
01:44:07,170 --> 01:44:08,400
and all that data's sitting there.

2785
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,560
So why not use machine learning

2786
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,060
to, like, look through all those things

2787
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:15,600
and look for anything that looks not like the lunar surface?

2788
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,140
And they did a test program where they gave the computer,

2789
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:20,070
you know, sort of, like, I don't know,

2790
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:22,410
50 miles around the Apollo 11,

2791
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:24,540
or Apollo, maybe it was Apollo 17 site.

2792
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:27,420
And it instantly was able to pull out the Lander.

2793
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:29,340
- I mean, the whole task of looking for anomalies,

2794
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,590
something that looks not like the lunar surface,

2795
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:34,470
you make it sound obvious, but it's not exactly obvious.

2796
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:38,013
Like, anomalies is really not,

2797
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,740
I mean, detect something

2798
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:43,140
that doesn't look right about this room.

2799
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,400
It's actually really difficult.

2800
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,810
- Really difficult. It's really difficult.

2801
01:44:45,810 --> 01:44:46,643
And you know what's cool,

2802
01:44:46,643 --> 01:44:49,980
it's a really information-theoretic kind of proposal.

2803
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:51,720
You really have to use information theory

2804
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,640
to say, like, what's the background?

2805
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,170
You know, how do I define something

2806
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:58,380
that I can say, "That looks weird," so.

2807
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:00,360
- Yeah, maybe when you are looking at a spectrograph

2808
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:03,363
or something, like, it's still, like,

2809
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:07,530
it's gonna look really weird, potentially.

2810
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:10,410
Like, we're kind of hypothesizing

2811
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:12,060
all the things that humans would build,

2812
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:13,780
and how do we detect that?

2813
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:15,480
But there could be really weird stuff.

2814
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:16,770
- That's why there's this emphasis now

2815
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:19,530
on these agnostic signatures, right?

2816
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:22,140
So actually, disequilibrium is a nice one.

2817
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:24,990
One way to define life is it is a system

2818
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:26,730
that is far from equilibrium, right?

2819
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:27,900
It's alive, right?

2820
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:30,900
'Cause as soon as it dies, it goes back to equilibrium.

2821
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:33,630
And so you can look at all chemicals in an atmosphere,

2822
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:35,460
even if you don't know whether these could be chemicals

2823
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:36,300
that you have no idea whether

2824
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:38,010
or not they have anything to do with life.

2825
01:45:38,010 --> 01:45:40,320
But the degree of disequilibrium,

2826
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,817
the degree to which they show that that atmosphere has not,

2827
01:45:42,817 --> 01:45:45,240
you know, the chemicals have not all kind of, like,

2828
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:48,060
just gone down to, you know, they've all reacted away

2829
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:49,650
to an equilibrium state,

2830
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:51,900
you can actually tell that in very general ways

2831
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:54,480
using what's called the Gibbs free energy.

2832
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,890
And that's kind of a signature.

2833
01:45:55,890 --> 01:45:57,300
Like, if you see an atmosphere

2834
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:00,570
that is wildly out of equilibrium,

2835
01:46:00,570 --> 01:46:01,590
you know, that indicates

2836
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:04,140
that there's something happening on that planet,

2837
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:06,180
biosphere or technosphere,

2838
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:08,613
that is pumping gases, you know,

2839
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:11,010
into the atmosphere

2840
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:13,440
that is keeping the whole system from relaxing.

2841
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:17,460
- So is it possible we can detect anomalies in spacetime?

2842
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,570
- Well, you could detect,

2843
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:20,267
and there's been some work on this,

2844
01:46:20,267 --> 01:46:21,510
like, with the Alcubierre drive,

2845
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:23,880
you know, these proposals for warp drives,

2846
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:24,990
and we can talk about that later.

2847
01:46:24,990 --> 01:46:27,416
I'm skeptical of those,

2848
01:46:27,416 --> 01:46:28,620
'cause it may really be possible,

2849
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:30,450
you just can't go faster on the speed of light.

2850
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:32,670
But people have done work on, like, you know,

2851
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:37,470
what would be the signature of an Alcubierre drive?

2852
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:39,180
What would be the signature,

2853
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:40,560
like, you know, could you detect,

2854
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,210
if you're using a drive like that,

2855
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:44,070
then you certainly are distorting spacetime,

2856
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:46,830
which means any light that's passing by has gotten,

2857
01:46:46,830 --> 01:46:49,350
you know, its trajectory has gotten altered

2858
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:51,870
because it had to pass through the distorted spacetime.

2859
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:54,498
So yeah, there are possibilities along with that.

2860
01:46:54,498 --> 01:46:55,470
You know, one of the funny things,

2861
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:56,580
I don't know if they've gotten past this,

2862
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:58,020
but somebody calculated the problem

2863
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:00,180
with the Alcubierre drive or this warp drive,

2864
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,730
was that if you dropped out of warp,

2865
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:05,160
there would be this spray of gamma rays

2866
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:08,040
that would, like, sterilize any planet in front of you.

2867
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,030
So it's like, well,

2868
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:10,440
yeah, you probably don't want to do that,

2869
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:13,320
but that would be a great bio, or technosignature.

2870
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,030
Ah, another planet obliterated.

2871
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:16,891
- So you think it's not possible to travel faster

2872
01:47:16,891 --> 01:47:18,180
than speed of light? - I wouldn't say that.

2873
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:19,220
I wouldn't say that, but what I think, you know,

2874
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:22,827
if you look at the physics we understand, right,

2875
01:47:22,827 --> 01:47:25,800
you know, every possibility

2876
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,890
for faster-than-light travel really relies

2877
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:30,810
on something that doesn't exist, right?

2878
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:34,290
So, you know, the cool thing is Einstein's field equations,

2879
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:35,850
you can actually play with them.

2880
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:36,690
The equations are right there.

2881
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:38,580
You can add things to the, you know,

2882
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:41,130
right or left-hand side that allow you

2883
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:43,350
to get something like the Alcubierre drive

2884
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:45,360
that was a metric that, you know, showed you, like,

2885
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,340
oh, it's a warped bubble.

2886
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:48,840
It's a warping of spacetime

2887
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,120
that moves through spacetime faster

2888
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:52,650
than the speed of light, right?

2889
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:55,830
Because nothing can move across spacetime faster

2890
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:56,663
than the speed of light,

2891
01:47:56,663 --> 01:47:59,220
but spacetime itself can move faster

2892
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:00,450
than the speed of light.

2893
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,910
But here's the problem with all of those proposals,

2894
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:03,900
is they all need something,

2895
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,960
the thing you added, the little fictional term you added

2896
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,410
into the equations is something called exotic matter,

2897
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:11,430
And it doesn't exist.

2898
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:12,960
It's really just something we dreamed up

2899
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,810
to make the equation to do what we wanted them to do.

2900
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:18,810
So, you know, it's a nice fiction,

2901
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:20,707
but really, right now, you know...

2902
01:48:20,707 --> 01:48:24,750
You know, we live in this weird moment in history

2903
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:26,640
of the Great Acceleration where, like,

2904
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:30,270
the technology we use now is, you know,

2905
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:31,440
is completely different

2906
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,900
from the technology we used 10 years ago,

2907
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,970
is remarkably different

2908
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:38,640
from the technology from 100 years ago.

2909
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:42,390
But, you know, I remember playing "Assassin's Creed"

2910
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,460
where everybody's like, you know, what is it, 1200,

2911
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:45,900
and everybody's like, stab, stab, stab.

2912
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,130
And I was like, yeah, it's a great game.

2913
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:49,710
And then I got "Assassin's Creed II,"

2914
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:52,260
and it was 300 years later.

2915
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:54,360
And everybody's like, stab, stab, stab.

2916
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:56,190
And it was, like, 300 years,

2917
01:48:56,190 --> 01:48:57,630
and the technology hadn't changed,

2918
01:48:57,630 --> 01:49:00,390
and that was actually true for most of human history, right?

2919
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:03,660
You used your great-grandfather's tools

2920
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:05,880
because there was no need to have any other new tools,

2921
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,710
and you probably did his job.

2922
01:49:07,710 --> 01:49:10,620
So, you know, we could be fooled into thinking, like, oh,

2923
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,690
you know, technology's just gonna go on forever.

2924
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:14,460
We're always gonna find new advances,

2925
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:17,160
as opposed to sometimes things just flatten out

2926
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:17,993
for a long time.

2927
01:49:17,993 --> 01:49:19,800
So you have to be careful about that bias

2928
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:23,250
that we have living in this time of Great Acceleration.

2929
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:26,250
- Yeah, but also, it is a Great Acceleration,

2930
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:30,600
and we also are not good at predicting what that entails

2931
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,220
if it does keep accelerating.

2932
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:35,010
So for example, somebody like Eric Weinstein

2933
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:37,110
often talks about we underinvest

2934
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:40,950
in theoretical physics research.

2935
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:44,190
Basically, like, we're trying too hard

2936
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:48,090
for traditional chemical propulsion on rockets

2937
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:51,900
versus, like, trying to hack physics,

2938
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:53,970
sort of warp drives and so on,

2939
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:58,260
because it's really hard to do space travel.

2940
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,600
And it seems like in the long arc of human history,

2941
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,510
if we survive, the way to really travel

2942
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:04,530
across long distances

2943
01:50:04,530 --> 01:50:07,860
is going to be some totally new thing.

2944
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:11,310
So it's not going to be an engineering problem.

2945
01:50:11,310 --> 01:50:12,823
It's going to be a physics problem.

2946
01:50:12,823 --> 01:50:13,862
- A fundamental physics problem.

2947
01:50:13,862 --> 01:50:15,180
- Fundamental physics problem. - Yeah, I mean,

2948
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:17,100
I agree with that in principle,

2949
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:18,869
but I think there's been,

2950
01:50:18,869 --> 01:50:21,150
you know, I mean, there's a lot of ideas out there.

2951
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:21,983
You know, string theory,

2952
01:50:21,983 --> 01:50:23,370
people have been playing with string theory now

2953
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:25,050
for 40 years.

2954
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:26,460
It's not like people haven't been,

2955
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:28,174
not like there hasn't been a lot of effort.

2956
01:50:28,174 --> 01:50:29,610
And, you know, and again, I'm not gonna predict.

2957
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:32,070
I think it's entirely possible that we have, you know,

2958
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:34,350
there's, you know, incredible boundaries

2959
01:50:34,350 --> 01:50:37,170
of physics that have yet to be poked through,

2960
01:50:37,170 --> 01:50:39,600
in which case then, all bets are off, right?

2961
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,620
Once you get sort of,

2962
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:42,870
you know, fast interstellar travel,

2963
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:45,480
whoa, you know, who knows what can happen.

2964
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:48,180
But yeah, I tend to be drawn to,

2965
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:49,320
like, science fiction stories

2966
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,090
that take the speed of light seriously.

2967
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:53,430
Like, what kind of civilization can you build where, like,

2968
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:57,570
it takes, you know, 50 years to get to where you're going

2969
01:50:57,570 --> 01:50:58,680
and a 50 years back?

2970
01:50:58,680 --> 01:50:59,573
Like, so, I don't know.

2971
01:50:59,573 --> 01:51:01,680
I mean, yeah, there's no way I'm gonna say

2972
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:03,120
that we won't get warp drives,

2973
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:06,510
but as of right now, it's all fictional.

2974
01:51:06,510 --> 01:51:08,550
You know, it's barely even a coherent concept.

2975
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:10,680
- Well, it's also a really exciting possibility

2976
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:14,460
of hacking this whole thing by extending human lifespan

2977
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:17,970
or extending our notion of time

2978
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:20,580
and maybe, as dark as to say,

2979
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:22,980
but the value of an individual human life

2980
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:25,380
versus the value of life

2981
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:27,390
from the perspective of generations.

2982
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:29,280
So you can have something like a generational ship

2983
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,320
that travels for hundreds of thousands of years,

2984
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:34,000
and you're not sad

2985
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:37,740
that you'll never see the destination

2986
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:39,360
because you kind of have the value

2987
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:43,890
for the prolonged survival of humanity

2988
01:51:43,890 --> 01:51:45,280
versus your own individual life.

2989
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,880
- Yeah. It's a wild ethical question, isn't it?

2990
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,737
That book I told you about, "Aurora,"

2991
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:51,713
I love the book

2992
01:51:51,713 --> 01:51:55,080
because it was such a sort of inversion of the usual,

2993
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:56,580
'cause, you know, I love science fiction.

2994
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:58,560
I've read so many generation ship stories,

2995
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,700
and they get to that planet.

2996
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:01,770
The planet turns out to be uninhabitable.

2997
01:52:01,770 --> 01:52:04,080
It's inhabited, but it's uninhabitable for Earth,

2998
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:06,360
because, again, he has this idea of, like, you know,

2999
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:08,100
life is particular to their planets.

3000
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:09,780
So they turn around, and they come back.

3001
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:12,720
And then when they land, the main character goes,

3002
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:13,800
but there's still people who are, you know,

3003
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:15,540
arguing for more generation ships.

3004
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:17,700
And she goes, and she punches the guy out

3005
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:20,100
'cause she spent her whole life in a tube, you know?

3006
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:23,310
I thought that was a really interesting inversion.

3007
01:52:23,310 --> 01:52:24,600
You know, the interesting thing about,

3008
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,400
we were talking about these space habitats,

3009
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,830
but if you really had a space habit, not some super cramped,

3010
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:31,560
you know, crappy, usual version of a century ship,

3011
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:33,000
but if you had these, like, space habitats

3012
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,950
that were really, you know, like the O'Neill cylinders,

3013
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:37,410
they're actually pretty nice places to live.

3014
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:39,000
Put a thruster on those, you know?

3015
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,283
Like, why keep them in the solar system?

3016
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:44,100
Maybe space is full of, like, these, sort of,

3017
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:46,950
traveling space habitats that are, in some sense,

3018
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:49,530
you know, they're worlds in them in and of themselves.

3019
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:51,330
- There's the show, "Silo,"

3020
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:53,070
which raises the question of, basically,

3021
01:52:53,070 --> 01:52:55,263
if you are put on a generational ship,

3022
01:52:56,370 --> 01:52:59,640
what do you tell the inhabitants of that ship?

3023
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:00,810
You might wanna lie to them.

3024
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:01,643
- [Adam] Yeah.

3025
01:53:01,643 --> 01:53:03,033
- You might wanna tell them a story

3026
01:53:03,033 --> 01:53:04,920
that they believe. - Right, right.

3027
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:07,185
- Because there is a society, there's human nature.

3028
01:53:07,185 --> 01:53:10,110
It's like, how do you maintain a homeostasis

3029
01:53:10,110 --> 01:53:11,523
of that little society?

3030
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,540
I mean, that's a fascinating technical question,

3031
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:17,107
the social question, the psychology question.

3032
01:53:17,107 --> 01:53:18,990
- You know, the generation ship too,

3033
01:53:18,990 --> 01:53:20,430
and you know, which I talked about in the book,

3034
01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:21,307
the idea of also the,

3035
01:53:21,307 --> 01:53:24,240
you know, you talked about the extending human lifetimes

3036
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:27,030
or, you know, the stasis, the cryostasis,

3037
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:29,340
which is a mainstay of science fiction.

3038
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:30,337
You know, right, you can be put to,

3039
01:53:30,337 --> 01:53:31,830
you know, you can basically put

3040
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:33,240
in suspended animation and such.

3041
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:34,920
None of these things we know are possible.

3042
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:35,753
But you know what's so interesting,

3043
01:53:35,753 --> 01:53:36,840
and this is why I love science fiction,

3044
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,180
the way it's seeds ideas, right,

3045
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,530
all these ideas we're gonna talk about,

3046
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:41,730
because they've been staples

3047
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:43,680
of science fiction for 50 years.

3048
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,750
- I mean, the whole field of cryogenics.

3049
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:47,040
- Yeah, where are we at with that?

3050
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,690
- Yeah, i wonder what the state of the art is

3051
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:50,486
for complex organism.

3052
01:53:50,486 --> 01:53:51,319
Can you freeze? - How long.

3053
01:53:51,319 --> 01:53:54,240
- How long can you freeze and then unfreeze?

3054
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:56,250
Maybe, like, with bacteria, you could do freeze, unfreeze-

3055
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:57,120
- Oh, bacteria can last.

3056
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:59,130
This is the thing about panspermia, right?

3057
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:00,633
How long can,

3058
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:04,260
you know, how long can a bacteria survive

3059
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:05,520
in a rock that's been blasted,

3060
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,080
you know, if there's a comet impact,

3061
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,780
across, you know, interstellar distances?

3062
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:11,520
That does seem to actually be possible.

3063
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,200
People have done those kind of calculations.

3064
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:14,820
It's not out of the realm of possibility,

3065
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:17,520
but a complex organism, multicellular,

3066
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,010
multi-systemic, or multisystems, right,

3067
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:20,940
with organs and such.

3068
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:22,830
- Also, what makes an organism?

3069
01:54:22,830 --> 01:54:23,970
I mean, it could,

3070
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:25,830
you know, which part do you want to preserve?

3071
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:28,113
'Cause maybe for humans, it seems like,

3072
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:31,893
like, what makes a personality?

3073
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:35,643
It feels like you wanna preserve a set of memories.

3074
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:38,820
Like, if I woke up in a different body

3075
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:39,970
with the same memories,

3076
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,087
I would feel like I would be the same person.

3077
01:54:43,087 --> 01:54:45,870
- "Altered Carbon." That's a great series.

3078
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:47,310
I think it's on Netflix.

3079
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:49,020
It's, you know, that's a really great series,

3080
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:50,400
where that's exactly the idea of sleeves.

3081
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,810
Everybody's able to like, you know,

3082
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:54,060
you can re-sleeve in another body,

3083
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:56,490
and it raises exactly, sort of, this question.

3084
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:58,920
It's not the greatest cyberpunk, but it's pretty good.

3085
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:01,530
It's got some great action sequences too.

3086
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:03,420
- As we get better and better advancements

3087
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:05,550
in large language models

3088
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:09,423
that are able to be fine-tuned on you,

3089
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:11,850
it raises a question

3090
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:14,310
because, to me, they've already passed the Turing test,

3091
01:55:14,310 --> 01:55:16,826
as we traditionally have defined it.

3092
01:55:16,826 --> 01:55:18,360
So if there's going to be an LLM

3093
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,870
that's able to copy you in terms of language extremely well,

3094
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:24,030
it's gonna raise ethical

3095
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:25,890
and, I don't know, philosophical questions

3096
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:27,183
about what makes you you.

3097
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:32,610
Like, if there's a thing that can talk exactly like you,

3098
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:35,253
like, what is the thing that makes you you?

3099
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:41,220
It's gonna speak about your memories very effectively.

3100
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:44,700
- This leads us to, if we're gonna get to the blind spot.

3101
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,050
You know, I am of the opinion,

3102
01:55:46,050 --> 01:55:47,970
heretical, in some camps,

3103
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:49,698
that, you know, the brain is not

3104
01:55:49,698 --> 01:55:53,760
the minimal structure for consciousness.

3105
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,650
You know, it's the whole body.

3106
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:57,180
It's embodied and may, actually, in some sense,

3107
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:59,460
it's communities, actually.

3108
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:00,739
So yeah, so I don't...

3109
01:56:00,739 --> 01:56:02,010
I mean, you know, I could be wrong,

3110
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:03,720
but this is, you know, this is what this whole work

3111
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,820
that I did with Marcelo Gleiser and Evan Thompson,

3112
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:08,040
the philosophy of science,

3113
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:08,873
which is interesting

3114
01:56:08,873 --> 01:56:10,620
'cause it leads to this question about, you know,

3115
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:12,000
oh, maybe we should just download ourselves

3116
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:12,833
into computers, right?

3117
01:56:12,833 --> 01:56:15,330
That's another story that one tells.

3118
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:17,430
I'm super skeptical about those.

3119
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:19,860
But that's one of the narratives about interstellar travel

3120
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:20,790
is just like,

3121
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:23,640
and that anybody we meet is gonna be a machine anyway,

3122
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:25,590
whether it's downloaded bodies

3123
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:27,300
or it's just gonna be artificial intelligence.

3124
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:28,133
Like, there's the whole idea of,

3125
01:56:28,133 --> 01:56:30,870
how long does biological evolution last?

3126
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:32,580
Maybe it's a very short period

3127
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:34,290
before everybody, you know, goes to,

3128
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:36,780
or the machines take over in, you know, kill you.

3129
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:39,450
Or, you know, it's some hybrid.

3130
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:41,550
- What do you think aliens look like?

3131
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:43,410
So we talked about all the different kinds

3132
01:56:43,410 --> 01:56:46,200
of biosignatures they might leave or technosignatures,

3133
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:49,410
but what would they look like when we show up?

3134
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:52,560
Are they gonna have arms and legs?

3135
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:55,710
Are they going to be recognizable at all?

3136
01:56:55,710 --> 01:56:57,030
Are they gonna be carbon-based?

3137
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:59,010
- Yeah, so great question.

3138
01:56:59,010 --> 01:57:00,390
And this question gets to the heart

3139
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:05,010
of thinking about life, right, about what life is.

3140
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:06,810
And this is the physical part of that.

3141
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:10,590
There's also sort of the informational part of it.

3142
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:13,080
But let's just talk about the physical part of it,

3143
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:15,030
which is, you know,

3144
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:16,350
anything that we're gonna call life

3145
01:57:16,350 --> 01:57:18,630
is probably gonna work on Darwinian evolution.

3146
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:20,310
That's the nice thing about Darwinian evolution.

3147
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:22,500
Just like we know the laws of physics are general,

3148
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:24,930
the laws of Darwinian evolution are kind of this logic,

3149
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:26,110
this basic logic

3150
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,820
that, you know, anything we'd reasonably call life probably

3151
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:32,520
has to operate under these kinds of principles.

3152
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:36,090
And so, you know, evolution's about solving problems that,

3153
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:40,980
you know, to survive, that the environment presents,

3154
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:43,560
and the environment's always gonna present these problems

3155
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,690
in physical and chemical terms

3156
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:49,800
so that you expect a kind of balance

3157
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:52,590
between what we call convergence, evolutionary convergence,

3158
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:55,020
and evolutionary contingency.

3159
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:57,720
So, you know, if you've gotta move along a surface,

3160
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,807
you know, a surface between,

3161
01:57:58,807 --> 01:58:01,140
you know, hard surface and air,

3162
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:03,930
then the idea of some kind of jointed stick,

3163
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:05,820
right, legs, makes sense,

3164
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:06,667
that you're probably gonna trigger that.

3165
01:58:06,667 --> 01:58:08,490
You know, if you look at Earth's history,

3166
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:10,230
multiple times, multiple lineages

3167
01:58:10,230 --> 01:58:11,640
that had nothing to do with each other

3168
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,530
are going to solve the problem

3169
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:16,057
of getting towards energy sources using some kind of,

3170
01:58:16,057 --> 01:58:18,540
you know, a stick-like apparatus.

3171
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:19,920
- So that's about movement?

3172
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,342
- Yeah. So that's one problem that has to be solved.

3173
01:58:21,342 --> 01:58:22,290
The one problem that has to be solved is,

3174
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:23,820
I gotta get to food, right?

3175
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:26,310
Another problem is, I gotta get away from predators, right?

3176
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:27,990
You've seen wings. We've seen wings.

3177
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:30,180
The line that went through dinosaurs

3178
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:32,190
to birds involved wings.

3179
01:58:32,190 --> 01:58:35,670
Insects evolved wings. Mammals evolved wings.

3180
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:38,190
If the gas is dense enough that a curved surface,

3181
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:39,390
if you move through the curved surface,

3182
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:40,680
it's gonna produce lift,

3183
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:42,720
yeah, there you go, evolutional trip on that.

3184
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:45,960
So I think you can expect certain classes

3185
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:50,191
of solutions to the basic problems that life

3186
01:58:50,191 --> 01:58:52,050
is gonna be presented with.

3187
01:58:52,050 --> 01:58:54,063
Stay alive, reproduce.

3188
01:58:55,230 --> 01:58:58,200
But one of the weird things about, like, with the UFO things

3189
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:00,420
is that you always see like, oh, they all look like humans.

3190
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:01,680
They're just like basically humans

3191
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,300
with, you know, triangular heads.

3192
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:06,210
And that's where we get to contingency, right?

3193
01:59:06,210 --> 01:59:07,530
So what we've been talking about is convergence.

3194
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:10,110
So you expect that evolution will converge

3195
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:11,520
on wings multiple times

3196
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,673
when presented with the problems that wings can solve.

3197
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:19,530
But contingency is accidents, right?

3198
01:59:19,530 --> 01:59:20,700
That, you know, you've got something

3199
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:22,350
that's evolving a certain kind of wing,

3200
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:24,210
a leathery wing, right?

3201
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:25,800
And then, you know, the climate changes,

3202
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,660
and they all die out, end of story.

3203
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:30,390
Or, you know, an asteroid, a total accident, asteroid hits.

3204
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:32,190
And so contingency,

3205
01:59:32,190 --> 01:59:35,310
accidents play also a huge role in evolution.

3206
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:37,380
And one of the things that, you know,

3207
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:39,630
lots of evolutionary biologists have talked about

3208
01:59:39,630 --> 01:59:41,130
is the idea that if you ran the tape

3209
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:42,870
of Earth's history over again,

3210
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:44,760
would you get the same creatures?

3211
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:47,580
Now, Stephen Jay Gould was of the opinion

3212
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:50,130
that, no way, you wouldn't find anything on Earth

3213
01:59:50,130 --> 01:59:52,920
that resembled any species today.

3214
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:56,007
They've done experiments, actually, on this with E. coli.

3215
01:59:56,007 --> 01:59:57,630
You know, you take a bunch of E. coli,

3216
01:59:57,630 --> 01:59:58,920
you let them evolve for a while,

3217
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:01,680
you take a bunch of them out, freeze them.

3218
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:03,840
You know, let that population continue to evolve.

3219
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,830
The other one's froZen.

3220
02:00:04,830 --> 02:00:06,630
Now start it over again with the froZen.

3221
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:07,590
- [Lex] Mm-hmm.

3222
02:00:07,590 --> 02:00:10,710
- And it seems to be that contingency tends to win, right?

3223
02:00:10,710 --> 02:00:13,170
The contingency, at least from what we can tell,

3224
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:14,700
I mean, that's not a hard result.

3225
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:16,080
But in those experiments,

3226
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,120
what you find is that accidents really do matter.

3227
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,650
So the idea, and this is important,

3228
02:00:19,650 --> 02:00:22,170
so yes, you should expect legs

3229
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:23,520
or jointed sticks.

3230
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,163
How many joints they're gonna be, anybody's guess.

3231
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:28,890
You know, do you expect humanoids,

3232
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:30,060
you know, things with a, you know,

3233
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:32,580
a sensing apparatus on top of a shoulder

3234
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:34,350
with two arms and two legs?

3235
02:00:34,350 --> 02:00:37,140
That's probably a pretty random set

3236
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:39,180
of occurrences that led to that.

3237
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:43,430
- I guess what is a brain versus the nervous system?

3238
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:46,110
Like, where is most of the cognition, computation going on?

3239
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:47,820
- [Adam] Yeah. Yeah.

3240
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:49,380
- You could see that in organisms.

3241
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:54,240
Like, I actually had, I don't know how the brain evolve.

3242
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:56,100
Like, why does it have to be in one place?

3243
02:00:56,100 --> 02:00:56,933
- It doesn't have to be.

3244
02:00:56,933 --> 02:00:58,470
So my favorite word, word of the day,

3245
02:00:58,470 --> 02:01:00,330
is liquid brains, right,

3246
02:01:00,330 --> 02:01:02,400
this idea of distributed cognition,

3247
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,200
which fascinating idea.

3248
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:05,190
And we've come to understand

3249
02:01:05,190 --> 02:01:09,180
how much distributed cognition there is.

3250
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:10,950
Obviously, you social animals,

3251
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:13,650
like termites, et cetera, and ants,

3252
02:01:13,650 --> 02:01:15,390
that's an example of distributed cognition.

3253
02:01:15,390 --> 02:01:17,700
The organism is the whole colony.

3254
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:19,050
This is one thing that's been really interesting

3255
02:01:19,050 --> 02:01:21,600
in the state of the study for aliens,

3256
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:22,740
is that when we've come to recognize

3257
02:01:22,740 --> 02:01:24,003
that human intelligence,

3258
02:01:25,770 --> 02:01:27,780
the kinds of things that go into intelligence

3259
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:30,390
are distributed all across the biosphere.

3260
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:31,770
Lots of different examples

3261
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:35,340
of things show various pieces of what we have.

3262
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:38,040
Jason Wright described it as like a deck of cards.

3263
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,090
The cards are all there.

3264
02:01:39,090 --> 02:01:40,440
We got the hand that actually led

3265
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:43,500
to the kind of technological progress that we see.

3266
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:46,230
But the kinds of, you know, the basic idea of using tools,

3267
02:01:46,230 --> 02:01:48,570
the basic idea of recognizing each other eye to eye,

3268
02:01:48,570 --> 02:01:50,820
all the things that we define as intelligence,

3269
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:52,380
you can find many places

3270
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:55,080
in many other places,

3271
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:57,630
many other lineages across the Earth.

3272
02:01:57,630 --> 02:02:00,060
So they could be very, very different

3273
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,620
with something like, yeah, maybe it's, you know,

3274
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:04,050
the hive mind idea or, you know,

3275
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:07,620
bacterial colonies that actually managed to, you know,

3276
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:10,590
come to their own version of high cognition.

3277
02:02:10,590 --> 02:02:13,380
- Well, I wonder, if we stretch out time

3278
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:17,580
across tens, 20 billion years,

3279
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:21,240
whether there's an Darwinian evolution stops working

3280
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:23,880
at some point in terms of the biology

3281
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:25,410
or the chemistry of the organisms,

3282
02:02:25,410 --> 02:02:28,650
and it switches to ideas, for example.

3283
02:02:28,650 --> 02:02:31,560
Much more rapidly, you're operating, maybe,

3284
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,510
I guess it's a kind of Darwinian evolution

3285
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:35,910
on the space of memes or whatever as-

3286
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:38,727
- Technology seems to operate in, yeah,

3287
02:02:38,727 --> 02:02:41,340
but certainly markets can operate

3288
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:43,080
in ways that look very Darwinian.

3289
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:46,140
- So basically, a planet is working hard

3290
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:48,300
to get to the first kind of organisms

3291
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:53,300
that's able to be a nice platform for ideas to compete,

3292
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:56,037
and then it kind of stops evolving there,

3293
02:02:56,037 --> 02:02:57,093
and then it's ideas that take off.

3294
02:02:57,093 --> 02:02:59,430
- Right, right, 'cause, yeah, cultural, like, it's true.

3295
02:02:59,430 --> 02:03:03,990
It's amazing that cultural evolution totally disconnects

3296
02:03:03,990 --> 02:03:05,790
from the Darwin process.

3297
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:06,943
But I'd be careful to say that, like,

3298
02:03:06,943 --> 02:03:08,460
a planet is working hard to do this,

3299
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:10,500
'cause, you know, looking at us,

3300
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:13,410
like, what we think of is ideas and culture

3301
02:03:13,410 --> 02:03:15,450
and, you know, it's quite possible

3302
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:16,830
we're gonna make it another 200 years

3303
02:03:16,830 --> 02:03:18,030
and this is gone, right?

3304
02:03:18,030 --> 02:03:21,000
'Cause it actually wasn't a very good idea long-term.

3305
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:21,833
We just don't know.

3306
02:03:21,833 --> 02:03:24,810
- Oh, so maybe the idea-generation organism

3307
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:26,640
is actually the thing that destroys.

3308
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:28,800
- Not the biosphere, but it destroys itself.

3309
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,240
It may not be very long-term.

3310
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:33,120
It may be very potent for a short period of time,

3311
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:34,830
but that it's not sustainable.

3312
02:03:34,830 --> 02:03:35,663
It doesn't become,

3313
02:03:35,663 --> 02:03:36,870
like we were talking about before, mature.

3314
02:03:36,870 --> 02:03:38,880
It's very hard to integrate

3315
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:42,720
into a mature bio/technosphere.

3316
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,580
And of course, you know, evolution

3317
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:45,270
is not working for anything.

3318
02:03:45,270 --> 02:03:46,590
Well, here's actually interesting thing, right?

3319
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:47,790
So people are very much,

3320
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:49,800
you know, evolutionary biologists will get very,

3321
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:51,330
their hair will stand on end if you start talking

3322
02:03:51,330 --> 02:03:53,370
about evolution having a purpose or anything.

3323
02:03:53,370 --> 02:03:55,680
But the very interesting thing about purpose

3324
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:58,980
is that once you do get to a idea-generating species

3325
02:03:58,980 --> 02:04:00,693
or collective organism,

3326
02:04:01,770 --> 02:04:04,950
yeah, then, you know, kind of all bets are off,

3327
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:09,240
and there is goals, there is teleology.

3328
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:11,190
You know, there now suddenly, you know,

3329
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:13,260
absolutely, there's a direction implied.

3330
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:15,060
So that's kind of the cool, interesting thing,

3331
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:16,530
that once you get to that,

3332
02:04:16,530 --> 02:04:20,040
evolution stops being goalless and directionless,

3333
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:21,930
and suddenly, yeah, we're the ones who supply,

3334
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:23,340
or any kind of creature like us

3335
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:25,320
has an absolute direction that way they decide on.

3336
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:27,570
- Although you could argue that from a perspective

3337
02:04:27,570 --> 02:04:31,590
of the entire human civilization, we're also directionless.

3338
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:33,180
We have a sense

3339
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:37,830
that there's a direction in this cluster of humans,

3340
02:04:37,830 --> 02:04:39,000
and then there's another cluster

3341
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,500
has a different sets of direction.

3342
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,900
There's all kinds of religions that are competing.

3343
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:45,480
There's different ideologies that are competing.

3344
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:48,210
And when you just zoom out across,

3345
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:51,030
if we survive, across thousands of years,

3346
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:52,230
it will seem directionless.

3347
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:55,080
It will seem like a pinballs. - It's a mess.

3348
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:56,730
It's an unholy mess.

3349
02:04:56,730 --> 02:04:58,650
But, you know, but at some point, like,

3350
02:04:58,650 --> 02:05:00,630
the expansion into the solar system, say,

3351
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:03,120
like, that would be both,

3352
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:05,730
I mean, depending on how you look at it, it was directional.

3353
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:08,580
There was a decision that the collective

3354
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:11,100
of human beings made to, like, anti-accrete,

3355
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:13,260
to start spreading out into the solar system.

3356
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:15,660
So that was definitely a goal there.

3357
02:05:15,660 --> 02:05:17,857
That may have been reached in some crazy sort of,

3358
02:05:17,857 --> 02:05:22,489
you know, non-linear way, but it was still, right,

3359
02:05:22,489 --> 02:05:25,140
it's still a goal was set, and it was achieved.

3360
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:27,440
- If there's advanced civilizations out there,

3361
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:31,560
what do you think is the proper protocol

3362
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:32,880
for interacting with them?

3363
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:34,650
Do you think they would be peaceful?

3364
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:36,400
Do you think they would be warlike?

3365
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:38,910
Like, what do we do next?

3366
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:41,010
We detect a civilization

3367
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:43,710
through all the technosignatures we've been talking about,

3368
02:05:43,710 --> 02:05:46,710
maybe direct imaging, maybe there's really strong signal.

3369
02:05:46,710 --> 02:05:49,593
We come up with a strategy of how to actually get there.

3370
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:53,163
Then the generals says, they always do,

3371
02:05:54,090 --> 02:05:55,680
the military industrial

3372
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:57,632
complex broadly- - We've watched that movie

3373
02:05:57,632 --> 02:06:01,080
- What kind of rockets?

3374
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:02,400
And do we bring rockets?

3375
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,620
- Right, well, I think, you know,

3376
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:07,500
so this general question also leads to METI,

3377
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:09,750
messaging extraterrestrial intelligence.

3378
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,250
And I'm definitely of the opinion of, like,

3379
02:06:11,250 --> 02:06:13,620
you should be very careful, you know?

3380
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:15,480
Like, I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea

3381
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:17,373
to have your head below the grass.

3382
02:06:18,330 --> 02:06:20,100
You know, the people who advocate, like, oh, yeah,

3383
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:22,620
we should be sending, you know, powerful messages

3384
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:25,890
that are easily detectable into interstellar space,

3385
02:06:25,890 --> 02:06:27,090
I'm like, why would you?

3386
02:06:27,090 --> 02:06:27,923
'Cause we just don't know.

3387
02:06:27,923 --> 02:06:29,730
Like, I'm not gonna say they are warlike.

3388
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:31,920
I'm not gonna say they're not warlike. I have no idea.

3389
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:34,380
You know, but we sure as hell,

3390
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:36,270
well, first of all, who gets to decide that?

3391
02:06:36,270 --> 02:06:37,470
The idea that a bunch of astronomers

3392
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:39,810
who happen to have a radio telescope, I don't, you know,

3393
02:06:39,810 --> 02:06:41,790
who speaks for Earth,

3394
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:44,310
which I think was a great book somebody wrote.

3395
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:46,290
So, you know, definitely,

3396
02:06:46,290 --> 02:06:48,623
we should be cautious, I would say,

3397
02:06:48,623 --> 02:06:50,763
because we just have zero information.

3398
02:06:51,652 --> 02:06:52,485
You know, you used to have this idea

3399
02:06:52,485 --> 02:06:54,360
of, well, if they're advanced, they've managed to survive,

3400
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:56,190
so of course they're gonna be wearing togas,

3401
02:06:56,190 --> 02:06:58,560
you know, and be singing Kumbaya.

3402
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,720
But I just wouldn't assume that.

3403
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:01,650
It's also possible, though,

3404
02:07:01,650 --> 02:07:04,710
that, like, their cognitive structure is so different

3405
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:06,000
that we're not even living

3406
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,650
in the same universe in a certain way.

3407
02:07:07,650 --> 02:07:09,090
I think we have to be prepared for that.

3408
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:11,370
We may not even be able to recognize each other

3409
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:15,420
in some way as cognizing beings.

3410
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:17,520
One of my favorite movies is "Arrival."

3411
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,403
I don't know if you've ever seen that one.

3412
02:07:18,403 --> 02:07:20,280
I really love that one because, you know, they're literally,

3413
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:21,116
they have a different language,

3414
02:07:21,116 --> 02:07:22,740
they have a different cognitive structure

3415
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:23,573
in terms of language,

3416
02:07:23,573 --> 02:07:25,770
and they're literally kind of living in a different physics.

3417
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:27,770
- Different physics, different language,

3418
02:07:29,012 --> 02:07:31,800
different everything, but in the case of "Arrival,"

3419
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:33,900
it can at least, like, recognize

3420
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:34,733
that they're there. - They did.

3421
02:07:34,733 --> 02:07:38,940
And managed to cross the language barrier, yeah.

3422
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:42,120
- But both sides have an interest in communicating,

3423
02:07:42,120 --> 02:07:43,950
which you kind of suppose

3424
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:47,913
that an advanced civilization would have a curiosity,

3425
02:07:48,930 --> 02:07:50,340
because, like, how do you become advanced

3426
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:52,470
without a kind of curiosity

3427
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:54,780
about the mysterious about the other?

3428
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:57,000
- But also, you know, if they're long-lived,

3429
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,400
they may just be like, we're not even interested.

3430
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:00,990
Like, we've done this.

3431
02:08:00,990 --> 02:08:04,050
You know, 10 billion year,

3432
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:05,460
or sorry, say, 10 million years ago,

3433
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:07,170
we were really interested in this,

3434
02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:09,540
in communicating with you, you know, youngins,

3435
02:08:09,540 --> 02:08:10,650
but now we're not at all.

3436
02:08:10,650 --> 02:08:12,990
And that's just, you know, one of the beauties of this,

3437
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:15,210
again, is how to think about this systematically

3438
02:08:15,210 --> 02:08:18,360
'cause you're so far past the hairy edge, right,

3439
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:21,180
of our experience of what we know

3440
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:22,680
that you want to think about it, right?

3441
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:24,630
You don't wanna be like, don't know, can't say anything,

3442
02:08:24,630 --> 02:08:25,710
'cause that's not fun.

3443
02:08:25,710 --> 02:08:27,990
But you also have to sort of systematically go

3444
02:08:27,990 --> 02:08:29,910
after your own biases, right?

3445
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:32,730
So one of the things I loved about "Arrival" too was,

3446
02:08:32,730 --> 02:08:34,260
you know, Carl Sagan always had this idea, like,

3447
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:35,400
we'll teach them math.

3448
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:36,540
We'll teach them our math,

3449
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:38,130
then they'll teach us their math.

3450
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:38,963
And then, you know,

3451
02:08:38,963 --> 02:08:40,860
we'll be telling each other knock-knock jokes,

3452
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:42,870
you know, and swapping cures for cancer.

3453
02:08:42,870 --> 02:08:43,890
And you know, in the movie,

3454
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:46,050
like, they send a Carl Sagan guy in and a linguist.

3455
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:48,750
And the Carl Sagan guy fails immediately, right?

3456
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:50,010
And it's the linguist who understands

3457
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:51,570
that language is actually embodied.

3458
02:08:51,570 --> 02:08:53,520
Language is not just something that happens in your head.

3459
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,650
It's actually the whole experience.

3460
02:08:55,650 --> 02:08:57,270
And she's the one who breaks through.

3461
02:08:57,270 --> 02:08:59,231
And it just points to the idea

3462
02:08:59,231 --> 02:09:03,090
how utterly different the cognitive structures,

3463
02:09:03,090 --> 02:09:05,670
you know, of a different species should be.

3464
02:09:05,670 --> 02:09:08,400
So somehow we have to figure out how to think about it,

3465
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,320
but be so careful of our biases

3466
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:11,850
or figure out, like, a systematic way

3467
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:13,830
to break through our biases

3468
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:15,840
and not just make science fiction movies.

3469
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:16,860
You know what I mean?

3470
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:20,550
- Yeah, yeah, speaking of biases,

3471
02:09:20,550 --> 02:09:22,740
do you think aliens have visited Earth?

3472
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:24,630
You've mentioned that they could have visited

3473
02:09:24,630 --> 02:09:25,977
and started civilizations,

3474
02:09:25,977 --> 02:09:27,660
and we wouldn't even know about it

3475
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:30,780
if it was 100 million years ago.

3476
02:09:30,780 --> 02:09:32,670
How can we even begin to answer this question, whether-

3477
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:34,920
- Gotta look, gotta look. Gotta figure out ways to look.

3478
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:38,100
So you know, I mean, it's not high on my list

3479
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:41,130
of, you know, things that I think are probable,

3480
02:09:41,130 --> 02:09:43,980
but it's certainly, it needs to be explored, you know?

3481
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:45,270
And unless you look, you never know.

3482
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:47,370
So looking on the moon.

3483
02:09:47,370 --> 02:09:49,020
Where would we find,

3484
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:51,510
if aliens had passed through the solar system anytime

3485
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:54,720
in the last 3 billion years, where might we find artifacts?

3486
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,250
Where might artifacts still be around?

3487
02:09:56,250 --> 02:10:00,300
Earth, probably not 'cause of weathering and resurfacing.

3488
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:01,710
The moon's a good place,

3489
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:03,450
certain kinds of orbits, you know?

3490
02:10:03,450 --> 02:10:05,730
Maybe they parked a probe in an orbit that was stable,

3491
02:10:05,730 --> 02:10:07,047
so you gotta figure out which orbits, actually,

3492
02:10:07,047 --> 02:10:08,070
you could put something there,

3493
02:10:08,070 --> 02:10:10,020
and it'll last for a billion years.

3494
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:11,770
So those are the kind of questions.

3495
02:10:12,731 --> 02:10:15,600
Like I said, it's not high on my list

3496
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:18,630
of thinking this could happen, but it could happen.

3497
02:10:18,630 --> 02:10:19,800
Unless you look, you don't know.

3498
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:21,750
- What about, speaking of biases,

3499
02:10:21,750 --> 02:10:24,170
what about if aliens visiting Earth

3500
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:26,010
is the elephant in the room?

3501
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:27,570
Meaning, like, the potential

3502
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:30,420
of aliens, say, seeding life on Earth?

3503
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:32,411
- You mean, like, in that directed panspermia?

3504
02:10:32,411 --> 02:10:34,320
I've actually- - Directed panspermia

3505
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:39,000
or seeding some aspect of the evolution.

3506
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,530
- Like, "2001."

3507
02:10:40,530 --> 02:10:41,363
- Yeah. - Yeah.

3508
02:10:42,450 --> 02:10:44,490
You know, it's a great story.

3509
02:10:44,490 --> 02:10:45,840
But you know, always,

3510
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:48,150
with Occam's razor or whatever, with science,

3511
02:10:48,150 --> 02:10:50,040
if I can answer that question without

3512
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:54,840
that extra very-detailed hypothesis, then I should.

3513
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:58,470
And you know, the idea that evolution is a natural process,

3514
02:10:58,470 --> 02:11:01,290
that's what I would go for first, right?

3515
02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:04,170
It's so much easier to do it that way than adding,

3516
02:11:04,170 --> 02:11:07,620
you know, sort of, 'cause it's kind of deus ex machina thing

3517
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:09,090
of like, oh, then the aliens came down,

3518
02:11:09,090 --> 02:11:10,950
and they solved that problem that you're trying to solve

3519
02:11:10,950 --> 02:11:13,290
by just coming down and putting their finger on the scales.

3520
02:11:13,290 --> 02:11:15,370
- So to you, the origin of life

3521
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:19,680
is a pretty simple thing that doesn't require an alien.

3522
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,513
- I wouldn't say that.

3523
02:11:20,513 --> 02:11:21,390
It's not a simple thing,

3524
02:11:21,390 --> 02:11:24,300
but it doesn't, you know, I think...

3525
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:25,290
'Cause you know, all you're doing

3526
02:11:25,290 --> 02:11:27,630
is kicking the can down the road, right?

3527
02:11:27,630 --> 02:11:29,100
The alien's formed, right?

3528
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:30,510
So you're just saying like, all right,

3529
02:11:30,510 --> 02:11:33,930
I'm just kicking the can down the road to the aliens.

3530
02:11:33,930 --> 02:11:35,700
What was their abiogenesis event?

3531
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:38,160
- Well, so from a different perspective, I'm just saying,

3532
02:11:38,160 --> 02:11:41,010
it seems to me that there's obviously advanced civilizations

3533
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:42,450
everywhere throughout the galaxy

3534
02:11:42,450 --> 02:11:43,590
and through the universe

3535
02:11:43,590 --> 02:11:45,570
from the Drake equation perspective.

3536
02:11:45,570 --> 02:11:48,691
And then if I was an alien, what would I do?

3537
02:11:48,691 --> 02:11:50,340
(Adam laughing)

3538
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:51,570
You know, I've gotten a chance

3539
02:11:51,570 --> 02:11:55,710
to learn about the uncontacted tribes in the Amazon.

3540
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:57,090
I recently went to the Amazon.

3541
02:11:57,090 --> 02:11:59,100
You get to understand how they function.

3542
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:01,500
And how the humans in the Amazon

3543
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:05,130
that are in contact with the civilized world,

3544
02:12:05,130 --> 02:12:07,410
how they interact with the uncontacted tribes.

3545
02:12:07,410 --> 02:12:09,360
First of all, the uncontacted tribes

3546
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,730
are very violent towards the outside world,

3547
02:12:11,730 --> 02:12:13,920
but everybody else tries to stay away from them.

3548
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:15,360
They try to kind of protect them,

3549
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:16,860
don't talk about them,

3550
02:12:16,860 --> 02:12:19,440
don't talk about their location and all this kind of stuff.

3551
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,910
And I've begun to internalize

3552
02:12:20,910 --> 02:12:23,247
and understand that perspective of why you're doing that.

3553
02:12:23,247 --> 02:12:25,860
And if I was an alien civilization,

3554
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:28,407
I probably would be doing a similar kind of thing.

3555
02:12:28,407 --> 02:12:30,270
And of course, there's always the teenager

3556
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:32,850
or the troll who's gonna start messing with this stuff,

3557
02:12:32,850 --> 02:12:34,013
or the scientists.

3558
02:12:34,013 --> 02:12:35,533
You know? - Yeah, yeah. Right.

3559
02:12:35,533 --> 02:12:40,500
- And so from our perspective, yes.

3560
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:43,350
And if you're in "The Truman Show," like Occam's razor,

3561
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:45,840
but, like, also the Occam's razor

3562
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:48,750
from the perspective of the alien civilization,

3563
02:12:48,750 --> 02:12:52,110
we have to have the humility

3564
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:53,850
to understand that that interaction

3565
02:12:53,850 --> 02:12:56,100
will be extremely difficult to detect,

3566
02:12:56,100 --> 02:12:57,120
that it will not be obvious.

3567
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:58,890
- Right, I understand the logic of what you're saying,

3568
02:12:58,890 --> 02:13:00,480
but the problem for me with that

3569
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:02,460
is that, right, that, first,

3570
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:05,250
you have to assume that alien civilizations are common,

3571
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:06,540
which I'm not sure about it.

3572
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:08,730
Most of them may be dead, or they're not, you know,

3573
02:13:08,730 --> 02:13:10,800
like, while I think that life is common,

3574
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:12,240
and again, this is just my biases, right?

3575
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:15,360
So now the problem is, how do we sort out, sort of,

3576
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:18,450
you know, the biases we're bringing

3577
02:13:18,450 --> 02:13:20,300
or the assumptions we're bringing in,

3578
02:13:22,516 --> 02:13:25,470
you know, from the sort of causal chain

3579
02:13:25,470 --> 02:13:27,030
that comes out of that?

3580
02:13:27,030 --> 02:13:29,419
I would first want to try and do this without a,

3581
02:13:29,419 --> 02:13:31,380
like, you know, if we're looking about the origin of life

3582
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:32,760
or the evolution of life on Earth,

3583
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,440
I'd wanna do it just on its own

3584
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:36,933
without asking for this other layer,

3585
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:41,460
because it requires a bunch of these other assumptions,

3586
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:42,780
which also have their own, sort of,

3587
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:44,100
breaking of causal change.

3588
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,710
'Cause I don't really, like, the idea that,

3589
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:48,960
when you ask, what would you do if you were an alien?

3590
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:50,640
But again, like, alien minds

3591
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:53,550
could be so unbelievably different, right,

3592
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:54,750
that they wouldn't even recognize

3593
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:56,760
the question you just posed, right?

3594
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:57,888
'Cause it's just like, you know,

3595
02:13:57,888 --> 02:14:00,780
we have a very particular kind of cognitive structure

3596
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:03,780
or cognitive, you know, and we're very governed by,

3597
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:05,610
even if you went and talked to,

3598
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:06,607
this is an interesting thing to think about.

3599
02:14:06,607 --> 02:14:09,510
You know, if I could suddenly magically appear

3600
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:10,830
100,000 years ago

3601
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:12,360
and talk to a hunter-gatherer

3602
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:14,190
about their worldview and their motivations,

3603
02:14:14,190 --> 02:14:15,900
you know, I might find something that's, like,

3604
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:18,960
no resemblance to things that I think are sort of,

3605
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,460
oh, that's what naturally humans do.

3606
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:21,960
- Well, let me ask you this question.

3607
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:23,279
Let's together do the thought experience.

3608
02:14:23,279 --> 02:14:24,112
- Yeah. Yeah.

3609
02:14:24,112 --> 02:14:26,280
- If we either create a time machine

3610
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:28,770
that allows us to travel back and to talk to them

3611
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:32,110
or we discover maybe a primitive alien civilization

3612
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:37,800
on a nearby star system, what would we do?

3613
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:39,450
- Yeah. I think that's a great question.

3614
02:14:39,450 --> 02:14:40,410
I mean, so, you know, it's interesting

3615
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:42,480
how that even brings up the ethical questions, right?

3616
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:44,370
Let's say that, you know,

3617
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:46,050
we'd have to first sort of sort out,

3618
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:47,640
what are the consequences for them,

3619
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:50,190
and what do we feel our ethical responsibilities

3620
02:14:50,190 --> 02:14:51,270
are to them?

3621
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:54,270
- And also, sorry, from a capitalist perspective,

3622
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:56,939
what are we to gain from this interaction?

3623
02:14:56,939 --> 02:14:57,772
- Right, right, right.

3624
02:14:57,772 --> 02:14:58,770
Look at the way the missionaries,

3625
02:14:58,770 --> 02:15:00,540
you know, missionaries had these interactions

3626
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:03,060
because they thought converting them

3627
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:04,740
to whatever religion they were, you know,

3628
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:05,940
was the most important.

3629
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:07,320
That's what the gain was.

3630
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:11,400
So from our perspective, I mean, we'd have to sort that out.

3631
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:12,420
I think given,

3632
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:15,690
you know, if we're doing this thought experiment,

3633
02:15:15,690 --> 02:15:16,800
we are curious.

3634
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:19,200
And I think, eventually, we'd want to reach out to them.

3635
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:21,630
- Now, I think when you say we,

3636
02:15:21,630 --> 02:15:22,610
let's start with the people - You and me.

3637
02:15:22,610 --> 02:15:23,943
- In this room, right?

3638
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:27,900
I wonder who the dominant forces are in the world,

3639
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:30,360
because I think there's a lot of people...

3640
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:31,470
The military.

3641
02:15:31,470 --> 02:15:32,400
- Yeah.

3642
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,260
- They'll probably move first

3643
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:37,620
so they can steal whatever advantage they can

3644
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:39,060
from this new discovery

3645
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:42,720
so they can hurt China, or China hurt America.

3646
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,070
That's one perspective.

3647
02:15:44,070 --> 02:15:45,600
Then there's the capitalists

3648
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:49,530
who will see, like, the benefit and the costs here,

3649
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:51,390
and how can I make money off of this?

3650
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:55,020
There's opportunity here. There's gold in them hills.

3651
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:57,540
And I think the scientist is just not going to,

3652
02:15:57,540 --> 02:15:58,999
unlike the movies-

3653
02:15:58,999 --> 02:16:00,113
- We're not gonna get much say.

3654
02:16:00,113 --> 02:16:01,590
- [Lex] They're gonna put them-

3655
02:16:01,590 --> 02:16:03,240
- Hey, guys, we, uh, wait a minute.

3656
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:04,620
- They would engage, probably.

3657
02:16:04,620 --> 02:16:09,090
I mean, as a human society as we are now, we would engage,

3658
02:16:09,090 --> 02:16:12,119
and we would be detectable, I think.

3659
02:16:12,119 --> 02:16:13,242
- In our engagement.

3660
02:16:13,242 --> 02:16:15,360
- In our engagement. - Yeah, yeah, probably.

3661
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,750
- So using that trivial biased logic,

3662
02:16:18,750 --> 02:16:20,400
it just feels like aliens would need

3663
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:22,530
to be engaging in a very obvious way.

3664
02:16:22,530 --> 02:16:24,453
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3665
02:16:25,358 --> 02:16:29,970
- Just brings up that old direct Fermi paradox for me.

3666
02:16:29,970 --> 02:16:32,910
What do you make of all the UFO sightings?

3667
02:16:32,910 --> 02:16:37,530
- I am all in favor of an open, agnostic,

3668
02:16:37,530 --> 02:16:40,260
you know, transparent, scientific investigation

3669
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:42,420
of UFOs and UAPs.

3670
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:46,590
But the idea that there's any data that we have

3671
02:16:46,590 --> 02:16:50,430
that links UFOs and UAPs to non-human technology,

3672
02:16:50,430 --> 02:16:52,440
I just think the standards,

3673
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:55,740
none of what is framed to be the data lives up

3674
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:56,700
to the standards of evidence.

3675
02:16:56,700 --> 02:16:57,532
So let's just take a moment

3676
02:16:57,532 --> 02:16:58,920
on that idea of standards of evidence

3677
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,226
'cause I've made a big deal about this both,

3678
02:17:00,226 --> 02:17:01,058
you know, in the book

3679
02:17:01,058 --> 02:17:03,000
and elsewhere whenever I talk about this.

3680
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,740
So what people have to understand about science

3681
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:06,450
is we are really,

3682
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:08,400
scientists, we are really mean to each other.

3683
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:10,080
We are brutal to each other

3684
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:10,980
'cause we have this thing

3685
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:12,870
that we call standards of evidence.

3686
02:17:12,870 --> 02:17:15,809
And it's the idea of, like, you have a piece of evidence

3687
02:17:15,809 --> 02:17:18,120
that you wanna link to a claim.

3688
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:20,580
And, you know, under what conditions can you say,

3689
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,860
oh, look, I've got evidence of, you know,

3690
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:24,660
this claim X, Y, and Z.

3691
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:27,840
And in science, we are so mean to each other

3692
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:30,840
about whether or not that piece of evidence lives up

3693
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:31,887
to the standards that we have.

3694
02:17:31,887 --> 02:17:36,660
And we spent 400 years determining what those standards are.

3695
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:39,150
And that is why cell phones work, right?

3696
02:17:39,150 --> 02:17:42,240
If you didn't have super rigorous standards

3697
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:43,889
about, you know, what you think that's,

3698
02:17:43,889 --> 02:17:44,969
oh, this little antenna.

3699
02:17:44,969 --> 02:17:46,230
I've invented a new kind of antenna

3700
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:47,940
that I can slip into the cell phone,

3701
02:17:47,940 --> 02:17:49,709
and, you know, I can show you that it works.

3702
02:17:49,709 --> 02:17:51,460
You know, if you didn't have these standards,

3703
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:53,760
you know, you did, every cell phone would be a brick, right?

3704
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:56,610
And when it comes to UFOs and UAPs, the evidence you have

3705
02:17:56,610 --> 02:17:59,670
and the claim that though this shows that, you know,

3706
02:17:59,670 --> 02:18:00,719
we are being visited

3707
02:18:00,719 --> 02:18:04,530
by non-human advanced civilization

3708
02:18:04,530 --> 02:18:07,200
just doesn't even come close

3709
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:09,840
to the same standards I'm gonna have to obey

3710
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:11,010
or whatever, live under,

3711
02:18:11,010 --> 02:18:12,980
if my team, you know, the group I work with,

3712
02:18:12,980 --> 02:18:16,260
if one of them says, look, we've discovered,

3713
02:18:16,260 --> 02:18:17,580
wants to announced that, oh,

3714
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:20,490
we've discovered technosignature on an alien planet.

3715
02:18:20,490 --> 02:18:23,250
We're gonna get shredded, as we expect to be.

3716
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:24,990
We expect to be beaten up.

3717
02:18:24,990 --> 02:18:27,840
And, you know, the UAP, UFO community

3718
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,040
should expect the same thing.

3719
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:31,260
You know, you don't get a pass

3720
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:32,820
because it's a really cool topic.

3721
02:18:32,820 --> 02:18:33,809
So that's where I am right now.

3722
02:18:33,809 --> 02:18:35,940
I just don't think any of the evidence

3723
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:39,420
is even close to anything that could support that claim.

3724
02:18:39,420 --> 02:18:42,389
- Well, I generally assign a lot of value

3725
02:18:42,389 --> 02:18:44,820
to anecdotal evidence from pilots.

3726
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:47,070
Not scientific value, but just, like,

3727
02:18:47,070 --> 02:18:50,280
it's always nice to get anecdotal evidence

3728
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:51,974
as a first step

3729
02:18:51,974 --> 02:18:53,969
'cause, like, hmm, I wonder if there's something there.

3730
02:18:53,969 --> 02:18:55,559
But unfortunately, with this topic,

3731
02:18:55,559 --> 02:18:56,850
there's so much excitement around it.

3732
02:18:56,850 --> 02:18:57,750
There's a lot of people

3733
02:18:57,750 --> 02:19:00,990
that are basically trying to make money off of it.

3734
02:19:00,990 --> 02:19:02,370
There's hoaxes, all this kind of stuff,

3735
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:04,770
so even if there's some signal,

3736
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:05,820
there's just so much noise,

3737
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:07,320
it's very difficult to operate with.

3738
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:10,410
So how do we get better signal?

3739
02:19:10,410 --> 02:19:12,570
So you've talked about, sort of,

3740
02:19:12,570 --> 02:19:16,510
if we wanted to really search for UFOs on Earth

3741
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:21,360
and maybe detect things like weird physics,

3742
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:23,820
what kind of instruments would we be using?

3743
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:25,260
- Yeah, so, you know, in the book,

3744
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:27,360
I talked about the idea that, this is really stupid,

3745
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,370
but you know, you wanna look up,

3746
02:19:29,370 --> 02:19:30,990
you wanna look down, and you wanna look all around.

3747
02:19:30,990 --> 02:19:31,830
- I think that's brilliant.

3748
02:19:31,830 --> 02:19:34,440
I mean, it's simple, not stupid.

3749
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:35,580
It's, like, literally.

3750
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:38,459
- Yeah, right, so you wanna do ground-based detectors,

3751
02:19:38,459 --> 02:19:40,040
the, you know, upward-looking ground-based detectors

3752
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:42,540
of the kind we're already building for meteors, right,

3753
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:44,309
for tracking meteors.

3754
02:19:44,309 --> 02:19:45,990
You wanna have space-based detectors,

3755
02:19:45,990 --> 02:19:46,830
put them on satellites.

3756
02:19:46,830 --> 02:19:49,320
This is what the NASA UAP panel was thinking about.

3757
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:51,450
And then probably on, you know,

3758
02:19:51,450 --> 02:19:53,310
we have lots of people in the sky,

3759
02:19:53,310 --> 02:19:56,370
there should be detectors on the planes,

3760
02:19:56,370 --> 02:19:58,433
or at least, you know, some kind of alert system

3761
02:19:58,433 --> 02:19:59,730
that if a pilot says,

3762
02:19:59,730 --> 02:20:01,350
oh, look, I'm seeing something I don't understand,

3763
02:20:01,350 --> 02:20:02,700
boop, presses the red button,

3764
02:20:02,700 --> 02:20:04,740
and that triggers the ground-based

3765
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:09,180
and space-based data collectors.

3766
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:10,440
And then the data collectors themselves,

3767
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:12,210
this is something that people really don't understand,

3768
02:20:12,210 --> 02:20:13,890
and it's so important.

3769
02:20:13,890 --> 02:20:16,260
In order to actually do science with anything,

3770
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:17,760
the data you have,

3771
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:19,440
you have to understand where it came from,

3772
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:22,110
like, down to the, you know, the nth degree.

3773
02:20:22,110 --> 02:20:26,040
You have to know how that camera behaves

3774
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:27,660
in a bunch of different wavelengths.

3775
02:20:27,660 --> 02:20:29,130
You have to have characterize that.

3776
02:20:29,130 --> 02:20:31,680
You have to know what the software does,

3777
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:33,330
what the limits of the software are possible.

3778
02:20:33,330 --> 02:20:34,650
You have to know what happened to the camera.

3779
02:20:34,650 --> 02:20:37,470
Was it refurbished recently?

3780
02:20:37,470 --> 02:20:39,510
You know, in every spectral wavelength,

3781
02:20:39,510 --> 02:20:44,130
in all of its data collection and processing,

3782
02:20:44,130 --> 02:20:45,240
you have to know all of those steps

3783
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:46,710
and have them all characterized,

3784
02:20:46,710 --> 02:20:48,390
'cause especially if you want to claim, like, oh my God,

3785
02:20:48,390 --> 02:20:51,570
I saw something take a right-hand turn at Mach 500, right,

3786
02:20:51,570 --> 02:20:53,940
you better have all of that nailed down

3787
02:20:53,940 --> 02:20:55,890
before you make that kind of claim.

3788
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:58,500
So we have to have characterized detectors looking up, down,

3789
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:00,840
and maybe on planes themselves.

3790
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:02,490
We need a rational search strategy.

3791
02:21:02,490 --> 02:21:03,690
So let's say you wanna lay out

3792
02:21:03,690 --> 02:21:05,940
these ground-based detectors.

3793
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:07,050
Where do you put them, right?

3794
02:21:07,050 --> 02:21:08,670
There's only so much money in the world.

3795
02:21:08,670 --> 02:21:10,620
So, you know, do you wanna put them near places

3796
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:12,240
where you've seen a lot of things beforehand?

3797
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:13,500
Or do you want to, you know, have them try

3798
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:17,220
and do a sparse coverage of the entire country?

3799
02:21:17,220 --> 02:21:20,820
And then you need the data analysis, right?

3800
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:23,580
You're gonna have so much data, so many false positives

3801
02:21:23,580 --> 02:21:25,320
or, you know, false triggering

3802
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:26,430
that you need a way of sorting

3803
02:21:26,430 --> 02:21:27,870
through enormous amounts of data

3804
02:21:27,870 --> 02:21:29,070
and figuring out what you're gonna throw out

3805
02:21:29,070 --> 02:21:29,970
and what you're gonna keep.

3806
02:21:29,970 --> 02:21:31,470
And all these things we're used to doing

3807
02:21:31,470 --> 02:21:33,150
in other scientific enterprises.

3808
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:35,430
And without that, if we don't do that,

3809
02:21:35,430 --> 02:21:37,470
we're gonna be having the same damn argument

3810
02:21:37,470 --> 02:21:40,080
about these things for, you know, the next 100 years.

3811
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:43,110
- But if I asked you, I give you a trillion dollars

3812
02:21:43,110 --> 02:21:47,130
and ask you to allocate it to one place,

3813
02:21:47,130 --> 02:21:51,660
looking out, SETI, or looking at Earth,

3814
02:21:51,660 --> 02:21:52,493
which should you allocate to?

3815
02:21:52,493 --> 02:21:54,930
- Oh, God, looking out. Looking out.

3816
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:55,770
You know, as I always like to say,

3817
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:58,110
here's my codification of this.

3818
02:21:58,110 --> 02:22:01,290
If you said, "Hey, Adam, I'd like to find some Nebraskans,"

3819
02:22:01,290 --> 02:22:04,290
and I said, "Oh, good, let's go to the Himalayas,"

3820
02:22:04,290 --> 02:22:06,030
you know, you'd be like, "Why am I going there?"

3821
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:08,280
I'm like, well, you know, "Maybe there's some,

3822
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:09,357
you know, some Nebraskans in Himalayas."

3823
02:22:09,357 --> 02:22:11,400
You say, "No, no, let's go to Nebraska."

3824
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:13,380
If we're looking for aliens,

3825
02:22:13,380 --> 02:22:16,620
why don't we look on alien planets where they live?

3826
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:18,600
'Cause we have that technology now

3827
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:22,380
as opposed to the, you know, the bucket of assumptions

3828
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:23,640
that you have to come up with

3829
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:25,560
in order to say like, "Oh, they're here right now."

3830
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:26,880
You know, "They just happen to be here right now."

3831
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:28,307
And also, the very important thing,

3832
02:22:28,307 --> 02:22:30,183
I call this the high-beam argument,

3833
02:22:31,050 --> 02:22:32,580
you know, to deal with the UFO stuff,

3834
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:33,690
you have to deal with all,

3835
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:35,280
you have to answer these weird,

3836
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:36,630
irrational things that are happening.

3837
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:39,360
Like, okay, there's an advanced civilization

3838
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:41,820
that is visiting Earth regularly.

3839
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:43,560
They don't want to be detected.

3840
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:45,750
They've got super powerful technology,

3841
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:47,400
but they really suck at using it

3842
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:49,110
because we keep seeing them.

3843
02:22:49,110 --> 02:22:51,360
We keep seeing them, but then they disappear, right?

3844
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:55,830
I mean, explain to me what rational world that works under.

3845
02:22:55,830 --> 02:22:56,663
It's like...

3846
02:22:56,663 --> 02:22:58,230
You know, so there's that whole sort of argument

3847
02:22:58,230 --> 02:22:59,610
you've gotta explain, like, why,

3848
02:22:59,610 --> 02:23:03,480
if they want to stay hidden, are they so bad at it?

3849
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:07,620
So, you know, that's why I take that level of difficulty,

3850
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:10,020
and then I put it on top of, where should I look?

3851
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:12,733
I should look at the, you know,

3852
02:23:12,733 --> 02:23:14,850
I should look at where they're from.

3853
02:23:14,850 --> 02:23:17,133
That makes me wanna do the telescopic stuff.

3854
02:23:17,133 --> 02:23:20,310
- Yeah, I think the more likely explanation

3855
02:23:20,310 --> 02:23:24,450
is either the sensors are not working correctly

3856
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:27,600
or it's secret military technology being tested.

3857
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:29,160
- Absolutely, I mean, listen.

3858
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:30,960
That's why, again, I think UAP,

3859
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:35,253
you know, absolutely, UAP should be studied scientifically,

3860
02:23:36,570 --> 02:23:37,650
but if I had to make a bet,

3861
02:23:37,650 --> 02:23:38,557
and it's just a bet, I would say this is,

3862
02:23:38,557 --> 02:23:42,150
you know, this is pure state adversary stuff.

3863
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:45,480
I did a "New York Times" op-ed for this in 2021,

3864
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:46,730
which, you know, blew up.

3865
02:23:47,605 --> 02:23:48,438
And so, you know, I had a lot of,

3866
02:23:48,438 --> 02:23:50,100
you know, people talking to me.

3867
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:50,933
While I was doing that,

3868
02:23:50,933 --> 02:23:53,070
I sort of looked at the signals intelligence people,

3869
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:57,300
the SIGINT and EINT, electronic intelligence communities,

3870
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:58,203
and what they were saying about, you know,

3871
02:23:58,203 --> 02:24:01,770
the "New York Times" articles and the various videos.

3872
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:03,420
And really none of them were talking about UFOs.

3873
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:05,340
They were all talking about, you know, pure state.

3874
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:07,530
That's where I learned the word, pure state adversaries.

3875
02:24:07,530 --> 02:24:10,590
How, like even simple drone technologies, you can,

3876
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:12,360
you know, and you purposely wanna do this.

3877
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:15,660
You want to fake, you know, signals

3878
02:24:15,660 --> 02:24:20,010
into the electronics of their adversary so they crank it up,

3879
02:24:20,010 --> 02:24:21,210
so then you can just soak up

3880
02:24:21,210 --> 02:24:22,950
all the electromagnetic radiation

3881
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:25,800
and know exactly what those advanced radars can do.

3882
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:28,471
- That said, I'm not saying that that's what this is.

3883
02:24:28,471 --> 02:24:31,740
If I was the head of an alien civilization

3884
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:32,770
and I chose

3885
02:24:34,786 --> 02:24:37,178
to minimize the amount of contact I'm doing,

3886
02:24:37,178 --> 02:24:40,560
I would try to figure out, what would these humans,

3887
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:43,563
what would these aliens like to see?

3888
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:48,390
That's why, like, the big heads in the humanoid form.

3889
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:50,130
like, I mean, that's kind of, like,

3890
02:24:50,130 --> 02:24:52,020
how I would approach communication.

3891
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:55,412
If I was much more intelligent, I would observe them enough.

3892
02:24:55,412 --> 02:24:57,240
It's like, all right, if I wanted to communicate

3893
02:24:57,240 --> 02:25:00,630
with an ant colony, I would observe it long enough

3894
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:03,363
to see, what are the basic elements of communication?

3895
02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:05,670
And maybe I would do a trivial thing,

3896
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:07,575
like, do, like, a fake ant

3897
02:25:07,575 --> 02:25:08,580
in there. - Right, a robot ant.

3898
02:25:08,580 --> 02:25:09,780
- A robot ant,

3899
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:11,850
but then it's not enough to just do a robot ant.

3900
02:25:11,850 --> 02:25:12,990
You have to do a robot ant

3901
02:25:12,990 --> 02:25:15,030
that, like, moves in the way they do.

3902
02:25:15,030 --> 02:25:18,510
And maybe aliens are just shitty at doing the robot ants.

3903
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:20,280
But no, I do sort of,

3904
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:21,173
I just wanted to make the case for that.

3905
02:25:21,173 --> 02:25:22,550
- This is the plot, actually,

3906
02:25:22,550 --> 02:25:26,220
of a great science fiction book called "Eon" by Greg Bear.

3907
02:25:26,220 --> 02:25:27,337
And the idea was, like, these sort of,

3908
02:25:27,337 --> 02:25:30,510
you know, this is actually where my first,

3909
02:25:30,510 --> 02:25:34,410
I became sort of a more than agnostic anti-METI,

3910
02:25:34,410 --> 02:25:36,780
because the idea is that, yes, our aliens come,

3911
02:25:36,780 --> 02:25:38,430
you know, they sort of make their arrival,

3912
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:40,320
and really their point is to get rid of us.

3913
02:25:40,320 --> 02:25:43,140
It's the dark forest hypothesis.

3914
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:44,760
And what they do is they sort of, literally,

3915
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:46,530
the way they present themselves

3916
02:25:46,530 --> 02:25:48,990
is in this sort of classic UFO thing.

3917
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:49,823
And they do it,

3918
02:25:49,823 --> 02:25:50,790
and they, you know, they arrive at the,

3919
02:25:50,790 --> 02:25:51,960
this was during the Soviet Union.

3920
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:53,610
They arrive at the USSR, they arrive in China,

3921
02:25:53,610 --> 02:25:55,133
and they're kind of faking us out

3922
02:25:55,133 --> 02:25:58,680
so that we never can organize ourselves against,

3923
02:25:58,680 --> 02:25:59,513
so it was really,

3924
02:25:59,513 --> 02:26:01,560
they did exactly kind of what you're talking about,

3925
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:03,930
but for nefarious purposes.

3926
02:26:03,930 --> 02:26:06,570
- Okay, let me ask the pothead question,

3927
02:26:06,570 --> 02:26:07,860
yet another pothead- - Yet another,

3928
02:26:07,860 --> 02:26:09,150
the whole conversation.

3929
02:26:09,150 --> 02:26:11,220
- I'm sorry. - Bongs before breakfast.

3930
02:26:11,220 --> 02:26:14,370
- It's science and pothead questions back and forth.

3931
02:26:14,370 --> 02:26:17,640
Okay, what if aliens take a form

3932
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:22,540
that's unlike what we kind of traditionally envision

3933
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:26,340
in analyzing physical objects?

3934
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:28,650
What if they take the form of, say, ideas?

3935
02:26:28,650 --> 02:26:31,830
What if, real pothead,

3936
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:34,140
if it's consciousness itself,

3937
02:26:34,140 --> 02:26:37,950
like the subjective experience as an alien being?

3938
02:26:37,950 --> 02:26:40,320
Maybe ideas is an easier one to visualize

3939
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:41,940
'cause we can think of ideas

3940
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:44,310
as entities traveling from human to human.

3941
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:45,300
- When, you know, I made the claim

3942
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:46,890
that the most important data,

3943
02:26:46,890 --> 02:26:48,960
that finding life, any kind of life,

3944
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:51,750
would be the most important discovery in human history.

3945
02:26:51,750 --> 02:26:53,280
And one of the reasons is, again, as I said,

3946
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:56,010
that, you know, if we're not an accident

3947
02:26:56,010 --> 02:26:57,600
and there's other life,

3948
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:58,950
then there's probably lots of other life.

3949
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:01,830
And because the most significant thing about life

3950
02:27:01,830 --> 02:27:03,780
is it can innovate, right?

3951
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:07,260
If I give you a star and,

3952
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:09,330
you know, tell you the mass and the composition,

3953
02:27:09,330 --> 02:27:11,190
you can basically pretty much use the laws of physics,

3954
02:27:11,190 --> 02:27:12,630
tell exactly what's gonna happen to that star

3955
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:13,620
over its entire lifetime.

3956
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:15,870
Maybe not the little, tiny details, but overall.

3957
02:27:15,870 --> 02:27:16,703
It's gonna be a white dwarf,

3958
02:27:16,703 --> 02:27:18,060
it's gonna be a black hole, end of story.

3959
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:19,680
If I gave you a single cell

3960
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:21,330
and said, what's gonna happen in a few billion years,

3961
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:23,820
you'd never be able to predict a giant rabbit

3962
02:27:23,820 --> 02:27:26,400
that can punch you in the face, right, a kangaroo.

3963
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:28,650
So life has this possibility of innovating,

3964
02:27:28,650 --> 02:27:29,910
of being creative.

3965
02:27:29,910 --> 02:27:32,250
So what it means is,

3966
02:27:32,250 --> 02:27:34,320
and that's a part of a kind of a fundamental definition

3967
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:35,460
of what it means to be alive.

3968
02:27:35,460 --> 02:27:37,230
It goes past itself.

3969
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:41,040
So give life enough time, you know,

3970
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:44,220
and what are the end result?

3971
02:27:44,220 --> 02:27:47,070
You know, like that's why I love science fiction so much.

3972
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:50,070
At some point, does life reach a point

3973
02:27:50,070 --> 02:27:52,710
where it climbs into the laws of physics itself?

3974
02:27:52,710 --> 02:27:54,300
It becomes the laws of physics,

3975
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:56,130
or, you know, these sort of lie

3976
02:27:56,130 --> 02:27:58,440
at the extreme limits of thinking

3977
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:00,510
about what we mean by reality,

3978
02:28:00,510 --> 02:28:03,723
what we mean by, you know, experience.

3979
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:05,760
But I'm not sure there was much

3980
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,930
we can do with them scientifically.

3981
02:28:06,930 --> 02:28:09,090
But, you know, they're open-ended question

3982
02:28:09,090 --> 02:28:13,050
about the open-ended nature of what it means to be alive

3983
02:28:13,050 --> 02:28:14,880
and what life can do.

3984
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:17,640
- Since you said it's the biggest question,

3985
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:19,530
which is an interesting thought experiment,

3986
02:28:19,530 --> 02:28:22,620
what is the biggest scientific question we possibly answer?

3987
02:28:22,620 --> 02:28:24,480
You know, some people might say about, like,

3988
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:25,950
what happened before the Big Bang,

3989
02:28:25,950 --> 02:28:29,193
like, some big physics questions about the universe.

3990
02:28:30,330 --> 02:28:31,833
I could see the argument for,

3991
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:34,230
you know, how many alien civilizations

3992
02:28:34,230 --> 02:28:36,840
or if there's other life out there.

3993
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:38,880
You wanna speak to that a little bit? Like, why-

3994
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:39,713
- Why is the-

3995
02:28:39,713 --> 02:28:41,880
- Why is it the biggest question,

3996
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:43,860
why is it number one in your top five, or?

3997
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:44,693
- I've evolved in this, right?

3998
02:28:44,693 --> 02:28:46,830
You know, I started off as a theoretical physicist.

3999
02:28:46,830 --> 02:28:49,020
I went into computational astrophysics

4000
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:50,910
and magneto hydrodynamics of star formation.

4001
02:28:50,910 --> 02:28:52,320
But, you know, I was a philosophy minor.

4002
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:54,420
I always had these, sort of, bigger questions

4003
02:28:54,420 --> 02:28:56,400
sort of floating around the back of my mind.

4004
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:59,580
And what I've come to now is the most important question,

4005
02:28:59,580 --> 02:29:01,650
for physics, is, what is life?

4006
02:29:01,650 --> 02:29:03,600
What the hell is the difference between a rock

4007
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:05,820
and a cell, fundamentally?

4008
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:06,653
And what I really mean by this,

4009
02:29:06,653 --> 02:29:09,210
and this is where I'm gonna go non-traditional,

4010
02:29:09,210 --> 02:29:13,110
is that really the fundamental question, is agency.

4011
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:15,570
What does it mean to be an autonomous agent?

4012
02:29:15,570 --> 02:29:17,640
How the hell does that happen?

4013
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:19,980
You know, I'm not a reductionist.

4014
02:29:19,980 --> 02:29:20,813
I'm not somebody who's just like,

4015
02:29:20,813 --> 02:29:22,170
"Well, you just put together enough chemicals,"

4016
02:29:22,170 --> 02:29:24,180
and bing, bang, boom, and, you know, it suddenly appears.

4017
02:29:24,180 --> 02:29:28,470
There's something that really is gonna demand a reception

4018
02:29:28,470 --> 02:29:30,477
of what nature itself is.

4019
02:29:30,477 --> 02:29:32,400
And so, yeah, black holes are super cool.

4020
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:33,840
Cosmology is super cool.

4021
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:38,340
But really, this question of, what is life,

4022
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:41,250
especially from by viewing it from the inside,

4023
02:29:41,250 --> 02:29:43,620
'cause it's really about the verb to be, right?

4024
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:46,920
Really, what is the most impressing philosophical question

4025
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:49,110
beyond science is the verb to be.

4026
02:29:49,110 --> 02:29:51,750
What is being, right?

4027
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:53,240
This is what Stephen Hawking said.

4028
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:55,980
He talked about, what puts the fire in the equations?

4029
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:57,000
The fire, right?

4030
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,520
The fire is this presence.

4031
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:00,960
And this is where it touches things like,

4032
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,070
you know, whatever you wanna say,

4033
02:30:02,070 --> 02:30:04,320
the sacred, spirituality, whatever you wanna talk about.

4034
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:08,310
My first book was about science and human spirituality.

4035
02:30:08,310 --> 02:30:10,590
So it's like, you know, so this question of life,

4036
02:30:10,590 --> 02:30:14,100
what makes life as a physical system, you know,

4037
02:30:14,100 --> 02:30:16,793
so different is, to me, much more,

4038
02:30:16,793 --> 02:30:18,720
'cause, you know, that's where being appears.

4039
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:21,300
Being doesn't appear out there, right?

4040
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:24,090
The only place that ever appears to any of us is us.

4041
02:30:24,090 --> 02:30:26,400
So, you know, I can do this kind of projection

4042
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:27,600
into this third-person thing,

4043
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:29,700
but nobody ever has that, that god's-eye view.

4044
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:31,142
That's a story we tell.

4045
02:30:31,142 --> 02:30:32,760
This is where, you know?

4046
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:36,870
This, between us, is where the verb to be appears.

4047
02:30:36,870 --> 02:30:39,300
- So this is something that you write about

4048
02:30:39,300 --> 02:30:40,770
in "The Blind Spot:

4049
02:30:40,770 --> 02:30:43,920
Why Science Cannot Ignore Human Experience,"

4050
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:46,060
sort of trying to pull the fire

4051
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:52,100
into the process of science.

4052
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:54,810
And it's a kind of critique of materialism.

4053
02:30:54,810 --> 02:30:56,640
Can you explain the main thesis of this book?

4054
02:30:56,640 --> 02:30:58,980
- Yeah, so the idea of "The Blind Spot"

4055
02:30:58,980 --> 02:31:03,780
is that there is this thing that is central to science.

4056
02:31:03,780 --> 02:31:05,760
So we're using the blind spot as a metaphor, right?

4057
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:07,710
So the eye has an optic nerve.

4058
02:31:07,710 --> 02:31:11,190
And the optic nerve is what allows vision to happen.

4059
02:31:11,190 --> 02:31:13,230
So you can't have vision without the optic nerve,

4060
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:15,120
but actually, you are blind to the optic nerve.

4061
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:16,410
There's a little hole in your vision

4062
02:31:16,410 --> 02:31:17,940
where the optic nerve is.

4063
02:31:17,940 --> 02:31:18,773
And what we're saying is,

4064
02:31:18,773 --> 02:31:21,330
is that science has something like this.

4065
02:31:21,330 --> 02:31:22,770
There is something that,

4066
02:31:22,770 --> 02:31:25,500
without which, science would not be possible,

4067
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:27,690
but that science, the way it's been configured.

4068
02:31:27,690 --> 02:31:29,370
And actually, when we mean the blind spot,

4069
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:31,710
I'll get into exactly what I mean, what it is,

4070
02:31:31,710 --> 02:31:33,690
but it's not really science.

4071
02:31:33,690 --> 02:31:37,260
It is a set of ideas that got glued on to science.

4072
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:40,410
It's a metaphysics that got glued onto science.

4073
02:31:40,410 --> 02:31:43,290
And so what is that thing? That is, what is the blind spot?

4074
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:45,480
It's experience. It is presence.

4075
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:47,370
And by experience, people have to be very careful

4076
02:31:47,370 --> 02:31:50,220
'cause I'm not talking about being an observer.

4077
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:51,390
You know, there's lots of words for it.

4078
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:53,010
There's direct experience.

4079
02:31:53,010 --> 02:31:56,910
There is presence, being,

4080
02:31:56,910 --> 02:31:59,700
the life world within the philosophy called phenomenology,

4081
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:00,533
there's the life world.

4082
02:32:00,533 --> 02:32:03,180
It's this sort of raw presence

4083
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:05,010
that you can't get away from until you die.

4084
02:32:05,010 --> 02:32:06,060
And then who the hell knows, you know?

4085
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:08,940
Like, you know, as long as you're around, it's there.

4086
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:10,860
And what we're saying is that that is,

4087
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:15,210
the way to say this, that is the precondition

4088
02:32:15,210 --> 02:32:17,697
for the possibility of science.

4089
02:32:17,697 --> 02:32:20,940
And the whole nature of science, the way it has evolved

4090
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:23,610
is that it purposely pushed that out.

4091
02:32:23,610 --> 02:32:26,430
It pushed that out so it could make progress,

4092
02:32:26,430 --> 02:32:29,190
and that's fine for a certain class of problems.

4093
02:32:29,190 --> 02:32:32,070
But when we try to answer,

4094
02:32:32,070 --> 02:32:33,090
when we try and go deeper,

4095
02:32:33,090 --> 02:32:34,860
there's a whole other class of problems,

4096
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:36,390
the nature of consciousness,

4097
02:32:36,390 --> 02:32:38,790
the nature of time, quantum mechanics,

4098
02:32:38,790 --> 02:32:40,350
that comes back to bite us.

4099
02:32:40,350 --> 02:32:44,250
And that if we don't learn how to understand

4100
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:45,930
that that is always the background,

4101
02:32:45,930 --> 02:32:47,940
that experience is always the background,

4102
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:49,940
then we just end up with these paradoxes

4103
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:53,243
that require this intellectual yoga to get out of.

4104
02:32:53,243 --> 02:32:55,180
- I think you give a bunch of examples of that.

4105
02:32:55,180 --> 02:32:57,750
Like, looking at temperature as a number

4106
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:58,890
is a very sort of objective,

4107
02:32:58,890 --> 02:33:00,160
scientific way of looking at that,

4108
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:02,190
and then there's the experience of the temperature.

4109
02:33:02,190 --> 02:33:04,200
- And how you build the parable of temperature,

4110
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:05,640
that we call it.

4111
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:07,080
So what is the blind spot?

4112
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:08,880
We use the term, it's a constellation.

4113
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:10,170
It's not just materialism.

4114
02:33:10,170 --> 02:33:11,520
It's a constellation of ideas

4115
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:13,740
that are all really, sort of, philosophical views.

4116
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:15,690
They're not what science says,

4117
02:33:15,690 --> 02:33:17,070
but because of the evolution

4118
02:33:17,070 --> 02:33:19,320
of the history of science and culture,

4119
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:21,180
they got, like, pin the tail on the donkey.

4120
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:23,100
They were sort of pinned on

4121
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:24,990
and to tell us that this is what science says.

4122
02:33:24,990 --> 02:33:25,823
So what is it?

4123
02:33:25,823 --> 02:33:26,880
One is reductionism,

4124
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:29,850
that you are nothing but your nerve cells,

4125
02:33:29,850 --> 02:33:32,130
which are nothing but the chemistry,

4126
02:33:32,130 --> 02:33:34,650
which is nothing but, you know, all the way down to corks.

4127
02:33:34,650 --> 02:33:36,360
That's it. So that's reductionism.

4128
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:37,500
The objective frame

4129
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:39,300
that science gives us this god's eye view,

4130
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:41,340
this third-person view of the world

4131
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:43,620
to view the world from the outside,

4132
02:33:43,620 --> 02:33:44,677
that that's what science, you know,

4133
02:33:44,677 --> 02:33:46,200
bequeaths to us that view.

4134
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:48,690
Physicalism, that everything in the world

4135
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:50,820
is basically made of stuff.

4136
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:52,920
There's nothing else to talk about, right,

4137
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:54,120
that that's all there is,

4138
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:55,860
and everything can be reduced to that.

4139
02:33:55,860 --> 02:33:57,510
And then also the reification of mathematics,

4140
02:33:57,510 --> 02:34:00,897
that mathematics is somehow more real than this.

4141
02:34:00,897 --> 02:34:02,220
And there's a bunch of other things.

4142
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:03,720
But all these together,

4143
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:06,900
what they all do is they end up pushing experience out

4144
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:10,140
and saying experience is an epiphenomena, consciousness.

4145
02:34:10,140 --> 02:34:12,060
I tend not to use the word consciousness

4146
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:14,010
'cause I think it get, you know,

4147
02:34:14,010 --> 02:34:15,450
it leads us in the wrong direction.

4148
02:34:15,450 --> 02:34:16,697
We should focus on experience

4149
02:34:16,697 --> 02:34:18,960
'cause it's a verb, kind of, in a way,

4150
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:20,700
or it's verb-like.

4151
02:34:20,700 --> 02:34:24,300
So yeah, and by being blind to that,

4152
02:34:24,300 --> 02:34:26,850
we end up with these paradoxes

4153
02:34:26,850 --> 02:34:29,760
and problems that really not only block science,

4154
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:31,770
but also have been detrimental to society as a whole,

4155
02:34:31,770 --> 02:34:33,450
especially where we're at right now.

4156
02:34:33,450 --> 02:34:35,490
- So you actually say that that,

4157
02:34:35,490 --> 02:34:37,620
from a perspective of detrimental society,

4158
02:34:37,620 --> 02:34:39,660
that there's a crisis of meaning

4159
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:42,210
and that we respond to that

4160
02:34:42,210 --> 02:34:43,770
in a way that's counterproductive

4161
02:34:43,770 --> 02:34:46,260
to these bigger questions, scientific questions.

4162
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:47,550
So the three ways,

4163
02:34:47,550 --> 02:34:48,900
the three responses you mentioned

4164
02:34:48,900 --> 02:34:52,230
is scientific triumphalism,

4165
02:34:52,230 --> 02:34:55,110
and then on the other side is rejecting science completely,

4166
02:34:55,110 --> 02:34:56,280
both on the left and the right,

4167
02:34:56,280 --> 02:34:58,710
I think the postmodernist on the left

4168
02:34:58,710 --> 02:35:01,560
and the anti-establishment people on the right,

4169
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:03,000
and then just pseudoscience

4170
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,790
that kind of does this in-between thing.

4171
02:35:05,790 --> 02:35:07,410
Can you just speak to those responses

4172
02:35:07,410 --> 02:35:08,820
and to the crisis of meaning?

4173
02:35:08,820 --> 02:35:12,240
- Right, right, so the crisis of meaning is that, you know,

4174
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:14,820
on the one hand, science wants to tell us

4175
02:35:14,820 --> 02:35:16,530
that we're insignificant, we're not important,

4176
02:35:16,530 --> 02:35:19,380
we're just, you know, biological machines,

4177
02:35:19,380 --> 02:35:21,450
and, you know, so we're basically

4178
02:35:21,450 --> 02:35:23,120
an insignificant part of the universe.

4179
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:24,390
On the other hand,

4180
02:35:24,390 --> 02:35:27,270
we also find ourselves being completely significant.

4181
02:35:27,270 --> 02:35:29,640
In cosmology, we have to figure out how to look

4182
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:32,340
from the inside at cosmology.

4183
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:33,510
We're always the observers.

4184
02:35:33,510 --> 02:35:35,430
We're at the center of this, you know,

4185
02:35:35,430 --> 02:35:37,083
collapsing wavefront of light.

4186
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:39,997
You know, quantum mechanics, it really comes in.

4187
02:35:39,997 --> 02:35:41,760
You know, the measurement problem

4188
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:43,020
just puts us front and center.

4189
02:35:43,020 --> 02:35:43,890
And we've spent 100,

4190
02:35:43,890 --> 02:35:45,060
some people have spent 100 years trying

4191
02:35:45,060 --> 02:35:47,670
to ignore the measurement part of the measurement problem.

4192
02:35:47,670 --> 02:35:49,320
So on the one hand, we're insignificant,

4193
02:35:49,320 --> 02:35:50,790
and on the other hand, we're central.

4194
02:35:50,790 --> 02:35:52,230
So which one is it, right?

4195
02:35:52,230 --> 02:35:55,680
And so this all comes from not understanding

4196
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:57,930
actually the foundational role of experience.

4197
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:01,260
We can't do science

4198
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:03,720
without already being present in the world.

4199
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:06,183
We can't reduce what happens in science.

4200
02:36:06,183 --> 02:36:08,070
It's some sort of formal,

4201
02:36:08,070 --> 02:36:10,290
a lot of it is about we love our formal systems,

4202
02:36:10,290 --> 02:36:11,460
you know, our mathematics.

4203
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:12,660
And we're substituting.

4204
02:36:12,660 --> 02:36:14,490
That's one of the things that what we,

4205
02:36:14,490 --> 02:36:17,010
there's two philosophers we really like who are heroes.

4206
02:36:17,010 --> 02:36:20,160
One is Husserl, who is a mathematician

4207
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:21,870
who invented phenomenology.

4208
02:36:21,870 --> 02:36:23,820
And the other is Whitehead,

4209
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:25,590
who's one of the greatest mathematicians

4210
02:36:25,590 --> 02:36:27,600
of the 20th century.

4211
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:28,550
And Husserl came up with this idea

4212
02:36:28,550 --> 02:36:30,570
of the surreptitious substitution.

4213
02:36:30,570 --> 02:36:34,170
Part of the blind spot is substituting a formal system,

4214
02:36:34,170 --> 02:36:37,560
a calculus of, you know, data for actual experience,

4215
02:36:37,560 --> 02:36:39,597
that that's more important.

4216
02:36:39,597 --> 02:36:42,510
And so let me just do, before I go to those three responses,

4217
02:36:42,510 --> 02:36:43,890
let's just do the parable of temperature

4218
02:36:43,890 --> 02:36:47,163
'cause I think it'll help them understand what we mean.

4219
02:36:48,270 --> 02:36:52,080
So think about degrees Celsius, right?

4220
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:54,060
In the modern scientific culture we live in,

4221
02:36:54,060 --> 02:36:56,190
we think like, oh, yeah, degrees Celsius, they're out there.

4222
02:36:56,190 --> 02:37:00,270
You know, a molecular cloud in space is 10 degrees,

4223
02:37:00,270 --> 02:37:01,233
you know, Kelvin.

4224
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:05,760
The way we got there is we've forgotten

4225
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:09,000
how that idea is rooted in experience, right?

4226
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,920
We started off with science,

4227
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:13,500
we had the subjective experience of hot and cold.

4228
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:17,250
I feel hot, I feel cold. You feel hot, you feel cold.

4229
02:37:17,250 --> 02:37:18,810
Science was this process of trying

4230
02:37:18,810 --> 02:37:21,930
to extract from those experiences

4231
02:37:21,930 --> 02:37:23,640
what Michel Bitbol, philosopher,

4232
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:25,200
calls the structural invariance,

4233
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:28,110
the things that like we could both, kind of, do agree on.

4234
02:37:28,110 --> 02:37:29,790
So, you know, we figured out like, oh,

4235
02:37:29,790 --> 02:37:31,920
we could make a gradiated little cylinder

4236
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:32,940
that's got mercury in it,

4237
02:37:32,940 --> 02:37:36,795
and that, you know, hot things will be higher in that,

4238
02:37:36,795 --> 02:37:38,310
you know, on that gradiated cylinder,

4239
02:37:38,310 --> 02:37:39,840
cold things will be lower,

4240
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:41,190
and we can both kind of figure out

4241
02:37:41,190 --> 02:37:44,670
what we're gonna agree on are our standards for that.

4242
02:37:44,670 --> 02:37:46,230
And then we have thermometry, yay.

4243
02:37:46,230 --> 02:37:47,220
We have a way of sort of, like,

4244
02:37:47,220 --> 02:37:48,680
having a structural invariant

4245
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:53,250
of this sort of very personal experience of hot or cold.

4246
02:37:53,250 --> 02:37:54,083
And then from that,

4247
02:37:54,083 --> 02:37:55,980
we can come up with thermodynamics, et cetera.

4248
02:37:55,980 --> 02:37:58,508
And then we end up at the bottom of,

4249
02:37:58,508 --> 02:37:59,730
you know, at the end of that

4250
02:37:59,730 --> 02:38:00,957
with this idea of, like, everyday, I wake up,

4251
02:38:00,957 --> 02:38:01,950
and I check my phone,

4252
02:38:01,950 --> 02:38:03,180
and I'm like, "Oh, it's gonna be, you know,

4253
02:38:03,180 --> 02:38:04,710
60 degrees out, great."

4254
02:38:04,710 --> 02:38:06,750
And we start thinking that 60 degrees

4255
02:38:06,750 --> 02:38:09,780
is more real than hot and cold, that thermodynamics,

4256
02:38:09,780 --> 02:38:12,360
the whole formal structure of thermodynamics,

4257
02:38:12,360 --> 02:38:15,420
is more real than the basic experience

4258
02:38:15,420 --> 02:38:18,510
of hot and cold that it came from, you know?

4259
02:38:18,510 --> 02:38:22,260
It required that bodily experience,

4260
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:23,910
that also, not just me, you.

4261
02:38:23,910 --> 02:38:25,980
You know, it's part of my communication with you.

4262
02:38:25,980 --> 02:38:27,600
Cold today, isn't it? Right?

4263
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:31,080
That from that basic irreducible experience

4264
02:38:31,080 --> 02:38:32,160
of being in the world,

4265
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:34,320
you know, with everything that it involves,

4266
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:36,750
I developed degrees celsius,

4267
02:38:36,750 --> 02:38:38,070
but then I forgot about it.

4268
02:38:38,070 --> 02:38:39,180
I forgot the experience.

4269
02:38:39,180 --> 02:38:41,370
So that's called the amnesia of experience.

4270
02:38:41,370 --> 02:38:44,580
So that's what we mean by the, you know,

4271
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:47,160
how the blind spot emerges,

4272
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:49,920
how science purposely pushes experience out of the way

4273
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:51,120
so it can make progress,

4274
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:54,810
but then it forgets that experience was important.

4275
02:38:54,810 --> 02:38:56,910
So where does this show up?

4276
02:38:56,910 --> 02:38:58,110
You know, what are the responses

4277
02:38:58,110 --> 02:38:59,430
to trying to get this back in

4278
02:38:59,430 --> 02:39:01,830
and where this crisis of meaning emerge.

4279
02:39:01,830 --> 02:39:03,900
So scientific triumphalism is the idea

4280
02:39:03,900 --> 02:39:06,390
that the only thing that's true for us

4281
02:39:06,390 --> 02:39:08,490
are scientific truths, right?

4282
02:39:08,490 --> 02:39:10,620
Unless it can be codified in a formal system

4283
02:39:10,620 --> 02:39:12,690
and represented as data, you know,

4284
02:39:12,690 --> 02:39:16,770
captured in some kind of scientific causal network,

4285
02:39:16,770 --> 02:39:18,090
it doesn't even exist, right?

4286
02:39:18,090 --> 02:39:21,570
And anything else that's not part of it

4287
02:39:21,570 --> 02:39:24,120
that can be formalized in that way is an epiphenomenon.

4288
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:25,470
It's not real.

4289
02:39:25,470 --> 02:39:29,400
So, you know, scientific triumphalism is this response

4290
02:39:29,400 --> 02:39:32,228
to, you know, the weirdness of,

4291
02:39:32,228 --> 02:39:33,061
you know, I could call it the mystery,

4292
02:39:33,061 --> 02:39:34,260
the weirdness of experience,

4293
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:36,120
by kind of just ignoring it completely.

4294
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:37,440
So there's no other truth.

4295
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:39,990
You know, art, music,

4296
02:39:39,990 --> 02:39:41,550
you know, human spirituality,

4297
02:39:41,550 --> 02:39:43,530
it's all actually reducible just to neuro,

4298
02:39:43,530 --> 02:39:45,480
you know, neural correlates.

4299
02:39:45,480 --> 02:39:47,670
So that's one way that it's been dealt with.

4300
02:39:47,670 --> 02:39:48,900
The other way is this sort of, right,

4301
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:52,140
you've got on the postmodern, you know, the left,

4302
02:39:52,140 --> 02:39:53,580
academic left, you get this thing, like,

4303
02:39:53,580 --> 02:39:54,870
science is just a game.

4304
02:39:54,870 --> 02:39:59,010
You know, it's just a game the powerful come up with,

4305
02:39:59,010 --> 02:39:59,910
which is also not true.

4306
02:39:59,910 --> 02:40:01,440
Science is totally potent

4307
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:04,470
and requires an account for what is happening.

4308
02:40:04,470 --> 02:40:05,303
So that's another way

4309
02:40:05,303 --> 02:40:08,070
to push, sort of, science away or respond to it.

4310
02:40:08,070 --> 02:40:10,140
The denial, science denial that happens,

4311
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:12,900
that's also another way of, sort of, you know,

4312
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:15,700
not understanding the balance

4313
02:40:16,590 --> 02:40:18,960
that we need to establish with experience.

4314
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:20,280
And then there's just pseudoscience,

4315
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:21,720
which wants to sort of say, like,

4316
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:23,850
oh, you know, the new age movement or whatever,

4317
02:40:23,850 --> 02:40:26,130
which wants to have, you know, wants to deal

4318
02:40:26,130 --> 02:40:27,870
with experience by kind of elevating it

4319
02:40:27,870 --> 02:40:29,820
in this weird pseudospiritual way

4320
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:33,600
or, you know, so that doesn't have the rigor of science.

4321
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:36,780
So, you know, all of these ways, all of these responses,

4322
02:40:36,780 --> 02:40:39,150
we have this difficulty about experience.

4323
02:40:39,150 --> 02:40:40,920
We need to understand

4324
02:40:40,920 --> 02:40:43,593
how experience fits into the web of meaning,

4325
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:46,320
and we don't really have an accurate,

4326
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:47,520
we don't have a good way of doing it yet.

4327
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:50,400
And the point of the book was to identify, very clearly,

4328
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:52,800
how the problem manifests, what the problem is,

4329
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:55,800
and what its effects are in the various sciences.

4330
02:40:55,800 --> 02:40:57,993
- And by the way, we should mention that,

4331
02:40:58,860 --> 02:41:01,260
at least the first two responses,

4332
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:02,733
they kind of feed each other.

4333
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:06,090
Just to observe the scientific community,

4334
02:41:06,090 --> 02:41:08,340
those who sort of gravitate a little bit

4335
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:11,913
towards the scientific triumphalism,

4336
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:16,443
there's an arrogance that builds in the human soul.

4337
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:19,397
I mean, it has to do with PhDs,

4338
02:41:19,397 --> 02:41:21,720
it has to do with sitting on an academic throne,

4339
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:22,800
all of those things.

4340
02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:26,070
And human nature with the egos and so on, it builds.

4341
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:28,560
And of course, nobody likes arrogance,

4342
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:30,990
and so those that reject science,

4343
02:41:30,990 --> 02:41:33,540
the arrogance is fuel for the people that reject science.

4344
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:34,373
- I absolutely agree.

4345
02:41:34,373 --> 02:41:35,400
- It just goes back and...

4346
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:37,320
And it's this divide that builds.

4347
02:41:37,320 --> 02:41:39,010
- Yeah, no, and that was a problem.

4348
02:41:39,010 --> 02:41:40,050
So I said, you know, my first book

4349
02:41:40,050 --> 02:41:42,060
was about science and human spirituality.

4350
02:41:42,060 --> 02:41:43,770
So I was trying to say that, like, you know,

4351
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:44,760
science is actually,

4352
02:41:44,760 --> 02:41:47,910
if we look at what happens in human spirituality,

4353
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:50,190
not religion, religion's about politics, right?

4354
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:52,650
But about, you know, for the entire history of the species,

4355
02:41:52,650 --> 02:41:54,210
we've had this experience of,

4356
02:41:54,210 --> 02:41:56,580
for a lack of a better word, the sacredness.

4357
02:41:56,580 --> 02:41:58,260
I'm not connecting this god or anything.

4358
02:41:58,260 --> 02:42:01,260
I'm just saying this experience of, like, the more.

4359
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:03,300
And then, you know, with the new atheist movement,

4360
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:05,130
you got people saying that, like,

4361
02:42:05,130 --> 02:42:07,710
anybody who feels that is an idiot, you know?

4362
02:42:07,710 --> 02:42:10,980
They just can't handle the hardcore science,

4363
02:42:10,980 --> 02:42:15,540
when, in fact, their views of the world are so denuded

4364
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:17,700
they can't even see the role that experience plays

4365
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:20,130
and how they came up with their formal systems, you know?

4366
02:42:20,130 --> 02:42:21,930
And experience, fundamentally, is weird,

4367
02:42:21,930 --> 02:42:22,860
you know, mysterious.

4368
02:42:22,860 --> 02:42:26,070
It's, you know, kind of goes down forever in some sense.

4369
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:27,240
There is always more.

4370
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:28,710
So yeah, that arrogance then, just,

4371
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:31,620
if you're telling everybody who's not hardcore enough

4372
02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:33,960
to do the, you know, standard model of cosmology,

4373
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:36,270
that they're idiots, that's not gonna bode well for your,

4374
02:42:36,270 --> 02:42:37,890
you know, the advance of your project.

4375
02:42:37,890 --> 02:42:40,800
- So you're proposing at least to consider the idea

4376
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:43,860
that experience is fundamental,

4377
02:42:43,860 --> 02:42:46,260
experience is not just an illusion

4378
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:48,510
that emerges from the set of quirks,

4379
02:42:48,510 --> 02:42:51,912
that there could be something about the conscious experience

4380
02:42:51,912 --> 02:42:56,040
of the world that is, like, at the core of reality.

4381
02:42:56,040 --> 02:42:57,420
- Yeah, but I wouldn't do it,

4382
02:42:57,420 --> 02:42:58,860
'cause you know, there's panpsychism, right,

4383
02:42:58,860 --> 02:42:59,708
which wants to say that there- - Right, so that's

4384
02:42:59,708 --> 02:43:00,541
all the way there.

4385
02:43:00,541 --> 02:43:02,960
Panpsychism is, like, that's literally one

4386
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:05,510
of the laws of physics, is conscience-

4387
02:43:05,510 --> 02:43:07,260
- But see, what all those do is, like,

4388
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:08,790
just the idea of, say, like,

4389
02:43:08,790 --> 02:43:10,320
physicalism versus idealism,

4390
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:12,060
which are kind of the two philosophical schools

4391
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:12,893
you can go with.

4392
02:43:12,893 --> 02:43:14,670
Physicalism says all that exists is physical.

4393
02:43:14,670 --> 02:43:16,800
Idealism says all that exists is mind.

4394
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:19,110
We're actually saying, look, both of these,

4395
02:43:19,110 --> 02:43:21,270
to take either of those positions

4396
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:22,890
is already to project out

4397
02:43:22,890 --> 02:43:25,380
into that third-person view, right?

4398
02:43:25,380 --> 02:43:28,080
And that third-person view, we wanna really emphasize,

4399
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:29,730
is a fiction.

4400
02:43:29,730 --> 02:43:31,980
It's a useful fiction when you're doing science, right?

4401
02:43:31,980 --> 02:43:34,860
If I wanna do, like, you know, the Newtonian physics

4402
02:43:34,860 --> 02:43:37,800
of billiard balls on a pool table, great.

4403
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:40,110
I don't wanna have to think about experience at all, right?

4404
02:43:40,110 --> 02:43:42,630
But, you know, if I'm asking deeper questions,

4405
02:43:42,630 --> 02:43:44,070
I can't ignore the fact

4406
02:43:44,070 --> 02:43:46,260
that there really is no third-person view

4407
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:50,367
and that any story I tell about the world is coming from,

4408
02:43:50,367 --> 02:43:52,680
and it's not just first person, but it's literally,

4409
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:53,730
'cause I'm gonna argue

4410
02:43:53,730 --> 02:43:56,160
that experience always involves all of us,

4411
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:58,770
experience always originates out of a community,

4412
02:43:58,770 --> 02:44:02,040
that, you know, you are always telling those stories

4413
02:44:02,040 --> 02:44:05,400
from the perspective of already existing,

4414
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:07,140
of already being in experience.

4415
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:09,780
So whatever account we want to give

4416
02:44:09,780 --> 02:44:13,650
of the world is gonna have to take that experience

4417
02:44:13,650 --> 02:44:16,800
as being irreducible and the irreducible starting point.

4418
02:44:16,800 --> 02:44:19,170
So ultimately, like, we don't have an answer.

4419
02:44:19,170 --> 02:44:20,137
Like, that's when people are like,

4420
02:44:20,137 --> 02:44:22,020
"Well, what are you suggesting is the alternative?"

4421
02:44:22,020 --> 02:44:23,160
It's like, look, that's the good work

4422
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:24,420
of the next science to come.

4423
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:27,360
Well, our job was to point out the problem with this.

4424
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:28,650
But what we would argue with is,

4425
02:44:28,650 --> 02:44:30,150
and we're thinking about the next book,

4426
02:44:30,150 --> 02:44:31,530
is this is really gonna require

4427
02:44:31,530 --> 02:44:34,080
a new conception of nature, right,

4428
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:36,660
that doesn't sort of jump right to that third person,

4429
02:44:36,660 --> 02:44:38,460
that fictional third-person view

4430
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:40,980
and somehow figures out how to do science,

4431
02:44:40,980 --> 02:44:44,000
recognizing that it always starts from experience.

4432
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,320
It always starts from this field of experience,

4433
02:44:46,320 --> 02:44:49,440
or, in phenomenology, the word is the life world

4434
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:50,550
that you're embedded in.

4435
02:44:50,550 --> 02:44:52,500
You can't un-embed yourself from it.

4436
02:44:52,500 --> 02:44:54,120
So how do you do...

4437
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:56,137
So one of the things that Whitehead said was,

4438
02:44:56,137 --> 02:44:59,550
you know, we have to avoid the bifurcation of nature.

4439
02:44:59,550 --> 02:45:01,500
And what he meant by that is the bifurcation

4440
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:04,020
into, like, sort of, scientific concepts,

4441
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:06,780
wavelength, you know, think about, like, seeing a sunset.

4442
02:45:06,780 --> 02:45:08,550
You can say like, oh, look, it's just wavelengths,

4443
02:45:08,550 --> 02:45:10,260
you know, and scattering particles,

4444
02:45:10,260 --> 02:45:12,060
and your experience of the redness,

4445
02:45:12,060 --> 02:45:13,650
the actual experience of the redness

4446
02:45:13,650 --> 02:45:14,820
and all the other things,

4447
02:45:14,820 --> 02:45:16,410
it's not just red, there's no quality,

4448
02:45:16,410 --> 02:45:17,580
there's no pure redness.

4449
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:19,710
Everything that's happening in the experiential part

4450
02:45:19,710 --> 02:45:20,910
is just an epiphenomena.

4451
02:45:20,910 --> 02:45:23,090
It's just, you know, brain states, whatever.

4452
02:45:23,090 --> 02:45:24,420
He said, you can't do that.

4453
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:27,930
They're both real. They're both accounts,

4454
02:45:27,930 --> 02:45:29,940
They both need to be integrated.

4455
02:45:29,940 --> 02:45:31,440
And so that required,

4456
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:32,820
I think, a really a different conception

4457
02:45:32,820 --> 02:45:34,470
of what we mean by nature.

4458
02:45:34,470 --> 02:45:39,240
- Is it something like incorporating in the physics,

4459
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:41,160
in the study of nature, the observer,

4460
02:45:41,160 --> 02:45:42,510
the experiencing observer?

4461
02:45:42,510 --> 02:45:45,030
Or is that still also looking from a third person?

4462
02:45:45,030 --> 02:45:46,707
- I think that's what we have to figure out, right?

4463
02:45:46,707 --> 02:45:48,120
And so actually, you know, a great place

4464
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:50,010
to think about this is quantum mechanics, right?

4465
02:45:50,010 --> 02:45:53,010
'Cause one of the things we're arguing is, like, look,

4466
02:45:53,010 --> 02:45:54,450
in the chapter that I wrote,

4467
02:45:54,450 --> 02:45:56,880
'cause I wrote this with Evan Thompson,

4468
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:58,260
who's a wonderful philosopher,

4469
02:45:58,260 --> 02:46:01,050
and Marcelo Gleiser, who's a theoretical physicist.

4470
02:46:01,050 --> 02:46:01,920
When I was writing the chapter

4471
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:03,210
on the origin of the blind spot,

4472
02:46:03,210 --> 02:46:07,050
like, you know, sort of, how this emerged out of history,

4473
02:46:07,050 --> 02:46:09,570
the subheader was like, well, it made sense at the time,

4474
02:46:09,570 --> 02:46:10,440
'cause it did.

4475
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:11,640
You know, there was a reason

4476
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:14,100
why people adopted this third-person,

4477
02:46:14,100 --> 02:46:16,470
god's-eye, deterministic view.

4478
02:46:16,470 --> 02:46:17,550
This view of sort of, like, yeah,

4479
02:46:17,550 --> 02:46:20,100
the perfect clockwork of the universe,

4480
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:21,330
yeah, totally made sense.

4481
02:46:21,330 --> 02:46:22,530
But by the time you got to the beginning

4482
02:46:22,530 --> 02:46:25,571
of the 20th century, science itself was telling you, like,

4483
02:46:25,571 --> 02:46:26,404
(imitates buzzer beeping)

4484
02:46:26,404 --> 02:46:28,230
and no place does this appear more

4485
02:46:28,230 --> 02:46:29,820
than in quantum mechanics, right?

4486
02:46:29,820 --> 02:46:34,637
Quantum mechanics slams you with the idea

4487
02:46:34,637 --> 02:46:37,174
of the measurement problem, you know?

4488
02:46:37,174 --> 02:46:38,520
And most important thing about quantum mechanics

4489
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:42,000
is you have a dynamical equation, the Schrodinger equation,

4490
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,620
which, you know, you put in, like we talked about before,

4491
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:44,940
you have initial conditions,

4492
02:46:44,940 --> 02:46:46,320
and now you gotta differential equation,

4493
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:48,000
and you crank out the differential equation,

4494
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,920
and it makes predictions for the future, right?

4495
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:51,690
Exactly like Newtonian physics

4496
02:46:51,690 --> 02:46:55,830
or its higher versions of the Lagrange or Hamiltonians.

4497
02:46:55,830 --> 02:46:57,330
But then this other thing happens

4498
02:46:57,330 --> 02:46:59,220
where it's like, oh, by the way,

4499
02:46:59,220 --> 02:47:00,420
as soon as you look at it,

4500
02:47:00,420 --> 02:47:02,370
as soon as the measurement is made,

4501
02:47:02,370 --> 02:47:04,500
I have a whole 'nother set of rules for you.

4502
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:07,481
You know, that's what we call the Born rule.

4503
02:47:07,481 --> 02:47:09,090
And it was telling you right from the beginning

4504
02:47:09,090 --> 02:47:11,820
that measurement matters, right?

4505
02:47:11,820 --> 02:47:14,700
So when you're asking, like, how will we do this?

4506
02:47:14,700 --> 02:47:17,250
Quantum mechanics is actually pointing to how to do it.

4507
02:47:17,250 --> 02:47:18,600
So, you know, there's been all these different

4508
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:19,980
interpretations of the quantum mechanics.

4509
02:47:19,980 --> 02:47:21,090
Many of them try

4510
02:47:21,090 --> 02:47:23,340
to pretend the measurement problem isn't there,

4511
02:47:23,340 --> 02:47:24,720
go to enormous lengths,

4512
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:27,150
like the many-worlds interpretation,

4513
02:47:27,150 --> 02:47:29,220
literally inventing an infinite number

4514
02:47:29,220 --> 02:47:31,800
of unobservable parallel universes

4515
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:34,410
to avoid the thing that quantum mechanics is telling them,

4516
02:47:34,410 --> 02:47:36,210
which is that measurements matter.

4517
02:47:36,210 --> 02:47:37,740
And then you get something like cubism,

4518
02:47:37,740 --> 02:47:39,330
which I'm gonna advocate for,

4519
02:47:39,330 --> 02:47:41,400
is a new interpretation of quantum mechanics,

4520
02:47:41,400 --> 02:47:44,070
which puts the Born rule at the center, right?

4521
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:46,410
Instead of, like, focusing on the Schrodinger equation

4522
02:47:46,410 --> 02:47:47,550
and the weird things that come out of it,

4523
02:47:47,550 --> 02:47:49,470
like Schrodinger's cat and all that other stuff,

4524
02:47:49,470 --> 02:47:52,710
it says, no, no, actually the real mystery is the Born rule.

4525
02:47:52,710 --> 02:47:54,630
Let's think about the Born rule.

4526
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:57,390
And like you said, that puts the agent,

4527
02:47:57,390 --> 02:48:01,380
the agent and information at the center of the whole thing.

4528
02:48:01,380 --> 02:48:03,420
- So that's not a thing you're trying to get rid of.

4529
02:48:03,420 --> 02:48:05,190
That's a thing you're trying to integrate

4530
02:48:05,190 --> 02:48:06,420
at the center of the thing.

4531
02:48:06,420 --> 02:48:08,580
In quantum mechanics, it becomes super obvious,

4532
02:48:08,580 --> 02:48:12,720
but maybe the same kind of thing

4533
02:48:12,720 --> 02:48:17,720
should be incorporated in every layer

4534
02:48:18,030 --> 02:48:19,440
of study of nature.

4535
02:48:19,440 --> 02:48:20,940
- Absolutely. That's exactly it.

4536
02:48:20,940 --> 02:48:21,773
So, you know, one of the things

4537
02:48:21,773 --> 02:48:22,606
that's really interesting to me,

4538
02:48:22,606 --> 02:48:24,210
so, you know, I have a project,

4539
02:48:24,210 --> 02:48:25,860
I'm part of a big project

4540
02:48:25,860 --> 02:48:29,040
that Chris Fuchs and Jacques Pienaar on cubism.

4541
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:29,873
So I've been part of that,

4542
02:48:29,873 --> 02:48:33,030
and what I've been amazed by is the language they use.

4543
02:48:33,030 --> 02:48:34,290
So what's cool about cubism

4544
02:48:34,290 --> 02:48:35,970
is it comes from quantum information theory.

4545
02:48:35,970 --> 02:48:37,620
It's a pretty modern version

4546
02:48:37,620 --> 02:48:39,330
of thinking about quantum mechanics.

4547
02:48:39,330 --> 02:48:40,863
And it's always about,

4548
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:47,000
you have an agent who makes an action on the world,

4549
02:48:47,100 --> 02:48:49,560
and then the information they get from that action

4550
02:48:49,560 --> 02:48:51,900
through the experiment, that's the action in the world,

4551
02:48:51,900 --> 02:48:53,040
updates their priors,

4552
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:55,410
updates their, you know, their Bayesian,

4553
02:48:55,410 --> 02:48:58,350
that's why it's called cubism, quantum Bayesianism,

4554
02:48:58,350 --> 02:49:01,440
updates the information they've gotten from the world.

4555
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:04,140
Now, this turns out to be, it's kind of the same language

4556
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:05,820
that we're using in a project

4557
02:49:05,820 --> 02:49:08,400
that's about the physics of life,

4558
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:11,160
where we have a grant from the Templeton Foundation

4559
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:12,840
to look at semantic information

4560
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:15,210
and the role of semantic information

4561
02:49:15,210 --> 02:49:16,710
in living systems like cells.

4562
02:49:16,710 --> 02:49:18,510
So, you know, we have Shannon information,

4563
02:49:18,510 --> 02:49:20,437
which is a probability distribution that tells you,

4564
02:49:20,437 --> 02:49:23,340
you know, basically how much surprise there is

4565
02:49:23,340 --> 02:49:24,720
in a message.

4566
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:28,203
Semantic information focuses on meaning, right?

4567
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:30,060
And in a very simple way,

4568
02:49:30,060 --> 02:49:33,787
just, like, how much of the information that the agent,

4569
02:49:33,787 --> 02:49:37,870
you know, the critter is getting from the world actually

4570
02:49:39,300 --> 02:49:40,950
helps it survive, right?

4571
02:49:40,950 --> 02:49:42,780
That's the most basic idea of meaning, right?

4572
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:44,130
We can get all philosophical about meaning,

4573
02:49:44,130 --> 02:49:44,963
but this is it.

4574
02:49:44,963 --> 02:49:46,680
Does it help me stay alive or not?

4575
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:49,500
And the whole question of agency

4576
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:51,600
and autonomy that occurs

4577
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,490
in this setting of just asking about,

4578
02:49:53,490 --> 02:49:57,420
how do cells move up a a chemical gradient to get more food,

4579
02:49:57,420 --> 02:49:58,740
kind of has the same feel,

4580
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:01,260
the same, you know, sort of architecture

4581
02:50:01,260 --> 02:50:02,760
as what's going on in quantum mechanics.

4582
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:04,410
So I think what you said is exactly it.

4583
02:50:04,410 --> 02:50:06,960
How do we bring this sort of recognition

4584
02:50:06,960 --> 02:50:10,440
that there's always us, the agent,

4585
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:14,370
or life, the agent, interacting with the world

4586
02:50:14,370 --> 02:50:17,940
and both giving information and passing information back

4587
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:19,920
as a way of doing science,

4588
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:21,810
doing hardcore science with experiments,

4589
02:50:21,810 --> 02:50:23,850
but never forgetting that agency,

4590
02:50:23,850 --> 02:50:25,830
which also means experience, in some sense,

4591
02:50:25,830 --> 02:50:27,270
is at the center of the whole thing?

4592
02:50:27,270 --> 02:50:30,150
- So you think there could be something like cubism,

4593
02:50:30,150 --> 02:50:31,593
quantum Bayesianism,

4594
02:50:33,060 --> 02:50:36,990
that creates a theory, like a Nobel Prize-winning theory,

4595
02:50:36,990 --> 02:50:40,170
sort of, like, hardcore,

4596
02:50:40,170 --> 02:50:42,960
real theories that put the agent at the center?

4597
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:44,400
- Yes. That's what we're looking for.

4598
02:50:44,400 --> 02:50:47,326
I think that is really, that's the exciting part.

4599
02:50:47,326 --> 02:50:49,083
You know, the scientific triumphalist thing says,

4600
02:50:49,083 --> 02:50:52,030
you know, and you understand why people love this.

4601
02:50:52,030 --> 02:50:53,790
Like, I have these equations,

4602
02:50:53,790 --> 02:50:55,350
and these equations represent,

4603
02:50:55,350 --> 02:50:57,457
you know, there's this platonic idea that they are,

4604
02:50:57,457 --> 02:51:00,900
you know, they exist eternally on their own.

4605
02:51:00,900 --> 02:51:02,490
It's kind of quasi-religious, right?

4606
02:51:02,490 --> 02:51:03,870
It's sort of like somehow, like,

4607
02:51:03,870 --> 02:51:07,020
these equations are the, you're reading the mind of God.

4608
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:09,720
But this other approach to me is just as exciting

4609
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:12,660
because what you're saying is there's us and the world.

4610
02:51:12,660 --> 02:51:14,070
They're inseparable, right?

4611
02:51:14,070 --> 02:51:15,870
It's always us and the world.

4612
02:51:15,870 --> 02:51:17,100
And what we're now finding about

4613
02:51:17,100 --> 02:51:20,730
is this kind of co-creation, this interaction,

4614
02:51:20,730 --> 02:51:23,400
you know, between the agent and the world,

4615
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:26,580
such that these powerful laws of physics

4616
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:27,413
that need an account,

4617
02:51:27,413 --> 02:51:29,250
like, in no way am I saying these laws aren't important,

4618
02:51:29,250 --> 02:51:31,890
these laws are amazing, but they need an account,

4619
02:51:31,890 --> 02:51:34,650
but not an account that strips,

4620
02:51:34,650 --> 02:51:36,750
you know, that turns the experience,

4621
02:51:36,750 --> 02:51:40,620
turns the agent into just a, you know, an epiphenomena,

4622
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:42,150
that it pushes the agent out

4623
02:51:42,150 --> 02:51:43,380
and makes it seem as if the agent's

4624
02:51:43,380 --> 02:51:45,450
not the most important part of the story.

4625
02:51:45,450 --> 02:51:47,170
- So if you pull on this thread

4626
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:50,850
and say there's a whole discipline born of this,

4627
02:51:50,850 --> 02:51:54,180
putting the agent as the primary thing in a theory,

4628
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:55,773
in a physics theory, like,

4629
02:51:57,060 --> 02:52:00,300
is it possible it just like breaks the whole thing open?

4630
02:52:00,300 --> 02:52:03,390
So there's this whole effort of, you know,

4631
02:52:03,390 --> 02:52:05,880
unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics

4632
02:52:05,880 --> 02:52:08,100
of, like, coming up with a theory of everything.

4633
02:52:08,100 --> 02:52:09,543
What if these are, like,

4634
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:13,830
the tip of the iceberg?

4635
02:52:13,830 --> 02:52:18,750
What if the agent thing is, like, really important?

4636
02:52:18,750 --> 02:52:20,220
- So, you know, listen,

4637
02:52:20,220 --> 02:52:22,470
that would be, like, kind of my dream.

4638
02:52:22,470 --> 02:52:23,670
I'm not gonna be the one to do it

4639
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:25,560
because I'm not smart enough to do it.

4640
02:52:25,560 --> 02:52:27,420
But you know, Marcelo and I have, for a while,

4641
02:52:27,420 --> 02:52:28,830
have been sort of critical

4642
02:52:28,830 --> 02:52:31,320
of where foundational physics has been

4643
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:32,670
for a while with string theory.

4644
02:52:32,670 --> 02:52:34,440
I've spent my whole life listening

4645
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:37,443
to talks about, "String theory, real soon," you know?

4646
02:52:38,340 --> 02:52:43,020
And it's gotten ever more disconnected from,

4647
02:52:43,020 --> 02:52:45,360
you know, data, observations.

4648
02:52:45,360 --> 02:52:46,470
There were people talking for a while

4649
02:52:46,470 --> 02:52:48,273
that it's post-empirical,

4650
02:52:49,170 --> 02:52:50,820
and you know, I wanna always wanted to write a paper

4651
02:52:50,820 --> 02:52:52,710
or an article that was like,

4652
02:52:52,710 --> 02:52:55,350
physicists have been smoking their own stash, right?

4653
02:52:55,350 --> 02:52:56,625
There's this way we've gotten used to like,

4654
02:52:56,625 --> 02:52:59,100
you know, you have to out-weird the other person.

4655
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:01,170
Like, my theory is 38 dimensions.

4656
02:53:01,170 --> 02:53:02,730
My theory is 22 dimensions,

4657
02:53:02,730 --> 02:53:04,110
but it's got, you know,

4658
02:53:04,110 --> 02:53:07,380
you know, psychedelic squirrels in it.

4659
02:53:07,380 --> 02:53:09,210
And so there's been a problem, there's a problem.

4660
02:53:09,210 --> 02:53:11,850
I don't need to tell you there's a crisis in physics

4661
02:53:11,850 --> 02:53:13,260
or there's a crisis in cosmology.

4662
02:53:13,260 --> 02:53:14,280
Other people have used,

4663
02:53:14,280 --> 02:53:18,060
that's been the headline on scientific American stories.

4664
02:53:18,060 --> 02:53:20,730
So clearly, another direction has to be found,

4665
02:53:20,730 --> 02:53:22,590
and maybe it has nothing to do with this,

4666
02:53:22,590 --> 02:53:25,833
but I suspect that,

4667
02:53:26,970 --> 02:53:28,800
because so many times,

4668
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:32,340
the agent or having to deal with the view

4669
02:53:32,340 --> 02:53:35,400
from the inside or the role of agency,

4670
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:36,900
like, when it comes to time,

4671
02:53:36,900 --> 02:53:40,230
thinking that you can replace the block universe

4672
02:53:40,230 --> 02:53:43,170
with the actual experience of time.

4673
02:53:43,170 --> 02:53:44,790
You know, clocks don't tell time.

4674
02:53:44,790 --> 02:53:46,830
We use clocks to tell time.

4675
02:53:46,830 --> 02:53:48,570
So maybe that even, like, the fundamental nature

4676
02:53:48,570 --> 02:53:50,700
of time can't be viewed from the outside,

4677
02:53:50,700 --> 02:53:52,540
that there's a new physics theory

4678
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:56,190
that comes from this agential,

4679
02:53:56,190 --> 02:53:59,400
informational, computational view.

4680
02:53:59,400 --> 02:54:00,750
I don't know, but that's kind of what,

4681
02:54:00,750 --> 02:54:05,750
I think it would be fertile ground to explore.

4682
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:07,907
- Yeah, like, time is a really interesting one

4683
02:54:07,907 --> 02:54:11,010
'cause time is really important to us humans.

4684
02:54:11,010 --> 02:54:12,180
What is time?

4685
02:54:12,180 --> 02:54:14,070
- Yeah, right. What is time?

4686
02:54:14,070 --> 02:54:16,740
So the way we have tended to view it is we've taken,

4687
02:54:16,740 --> 02:54:18,000
this is, when Husserl talks

4688
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,400
about the surreptitious substitution,

4689
02:54:20,400 --> 02:54:22,860
we've taken Einstein's beautiful,

4690
02:54:22,860 --> 02:54:27,360
powerful, formal system for viewing time,

4691
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:30,120
and we substituted that

4692
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:33,060
for the actual experience of time, right?

4693
02:54:33,060 --> 02:54:34,050
So the block universe,

4694
02:54:34,050 --> 02:54:36,270
where, like, next Tuesday is already written down,

4695
02:54:36,270 --> 02:54:37,620
you know, in the block universe,

4696
02:54:37,620 --> 02:54:38,640
the four-dimensional universe,

4697
02:54:38,640 --> 02:54:40,530
all events are already there,

4698
02:54:40,530 --> 02:54:43,290
which is very potent for making certain kinds of predictions

4699
02:54:43,290 --> 02:54:46,200
within the, sort of, you know, the scientific framework.

4700
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:49,860
But, you know, it is not lived time.

4701
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:52,170
And you know, this was pointed out to Einstein,

4702
02:54:52,170 --> 02:54:54,150
and he eventually recognized it.

4703
02:54:54,150 --> 02:54:56,910
Very famous meeting between Henri Bergson,

4704
02:54:56,910 --> 02:54:59,670
who was the most famous philosopher of, like, the, you know,

4705
02:54:59,670 --> 02:55:02,250
early 20th century, and Einstein,

4706
02:55:02,250 --> 02:55:04,410
where Einstein was giving a talk on relativity.

4707
02:55:04,410 --> 02:55:06,510
And Bergson, whose whole thing was about time,

4708
02:55:06,510 --> 02:55:07,650
and it was about duration,

4709
02:55:07,650 --> 02:55:12,120
he wanted to separate the scientific image of time,

4710
02:55:12,120 --> 02:55:15,930
the map of time from the actual terrain,

4711
02:55:15,930 --> 02:55:17,610
which he used the word duration.

4712
02:55:17,610 --> 02:55:21,453
Like, we humans, duration for us is full.

4713
02:55:22,431 --> 02:55:23,310
It's stretched out.

4714
02:55:23,310 --> 02:55:24,420
It's got a little bit of the past,

4715
02:55:24,420 --> 02:55:25,860
a little bit of the future, a little bit of the present.

4716
02:55:25,860 --> 02:55:27,570
Music is the best example, right?

4717
02:55:27,570 --> 02:55:28,650
You're hearing music.

4718
02:55:28,650 --> 02:55:31,140
You're both already anticipating what's gonna happen,

4719
02:55:31,140 --> 02:55:34,800
and you are, you know, remembering what's going on.

4720
02:55:34,800 --> 02:55:38,310
There's a kind of phenomenal structure there,

4721
02:55:38,310 --> 02:55:41,850
which is different from the representation of time

4722
02:55:41,850 --> 02:55:43,920
that you have with the formal mathematics.

4723
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:46,860
And you know, the way we would look at this

4724
02:55:46,860 --> 02:55:49,380
is that the problem with the surreptitious substitution,

4725
02:55:49,380 --> 02:55:52,050
the problem with the blind spot is it says, oh, no, no,

4726
02:55:52,050 --> 02:55:54,210
the formal system is time,

4727
02:55:54,210 --> 02:55:57,210
but really the only place time appears is with us, right?

4728
02:55:57,210 --> 02:55:58,440
We're time, you know.

4729
02:55:58,440 --> 02:56:01,477
So having a theory that actually could start with us,

4730
02:56:01,477 --> 02:56:03,900
you know, and then stretch out into the universe

4731
02:56:03,900 --> 02:56:07,560
rather than imposing this imaginary third-person view

4732
02:56:07,560 --> 02:56:11,460
back on us, you know, that's a route

4733
02:56:11,460 --> 02:56:13,603
towards a different way of approaching the whole problem.

4734
02:56:13,603 --> 02:56:15,030
- I just wonder, who's the observer?

4735
02:56:15,030 --> 02:56:17,220
I mean, define what the agent is,

4736
02:56:17,220 --> 02:56:20,610
in a any kind of frame is difficult.

4737
02:56:20,610 --> 02:56:21,960
- Is difficult, right?

4738
02:56:21,960 --> 02:56:24,630
But that's the good work of the science ahead of us, right?

4739
02:56:24,630 --> 02:56:25,463
So what happened with this idea

4740
02:56:25,463 --> 02:56:27,465
of the structural invariance I was talking about,

4741
02:56:27,465 --> 02:56:28,860
so, you know, we start with experience,

4742
02:56:28,860 --> 02:56:29,760
which is irreducible.

4743
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:33,150
There's no atoms of experience, right? It's a whole.

4744
02:56:33,150 --> 02:56:34,380
And we go through the whole process,

4745
02:56:34,380 --> 02:56:35,850
which is a communal process, by the way.

4746
02:56:35,850 --> 02:56:37,200
There's a philosopher, Robert Crease,

4747
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:38,820
who talks about the workshop,

4748
02:56:38,820 --> 02:56:41,250
that starting in like the 1700s, 1600s,

4749
02:56:41,250 --> 02:56:45,540
we developed this communal space to work in.

4750
02:56:45,540 --> 02:56:48,210
Sometimes it was literally a physical space, a laboratory,

4751
02:56:48,210 --> 02:56:50,820
where these ideas would be pulled apart, refined,

4752
02:56:50,820 --> 02:56:53,010
argued over, and then validated,

4753
02:56:53,010 --> 02:56:54,780
and we went to the next step.

4754
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:57,360
So this idea of pulling out from experience,

4755
02:56:57,360 --> 02:57:01,500
these thinner, abstract, structural invariants,

4756
02:57:01,500 --> 02:57:03,660
the things that we could actually do science with.

4757
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:04,493
And it's kind of like,

4758
02:57:04,493 --> 02:57:07,590
we call it an ascending spiral of abstraction, right?

4759
02:57:07,590 --> 02:57:10,170
So the problem with the way we do things now

4760
02:57:10,170 --> 02:57:14,070
is we take those abstractions,

4761
02:57:14,070 --> 02:57:15,360
which came from experience,

4762
02:57:15,360 --> 02:57:17,640
and then with something like, you know,

4763
02:57:17,640 --> 02:57:21,420
a computational model of consciousness or experience,

4764
02:57:21,420 --> 02:57:22,860
we think we can put it back in.

4765
02:57:22,860 --> 02:57:25,740
Like, you literally pulled out these super thin things,

4766
02:57:25,740 --> 02:57:29,190
these abstractions, you know, neglecting experience

4767
02:57:29,190 --> 02:57:30,780
because that's the only way to do science.

4768
02:57:30,780 --> 02:57:32,280
And then you think somehow, oh,

4769
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:33,930
I'm gonna jam experience back in

4770
02:57:33,930 --> 02:57:36,780
and, you know, have an explanation for experience.

4771
02:57:36,780 --> 02:57:38,160
- So do you think it's possible to show

4772
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:41,910
that something like free will is, quote, unquote, real

4773
02:57:41,910 --> 02:57:43,600
if you integrate experience back

4774
02:57:44,556 --> 02:57:45,797
into the physics model of the world?

4775
02:57:45,797 --> 02:57:49,590
- What I would say is that free will is a given.

4776
02:57:49,590 --> 02:57:50,850
And that's the thing about experience, right?

4777
02:57:50,850 --> 02:57:52,770
So one of the things that Whitehead said,

4778
02:57:52,770 --> 02:57:53,603
I really love this quote,

4779
02:57:53,603 --> 02:57:57,030
he says, it's not the job of either science or philosophy

4780
02:57:57,030 --> 02:57:59,160
to account for the concrete.

4781
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:01,650
It's the job to account for the abstract.

4782
02:58:01,650 --> 02:58:05,430
The concrete, what's happening between us right now,

4783
02:58:05,430 --> 02:58:07,290
is just given, you know?

4784
02:58:07,290 --> 02:58:08,850
It's presented to us.

4785
02:58:08,850 --> 02:58:10,680
Every day, it's presented to.

4786
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:11,970
If you want an explanation, fine,

4787
02:58:11,970 --> 02:58:12,803
but the explanation actually

4788
02:58:12,803 --> 02:58:15,030
doesn't add anything to it, right?

4789
02:58:15,030 --> 02:58:16,680
So that free will, in some sense,

4790
02:58:16,680 --> 02:58:18,210
is the nature of being an agent, right?

4791
02:58:18,210 --> 02:58:19,380
To be an agent,

4792
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:22,980
agency and autonomy are sort of the two things that are,

4793
02:58:22,980 --> 02:58:24,210
you know, they're equivalent.

4794
02:58:24,210 --> 02:58:27,270
And so in some sense, to be an agent is to be autonomous.

4795
02:58:27,270 --> 02:58:29,190
And so then the question really to ask is,

4796
02:58:29,190 --> 02:58:31,590
can you have an account for agency

4797
02:58:31,590 --> 02:58:35,553
and autonomy that captures aspects of,

4798
02:58:36,840 --> 02:58:38,160
its arising in the world

4799
02:58:38,160 --> 02:58:41,550
or the way it and the world sort of co-arise.

4800
02:58:41,550 --> 02:58:44,100
You know, the reason why we argue about free will often

4801
02:58:44,100 --> 02:58:46,320
is because we already have this blind-spot view

4802
02:58:46,320 --> 02:58:47,760
that the world is deterministic

4803
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:50,400
because of our equations, which themselves,

4804
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:51,270
we treat the equations

4805
02:58:51,270 --> 02:58:53,791
as if they're more real than experience.

4806
02:58:53,791 --> 02:58:56,790
You know, and the equations are a paler, you know,

4807
02:58:56,790 --> 02:58:58,380
they don't corral experience.

4808
02:58:58,380 --> 02:59:00,780
They are a thinner, you know, representation.

4809
02:59:00,780 --> 02:59:01,740
As we like to say,

4810
02:59:01,740 --> 02:59:04,620
don't confuse the map for the terrain.

4811
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:05,970
What's happening between us right now

4812
02:59:05,970 --> 02:59:09,090
and, you know, all the weirdness of it, that's the terrain.

4813
02:59:09,090 --> 02:59:11,040
The map is what I can write down on equations

4814
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:13,410
and then, in the workshop, do experiments on.

4815
02:59:13,410 --> 02:59:15,450
Super powerful, needs an account,

4816
02:59:15,450 --> 02:59:17,880
but experience overflows that.

4817
02:59:17,880 --> 02:59:19,980
- What if the experience is an illusion?

4818
02:59:19,980 --> 02:59:21,930
Like, how do we know?

4819
02:59:21,930 --> 02:59:26,100
What if the agency that we experience is an illusion?

4820
02:59:26,100 --> 02:59:28,590
- An illusion looking from where?

4821
02:59:28,590 --> 02:59:30,030
Like, right, 'cause that already requires,

4822
02:59:30,030 --> 02:59:32,430
to take that stance is you've already pushed yourself

4823
02:59:32,430 --> 02:59:34,470
into that third-person view, right?

4824
02:59:34,470 --> 02:59:36,390
And so what we're saying is,

4825
02:59:36,390 --> 02:59:37,350
that third person view,

4826
02:59:37,350 --> 02:59:38,430
which now you're gonna say like, oh,

4827
02:59:38,430 --> 02:59:40,890
I've got a whole other set of entities,

4828
02:59:40,890 --> 02:59:42,390
of ontological entities,

4829
02:59:42,390 --> 02:59:44,280
meaning, you know, things that I think exist

4830
02:59:44,280 --> 02:59:46,320
in god's living room,

4831
02:59:46,320 --> 02:59:49,260
you know, that are independent of me

4832
02:59:49,260 --> 02:59:51,840
and the community of living things I'm part of.

4833
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:53,880
- So you're pushing it elsewhere.

4834
02:59:53,880 --> 02:59:57,450
Just like there's a stack of turtles, there's probably...

4835
02:59:57,450 --> 03:00:00,810
If this experience, the human experience is an illusion,

4836
03:00:00,810 --> 03:00:04,170
maybe there's an observer for whom it's not an illusion,

4837
03:00:04,170 --> 03:00:06,210
so you always have to find an observer somewhere.

4838
03:00:06,210 --> 03:00:07,740
- Yeah, right, and that's why, you know,

4839
03:00:07,740 --> 03:00:09,660
fundamentally, the blind spot,

4840
03:00:09,660 --> 03:00:12,180
especially the scientific triumphalist part,

4841
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:14,100
is following a religious impulse.

4842
03:00:14,100 --> 03:00:16,650
You know, it's wanting the god's-eye view.

4843
03:00:16,650 --> 03:00:17,640
And you know what's really interesting?

4844
03:00:17,640 --> 03:00:18,570
And when we think about this

4845
03:00:18,570 --> 03:00:21,060
and the way this gets talked about, especially publicly,

4846
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:24,330
you know, there's a line of philosophical inquiry

4847
03:00:24,330 --> 03:00:26,730
that this language gets couched in.

4848
03:00:26,730 --> 03:00:29,040
And it is actually a pretty,

4849
03:00:29,040 --> 03:00:32,670
it's only one version of philosophy, right?

4850
03:00:32,670 --> 03:00:33,510
So it is pretty much

4851
03:00:33,510 --> 03:00:36,000
what we call the analytic tradition, right?

4852
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:37,740
But even in Europe,

4853
03:00:37,740 --> 03:00:38,970
or in the Western tradition,

4854
03:00:38,970 --> 03:00:41,490
you know, what we'll call Western philosophy,

4855
03:00:41,490 --> 03:00:42,780
there's phenomenology,

4856
03:00:42,780 --> 03:00:45,060
there's Husserl and Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty

4857
03:00:45,060 --> 03:00:46,740
which took an entirely different track.

4858
03:00:46,740 --> 03:00:49,350
They were really interested in the structure of experience.

4859
03:00:49,350 --> 03:00:51,750
They spent all their time trying to understand,

4860
03:00:51,750 --> 03:00:53,310
trying to develop a language

4861
03:00:53,310 --> 03:00:55,590
that could kind of climb into the circle

4862
03:00:55,590 --> 03:00:57,270
that is experience, right?

4863
03:00:57,270 --> 03:00:59,190
Experience, you're not gonna be able to start with axioms

4864
03:00:59,190 --> 03:01:00,510
and work your way to it.

4865
03:01:00,510 --> 03:01:02,550
It's given, so you have to kind of jump in

4866
03:01:02,550 --> 03:01:03,780
and then try and find a language

4867
03:01:03,780 --> 03:01:05,553
to account for its structure.

4868
03:01:06,960 --> 03:01:10,170
So that has not been part of this discussion about,

4869
03:01:10,170 --> 03:01:13,770
good luck finding a YouTube video where someone, you know,

4870
03:01:13,770 --> 03:01:16,830
a famous scientist is talking about science

4871
03:01:16,830 --> 03:01:18,330
from a phenomenological point of view,

4872
03:01:18,330 --> 03:01:20,790
even though it's a huge branch of philosophy.

4873
03:01:20,790 --> 03:01:23,130
And then you get the philosophies that occurred

4874
03:01:23,130 --> 03:01:25,200
from other cores of civilization, right?

4875
03:01:25,200 --> 03:01:27,540
So there's there's the western core,

4876
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:28,770
out of which comes the Greeks

4877
03:01:28,770 --> 03:01:31,680
and the, you know, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition.

4878
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:34,200
But then you get India, and you get Asia,

4879
03:01:34,200 --> 03:01:35,130
and they developed their own.

4880
03:01:35,130 --> 03:01:36,840
They were highly complex societies

4881
03:01:36,840 --> 03:01:39,930
that developed their own responses to these questions.

4882
03:01:39,930 --> 03:01:41,550
And for reasons,

4883
03:01:41,550 --> 03:01:43,410
'cause they had contemplative practice,

4884
03:01:43,410 --> 03:01:45,300
they were very focused on, like, direct,

4885
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:49,200
trying to, like, directly probe attention and experience,

4886
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:52,800
they asked questions in ways that the West never really did.

4887
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:54,300
Phenomenology kind of started it.

4888
03:01:54,300 --> 03:01:57,690
But you know, there's philosophers like Nagarjuna

4889
03:01:57,690 --> 03:01:59,880
and Vasubandhu, and they're like the Plato

4890
03:01:59,880 --> 03:02:01,357
and the, you know, Aristotle of,

4891
03:02:01,357 --> 03:02:04,080
you know, sort of, those philosophies.

4892
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:06,030
And they were really focused on experience.

4893
03:02:06,030 --> 03:02:06,863
In the West,

4894
03:02:06,863 --> 03:02:11,220
I think maybe because we had the Judeo-Christian tradition

4895
03:02:11,220 --> 03:02:12,690
where we already had this kind of God

4896
03:02:12,690 --> 03:02:14,370
who's gonna be the frame on which,

4897
03:02:14,370 --> 03:02:16,220
you could always point to that frame.

4898
03:02:17,250 --> 03:02:20,130
The traditions that came from the classical philosophies

4899
03:02:20,130 --> 03:02:22,050
of India and Asia,

4900
03:02:22,050 --> 03:02:23,220
they started always with the,

4901
03:02:23,220 --> 03:02:24,720
they wanted to know about experience.

4902
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:26,730
Their whole philosophies and their logic

4903
03:02:26,730 --> 03:02:29,730
and their argumentation was based on,

4904
03:02:29,730 --> 03:02:31,050
I've got this experience,

4905
03:02:31,050 --> 03:02:32,940
I can't get out of this experience,

4906
03:02:32,940 --> 03:02:34,770
how do I reason from it?

4907
03:02:34,770 --> 03:02:35,603
So I think there's, like,

4908
03:02:35,603 --> 03:02:37,020
a lot of other philosophical traditions

4909
03:02:37,020 --> 03:02:37,853
that we could draw from.

4910
03:02:37,853 --> 03:02:39,570
You know, not like slavishly.

4911
03:02:39,570 --> 03:02:41,370
We don't all have to become Buddhists to do it,

4912
03:02:41,370 --> 03:02:42,240
but there are traditions

4913
03:02:42,240 --> 03:02:44,310
that really tried to work this out

4914
03:02:44,310 --> 03:02:47,070
in a way that the Western traditions just didn't.

4915
03:02:47,070 --> 03:02:49,110
- But there's also the practical fact

4916
03:02:49,110 --> 03:02:52,470
that is difficult to build a logical system

4917
03:02:52,470 --> 03:02:53,643
on top of experience.

4918
03:02:53,643 --> 03:02:56,010
It's difficult to have the rigor of science

4919
03:02:56,010 --> 03:02:57,270
on top of experience.

4920
03:02:57,270 --> 03:03:00,390
And so as science advances,

4921
03:03:00,390 --> 03:03:01,320
we might get better and better.

4922
03:03:01,320 --> 03:03:02,940
Like, the same is, it's very difficult

4923
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:05,070
to have any kind of mathematical

4924
03:03:05,070 --> 03:03:06,810
or kind of scientific rigor

4925
03:03:06,810 --> 03:03:11,460
to why complexity emerges

4926
03:03:11,460 --> 03:03:13,890
from simple rules and simple objects,

4927
03:03:13,890 --> 03:03:15,600
sort of the Santa Fe questions.

4928
03:03:15,600 --> 03:03:17,040
- Yeah, but I think we can do it.

4929
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:18,343
I think there's a aspects of it.

4930
03:03:18,343 --> 03:03:20,137
I mean, as long as you're never trying to, like,

4931
03:03:20,137 --> 03:03:21,660
"This is what experience is,"

4932
03:03:21,660 --> 03:03:22,637
like, I think that's kind of where we're, you know,

4933
03:03:22,637 --> 03:03:26,730
you're never gonna have a causal account

4934
03:03:26,730 --> 03:03:28,380
of experience 'cause it's just given.

4935
03:03:28,380 --> 03:03:30,180
But you can do lots about,

4936
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:31,740
and that's what the good work is,

4937
03:03:31,740 --> 03:03:33,330
is to, how do I approach this?

4938
03:03:33,330 --> 03:03:34,680
How do I approach this in a way that's rigorous

4939
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:37,110
that I can do experiments with, also?

4940
03:03:37,110 --> 03:03:39,180
But so, for example, I was just reading this beautiful paper

4941
03:03:39,180 --> 03:03:41,940
that was talking about in the, you know,

4942
03:03:41,940 --> 03:03:42,773
this is what we're counting

4943
03:03:42,773 --> 03:03:46,260
with our semantic information too, causal closure.

4944
03:03:46,260 --> 03:03:48,480
Love this idea, right?

4945
03:03:48,480 --> 03:03:50,580
So we talked about autopoiesis a while back, right,

4946
03:03:50,580 --> 03:03:52,713
the idea that living systems,

4947
03:03:54,120 --> 03:03:57,330
they are self-creating and self-maintaining.

4948
03:03:57,330 --> 03:03:58,320
So the membrane,

4949
03:03:58,320 --> 03:03:59,850
cell membrane is a great example of this, right?

4950
03:03:59,850 --> 03:04:01,140
The cell membrane,

4951
03:04:01,140 --> 03:04:02,940
you can't have a cell without a cell membrane.

4952
03:04:02,940 --> 03:04:05,580
The cell membrane lets stuff through,

4953
03:04:05,580 --> 03:04:07,440
keeps other stuff out, right?

4954
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:10,260
But the cell membrane is part of the processes,

4955
03:04:10,260 --> 03:04:13,740
and it's a product of the processes

4956
03:04:13,740 --> 03:04:16,620
that the cell membrane needs, right?

4957
03:04:16,620 --> 03:04:20,253
In some sense, the cell membrane creates itself.

4958
03:04:21,270 --> 03:04:22,140
It's always with life,

4959
03:04:22,140 --> 03:04:24,150
there's always this strange loop.

4960
03:04:24,150 --> 03:04:25,740
And so somehow figuring out how to jump

4961
03:04:25,740 --> 03:04:27,240
into that strange loop

4962
03:04:27,240 --> 03:04:29,007
is, you know, the science that's ahead of us.

4963
03:04:29,007 --> 03:04:32,703
And so this idea of causal closure, accounting for how,

4964
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:37,980
you know, we talk about, like, a downward causation, right?

4965
03:04:37,980 --> 03:04:40,110
So reductionism says everything only depends

4966
03:04:40,110 --> 03:04:40,943
on the microstate.

4967
03:04:40,943 --> 03:04:42,840
Everything just depends on the atoms, right? That's it.

4968
03:04:42,840 --> 03:04:46,080
If you know the Lagrangian for the standard model,

4969
03:04:46,080 --> 03:04:47,400
you are done, you know.

4970
03:04:47,400 --> 03:04:49,470
Of course, in principle, you need god's computer,

4971
03:04:49,470 --> 03:04:51,090
but fine, you know, you know,

4972
03:04:51,090 --> 03:04:53,130
in principle, it could be done.

4973
03:04:53,130 --> 03:04:55,770
Causal closure, and I was just reading this great paper

4974
03:04:55,770 --> 03:04:57,810
that sort of argues for this,

4975
03:04:57,810 --> 03:05:00,120
there's ways in which using epsilon machines

4976
03:05:00,120 --> 03:05:02,580
and all this machinery from information theory,

4977
03:05:02,580 --> 03:05:04,410
that you can see ways

4978
03:05:04,410 --> 03:05:07,320
in which the system can organize itself

4979
03:05:07,320 --> 03:05:10,140
so that it decouples from the microstates.

4980
03:05:10,140 --> 03:05:12,450
Now, the macrostate, fundamentally,

4981
03:05:12,450 --> 03:05:15,390
no longer needs the microstate for its own description,

4982
03:05:15,390 --> 03:05:17,070
its own account of the laws.

4983
03:05:17,070 --> 03:05:18,600
Whether that paper is true or not,

4984
03:05:18,600 --> 03:05:20,910
it's an example of heading down that road.

4985
03:05:20,910 --> 03:05:22,530
There's also Robert Rosen's work.

4986
03:05:22,530 --> 03:05:24,090
He was a theoretical biologist,

4987
03:05:24,090 --> 03:05:27,540
who, you know, he talked about closure to efficient cause,

4988
03:05:27,540 --> 03:05:31,530
that living systems, you know, are organizationally closed,

4989
03:05:31,530 --> 03:05:33,660
are causally closed

4990
03:05:33,660 --> 03:05:36,150
so that they don't depend anymore on the microstate.

4991
03:05:36,150 --> 03:05:38,520
He had a proof, which is very contentious.

4992
03:05:38,520 --> 03:05:41,160
You know, some argue it's true, some argue it's not.

4993
03:05:41,160 --> 03:05:43,470
But he said that because of this,

4994
03:05:43,470 --> 03:05:47,040
living systems are not Church-Turing complete.

4995
03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:50,160
They cannot be represented as formal systems.

4996
03:05:50,160 --> 03:05:52,530
So, you know, in that way, they're not axioms.

4997
03:05:52,530 --> 03:05:55,200
Living systems will not be axioms.

4998
03:05:55,200 --> 03:05:58,140
They can only be partially captured by algorithms.

4999
03:05:58,140 --> 03:06:00,000
Now, again, people fight back and forth

5000
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:01,740
about whether or not his proof was, you know,

5001
03:06:01,740 --> 03:06:02,580
is valid or not.

5002
03:06:02,580 --> 03:06:06,030
But I'm saying, I'm giving you examples of, like, you know,

5003
03:06:06,030 --> 03:06:08,100
when you see the blind spot,

5004
03:06:08,100 --> 03:06:09,450
when you acknowledge the blind spot,

5005
03:06:09,450 --> 03:06:10,890
it opens up a whole other class

5006
03:06:10,890 --> 03:06:13,410
of kinds of scientific investigations.

5007
03:06:13,410 --> 03:06:14,243
You know, the book,

5008
03:06:14,243 --> 03:06:16,170
we thought was gonna be really heretical, right?

5009
03:06:16,170 --> 03:06:17,310
You know, obviously,

5010
03:06:17,310 --> 03:06:20,340
you know most public-facing scientists

5011
03:06:20,340 --> 03:06:21,420
are very sort of in that,

5012
03:06:21,420 --> 03:06:22,650
especially scientific triumphalism,

5013
03:06:22,650 --> 03:06:23,820
and so we were just, like,

5014
03:06:23,820 --> 03:06:25,140
you know, waiting for the fight.

5015
03:06:25,140 --> 03:06:27,240
And then the review from "Science" came out,

5016
03:06:27,240 --> 03:06:30,450
and it was, like, totally pro,

5017
03:06:30,450 --> 03:06:31,830
you know, was very positive.

5018
03:06:31,830 --> 03:06:33,870
We're like, oh my God, you know?

5019
03:06:33,870 --> 03:06:36,000
And then a review came out in "Nature Physics,"

5020
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:37,830
and it was totally positive.

5021
03:06:37,830 --> 03:06:40,020
And then a review came out in "The Wall Street Journal,"

5022
03:06:40,020 --> 03:06:42,690
'cause we kind of criticized not capitalism,

5023
03:06:42,690 --> 03:06:45,480
but we criticized sort all industrial economies,

5024
03:06:45,480 --> 03:06:48,270
that they sort of had been touched by the blind spots.

5025
03:06:48,270 --> 03:06:49,830
Socialism, communism, doesn't matter.

5026
03:06:49,830 --> 03:06:52,740
These extractive, you know, sort of had that sort of view

5027
03:06:52,740 --> 03:06:57,487
that the world is just reducible to, you know, resources.

5028
03:06:57,487 --> 03:06:59,460
"The Wall Street Journal" gave us a great review.

5029
03:06:59,460 --> 03:07:01,893
So it feels like there's actually out there,

5030
03:07:02,850 --> 03:07:04,770
among working scientists in particular,

5031
03:07:04,770 --> 03:07:07,890
there is some dissatisfaction with this triumphalist view

5032
03:07:07,890 --> 03:07:10,950
and a recognition that we need to shift something

5033
03:07:10,950 --> 03:07:13,530
in order to, like, jump past these hurdles

5034
03:07:13,530 --> 03:07:16,548
that we've been arguing about forever.

5035
03:07:16,548 --> 03:07:18,180
You know, we're sort of stuck in a vortex.

5036
03:07:18,180 --> 03:07:20,130
- Well, I mean, I think there is a hunger

5037
03:07:20,130 --> 03:07:22,050
to acknowledge that there's an elephant in the room.

5038
03:07:22,050 --> 03:07:25,080
Like, that we're just removing the agent.

5039
03:07:25,080 --> 03:07:26,610
Like, everyone is doing it,

5040
03:07:26,610 --> 03:07:30,990
and it's like, yeah, yeah, there's the experience,

5041
03:07:30,990 --> 03:07:34,917
and then there's the third-person perspective on the world.

5042
03:07:34,917 --> 03:07:39,000
And so to, man, science from a...

5043
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:40,200
Applying scientific rigor

5044
03:07:40,200 --> 03:07:42,073
from a first-person perspective is very difficult.

5045
03:07:42,073 --> 03:07:44,250
I mean, it is fascinating.

5046
03:07:44,250 --> 03:07:46,110
- I think we can do it, 'cause it's also the thing,

5047
03:07:46,110 --> 03:07:47,340
you know, what's really interesting is,

5048
03:07:47,340 --> 03:07:49,440
I think, it's not just first person.

5049
03:07:49,440 --> 03:07:52,140
It's first and second, right?

5050
03:07:52,140 --> 03:07:55,260
So, like, one idea is that we, you know,

5051
03:07:55,260 --> 03:07:56,880
the idea that, oh, science gives us

5052
03:07:56,880 --> 03:07:58,560
this objective third-person view.

5053
03:07:58,560 --> 03:08:00,420
That's one way of talking about objectivity.

5054
03:08:00,420 --> 03:08:02,490
There's a whole other way, is that I do the experiment,

5055
03:08:02,490 --> 03:08:04,500
you do the experiment, we talk to each other,

5056
03:08:04,500 --> 03:08:07,470
we agree on methods, and we both get the same result.

5057
03:08:07,470 --> 03:08:10,320
That is a very different way of thinking about objectivity.

5058
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:13,590
And it acknowledges that, you know,

5059
03:08:13,590 --> 03:08:15,150
when we talk about agents,

5060
03:08:15,150 --> 03:08:18,240
agency and individuality are flexible, right?

5061
03:08:18,240 --> 03:08:19,410
So there's a great paper,

5062
03:08:19,410 --> 03:08:21,090
speaking of Santa Fe by David Krakauer,

5063
03:08:21,090 --> 03:08:21,923
where they looked at, sort of,

5064
03:08:21,923 --> 03:08:24,480
information-theoretic measures of individuality.

5065
03:08:24,480 --> 03:08:26,370
And what you find is it's actually pretty fluid.

5066
03:08:26,370 --> 03:08:29,070
Like, my liver cell is an individual,

5067
03:08:29,070 --> 03:08:30,360
but really, it's part of the liver.

5068
03:08:30,360 --> 03:08:32,730
And my liver is, you know, a separate system,

5069
03:08:32,730 --> 03:08:34,740
but really, it's part of me.

5070
03:08:34,740 --> 03:08:36,330
So I'm an individual, yay,

5071
03:08:36,330 --> 03:08:38,070
but actually, I'm part of a society.

5072
03:08:38,070 --> 03:08:41,010
And I couldn't be me

5073
03:08:41,010 --> 03:08:43,770
without the entire community of, say, language users, right?

5074
03:08:43,770 --> 03:08:46,110
I wouldn't even be able to frame any questions.

5075
03:08:46,110 --> 03:08:48,330
And my community of language users

5076
03:08:48,330 --> 03:08:50,400
is part of ecosystems, right,

5077
03:08:50,400 --> 03:08:52,710
that are alive, that I am a part of a lineage of.

5078
03:08:52,710 --> 03:08:54,300
This is like Sara Walker stuff.

5079
03:08:54,300 --> 03:08:58,110
And then those ecosystems are part of the biosphere, right?

5080
03:08:58,110 --> 03:09:01,140
We're never separable, as opposed to this very atomizing,

5081
03:09:01,140 --> 03:09:02,880
the triumphalist science view

5082
03:09:02,880 --> 03:09:04,290
is wants like Boltzmann brains.

5083
03:09:04,290 --> 03:09:07,140
You're just a brain floating in the space, you know?

5084
03:09:07,140 --> 03:09:10,320
- Yeah, there is a fascinating degree

5085
03:09:10,320 --> 03:09:12,990
to which agency is fluid.

5086
03:09:12,990 --> 03:09:14,250
Like, you are an individual,

5087
03:09:14,250 --> 03:09:17,430
but you and I talking is a kind of individual.

5088
03:09:17,430 --> 03:09:18,263
- [Adam] Yeah.

5089
03:09:18,263 --> 03:09:22,440
- And then the person listening to this right now

5090
03:09:22,440 --> 03:09:23,658
is also an individual.

5091
03:09:23,658 --> 03:09:24,750
I mean, that's a weird thing too.

5092
03:09:24,750 --> 03:09:25,920
- That's a weird thing, right?

5093
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:28,353
- Because there's a broadcast nature too.

5094
03:09:29,250 --> 03:09:30,930
- This is why information theoretics,

5095
03:09:30,930 --> 03:09:32,730
So the idea that we're pursuing now,

5096
03:09:32,730 --> 03:09:33,780
which I get really excited about,

5097
03:09:33,780 --> 03:09:36,750
is this idea of information architecture, right?

5098
03:09:36,750 --> 03:09:39,030
Or organization, informational organization.

5099
03:09:39,030 --> 03:09:39,863
Because, you know, right,

5100
03:09:39,863 --> 03:09:41,850
physicalism is like, "Everything's atoms."

5101
03:09:41,850 --> 03:09:44,520
But you know, Kant is apparently the one

5102
03:09:44,520 --> 03:09:45,990
who came up with the word organism

5103
03:09:45,990 --> 03:09:49,470
'cause he recognized that life has a weird organization

5104
03:09:49,470 --> 03:09:52,260
that was specifically different from machines.

5105
03:09:52,260 --> 03:09:54,210
And so this idea that,

5106
03:09:54,210 --> 03:09:58,950
how do we engage with the idea that organization,

5107
03:09:58,950 --> 03:10:02,820
which is often, I can be cast in information-theoretic terms

5108
03:10:02,820 --> 03:10:04,863
or computational terms, even,

5109
03:10:05,940 --> 03:10:08,160
it's not really quite physical, right?

5110
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:09,720
It's embodied in physical,

5111
03:10:09,720 --> 03:10:10,680
you know, in the physical,

5112
03:10:10,680 --> 03:10:12,060
has to instantiate in the physical,

5113
03:10:12,060 --> 03:10:15,577
but it also has this other realm of design,

5114
03:10:15,577 --> 03:10:17,940
you know, not design like intelligent design,

5115
03:10:17,940 --> 03:10:20,310
but there's a, you know, organization itself

5116
03:10:20,310 --> 03:10:23,010
is a relationship of constraints and information flow.

5117
03:10:23,010 --> 03:10:26,040
And I think, again, that's an entirely new, interesting way

5118
03:10:26,040 --> 03:10:27,840
that we might get a very different kind of science

5119
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:29,670
that would flow out of that.

5120
03:10:29,670 --> 03:10:34,670
- So going back to Kant and organism versus machine.

5121
03:10:36,090 --> 03:10:40,350
So I showed you a couple of legged robots.

5122
03:10:40,350 --> 03:10:41,220
- Very cool.

5123
03:10:41,220 --> 03:10:44,880
- Is it possible for machines to have agency?

5124
03:10:44,880 --> 03:10:48,150
- I would not discount that possibility.

5125
03:10:48,150 --> 03:10:49,170
I think, you know,

5126
03:10:50,430 --> 03:10:52,200
there's no reason I would say

5127
03:10:52,200 --> 03:10:54,990
that it's impossible that machines could...

5128
03:10:54,990 --> 03:10:56,160
Whatever it manifests,

5129
03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:57,840
that strange loop that we're talking about,

5130
03:10:57,840 --> 03:11:01,080
that autopoiesis, I don't think there's a reason

5131
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:06,060
to say it can't happen in Silicon.

5132
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:06,893
I think whatever it would,

5133
03:11:06,893 --> 03:11:08,370
it would be very different from us,

5134
03:11:08,370 --> 03:11:09,240
like, the idea that it would be like, oh,

5135
03:11:09,240 --> 03:11:11,430
it would be just like us, but now it's instantiated.

5136
03:11:11,430 --> 03:11:13,830
And I think it might have very different kind

5137
03:11:13,830 --> 03:11:15,573
of experiential nature.

5138
03:11:17,495 --> 03:11:18,540
I don't think what we have now,

5139
03:11:18,540 --> 03:11:21,723
like the LLMs, are really there,

5140
03:11:22,650 --> 03:11:26,130
but, yeah, I'm not gonna say that it's not possible.

5141
03:11:26,130 --> 03:11:29,070
- I wonder how far you can get with imitation,

5142
03:11:29,070 --> 03:11:30,900
which is essentially what LLMs are doing,

5143
03:11:30,900 --> 03:11:32,370
so imitating humans.

5144
03:11:32,370 --> 03:11:35,730
And I wouldn't discount either the possibility

5145
03:11:35,730 --> 03:11:37,730
that, through imitation, you can achieve

5146
03:11:38,760 --> 03:11:42,060
what you would call consciousness or agency

5147
03:11:42,060 --> 03:11:44,130
or the ability to have experience.

5148
03:11:44,130 --> 03:11:45,780
I think for most of us humans to think,

5149
03:11:45,780 --> 03:11:48,150
oh, that's just fake, that's copying.

5150
03:11:48,150 --> 03:11:49,620
But there's some degree

5151
03:11:49,620 --> 03:11:52,263
to which we humans are just copying each other.

5152
03:11:53,190 --> 03:11:55,800
We just are really good imitation machines.

5153
03:11:55,800 --> 03:11:57,660
Coming from babies, we were born in this world,

5154
03:11:57,660 --> 03:11:59,490
and we're just learning to imitate each other.

5155
03:11:59,490 --> 03:12:00,750
And through the imitation

5156
03:12:00,750 --> 03:12:03,513
and the tension in the disagreements in the imitations,

5157
03:12:04,847 --> 03:12:08,100
we gain personality, perspective, all that kind of stuff.

5158
03:12:08,100 --> 03:12:11,430
- Yeah, so, you know, it's possible, right?

5159
03:12:11,430 --> 03:12:14,040
It's possible, but I think probably the view I'm advocating

5160
03:12:14,040 --> 03:12:18,270
would say that one of the most important parts

5161
03:12:18,270 --> 03:12:22,130
of agency is, there's something called E4,

5162
03:12:22,130 --> 03:12:24,270
the E4 theory of cognition,

5163
03:12:24,270 --> 03:12:27,330
embodiment, enaction, embedding,

5164
03:12:27,330 --> 03:12:29,520
and there's another one, extension.

5165
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:33,570
So the idea is that you actually have to be in a body,

5166
03:12:33,570 --> 03:12:35,790
which is itself part of an environment.

5167
03:12:35,790 --> 03:12:39,210
That is, the physical nature of it

5168
03:12:39,210 --> 03:12:42,030
and of the extension

5169
03:12:42,030 --> 03:12:46,170
with other living systems as well is essential.

5170
03:12:46,170 --> 03:12:48,330
So that's why I think the LLMs are not gonna,

5171
03:12:48,330 --> 03:12:50,460
it's not just imitation.

5172
03:12:50,460 --> 03:12:51,810
This goes to the brain in the vat thing.

5173
03:12:51,810 --> 03:12:53,520
I did an article about the brain in the vat,

5174
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:55,830
which was really Evans, I was reporting on Evans,

5175
03:12:55,830 --> 03:12:57,900
where they did the brain-in-the-vat argument.

5176
03:12:57,900 --> 03:12:59,340
But they said, look, in the end, actually,

5177
03:12:59,340 --> 03:13:00,900
the only way to actually get a real brain in the vat

5178
03:13:00,900 --> 03:13:02,337
is actually to have a brain in a body.

5179
03:13:02,337 --> 03:13:04,500
And it could be a robot body, you know,

5180
03:13:04,500 --> 03:13:05,940
but you still need a brain in the body.

5181
03:13:05,940 --> 03:13:08,982
So I don't think LLMs will get there because they can't,

5182
03:13:08,982 --> 03:13:11,070
you know, you really need to be embedded in a world,

5183
03:13:11,070 --> 03:13:13,137
at least that's the E4 idea.

5184
03:13:13,137 --> 03:13:15,870
- The E4, "The 4E approach to cognition argues

5185
03:13:15,870 --> 03:13:18,240
that cognition does not occur solely in the head,

5186
03:13:18,240 --> 03:13:22,950
but is also embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended

5187
03:13:22,950 --> 03:13:27,300
and by way of extracranial processes and structures.

5188
03:13:27,300 --> 03:13:28,600
Though very much in vogue,

5189
03:13:29,730 --> 03:13:31,140
4E cognition has received

5190
03:13:31,140 --> 03:13:32,940
relatively few critical evaluations."

5191
03:13:32,940 --> 03:13:34,027
This is a paper.

5192
03:13:34,027 --> 03:13:36,390
"By reflecting on two recent collections,

5193
03:13:36,390 --> 03:13:38,520
this article reviews the 4E paradigm

5194
03:13:38,520 --> 03:13:41,790
with a view to assessing the strengths and weaknesses."

5195
03:13:41,790 --> 03:13:43,410
It's fascinating, I mean, yeah,

5196
03:13:43,410 --> 03:13:47,550
the branches of what is cognition extends far,

5197
03:13:47,550 --> 03:13:49,230
and it could go real far.

5198
03:13:49,230 --> 03:13:52,530
- Right, there's a great story about an interaction

5199
03:13:52,530 --> 03:13:55,020
between Jonas Salk, who was very much a reductionist,

5200
03:13:55,020 --> 03:13:56,550
you know, the great biologist,

5201
03:13:56,550 --> 03:13:59,430
and Gregory Bateson, who was a cyberneticist.

5202
03:13:59,430 --> 03:14:01,380
And Bateson always loved to poke people.

5203
03:14:01,380 --> 03:14:04,260
And he said to Salk, he said, you know, "Where's your mind?"

5204
03:14:04,260 --> 03:14:06,120
And, you know, Salk went up here.

5205
03:14:06,120 --> 03:14:08,487
And Bateson said, "No, no, no. Out here."

5206
03:14:08,487 --> 03:14:10,740
And what he really meant was this extended idea.

5207
03:14:10,740 --> 03:14:12,483
It's not just within your cranium.

5208
03:14:14,450 --> 03:14:15,870
To have experience,

5209
03:14:15,870 --> 03:14:16,950
you know, experience, in some sense,

5210
03:14:16,950 --> 03:14:18,570
is not a thing you have.

5211
03:14:18,570 --> 03:14:21,270
It is a thing you do, right?

5212
03:14:21,270 --> 03:14:23,250
You almost perform it in a way,

5213
03:14:23,250 --> 03:14:26,250
which is why both actually having a body,

5214
03:14:26,250 --> 03:14:28,440
but having the body itself be in a world

5215
03:14:28,440 --> 03:14:30,540
with other bodies is,

5216
03:14:30,540 --> 03:14:32,550
from this perspective, is really important.

5217
03:14:32,550 --> 03:14:33,543
And it's very attractive to me.

5218
03:14:33,543 --> 03:14:34,376
And, you know, seeing again,

5219
03:14:34,376 --> 03:14:35,290
you know, if we're really gonna do science with them,

5220
03:14:35,290 --> 03:14:36,600
we're gonna have to, like,

5221
03:14:36,600 --> 03:14:38,850
have these ideas crash up against data,

5222
03:14:38,850 --> 03:14:40,080
you know, crash up against...

5223
03:14:40,080 --> 03:14:41,500
We can't just armchair it,

5224
03:14:41,500 --> 03:14:45,810
you know, couch quarterbacking it.

5225
03:14:45,810 --> 03:14:47,550
But I think there's a lot of possibility here.

5226
03:14:47,550 --> 03:14:49,850
It's a very radically different way of looking

5227
03:14:51,468 --> 03:14:53,100
at what we mean by nature.

5228
03:14:53,100 --> 03:14:54,060
- What do you make of the fact

5229
03:14:54,060 --> 03:14:56,340
that this individual observer,

5230
03:14:56,340 --> 03:14:58,290
you as an individual observer,

5231
03:14:58,290 --> 03:15:00,730
only get a finite amount of time

5232
03:15:01,680 --> 03:15:03,450
to exist in this world?

5233
03:15:03,450 --> 03:15:04,530
Does it make you sad?

5234
03:15:04,530 --> 03:15:06,630
- No, actually, it doesn't make me sad.

5235
03:15:06,630 --> 03:15:09,990
So, okay, so, you know, full reveal,

5236
03:15:09,990 --> 03:15:11,970
I have been doing contemplative practice

5237
03:15:11,970 --> 03:15:14,190
in the Zen tradition for 30 years.

5238
03:15:14,190 --> 03:15:16,860
I've been staring at a wall for 30 years,

5239
03:15:16,860 --> 03:15:18,157
and it's taught me a lot, right?

5240
03:15:18,157 --> 03:15:21,720
You know, I really value what that practice

5241
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:25,140
has given me about the nature of experience.

5242
03:15:25,140 --> 03:15:26,743
And one of the things it's taught me is, like, you know,

5243
03:15:26,743 --> 03:15:28,290
I don't really matter that very much.

5244
03:15:28,290 --> 03:15:31,470
You know, this thing I call Adam Frank is really, you know,

5245
03:15:31,470 --> 03:15:33,480
it's kind of a construct, you know?

5246
03:15:33,480 --> 03:15:35,100
There's this process going on

5247
03:15:35,100 --> 03:15:38,340
of which I am actually fundamentally, and that's super cool,

5248
03:15:38,340 --> 03:15:40,260
but you know, it's gonna go.

5249
03:15:40,260 --> 03:15:41,700
You know, I don't know where it came from.

5250
03:15:41,700 --> 03:15:44,490
It's gonna go, I don't really need it to, you know,

5251
03:15:44,490 --> 03:15:45,450
and then who the hell knows?

5252
03:15:45,450 --> 03:15:47,550
You know, I'm not an advocate for an afterlife,

5253
03:15:47,550 --> 03:15:48,650
but just that, like...

5254
03:15:49,800 --> 03:15:52,500
Zen has this idea of beyond birth and death,

5255
03:15:52,500 --> 03:15:53,730
and they don't mean reincarnation.

5256
03:15:53,730 --> 03:15:54,930
What they mean is, dude,

5257
03:15:54,930 --> 03:15:57,420
you don't even really understand what life is.

5258
03:15:57,420 --> 03:15:58,253
You know what I mean?

5259
03:15:58,253 --> 03:15:59,670
On like this, you know, this core level

5260
03:15:59,670 --> 03:16:00,870
of your own experience.

5261
03:16:00,870 --> 03:16:02,040
So, you know, your ideas

5262
03:16:02,040 --> 03:16:04,893
about what death is are equally ill-formed.

5263
03:16:06,246 --> 03:16:08,850
So, you know, contemplative practice really tries

5264
03:16:08,850 --> 03:16:10,470
to focus on experience itself.

5265
03:16:10,470 --> 03:16:14,460
Like, spend five days at a Zen sesshin

5266
03:16:14,460 --> 03:16:15,630
doing contemplative practice

5267
03:16:15,630 --> 03:16:18,210
from, you know, 7:00 AM until 9:00 PM,

5268
03:16:18,210 --> 03:16:19,860
obviously with breaks.

5269
03:16:19,860 --> 03:16:22,110
And you'll really get a much deeper understanding

5270
03:16:22,110 --> 03:16:24,150
of, like, what my own experience is.

5271
03:16:24,150 --> 03:16:25,440
What is it really like?

5272
03:16:25,440 --> 03:16:28,800
It forces you to learn how to stabilize your attention,

5273
03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:30,270
'cause, you know, attention is kinda like this thing, like,

5274
03:16:30,270 --> 03:16:31,620
it's usually just, like, "Oh, over there.

5275
03:16:31,620 --> 03:16:33,450
Oh, my foot hurts. Oh, I gotta do my taxes.

5276
03:16:33,450 --> 03:16:35,220
Oh, you know, what's that guy over there?

5277
03:16:35,220 --> 03:16:37,230
Why is he wearing those stupid shoes?"

5278
03:16:37,230 --> 03:16:38,220
And with the contemplative practice,

5279
03:16:38,220 --> 03:16:39,660
you learn how to stabilize it.

5280
03:16:39,660 --> 03:16:40,500
And once you stabilize it,

5281
03:16:40,500 --> 03:16:42,420
you can now begin to sort of explore

5282
03:16:42,420 --> 03:16:44,040
the phenomenal nature of it.

5283
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:45,930
But I think I've learned from that

5284
03:16:45,930 --> 03:16:47,940
is, like, kind of, whatever.

5285
03:16:47,940 --> 03:16:50,910
You know, I'm not really kind of real to begin with.

5286
03:16:50,910 --> 03:16:53,427
The Adam Frank part, the identity, the thing,

5287
03:16:53,427 --> 03:16:55,650
and the part of me that is real,

5288
03:16:55,650 --> 03:16:57,060
is, you know, everything's coming and going.

5289
03:16:57,060 --> 03:16:58,110
It's all coming and going.

5290
03:16:58,110 --> 03:17:00,060
Well, how could I ever not come and go?

5291
03:17:00,060 --> 03:17:03,180
And the entire world is just, you know,

5292
03:17:03,180 --> 03:17:05,790
Buddhism has this idea of codependent arising.

5293
03:17:05,790 --> 03:17:08,610
Nothing exists, nothing has self-nature.

5294
03:17:08,610 --> 03:17:10,050
Nothing exists by itself.

5295
03:17:10,050 --> 03:17:13,833
It's an endless, infinitely connected web.

5296
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,070
- But still, there's a deliciousness

5297
03:17:17,070 --> 03:17:18,810
to the individual experience.

5298
03:17:18,810 --> 03:17:21,030
You get attached to it, and it ends,

5299
03:17:21,030 --> 03:17:24,510
and it's good while it lasts, and it sucks that it ends.

5300
03:17:24,510 --> 03:17:25,537
Like, you can just be like,

5301
03:17:25,537 --> 03:17:27,360
"Ah, well, everything comes and goes."

5302
03:17:27,360 --> 03:17:31,380
But like, I was eating ice cream yesterday,

5303
03:17:31,380 --> 03:17:33,810
found this awesome low-carb ice cream

5304
03:17:33,810 --> 03:17:38,163
called D'Lites here in Austin, and, you know, it ends.

5305
03:17:39,960 --> 03:17:42,360
And I was staring at the empty container, and it was-

5306
03:17:42,360 --> 03:17:44,610
- That's beautiful, man. I love that.

5307
03:17:44,610 --> 03:17:46,050
- You could say like, yeah, well,

5308
03:17:46,050 --> 03:17:47,370
that's how it all is, but yeah.

5309
03:17:47,370 --> 03:17:49,490
- Can I say that, so what I've learned from,

5310
03:17:49,490 --> 03:17:50,880
so I love your idea

5311
03:17:50,880 --> 03:17:53,670
of the deliciousness of it, you know?

5312
03:17:53,670 --> 03:17:54,990
But what I think happens

5313
03:17:54,990 --> 03:17:56,910
with contemplative practice, when it deepens,

5314
03:17:56,910 --> 03:17:59,610
is that you're not just saying, right?

5315
03:17:59,610 --> 03:18:01,950
This is why, you know, so I do koan practice.

5316
03:18:01,950 --> 03:18:04,650
So this is a tradition in Zen that it was established,

5317
03:18:04,650 --> 03:18:06,690
it was a teaching method that was established,

5318
03:18:06,690 --> 03:18:09,270
like, you know, 1,000 years ago, these book of koans.

5319
03:18:09,270 --> 03:18:10,800
And every koan, you know,

5320
03:18:10,800 --> 03:18:12,270
if you've ever read "Godel, Escher, Bach"

5321
03:18:12,270 --> 03:18:13,950
he's got a whole chapter on koans.

5322
03:18:13,950 --> 03:18:16,440
They're kind of non-logical problems

5323
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:18,120
that you have to work on.

5324
03:18:18,120 --> 03:18:19,650
One of my favorite one was,

5325
03:18:19,650 --> 03:18:22,950
stop the sound of the distant temple bell.

5326
03:18:22,950 --> 03:18:24,420
You know, you're like, what?

5327
03:18:24,420 --> 03:18:26,340
Every time my teacher gives it to me, I'm like,

5328
03:18:26,340 --> 03:18:27,900
what are you talking about, you know?

5329
03:18:27,900 --> 03:18:29,580
This whole Zen thing of, like,

5330
03:18:29,580 --> 03:18:30,780
up is down, but down is up,

5331
03:18:30,780 --> 03:18:32,340
you must understand this.

5332
03:18:32,340 --> 03:18:35,280
So, you know, your job with these koans is to sit with them,

5333
03:18:35,280 --> 03:18:38,190
is to sit with them until you sort of kind of, you know,

5334
03:18:38,190 --> 03:18:40,290
you realize what the thing is trying to teach you,

5335
03:18:40,290 --> 03:18:42,870
what aspect of experience it's trying to teach you.

5336
03:18:42,870 --> 03:18:43,980
So there's no answer.

5337
03:18:43,980 --> 03:18:45,720
And in fact, actually, you don't give an answer.

5338
03:18:45,720 --> 03:18:47,640
You actually usually have to demonstrate.

5339
03:18:47,640 --> 03:18:49,500
The first time when I sat, you know, when I did a koan

5340
03:18:49,500 --> 03:18:50,333
and the guy was like,

5341
03:18:50,333 --> 03:18:52,020
"Don't tell me the answer, show me the answer,"

5342
03:18:52,020 --> 03:18:54,390
I was like, what are you talking about?

5343
03:18:54,390 --> 03:18:55,760
But after doing these for years now,

5344
03:18:55,760 --> 03:18:59,490
you know, I've kind of learned the language of them.

5345
03:18:59,490 --> 03:19:01,380
So I could never tell you, if I told you the answer,

5346
03:19:01,380 --> 03:19:02,580
I could give you a koan and tell you the answer,

5347
03:19:02,580 --> 03:19:03,690
you'd be like, what?

5348
03:19:03,690 --> 03:19:06,300
You know, it's not the words.

5349
03:19:06,300 --> 03:19:07,410
It's the, you know.

5350
03:19:07,410 --> 03:19:10,140
So, like, your experience of, like, yeah, the cup is empty,

5351
03:19:10,140 --> 03:19:12,590
with contemplative practice, as it deepens over years,

5352
03:19:12,590 --> 03:19:13,620
it really does take years.

5353
03:19:13,620 --> 03:19:14,730
Just like anything in math,

5354
03:19:14,730 --> 03:19:17,160
it took me years to understand LaGrangian.

5355
03:19:17,160 --> 03:19:18,540
You kind of come to a deeper understanding

5356
03:19:18,540 --> 03:19:20,160
with, like, yeah, the words of, like,

5357
03:19:20,160 --> 03:19:22,380
it's not just, like, oh, everything changes.

5358
03:19:22,380 --> 03:19:24,390
You actually feel that movement.

5359
03:19:24,390 --> 03:19:27,840
Like, you feel it with, like, breath to breath, you know?

5360
03:19:27,840 --> 03:19:29,340
And it really becomes,

5361
03:19:29,340 --> 03:19:30,203
sometimes I have this feeling,

5362
03:19:30,203 --> 03:19:32,970
this is messed up, but of just joy,

5363
03:19:32,970 --> 03:19:34,590
and it's not connected to anything.

5364
03:19:34,590 --> 03:19:36,210
That's what I've kind of gotten from practice.

5365
03:19:36,210 --> 03:19:38,100
It's just like, yeah, you know,

5366
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:41,550
that passage, that infinite passage of moment to moment,

5367
03:19:41,550 --> 03:19:44,110
that is truly the way things are, and it's okay.

5368
03:19:44,110 --> 03:19:46,920
Like, it's not okay because I have a feeling about it okay.

5369
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:49,277
I want it to be okay. It just is okay.

5370
03:19:49,277 --> 03:19:50,680
And so really, it's a pretty awesome thing.

5371
03:19:50,680 --> 03:19:52,740
- Yeah. That's beautiful.

5372
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:53,760
Maybe it's the genetics,

5373
03:19:53,760 --> 03:19:55,350
maybe it's the biochemistry in my brain,

5374
03:19:55,350 --> 03:19:58,110
but I generally have that joy about experience,

5375
03:19:58,110 --> 03:20:00,210
just a amorphous joy.

5376
03:20:00,210 --> 03:20:01,290
But it seems like,

5377
03:20:01,290 --> 03:20:03,330
again, maybe it's my Eastern European roots,

5378
03:20:03,330 --> 03:20:05,130
but there's always, like, a melancholy

5379
03:20:05,130 --> 03:20:07,530
that's also sitting next to the joy.

5380
03:20:07,530 --> 03:20:09,640
And I think it always feels

5381
03:20:10,680 --> 03:20:13,800
like they're intricately linked.

5382
03:20:13,800 --> 03:20:14,700
So the melancholy

5383
03:20:14,700 --> 03:20:17,880
is maybe about the finiteness of experience,

5384
03:20:17,880 --> 03:20:20,744
And the joy is just about the beauty of experience,

5385
03:20:20,744 --> 03:20:22,150
and they're just kind of sitting there.

5386
03:20:22,150 --> 03:20:23,490
- Yeah, which is cool, actually,

5387
03:20:23,490 --> 03:20:25,830
because, you know, I come from Eastern,

5388
03:20:25,830 --> 03:20:29,100
my roots are Eastern European as well, going back.

5389
03:20:29,100 --> 03:20:30,123
And I get it, right?

5390
03:20:31,110 --> 03:20:32,280
But that's also the cool thing,

5391
03:20:32,280 --> 03:20:33,840
I think one of the things is, like,

5392
03:20:33,840 --> 03:20:35,430
yeah, well, that is what it is.

5393
03:20:35,430 --> 03:20:36,337
That is what it is, right? You don't have to do anything.

5394
03:20:36,337 --> 03:20:38,940
You don't have to, like, manipulate it or move it around,

5395
03:20:38,940 --> 03:20:41,160
or, like, yeah, this is the experience, you know?

5396
03:20:41,160 --> 03:20:43,020
- Can you speak to just the practical nature

5397
03:20:43,020 --> 03:20:45,030
of sitting there from 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM?

5398
03:20:45,030 --> 03:20:46,830
- Like, what the hell are you doing, bro?

5399
03:20:46,830 --> 03:20:47,917
- What's powerful? What's fascinating to you?

5400
03:20:47,917 --> 03:20:50,460
What have you learned from just the experience

5401
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:51,720
of staring at a wall?

5402
03:20:51,720 --> 03:20:54,330
- Yeah, yeah, so, you know, it's not really,

5403
03:20:54,330 --> 03:20:55,890
I mean, you're staring, you're facing a wall,

5404
03:20:55,890 --> 03:20:56,910
and what you're doing is you're,

5405
03:20:56,910 --> 03:20:58,320
you know, you're just sitting with...

5406
03:20:58,320 --> 03:21:00,900
You know, there's different meditative practices, right?

5407
03:21:00,900 --> 03:21:02,550
There's counting breaths. So that's usually what I do.

5408
03:21:02,550 --> 03:21:03,960
I sit down, I start counting breaths.

5409
03:21:03,960 --> 03:21:05,010
And for the first half hour,

5410
03:21:05,010 --> 03:21:07,143
it's just like, blah, blah, blah.

5411
03:21:08,010 --> 03:21:09,270
Like I said, I'm thinking about my taxes.

5412
03:21:09,270 --> 03:21:10,890
I'm thinking about what I gotta do later on,

5413
03:21:10,890 --> 03:21:12,060
yada, yada, yada.

5414
03:21:12,060 --> 03:21:14,432
First time I ever did a full sesshin,

5415
03:21:14,432 --> 03:21:15,540
a two-day sesshin, I swear to God,

5416
03:21:15,540 --> 03:21:18,600
I had Bruce Springsteen's "Born to Run" album track through

5417
03:21:18,600 --> 03:21:20,670
from the beginning to the end with the pauses.

5418
03:21:20,670 --> 03:21:22,008
This was back in when there were LPs

5419
03:21:22,008 --> 03:21:23,688
with the fricking pauses. - Nice.

5420
03:21:23,688 --> 03:21:24,521
- You know, 'cause my mind was just like,

5421
03:21:24,521 --> 03:21:25,680
I need to do something.

5422
03:21:25,680 --> 03:21:28,350
So it literally played the whole album in order.

5423
03:21:28,350 --> 03:21:29,183
- That's pretty cool, actually.

5424
03:21:29,183 --> 03:21:30,630
- Yeah, it was pretty amazing to see,

5425
03:21:30,630 --> 03:21:31,470
you know, 'cause you really do,

5426
03:21:31,470 --> 03:21:33,570
you see the dynamics of your mind.

5427
03:21:33,570 --> 03:21:35,866
But what happens is, and this took me a while,

5428
03:21:35,866 --> 03:21:38,280
I used to hate sitting, you know?

5429
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:39,830
I do it, but I...

5430
03:21:40,890 --> 03:21:43,950
After a while, the mind gets exhausted.

5431
03:21:43,950 --> 03:21:45,720
Like, that part of the mind, the upper level,

5432
03:21:45,720 --> 03:21:47,250
the roof brain chatter is just like,

5433
03:21:47,250 --> 03:21:48,570
there's nothing else to do.

5434
03:21:48,570 --> 03:21:49,403
And then you get bored.

5435
03:21:49,403 --> 03:21:50,820
And now I realize

5436
03:21:50,820 --> 03:21:52,770
that's when something interesting is gonna happen,

5437
03:21:52,770 --> 03:21:54,330
'cause you kind of, like, drop down.

5438
03:21:54,330 --> 03:21:57,090
And now it's a very physical practice.

5439
03:21:57,090 --> 03:21:59,070
People think you're just sitting there not thinking

5440
03:21:59,070 --> 03:22:00,510
or thinking about not thinking.

5441
03:22:00,510 --> 03:22:02,160
Actually, it becomes a very physical process

5442
03:22:02,160 --> 03:22:04,290
where you're really just following the breath,

5443
03:22:04,290 --> 03:22:06,060
you're kind of riding the breath,

5444
03:22:06,060 --> 03:22:08,790
and it gets very quiet, you know?

5445
03:22:08,790 --> 03:22:11,520
And within that quietness,

5446
03:22:11,520 --> 03:22:12,570
you know, there's a path.

5447
03:22:12,570 --> 03:22:14,190
You know, because, obviously,

5448
03:22:14,190 --> 03:22:16,057
Buddhism is always like, you know,

5449
03:22:16,057 --> 03:22:18,660
you know, not about thinking, but it's a huge literature.

5450
03:22:18,660 --> 03:22:19,620
So these guys are always about,

5451
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:21,540
don't think, I've written all this stuff,

5452
03:22:21,540 --> 03:22:22,373
but they're guideposts.

5453
03:22:22,373 --> 03:22:24,420
They're like the finger pointing at the moon.

5454
03:22:24,420 --> 03:22:26,550
And you know, there's the idea, first,

5455
03:22:26,550 --> 03:22:29,160
you know, your mind is usually scattered, right?

5456
03:22:29,160 --> 03:22:29,993
Right now, when I walk out,

5457
03:22:29,993 --> 03:22:30,826
I'm gonna go get the Uber,

5458
03:22:30,826 --> 03:22:32,430
and mind's gonna be all over the place.

5459
03:22:32,430 --> 03:22:34,710
But with sitting, first, you concentrate the mind

5460
03:22:34,710 --> 03:22:36,120
so that there's no more scatter anymore.

5461
03:22:36,120 --> 03:22:37,020
The thoughts are still happening,

5462
03:22:37,020 --> 03:22:38,580
but you're just not there happening up there.

5463
03:22:38,580 --> 03:22:40,110
You're not even paying attention to them.

5464
03:22:40,110 --> 03:22:43,740
And then as time goes on, you unify the mind,

5465
03:22:43,740 --> 03:22:45,810
which is this very powerful thing

5466
03:22:45,810 --> 03:22:48,600
where, kind of, the self drops away, you know?

5467
03:22:48,600 --> 03:22:49,950
And there's just this presence.

5468
03:22:49,950 --> 03:22:51,930
It's kind of like a raw presence.

5469
03:22:51,930 --> 03:22:55,830
And that's often where the joy up-wells from.

5470
03:22:55,830 --> 03:22:56,700
But you sit with whatever.

5471
03:22:56,700 --> 03:22:58,342
Maybe you're gonna sit, and you're gonna have, like,

5472
03:22:58,342 --> 03:23:00,690
you know, maybe you're gonna go through, like, an hour

5473
03:23:00,690 --> 03:23:03,360
of being bummed out about your mom who died or something.

5474
03:23:03,360 --> 03:23:06,360
You know, you're just gonna sit with whatever comes up.

5475
03:23:06,360 --> 03:23:08,340
That's why the sitting part, you're making the commitment.

5476
03:23:08,340 --> 03:23:10,200
I'm gonna sit here with whatever comes up,

5477
03:23:10,200 --> 03:23:11,430
I will not be moved.

5478
03:23:11,430 --> 03:23:13,620
And then what you come away with, actually, over time,

5479
03:23:13,620 --> 03:23:15,420
it actually changes kind of who you are.

5480
03:23:15,420 --> 03:23:17,220
Like, I'm still the asshole I was

5481
03:23:17,220 --> 03:23:18,223
from New Jersey growing up,

5482
03:23:18,223 --> 03:23:21,723
but I just have more space now for things, you know?

5483
03:23:24,150 --> 03:23:25,890
- Yeah. Once Jersey, always Jersey.

5484
03:23:25,890 --> 03:23:26,970
- Always Jersey.

5485
03:23:26,970 --> 03:23:28,650
- But I love that you had Bruce Springsteen

5486
03:23:28,650 --> 03:23:29,483
just blasting in your head.

5487
03:23:29,483 --> 03:23:30,930
- Yeah. That was so amazing.

5488
03:23:30,930 --> 03:23:31,763
- Why are we here?

5489
03:23:31,763 --> 03:23:33,780
What do you think is the purpose,

5490
03:23:33,780 --> 03:23:35,850
the meaning of human existence?

5491
03:23:35,850 --> 03:23:37,740
- It's good that we just had the last conversation,

5492
03:23:37,740 --> 03:23:40,440
because I'm gonna give this answer, which is so corny.

5493
03:23:41,640 --> 03:23:43,800
It's love. And I'm not messing around.

5494
03:23:43,800 --> 03:23:44,910
'Cause really, actually what happens, you know,

5495
03:23:44,910 --> 03:23:47,430
so within Buddhism, there's the idea

5496
03:23:47,430 --> 03:23:48,600
of the bodhisattva principle.

5497
03:23:48,600 --> 03:23:50,910
You're here to help. You're just here to help, right?

5498
03:23:50,910 --> 03:23:53,700
Compassion, like, that's a really essential part

5499
03:23:53,700 --> 03:23:55,860
of this path, of the dharma path.

5500
03:23:55,860 --> 03:23:56,940
And when I first started out, I was like,

5501
03:23:56,940 --> 03:23:58,830
I don't care about compassion.

5502
03:23:58,830 --> 03:24:00,090
I'm here for knowledge, right?

5503
03:24:00,090 --> 03:24:02,850
You know, I started contemplative practice,

5504
03:24:02,850 --> 03:24:04,320
because of the usual thing, I was suffering.

5505
03:24:04,320 --> 03:24:05,850
You know, the reason everybody comes to things like this.

5506
03:24:05,850 --> 03:24:06,683
You know, life was hard,

5507
03:24:06,683 --> 03:24:09,630
I was going through stuff, but I also wanted knowledge.

5508
03:24:09,630 --> 03:24:11,880
I wanted to understand the foundational nature of reality.

5509
03:24:11,880 --> 03:24:13,590
So I was like, "Compassion, whatever."

5510
03:24:13,590 --> 03:24:16,110
But then I found out that you can't get that.

5511
03:24:16,110 --> 03:24:18,540
You can't go to this level without compassion.

5512
03:24:18,540 --> 03:24:20,580
Somehow in this process,

5513
03:24:20,580 --> 03:24:23,310
you realize that it really is

5514
03:24:23,310 --> 03:24:27,300
about helping all sentient beings.

5515
03:24:27,300 --> 03:24:28,133
That's the way they frame,

5516
03:24:28,133 --> 03:24:30,420
you know, just being here to help.

5517
03:24:30,420 --> 03:24:32,280
So, I know that sounds cornball,

5518
03:24:32,280 --> 03:24:33,600
but especially for a guy from Jersey,

5519
03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:35,820
which is, like, you know, the main thing is to get over.

5520
03:24:35,820 --> 03:24:37,670
You're like, your job is to get over.

5521
03:24:39,150 --> 03:24:40,148
But that's really what I found.

5522
03:24:40,148 --> 03:24:42,360
It is actually, and so that joy,

5523
03:24:42,360 --> 03:24:44,790
the joy, some of that joy is just, it's like this...

5524
03:24:44,790 --> 03:24:45,623
One of the things I have,

5525
03:24:45,623 --> 03:24:47,790
when I have like really, you know,

5526
03:24:47,790 --> 03:24:48,900
there's a kind of experience I'll have

5527
03:24:48,900 --> 03:24:49,733
in contemplative practice,

5528
03:24:49,733 --> 03:24:50,940
which will carry out into the world,

5529
03:24:50,940 --> 03:24:52,320
which is just this gratitude

5530
03:24:52,320 --> 03:24:55,017
for the fact that the world gives you everything.

5531
03:24:55,017 --> 03:24:56,220
And there's a certain way, right?

5532
03:24:56,220 --> 03:24:58,650
Just the blue sky and the breath.

5533
03:24:58,650 --> 03:25:01,680
The world is just giving you itself completely unhindered.

5534
03:25:01,680 --> 03:25:03,540
It holds nothing back.

5535
03:25:03,540 --> 03:25:05,070
And yeah, that's kind of the experience.

5536
03:25:05,070 --> 03:25:06,990
And then you kind of like, oh, I need to be helpful

5537
03:25:06,990 --> 03:25:08,810
'cause who's not having this experience, you know?

5538
03:25:08,810 --> 03:25:10,860
- So just love for the world as it is.

5539
03:25:10,860 --> 03:25:12,750
- Love for the, and all the beings who are suffering.

5540
03:25:12,750 --> 03:25:14,760
Everybody's suffering. Everybody's suffering.

5541
03:25:14,760 --> 03:25:16,740
You know, your worst political opponent,

5542
03:25:16,740 --> 03:25:18,327
they're suffering, you know?

5543
03:25:18,327 --> 03:25:21,750
And our job is just to try and drop our biases

5544
03:25:21,750 --> 03:25:24,240
and our stories and see this fundamental level

5545
03:25:24,240 --> 03:25:26,280
at which life is occurring.

5546
03:25:26,280 --> 03:25:29,400
- And hopefully, there's many alien civilizations

5547
03:25:29,400 --> 03:25:30,900
out there going through the same journey

5548
03:25:30,900 --> 03:25:32,190
out of suffering, towards love.

5549
03:25:32,190 --> 03:25:35,190
- Yeah, you know, that may be a universal thing

5550
03:25:35,190 --> 03:25:36,570
about what it means to be alive.

5551
03:25:36,570 --> 03:25:38,070
- I hope so. - I hope so too.

5552
03:25:38,070 --> 03:25:39,750
That, or they're coming to eat us.

5553
03:25:39,750 --> 03:25:41,700
- Especially if they're a type III civilization.

5554
03:25:41,700 --> 03:25:43,950
- That's right. And they got really big guns.

5555
03:25:45,810 --> 03:25:48,210
- Well, this was a truly mind-blowing, fascinating,

5556
03:25:48,210 --> 03:25:49,440
and just awesome conversation.

5557
03:25:49,440 --> 03:25:50,910
Adam, thank you for everything you do,

5558
03:25:50,910 --> 03:25:52,200
and thank you for talking today.

5559

5560
03:25:54,750 --> 03:25:57,690

And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.

5564
03:26:05,107 --> 03:26:10,107
"The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.

5565
03:26:10,830 --> 03:26:14,100
Our feeblest contemplations of the cosmos stir us.

5566
03:26:14,100 --> 03:26:16,410
There's a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice,

5567
03:26:16,410 --> 03:26:19,710
a faint sensation, as if a distant memory,

5568
03:26:19,710 --> 03:26:21,303
or falling from a height.

5569
03:26:22,170 --> 03:26:26,787
We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries."

5570
03:26:27,690 --> 03:26:30,663
Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
