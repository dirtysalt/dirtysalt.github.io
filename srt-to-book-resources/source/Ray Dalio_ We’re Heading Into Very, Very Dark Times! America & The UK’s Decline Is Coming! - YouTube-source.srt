1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,250
pay attention. pain plus reflection equals progress.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,250
and from that principle, my company became the largest hedge fund in the world.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,250
managing how much? $ 150 billion.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,769
but i learned

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,370
that history of things

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,570
that never happened in my lifetime before were important things to understand in order to predict the future.

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,130
and we can get into that if you want. peace.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,650
so ray dallio

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,650
is the legendary billionaire investor who decoded the cycles of human history to predict financial crashes.

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,050
build the world's largest hedge fund.

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,930
and now to warn us about what lies ahead. are you optimistic about the future of the uk?

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,410
no.

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,530
what about the united states?

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,010
no.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,410
why?

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:38,890
okay.

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,489
in order to bet on what's going to happen on the global economy, i learned

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,809
that there's five big forces that create a big cycle that's repeated through history

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,090
which lasts about 80 years. the first is the money debt force that creates wealth and opportunities gaps

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,850
and it's connected to the second force, the internal conflict where you don't trust the system

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,410
causing wars between the left and the right

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,850
and it's not easy answers

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,570
like tax the rich and we can get into that.

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,130
but the third is geopolitical force. in other words, international conflict.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,450
then there's acts of nature. and then number five is man's inventiveness particularly of new technologies.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,369
now the question is who wins the technology war

27
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,810
because the winner of that determine how the new world order works.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,490
is it something to be concerned about?

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:26,810
no.

30
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,009
the question is how you as an individual handle it.

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,689
how do i as an individual handle it?

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,009
so there's building your financial strength, flexibility, the importance of being open-minded

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,850
and how to get more out of the minute, not how to work harder.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,130
and i really urge your audience to learn all of this.

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,450
so, first of all, i see messages all the time in the comment section

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,450
that some of you didn't realize you didn't subscribe.

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,049

thank you so much

45
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,290
because in a strange way, you are

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,489
you're part of our history

47
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,410
and you're on this journey with us

48
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,370
and i appreciate you for that.

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,489
so, yeah, thank you.

50
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:20,650
[music] ray, i i want to describe to you who's listening right now.

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,730
and the question i have for you is what is the most important thing

52
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,650
that this persona of person should be thinking about at the highest level right now.

53
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,930
so the person that's listening is someone who is intent on improving their life. they're

54
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,410
they're really interested in business, potentially starting their own business.

55
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,010
they they care about

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,050
where they're investing their their time and energy and also

57
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,410
where they're setting up their home based on in terms of geography.

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,330
they are aspiring to accomplish some goal. they're probably between the age of 18 and 50 predominantly

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:05,450
and they are very very interested in understanding what's happening in a world that feels incredibly scary, fast-paced

60
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,690
and uncertain at the moment.

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,569
this is a very difficult question, but if anyone i was going to ask anyone, it would have to be you.

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,450
what

63
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:19,849
what's one of the first things they should be considering at this moment to safeguard their future, their family, their finances? i don't think it's a difficult question.

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,890
i um

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,769
i think it's it's very clear. they have to understand how the life cycle works.

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,730
okay? they have to understand it how it works. we were just talking before, you know, in the book

67
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,690
and there was the arc of the life cycle, right?

68
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,610
and you have to understand that you're on an adventurous journey.

69
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,489
okay? and you have a certain nature.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,409
you know, those qualities that ma make you have your preferences and so on.

71
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,049
and then you're going after the things that you like

72
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,450
and you're learning and it's going to have the ups and downs and so on

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,730
and how you approach that. so you asked

74
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,849
from the higher level

75
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,890
if i'm looking down

76
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,010
you know

77
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,970
like that life cycle

78
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,849
that arc

79
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,849
what's that journey like

80
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,010
how do you approach it

81
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:10,730
you know

82
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,849
what are your principles

83
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,330
how do you even learn how to approach it

84
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,410
that's why we're having these conversations right

85
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:16,728
y

86
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:17,608
so that's clear

87
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,608
you know what's your nature

88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,370
how's the journey

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,690
how do you find the path that's suitable to your nature

90
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,889
and then you'll go down that path and you'll discover and you'll evolve.

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,009
what's that like? that's what they need to know. you said what's your nature?

92
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,530
what do you mean by nature?

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,330
people are born with and then also their environment creates their different nature.

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,290
you know, we have our preferences, our inclinations.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,370
we think in a certain way.

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,610
you chose to be entrepreneurial. okay? you're living out your nature. okay? this isn't for somebody else.

97
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,449
you know, some people have a different nature.

98
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,330
okay? they would like to have the stability of a job and clarity

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,290
and so on.

100
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,690
so

101
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,250
when you have your nature, you want to know that

102
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,250
and then find the path that is going to be good for your nature.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,050
then there's the particular tactical stuff.

104
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,370
so if you would ask me, should i be in the uk or should i be in the us?

105
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,889
well, that depends on a lot of things, but that's a tactical question.

106
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,770
so if i want to be an entrepreneur and i want to build a technology company,

107
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,690
do you think i should be in the uk

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,009
or the us? i think you should be in the us.

109
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,250
why? the us has a culture of um entrepreneurship, inventiveness.

110
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,250
there's a whole different culture

111
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,449
like in europe

112
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,570
generally speaking

113
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,410
and in and in the uk

114
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,250
there's an establishment culture, right? and here

115
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,370
um

116
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,330
you could be 25, have a blue streak in your hair

117
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,530
and have the talent, but if you got the talent to pull it off, you can get the resources

118
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,130
and you can be an entrepreneur.

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,210
it's there's a culture of that.

120
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,289
that means that it's happening more.

121
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,009
that's why you even see the differences in the economies.

122
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,770
okay, where is the inventiveness really happening? okay, it's happening here.

123
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,930
so i would say if you want to be an entrepreneur, this is an environment

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,330
that's particularly conducive to being an entrepreneur.

125
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,370
so what is your honest perspective about the uk at the moment? the uk has a financial problem. uh

126
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,650
the government has a debt problem

127
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,530
and it doesn't have enough money for what it wants to do and what it can do.

128
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,490
and so what you see is the nondom problem, people moving and so on so forth.

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,050
and throughout history, when you have these sorts of things, then there's great clashes in people.

130
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,210
okay? and the uk has been in decline since the war.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,770
even the development of the capital markets, can you raise capital there? all of these things are much worse

132
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,009
than they are in the united states.

133
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,370
and it leads to clashes. he said, " of course,

134
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,930
you know,

135
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:11,930
there are five big forces that create a big cycle that lasts about 80 years, give or take 50,

136
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,569
let's say.

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,650
and the five big forces are

138
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,330
there's a money, debt, economy force, okay? debts are spending power.

139
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,889
so what happens is when you give somebody credit they can spend and then

140
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,970
but it also produces debt

141
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,690
and debt has to be paid back

142
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,889
and so what happens is if there's not enough income to pay back the debt

143
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,090
then you have um debt

144
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,610
rising relative to income

145
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,130
it squeezes out

146
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:43,449
spending

147
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,210
people don't want to hold the debt assets and so on

148
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,090
the uk has gone through that and has gone through that

149
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,930
and it's connected to the second force

150
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,129
and we're all going through this in varying degrees. the second force is the internal political and social force.

151
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,410
in other words, like between the left and the right

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,690
with wealth gaps and opportunities gaps.

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,009
we have big wealth and opportunities gaps.

154
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,009
so when you have big wealth and opportunities gaps, there's conflict.

155
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,370
okay? conflict between the left and the right.

156
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:15,930
and

157
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,370
when you get to the situation

158
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,729
where you don't believe the system is working for you

159
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:23,770
and you don't trust the system, then there are wars.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,370
there are internal conflicts over over that

161
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,610
and so on. so the third force is the geopolitical

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,570
force.

163
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,250
in other words, u

164
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,729
there's a cycle that usually goes from one big war to another big war.

165
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,610
so the last war ended in 194544

166
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,209
and we began a new order in 1945.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,450
and the way that works is that the winners of the war determine how the world order works.

168
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,890
they draw borders. they say here's how it's going to work. and that's the new order.

169
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,690
okay? and that continues until there's a rising power challenging an existing power

170
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,050
and the existing world order

171
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,529
which typically is deteriorating at that time.

172
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,730
and then you have international conflict. okay, these orders, there's a monetary order, they all break down.

173
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,290
there's an in internal political order, they all break down.

174
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,290
and and there's a geopolitical order.

175
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,769
they all have this conflict and they work together. the fourth force throughout history has been acts of nature.

176
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,810
droughts, floods, and pandemics, for example, have killed more people than wars.

177
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,570
and acts of nature, nature has a big effect.

178
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,010
and then number five force is man's inventiveness particularly of new technologies.

179
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:43,769
okay,

180
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,290
because if you see

181
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,850
that inventiveness

182
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,529
that has raised per capita incomes, gdp per capita, any measures of living standards over a period of time

183
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,649
and and so on.

184
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,330
but it is also related to the first four that i said those four four forces interact.

185
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,370
now when we go back to your uk case, okay, they have a financial problem.

186
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:15,050
they and almost every country now is dealing with more of that internal political problem for the same reasons.

187
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,290
wealth gaps, opportunities gaps,

188
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,250
what do we do?

189
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,050
who's got the power?

190
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,810
i don't trust the system kind of thing.

191
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:21,690
okay.

192
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,649
number three is we are certainly in an international great powers conflict, right?

193
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,410
and it certainly affects europe and the uk as we're dealing with not only the ukraine situation

194
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,769
but the russian situation

195
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,610
and what does that mean

196
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,930
and that relates to the money thing

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,250
because

198
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:40,810
okay

199
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,250
where's the money coming from to have defense or military expenditures

200
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,769
and so on so forth.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,290
so that matters right

202
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,930
the geopolitical

203
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,730
matters

204
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,170
climate certainly matters

205
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,050
and then

206
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,769
of course technology

207
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,970
man's inventiveness.

208
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,810
so everything could be looked through at through that lens.

209
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,970
and so what does this mean for the uk if all other countries are going through this as well? doesn't

210
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,930
that just mean that all countries are going to suffer equally? no.

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,250
no.

212
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,570
no.

213
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,769
because they're not all equal.

214
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:08,649
okay.

215
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,410
some are more in debt than others.

216
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,890
okay. some people are more willing to hold their debt than others. um

217
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,690
some means they they have more resources. some are bigger and more powerful.

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,970
some are less powerful.

219
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,850
they're different. okay. they're all go in different conditions. some countries have surpluses. some countries, you know,

220
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,490
are not in the middle of where there's having a war.

221
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,570
are you optimistic about the the future of the uk at the moment?

222
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,290
no, no.

223
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,730
because it has high debt.

224
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,490
it has the social internal conflict.

225
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,570
it it's affected by the geopolitical factors.

226
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,170
and in terms of inventiveness, it doesn't have the culture that other countries have

227
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,490
like

228
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,050
like the us.

229
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,450
is that

230
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:55,930
yes.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,050
the cult culture

232
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,529
and the capital markets to support

233
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,329
that at a scale that it needs to be supported to play seriously in the game.

234
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,490
and for anyone that doesn't know capital markets mean

235
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,769
basically the investor markets is way of saying

236
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:10,010
well

237
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,970
i mean it gets you the money.

238
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,250
in other words, you're a guy with

239
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,290
you know

240
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,010
what happens is

241
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:14,970
um

242
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,649
we have to enable people.

243
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:17,769
okay.

244
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,290
what what works is finding great people, talented people,

245
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,970
and identifying those who you want to bet on and enabling them.

246
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,769
and that works. that's the most important force, much more important than money.

247
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,370
okay? because you could see who's got the money and power and where did they come from?

248
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,810
where did nvidia come from? where did where did they all come from?

249
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,690
okay? there are guys like you, entrepreneur

250
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,010
in a sense, who's been enabled, okay, by you

251
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,170
because you have the talent and people want to bet on you

252
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,529
and that's the capital market.

253
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,930
so they give you money to help enable you

254
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,570
because they want to bet on you and then good things happen.

255
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,250
but are you

256
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,290
are you optimistic about the united states at the moment? the united states is very much a big picture.

257
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,490
no, i think it's very much in this issue there.

258
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,209
so, if i go down my list, it definitely has this uh debt money economy problem.

259
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,730
we can get into that. okay. it definitely has the internal conflict power

260
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,410
in which there's a fight between the left, you know,

261
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,450
the hard left and the right

262
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,209
due to wealth and values gaps and people not believing that the system will work for them.

263
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,170
and so democracy is at risk because they don't believe this.

264
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,010
they they're not going to follow the rules in the sense they don't believe the rules are going to

265
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,730
uh

266
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,290
number three

267
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,329
it's of course

268
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,370
the leading one side in this great power conflict of the world

269
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,170
right

270
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,209
in other words

271
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:49,769
yes

272
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,649
between the united states and the one side

273
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,209
let's say

274
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,649
and china and the allies

275
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,570
their allies on the other side.

276
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,610
i mean in the news

277
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,570
you just saw the meetings of xi putin

278
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,610
modi and that group over there

279
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,410
walking down

280
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,889
you know

281
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:05,449
and okay

282
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,610
so now it should be pretty clear how the sides are lining up

283
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,730
okay

284
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,449
you

285
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,810
it's always better to be in a place that's not in one of those wars

286
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,970
like stay out of wars

287
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,170
um

288
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,209
and of course

289
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:20,250
climate has an effect

290
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,769
and of course

291
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:22,649
then we have technology

292
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,570
the united states and china are in the big technology compet competitions.

293
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,370
the others are really not in the game.

294
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,490
they don't have the money that this innovation and talent in a sense to play at that scale

295
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,690
and so on.

296
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,889
so we have a great

297
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,769
you know

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,850
technology war

299
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,850
which can be used to create great advances but at the same time could be used for great conflicts.

300
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,889
and so now the question is going to be who wins the technology war

301
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,970
because the winner of the technology war is going to win all wars.

302
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:55,769
okay.

303
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,690
in other words, they'll win the economic war. they'll win the geopolitical war because technology

304
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,410
and i'm not saying anything that hasn't repeated through history. give me that historical context if you can

305
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,329
just for the technology

306
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:11,610
for example

307
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,250
nuclear.

308
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:14,970
yeah.

309
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,170
nuclear won world war ii.

310
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,610
and and does this cycle go back further than just

311
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,170
oh, no.

312
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,209
it goes back i that book. okay.

313
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:26,329
um,

314
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,769
in order to understand these things, cuz i have to bet on what's going to happen.

315
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:30,970
i'm a global macro investor.

316
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,130
i study the last 500 years of history and and it happens over and over again in all cases.

317
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,889
so, i could take the british empire, i could take you through all the empires, the dutch empire before

318
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,290
that,

319
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,850
and all this, and it it it happens

320
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,490
uh

321
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,050
all the time.

322
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,570
i watched your

323
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,690
i watched your videos about this

324
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,329
and it was truly fascinating how predictable this stuff is

325
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:57,529
and the work that you've done to uncover this trend throughout history.

326
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,810
i mean, it's almost for me

327
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,370
it was almost irrefutable watching the evidence in in

328
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,449
i think it's like a 40-minute video on youtube where you show how this played out through empires.

329
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,769
and it begs the question, you know,

330
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:07,930
because

331
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,370
when you live in the united states,

332
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,170
when you're when you're in the present time, you almost never assume that the empire you're in could fall.

333
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,690
you just don't you don't see how it could happen. we're so strong. we're so great, you know,

334
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,930
we're so that doing ai over here, have money over here, everything's good, the sun's shining.

335
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,130
it's inconceivable.

336
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,209
of course, people always think that the future would be a slightly modified version of the present,

337
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,130
and it's not.

338
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,250
okay.

339
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,050
watch over decades, but it's like watching a person grow.

340
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:37,850
yeah.

341
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,730
okay.

342
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:39,209
yeah.

343
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,529
you know, you watch your kid or you watch a person at your age, any age,

344
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,889
and that's what you see.

345
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,889
yeah. okay. and you don't see the life arc. yeah. okay. but the life arc is in irrefutable.

346
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,769
but the u do you think it's conceivable

347
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,009
that in the next 50 to 100 years the us could no longer be the dominant power globally? yeah.

348
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,130
yeah.

349
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,130
more than conceivable. more than conceivable.

350
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,890
what does what do you mean by more than conceivable?

351
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,130
i mean that these evolutions always take place and they take place in a certain way

352
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,929
and that

353
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:20,890
um

354
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,609
if you look at the probabilities

355
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,130
um

356
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,970
and the paths and the symptoms

357
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,090
there is a challenge

358
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,770
the united states is facing a number of those challenges

359
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,370
and we're at a moment where

360
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,570
um

361
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,169
it's a question of whether the system

362
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:56,730
and the people could can get control of the situations and deal with it strongly and well

363
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,730
in a way

364
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:07,210
where they are not fighting to the point of damaging each other

365
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,890
and damaging managing the prospects for the future.

366
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,370
but i mean, the united states is very innovative. got all these great innovative companies here. so surely yeah.

367
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,490
but you you can't make generalizations about the united states.

368
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,370
and you can't make generalizations, by the way, about the markets either.

369
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,490
um

370
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,530
what you see is um

371
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,370
1

372
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:29,370
%

373
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,970
a small percentage

374
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,970
1 % of the population

375
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,250
if you're looking at the breakdown of incomes and also you're looking at the innovation

376
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,770
the stock markets

377
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,450
which stocks are doing well

378
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,410
who owns those companies and all of that

379
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,850
about three million people in a country of uh

380
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,410
330 million people are really unbelievably doing great

381
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,250
and you could pick the neighborhoods they're in and what they're doing.

382
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,890
and then there's the top 10 %, let's say, which is the people around them.

383
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,410
and they're really, really doing great in that world. at the same time, the bottom 60 %

384
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:17,130
60 % of americans have below a sixth grade reading level. wow. and that population

385
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,970
in terms of um

386
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,490
the basics being productive, you have to be productive and be prosperous.

387
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:38,330
so what what you need to have a su successful society is to have broadbased productivity and prosperity.

388
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,850
okay? and that's a problem.

389
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,250
okay? so, which america are you looking at? and are you watching the war that's happening between these?

390
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,690
it's a little bit complicated for me as a as a bit of an outsider

391
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,210
because i see trump saying he represents those people,

392
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,130
but obviously trump is a from the billionaire class himself.

393
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,570
so, i mean, is he is he a savior for inequality? is he correcting?

394
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,809
i think i think he sees a lot of the problem and he

395
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,289
uh

396
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,210
i think he sees the debt problem.

397
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,929
i think he sees the internal conflict disorder problem and i think he represents

398
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,450
uh

399
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:23,770
the red,

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,210
let's call it the red states.

401
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,130
i mean, you look at a map and there's red and blue and you see

402
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,090
where they are, okay? and he represents that

403
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,530
and they're united behind him in terms of doing some things.

404
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,210
okay? so he represents

405
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,450
let's call it the red side

406
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,210
which is located where the maps shows red

407
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,210
and then there are the blue

408
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:45,770
and

409
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,730
and he's

410
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:47,690
um

411
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,690
he views himself as somebody who needs to take charge and to do certain things.

412
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,730
others in

413
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:01,530
that population would say those who let's say are not getting are having the food stamp program cut off

414
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,490
or having other programs cut off that they're dependent on

415
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,929
would say

416
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,490
uh

417
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,289
wait a second

418
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:12,490
that's not representing me. and so we have gone

419
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,970
that population has gone to significant number behind him

420
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,850
that are devotees. they're all in.

421
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,730
okay. at the same time as we have the other side

422
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,490
which will have their devotees if you know we're in new york city.

423
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,690
okay.

424
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,169
and the up upcoming mayoral uh election will be an example of the two sides.

425
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,929
okay. and they will try to use the system

426
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,970
but there's a question

427
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,970
will the system have enough support to work.

428
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,929
okay. but that's what we have. just just to close off on this point of the uk in particular,

429
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,850
if if you were to try and fix it, what would you be aiming at? i say this

430
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,210
because we do have a millionaire exodus that's widely reported in the uk

431
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,770
where i think this year we're set to lose 16, 000

432
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,409
roughly 16, 000 millionaires.

433
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,530
um, when you look at the big big countries like china, america, the uae, the uk,

434
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,610
we're losing more millionaires than anybody else.

435
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,690
and i was wondering if you think it's fixable

436
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,929
and if you were in charge of the uk, what you might aim at first.

437
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,090
it's diff,

438
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:24,570
you know,

439
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,210
first of all,

440
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:33,770
if you go back to the basic problem, which is there's too much debt, there are deficits,

441
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,450
there's differences in education and opportunity levels

442
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,850
and so on.

443
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,809
the most important thing that you can have is a strong middle.

444
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,570
political middle.

445
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,130
political middle to be analytically strong

446
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:06,730
and also strong enough to get the people to do what needs to be done even if they don't want to do it to get to be productive.

447
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,169
now that's an easy thing to say.

448
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,049
it's not an easy thing to do.

449
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,890
but you do need that strong middle

450
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,850
and you do need to convey to people that you need to have the strong middle to change productivity

451
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,330
and you know

452
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,610
and are you in it?

453
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,370
are are you in it?

454
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,450
are you patriotic and in it

455
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,250
and you know

456
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,450
but you look at history

457
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,570
how did the united states come to be the united states? people will go to the places

458
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,850
that are better than them

459
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,130
then stay in the places that worse for them. this is fundamental

460
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,169
right incentives.

461
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:56,730
okay. so you have to make the place better. okay. now i would say also

462
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,690
you can take pockets and they go into the pocket and let it spread out.

463
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,929
but you also have to have this equal education or you know you've got to strive for equal opportunity.

464
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,850
but anyway, it's a difficult question that i'm afraid i'm incapable of um solving.

465
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,529
it was unnerving to hear the tone of your voice drop when i asked it. you seemed slightly

466
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,250
um

467
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,570
as if you you've kind of given up on the uk a little bit. your facial reaction? well, i'm

468
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,289
i'm just a

469
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,490
i'm just a

470
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,490
i'm a practical guy. i'm a realistic guy. i made my money. i'm in the business

471
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,570
and it's my nature to try to be realistic and to bet on how things will transpire.

472
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,049
and that's not healthy.

473
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,690
the situation in the uk is not healthy.

474
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,409
and the situation in the united states is very risky in many ways.

475
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,529
it's what we're describing. so, you know,

476
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,690
and then if you look where are people going

477
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,049
then then you see the places that have the qualities we're talking about.

478
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,090
they're civil.

479
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,010
they're creative.

480
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,650
the people aren't at war with each other.

481
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:24,330
what happens next in history? well, usually there's a a big fight for control, political revolutions

482
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,450
and things like that.

483
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,890
the system breaks down because they don't trust the system.

484
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,929
so will the legal system resolve

485
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:50,490
that? will the parliamentary system resolve that these disputes satisfactorily to the satisfaction of those people

486
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,450
and the other people who have different points of view

487
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,610
and the sides won't believe it. and this goes back

488
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,610
this goes back to rome. it goes back to caesar, you know,

489
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,330
the senate.

490
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,490
and you know this goes back through history all the time,

491
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,049
right? and in in the 30s, four major democracies chose to be autocracies.

492
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,250
okay,

493
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,090
that happened in italy, germany, spain, and japan. what's autocracy for anyone that doesn't know the word?

494
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,650
well, it's

495
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:33,929
it means a dictatorship essentially of a limited number of people at the top who are autocratic,

496
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,210
which means that they are directing things rather than a democracy

497
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,289
in which

498
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,330
um

499
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,450
there's representatives of all different points of view that get together and follow rules to make decisions.

500
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,289
so the uk could become an autocracy as could the us.

501
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:57,770
i guess

502
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,090
um

503
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,650
you're going to see a lot of pressure for that strong leader who will get control of things

504
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,570
and make it work well and will

505
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,970
and you're likely to see two different views as to which side, you know,

506
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,730
the red and the blue sides,

507
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:17,929
so to speak.

508
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,450
you're likely to see that type of clash.

509
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,770
you said the us is playing a risky game itself.

510
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,650
is that from a de debt perspective or otherwise from these things? okay.

511
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:37,210
from the debt, from the internal conflict, from the changing world order, the geopolitical world conflict,

512
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:38,650
you know,

513
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,289
i don't know.

514
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:43,529
we're playing with nuclear weapons and, you know,

515
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,130
in wars and different places

516
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,890
and then of course climate

517
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,289
and then the technology war.

518
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,210
how we're doing that. yeah, i saw that image the other day of putin and um

519
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,730
president xi and china together walking together.

520
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,490
if china does become the dominant force in the world, the dominant power does

521
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,850
is that a smooth transition?

522
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,610
first of all, i don't think either side is going to be the clearly dominant power for for a very long time

523
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,570
and

524
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,850
and the the quickest way to have it is some kind of a war

525
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,049
and that's a dangerous thing

526
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,409
and but maybe it evolves

527
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,010
hopefully

528
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:31,690
the way the soviet union evolved that the the worry of mutually assured destruction keeps everybody

529
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,130
not having that kind of war

530
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,890
and then what then then the systems

531
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,130
one system or another system wins

532
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,330
but that's an evolutionary process

533
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,409
and you know i can't say

534
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:45,610
and um

535
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,570
do you think much about time frames

536
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,890
because when i was watching when i was going through the changing world order

537
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,289
there seems to be somewhat consistent or predictable time frames when these these transitions happen.

538
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,890
do you think about where we are?

539
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,649
well, they're long-term big cycles. yeah. right. it's

540
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:03,770
it's like a life cycle

541
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,649
on average

542
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,690
they are about a life cycle about 80 years

543
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,370
but it's not predetermined

544
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,690
just like your life cycle is not predetermined like

545
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,330
if you take care of yourself and you

546
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,049
you know

547
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:17,610
i don't know

548
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,169
smoke

549
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,570
eat

550
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:18,809
well

551
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,649
exercise and so on

552
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:21,130
so forth

553
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,330
then you will probably have a longer life cycle than if you don't take care of yourself

554
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,850
and it's um kind of like that

555
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,649
you know

556
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:31,690
and so you see them

557
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,090
in industry

558
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,890
they evolve

559
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,490
but you can see the symptoms. okay,

560
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,409
you can see the actions and the symptoms

561
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,649
which like taking a physical

562
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,010
uh

563
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,970
then gives you a sense of where they are in their life cycles.

564
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,570
we're 80 years from world war ii. 80 years from world war ii.

565
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:48,890
yeah.

566
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,370
and you're seeing the symptoms.

567
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:52,169
yeah.

568
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,770
symptoms are clear.

569
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,809
they're all in that book.

570
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,970
you can see the charts of all the systems.

571
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,649
is it something to be worried about or concerned about if you're in the united states? no

572
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,809
i mean, yes.

573
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,770
and then the question is how you as an individual handle it.

574
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,690
how do i as an individual handle it?

575
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,570
well, first of all, i think i think you have to be aware of the situation

576
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,450
and the risks for me and my family

577
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:21,690
though

578
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:27,049
in terms of risks and how i should um counteract those risks.

579
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,809
is it a case of me saving for a rainy day? is it a that's part of it. yeah.

580
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,450
um

581
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:32,730
there's a

582
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,490
there's a saying in hong kong

583
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,690
um

584
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:42,570
a chinese saying which is a smart rabbit has three holes. and what that means is you can see

585
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,450
is it the uk or the us

586
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,730
and

587
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,049
and i can then move to the better place and get out of the place

588
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,409
that's a terrible place.

589
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,250
so can i successfully be an immigrant or whatever and change my location? throughout history

590
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:07,370
that's been important. so the ability to go to good places and away from bad places. um

591
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,289
so that's part of it. um

592
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,010
secondly,

593
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,289
building your financial strength is important

594
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,970
which has to do with how you earn, spend and save. that will determine the amount.

595
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,770
and then what you do with that amount is invest.

596
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,929
and so how you invest

597
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,690
uh

598
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,409
is also important.

599
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,809
so if you have your financial ability

600
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,929
and you can make the move

601
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,850
and then you have knowledge you know about what's happening so that you can change things.

602
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,049
those are the things you need. so on that first point about a smart rabbit having three holes,

603
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,330
is it therefore a better decision at this point in time to not to not buy a house?

604
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,490
because a lot of people end up buying a house

605
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,250
and anchors them to to a place and it means that they then have to pay into a mortgage.

606
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,370
so a lot of lot of the financial advice most of us have growing up is

607
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,850
when you get enough money to buy a house, move in, pay that mortgage for 25 years.

608
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,250
but if i'm in a new economy, in a new world,

609
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,850
and flexibility and the ability to get up and go and move is there's

610
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,769
there's uh value to that.

611
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:30,330
the ability to move capital matters. and if you look at history, this has been an important consideration. yes.

612
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,730
so it matters. so if you're nailing yourself down

613
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,570
and that's your primary capital and it's nailed down there,

614
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,049
then that's does limit your flexibility.

615
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,649
and on the point of earning, spending, and saving, wonder what you you're a

616
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,130
you're a a father, aren't you? yeah.

617
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,250
what what advice are you giving to your children about earning money in the in the current world,

618
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,210
where

619
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,649
where they should set up their shop, the skills

620
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:03,289
that are most valuable to acquire, the technologies, the we talked about the us being a place to one of the better places to build your career for all the reasons you described.

621
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,370
well, that's, you know, that's kind of like the particular that you asked me for.

622
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,890
that's below the level of the higher level.

623
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,570
okay. the higher level is i have a principle. make your work and your passion the same thing.

624
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,409
and don't forget about the money part.

625
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,850
okay? if you make your work

626
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,690
and your passion the same thing so that you're really enjoying your work, you'll have an enjoyable satisfactory life

627
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,490
and you'll probably be better at your career

628
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:37,529
that

629
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:38,169
um

630
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:38,809
as a result

631
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,450
probably advance

632
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,610
and so on. so you have a happier life and you will have a more

633
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,370
probably a more successful life.

634
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,850
but it is true that the careers that you choose will have financial implications. mhm.

635
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,730
and if you say, " i want to be a poet or something along those lines.

636
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,809
" you better consider the financial implications of that.

637
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,090
that doesn't mean that you have to go make a ton of money

638
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,210
because i think that that's

639
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,649
i think a lot of people fall into that trap that they think the money is

640
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,530
um

641
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,649
like vast amounts of money is vast amounts of success.

642
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,449
and that's not true. in other words, is your work and your passion the same thing?

643
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,889
so, i think that what brings people happiness is meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

644
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,609
okay? if you have meaningful work, you know, that you're into

645
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,810
and your, you know, your passion and your work's the same thing.

646
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,489
and you have meaningful relationships, whether through that work or beyond, you're going to have probably a great life.

647
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,369
okay? and so, you have to keep that in mind.

648
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,929
and it doesn't have much correlation past a certain level of money.

649
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:48,969
uh

650
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,010
it doesn't have much correlation with um

651
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,649
that well-being with the amount of money you have.

652
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,129
and if you see studies across societies

653
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,930
and you'll see that past that certain basic level, there's no correlation between the amount of money they have

654
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,250
and how much happiness they have or well-being.

655
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,410
okay? that the highest level of co correlation across societies and studies of happiness and well-being is community.

656
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,490
do you have a sense of community? do you have those around you

657
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,530
who are your community?

658
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,730
you'll live longer that way. you'll have a more joyous life and it'll be a better outcome.

659
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,490
but anyway, so thinking about those things i think is important

660
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,450
based on your life cycle

661
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,010
in this book principles your guided journey.

662
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,970
create your own principles to get the work and life you want.

663
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,930
do you think you have to play different games in different seasons of your life cycle as it relates to generating wealth?

664
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,170
and what i'm talking about here is really like risk profile

665
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,450
um

666
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,810
or what i should be optimizing for.

667
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,290
should i be

668
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,970
should i be trying to hang around with ray dalio

669
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,890
or should i be focusing on the job that pays me the most?

670
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,970
first of all,

671
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,570
the answer is yes.

672
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,329
and the second question you asked

673
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,730
the answer is um

674
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:13,050
that you should be around the the people who are the best people to teach you to operate

675
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,010
by the

676
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,450
the mentors and the learnings

677
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,530
and so on. you should be around the best people

678
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,050
and when i say best people

679
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,130
i mean people of good character and good capabilities. okay. and uh

680
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,490
so you should be around the best

681
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,890
not the job that pays you the most.

682
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,170
and i could explain why that is,

683
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,849
but and yes,

684
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,849
in terms of that arc, you will play it differently at different parts of your life cycle.

685
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,089
so in the early part of your life cycle,

686
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,089
what you're going to do is

687
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,490
i mean the more learning and experiencing is the most important thing that you can do in the learning

688
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,089
in the early part of your life cycle.

689
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,010
it's like you're going to make your choices.

690
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,530
what direction am i going to be in and so on so forth. so learn.

691
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,250
okay, that that's that's most important.

692
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,849
and then what you're at the end of your life cycle, you're pretty much relieved from all of that.

693
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,730
you're not going to be working to earn, okay? you're going to be free of all of that.

694
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,089
you're going to have um

695
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:17,530
and you have freedom of choices

696
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,970
and so on.

697
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,970
and you're going to be thinking about transitioning.

698
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,050
how do i transition well-being or how do i transition my wealth

699
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,609
or how do i transition and so on

700
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,490
you know

701
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:28,970
that's

702
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,290
that's where you are still learning is a joy

703
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,690
but at the same time

704
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,530
in terms of trying to accomplish

705
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,690
it's not the same at your late part of your life cycle

706
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,930
as it is in your early part of your life cycle

707
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,849
so i want to ask about your early life cycle

708
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,530
and what the most important strategic or wealth generating decisions you made that you would encourage

709
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,250
encourage everybody to consider if their nature is aligned to yours. okay. my nature was

710
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,690
i hated school.

711
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:06,490
i didn't like the whole thing of remembering this and remembering this and then give it back to me

712
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,210
and there were these uh you know history

713
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,170
like there's william the conquer in 1066 and what did he do

714
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,970
and you know

715
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,849
like all of that was what education represented.

716
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,570
and when i was um 12, a kid, i earned money with odd jobs like

717
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:25,930
um

718
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,369
i had a paper route and um

719
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:33,609
i mowed lawns and i caddied and i took my cadding money

720
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,890
and when i was 12

721
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,530
i got

722
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,930
everybody was talking about the stock market.

723
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,010
so i put some money in the stock market. i didn't know what i was doing, of course,

724
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,730
but i

725
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:43,369
um

726
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:44,970
i picked um

727
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,369
the stock

728
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,570
that was the only stock i ever heard of that was selling for less than $ 5 a share.

729
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,650
and my reasoning was i could buy more shares, so if it went up, i could make more money.

730
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,010
okay, that was a stupid criteria, but it was a company that was about to go bankrupt.

731
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,329
and another company acquired it and it tripled in price.

732
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,329
and i said, " i like this game. " [music] so, i got

733
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,170
i got hooked on the game.

734
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,849
i'm still hooked on the game, right? so, i liked it.

735
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:28,010
okay. that that affected me. so, i barely got into uh cw post college and then i went to

736
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,730
uh

737
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,690
harvard business school

738
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,329
and that opened my eyes to the world in in many ways

739
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,930
because of who were there and what it was like and all that, you know,

740
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,290
the best and the brightest kind of thing.

741
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,089
but i always still traded markets because i always played the game.

742
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,930
i could tell you stories. you want a couple of quick stories? 100

743
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:47,930
%.

744
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,650
okay.

745
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,210
so, i'm clerking on the floor of the new york stock exchange between graduating from college

746
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,810
and in the summer

747
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,849
between graduating from college and going to uh harvard business school. and that is 197

748
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,290
the summer of 1971.

749
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:06,970
mhm.

750
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:16,490
and on august 15th, 1971, richard nixon gets on the television

751
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,010
and says

752
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,010
that, you know, the promise that that you were going to be able to take your paper money

753
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,890
and go get gold,

754
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,690
you can't do that and we're not

755
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,810
we're going to cut off that off.

756
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,530
he didn't say it in exactly those words, but money then was gold

757
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,770
and what we think of as paper money, fiat money was claims on the gold.

758
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,690
so i walked on the floor of the new york stock exchange that summer

759
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,170
and i thought the market was going to go down a lot

760
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,089
and the market went up a lot and i didn't understand why

761
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,250
because i never went through a devaluation before.

762
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,609
and i studied history

763
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:03,050
and i found that in march of 1933, roosevelt got on the radio

764
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,890
and made the exact same announcement that you're not going to get your gold

765
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,170
and they're going to print the money.

766
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,410
and when you print a lot of money, you have that.

767
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,450
okay.

768
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:19,450
so, i learned that history of things that never happened in my lifetime before were important things to understand.

769
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:20,329
okay.

770
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,730
i went back then to harvard business school two for two years

771
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,369
and and two years later as a result of all the printing of money and the oil shock

772
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,770
because of all of that

773
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:34,810
uh

774
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,089
we had the in 1973 oil shock

775
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,650
and now because of my background

776
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,730
i'm head hired to be director of commodities at a wall street brokerage firm.

777
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,650
okay.

778
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,130
mhm.

779
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:49,690
which

780
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,050
and then all sorts of things happened. um

781
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:53,609
turbulence

782
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,490
and so on

783
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:54,890
so forth.

784
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,210
that firm went broke. i went to another firm and i was

785
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,569
uh

786
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:00,970
rowdy.

787
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,329
i wasn't your typical good employee,

788
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,369
you know,

789
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:06,010
follow everything.

790
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,650
and

791
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,130
uh

792
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,089
so i got fired and that was in uh

793
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,410
1975

794
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,130
and then

795
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,450
i

796
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:15,930
but

797
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:16,569
uh

798
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:19,050
clients all liked me and for things

799
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,369
and so they would pay me for advice

800
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,770
and i continued to trade the markets and that's

801
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,810
when i formed bridgewwater. okay. and what that was 1975.

802
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,130
i just passed along bridgewater 50 years later.

803
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:41,210
yeah. okay. so there's a journey there that has failures and successes and learnings.

804
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,970
you know, i have a principle. pain plus reflection equals progress.

805
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,130
okay? your best learnings come from the pain.

806
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,810
it's a message. pay attention. learn how reality works and how to deal with it differently

807
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,410
so you have principles for re dealing with reality better.

808
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,329
and i learned that process.

809
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,250
and from that process, my company bridgewwater became the largest hedge fund in the world.

810
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,930
um, extremely successful, managing how much? $ 150 billion.

811
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,050
1, 500 people, $ 150 billion.

812
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,210
and that's made you a very wealthy man.

813
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,210
and made me a very wealthy man, which by the way was not my intention.

814
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:24,730
okay.

815
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,770
i just wanted to play the game and to have meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

816
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:30,890
that was paramount.

817
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,650
but it happened to be the game i played.

818
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,970
if you're good at the game, you make a lot of money.

819
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,890
and now i'm at a stage in my life where i'm

820
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,810
i want to pass things along.

821
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,410
i need to pass things along, right? so, hence the books, hence our conversation

822
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,410
and here we are.

823
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,450
that's the life arc.

824
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,290
but i learned a lot. and so that's the journey.

825
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,930
i think b2b marketeers keep making this mistake.

826
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,730
they're chasing volume instead of quality.

827
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,450
and

828
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,410
when you try to be seen

829
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,770
by more people instead of the right people, all you're doing is making noise.

830
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,930
but that noise rarely shifts the needle.

831
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,450
and it's often quite expensive.

832
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,290
and i know as there was a time in my career where i kept making this mistake

833
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,970
that many of you will be making it, too.

834
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,130
eventually, i started posting ads on our show sponsors platform, linkedin.

835
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,890
and that's when things started to change.

836
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,609
i put that change down to a few critical things.

837
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,450
one of them being that linkedin was then and still is today the platform

838
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,450
where decision makers go to not only to think and learn but also to buy.

839
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:31,930
and

840
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,890
when you market your business there, you're putting it right in front of people who actually have the power to say yes.

841
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,650
and you can target them by job title, industry, and company size.

842
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,530
it's simply a sharper way to spend your marketing budget.

843
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,369
and if you haven't tried it, how about this? give linkedin ads a try.

844
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,730
and i'm going to give you a $ 100 ad credit to get you started.

845
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,930
if you visit linkedin. com / diary,

846
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,170
you can claim that right now. that's linkedin. com / diary.

847
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,329
just for context, people don't like talking about money

848
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:02,170
and i understand it, but you're a prolific philanthropist.

849
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,970
also, google says that your net worth is in the tens of billions of dollars.

850
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,130
and i'm sure there's some people that have clicked on this conversation

851
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,930
and aren't aware of the scale of wealth you built up

852
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:17,210
and the scale of bridgewater capital and how prolific and famous it is in the investing world.

853
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,970
in that 50-year life arc, one of the things you mentioned is pain. all of us will encounter pain.

854
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,890
and you said pain plus reflection.

855
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,329
reflection equals progress.

856
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,970
how have you leared to deal with pain? you've had a lot of pain in all facets of life

857
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,010
because you've lived the life arc

858
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,410
um

859
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,690
and you continue to. how

860
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,170
what's the best principle for dealing with pain? first of all,

861
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,450
um to calm yourself down and to get centered.

862
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,369
meditation has had a big beneficial effect on my life.

863
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,130
we can get into meditation in a minute of how it has.

864
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:59,609
but the ability to, you know, in a sense calm yourself down and

865
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,210
when the time is right to reflect on what's happened

866
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,730
both to understand how reality works.

867
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,890
you know, you want to be a hyper realist.

868
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,450
i understand how reality works.

869
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,369
therefore, i need to do this under this set of circumstances, which means developing principles.

870
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,250
and so what i did when i would do that anytime

871
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,690
whenever i would think

872
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,010
what

873
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,970
what should i do

874
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,290
whether painful or not

875
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,890
i would pause

876
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,970
reflect on

877
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,369
you know what should i do if that happened again

878
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,410
and that's how i would write down my principles

879
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,410
and what i did was

880
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,050
i wrote down a lot of principles

881
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:43,849
a lot of principles

882
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,890
a lot of principles

883
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:45,930
if this happens

884
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,490
that happens

885
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,450
and whatever

886
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,890
and then so i wrote these principles down and then i found that in investing

887
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:54,650
um

888
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,050
if i can computerize those decision rules

889
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,210
i could back test them

890
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,329
see how they would have worked

891
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,130
and so on.

892
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,050
so i built systems, decision-making systems. um,

893
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,569
computer would make decisions.

894
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:16,089
so it was ai before llms, but it was ai to have decision-making criteria.

895
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,810
so it would be like i i would make a computer chess game

896
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:28,569
that would play while i was playing my mental chess game, what moves we would make.

897
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,530
and it's completely automated and so on.

898
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:37,290
but i'm what i'm trying to say is that reflecting on how does reality really work

899
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,250
and what do i do when this happens to

900
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,730
that happens is the development of principles

901
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,210
and that has been invaluable

902
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,849
and it also makes me see things differently

903
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,250
because a lot of people

904
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,210
um

905
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,730
and if i didn't do this

906
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,089
i would be seeing almost as uh

907
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,250
a blizzard of things coming at me

908
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:02,650
instead

909
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,890
i see everything as another one of those. so let let's say

910
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,290
for example

911
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:10,730
it

912
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,770
it's a species. so it's like seeing okay

913
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,010
that's what kind of species is it

914
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,210
and how do i deal with

915
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,089
that species? so it's one of those rather than just a lot of things coming at me.

916
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,010
pattern recognition of yeah.

917
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,849
but but let's say if you think of a

918
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,730
it's a duck.

919
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,490
okay. okay. oh okay. it's a duck. how do i deal with a duck? or it's a lion.

920
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:38,490
okay, how do i deal with a lion? rather than just a lot of things coming at it.

921
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,089
so this principle thinking

922
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:47,130
and seeing it that way had a big effect on the quality of my decision making

923
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,490
and and that helped. two questions i had there is to become a principal thinker

924
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,010
i need to do more reflection, right? and then the other

925
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,690
think about how does

926
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,290
how does the machine

927
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,410
how does

928
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,450
how does life

929
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,690
how do these things work?

930
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,410
so that's what i mean. okay. and to write that down.

931
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:08,809
uh

932
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,130
yeah.

933
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:09,849
yeah.

934
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,250
write down your thoughts. i find sometimes what i would do is i'd uh

935
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,010
dictate them into my iphone. okay. okay. i'd say no.

936
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,050
okay. ah

937
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,369
this is how when you're making a decision. why did you make that decision?

938
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,490
so, not just make a decision, but think about the criteria you're using to make the decision

939
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,569
also my emotions, my trauma, my insecurities, my anxiety,

940
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,170
right? and and you might say when reflecting on that, is that helpful? is that harmful?

941
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,650
and what do i do about that?

942
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,050
like

943
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:43,690
for example

944
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,569
when what you're referring to is

945
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,290
yes

946
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:47,770
the

947
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,170
um

948
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,890
that the motions and the things and all of those

949
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,010
um

950
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:52,490
we

951
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:52,890
uh

952
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,809
you have to understand that that

953
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,130
basically the brain's got two parts to it

954
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:57,369
right

955
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,730
it has the logical part of your brain

956
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,130
reasonable

957
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,650
tries to reason things through

958
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,650
and then which is conscious

959
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,970
and then it has the subconscious mind

960
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,730
which is the subliminal

961
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,290
that is really driving you

962
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,609
and so

963
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,010
when you can reflect

964
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:19,369
okay

965
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,730
how are my emotions entering into it

966
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,010
what do i

967
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:24,490
you know

968
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,130
and so on

969
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,809
and you can think and you can align

970
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:27,290
that

971
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:28,890
that's very powerful

972
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,890
and meditation by the way

973
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,250
naturally does that

974
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,010
because what you do when you meditate and maybe a times come

975
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:36,970
i should explain meditation

976
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:37,690
okay

977
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,170
how it works

978
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,130
um

979
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,530
what you do is it's a process process by which you sit quietly and you repeat in your mind

980
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,809
what is called a mantra

981
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,569
which is a sound

982
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,290
that it's a word that has no meaning.

983
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,329
let me say

984
00:50:54,339 --> 00:51:01,050
the most classic example of that would be okay. so you're quietly there and you go with your breath

985
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:01,609
you go

986
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,010
you know [music] like that

987
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:06,970
but you need to be taught

988
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,530
but anyway

989
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,170
i

990
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:08,970
um

991
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,970
and so when you're doing that

992
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,490
uh

993
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,010
because your m is in your mind or your mantra is in your mind

994
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,010
you're not able to have other thoughts.

995
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:27,530
you'll see yourself wavering between doing that and staying on the mantra and then having thoughts.

996
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:28,490
um

997
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,130
but what

998
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,849
and then you go back to your mantra. when you are

999
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:32,650
uh

1000
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,450
in the mantra

1001
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:34,730
a a lot

1002
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:41,450
then it disappears. the sound disappears and you go into your subconscious mind. that's what they call transcending.

1003
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,970
transcendental meditation is the type of meditation i do.

1004
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,650
and so you go there

1005
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,930
and you're not in a conscious state and you're not in a subcon unconscious state.

1006
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,650
you're in a conscious state. so it's subconscious state. it's not unconscious

1007
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,010
is you're sleeping.

1008
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,730
conscious is that you're awake like we are.

1009
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,530
you're in this.

1010
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,809
so it's a different state.

1011
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,530
like if you hear that noise, you would hear that noise.

1012
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:14,410
it would be big. not when you're sleeping. but when you're in your subconscious state, then it's relaxing. uh

1013
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:14,890
it's helpful

1014
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,130
and this process helps to

1015
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,490
um

1016
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,809
bring your conscious state and your uncon subconscious state into alignment.

1017
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,089
in other words, you recognize both

1018
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,130
and it calms you down. it

1019
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,170
it's like the ninja in the ninja movies, you know,

1020
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,730
they're fighting

1021
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,410
but they

1022
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,930
it seems in slow motion.

1023
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,490
the camera shows them in slow motion and they're doing whatever they're doing along that.

1024
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,089
it kind of makes you in

1025
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:49,530
that kind of state of mind so that you're dealing with what's coming at you in that way.

1026
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,130
and so what you referred to is this

1027
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,010
um

1028
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,010
these things that happen and how you deal with those is really important to the quality of your decision-making.

1029
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,530
how influential was transcendental meditation in your success?

1030
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,770
oh, enormously successful. enormously significant. ve

1031
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,170
very

1032
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,809
very significant.

1033
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,290
in other words, that way of singing seeing things and how often

1034
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,329
and and by the way, there's

1035
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:14,890
you know

1036
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:14,970
there's

1037
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:16,329
i

1038
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:22,890
i would say say there's a serenity prayer. the serenity prayer is god

1039
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,050
give me the serenity to accept that which i can't control

1040
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:35,690
and give me the power to control that which i can and the wisdom to tell the difference.

1041
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:43,290
okay. and so to how you approach these things, we're talking about reflection. you ask me reflection.

1042
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,250
okay? if you can reflect in that quality way, then you deal with anything.

1043
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,050
and i've

1044
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,730
i've dealt with

1045
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:53,849
uh

1046
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:55,130
the worst possible thing.

1047
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:55,530
um

1048
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,809
i lost a son.

1049
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,770
okay? and i would have rather died.

1050
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,730
i would have rather lost everything to lose my son.

1051
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,010
so it's the worst possible thing. and and then to see what it did

1052
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:06,569
you know

1053
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:09,210
the damage and the harm from family terrible.

1054
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:17,450
okay. then to go through that with meditation with reflection and so on

1055
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:18,569
uh

1056
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,450
was invaluable and people have their own challenges

1057
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,809
but to be able to do it that way

1058
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,690
i i really urge your audience

1059
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,290
i urge you to

1060
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,010
uh

1061
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:30,569
to learn that

1062
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,410
that's very helpful. how

1063
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,970
how did that tragedy change your your perspective and your your principles

1064
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,930
in any way

1065
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,809
on life on

1066
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:39,290
on happiness

1067
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,010
on success

1068
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,210
on all these things that you've written about? well,

1069
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,010
it's again

1070
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:44,410
i

1071
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,050
you know

1072
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:45,849
i go above it

1073
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,210
and

1074
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,170
um

1075
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,690
you reflect on the life arc

1076
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:59,369
and i realize at that higher level that that's what the life arc is like.

1077
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,490
you

1078
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,609
you'll in in all my books there's this ar

1079
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:04,329
um

1080
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:04,890
arcing

1081
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,450
this arcing

1082
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,530
here's a bigger version of it

1083
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:10,650
uh

1084
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:10,890
yeah

1085
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,690
there's this arcing

1086
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:12,890
okay

1087
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,050
i don't know if you're camera sees that

1088
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:15,450
okay

1089
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,329
whatever it is

1090
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,770
and that's what life and evolution is like to me

1091
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,450
meaning you make advances

1092
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,970
you will have setbacks

1093
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:27,210
okay

1094
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,450
if you reflect well,

1095
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,650
and you learn how reality works

1096
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:39,530
and how you will deal with it, you will get past that and go on.

1097
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,730
and that's just what it is. that's just the way life is. and if you do that

1098
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,329
well, then that's your best possible life.

1099
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:55,930
are you religious? are you a religious person? i'm not religious, but i'm spiritual. okay. the dalai lama

1100
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,770
who i had the pleasure of meeting told me u and i i agree with

1101
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:00,569
um

1102
00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:02,089
that religions are typically

1103
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:03,690
um

1104
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:10,250
a mix between superstitions and spirituality.

1105
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,210
there's half of it is that element that nobody knows

1106
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:22,170
but there is the way people should deal with each other. there is karma.

1107
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,809
okay. all religions

1108
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,210
there's the part of them that says do unto others as you would have them do unto you

1109
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,010
or what goes around comes around and then you get to the particulars.

1110
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,609
okay. and it is true that if we work well together

1111
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,530
that even little things i can do to help you can make a big difference in your life

1112
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,569
and little things that you can do to help me make a big difference in our lives.

1113
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,490
and so it's practical and it is also joyous.

1114
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,210
okay, that creates a relationship.

1115
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,329
and we talked earlier about how that meaningful relationship is like the source of great happiness.

1116
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,290
but when you have a community and you do that, you have a better society.

1117
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,930
and almost all religions will tell you that there'll be elements of those.

1118
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,930
and when i believe in spirituality, what i also mean is

1119
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:25,049
uh

1120
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:27,369
we're all part of this greater hole.

1121
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,730
okay? we're all part of the greater hole.

1122
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,490
and if you could see yourself as part of the greater whole and love the greater whole

1123
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:39,049
uh

1124
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:41,210
and whatever that is

1125
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:41,930
spirituality

1126
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:43,290
really

1127
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,930
okay

1128
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,970
and so i will go through my life arc

1129
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,170
okay

1130
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,010
and i will die and i'm comfortable with that

1131
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,930
okay in that

1132
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,410
okay

1133
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,849
it's all part of the greater whole

1134
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:58,809
you know

1135
00:57:58,819 --> 00:58:00,170
na nature and whatever it is

1136
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:00,970
that's true

1137
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,369
i can't tell you about other things

1138
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:09,770
but i do believe in the things i just told you when it comes to living a successful life

1139
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,450
we've talked about having dreams

1140
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,410
and understanding your nature and aspiring for things and then understanding reality

1141
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,089
which transcendental meditation is a great mechanism and vehicle to do

1142
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:19,049
um

1143
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:19,609
and in your

1144
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,450
in your book about a successful life

1145
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,089
you talk about

1146
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:22,809
plus determination

1147
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,450
plus determination

1148
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:27,369
hard work

1149
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,490
if i want to be a successful man

1150
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:38,329
or woman, how important do you think hard work is? well, gives you power.

1151
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,329
it's very important, right? some people

1152
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,890
some people,

1153
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,369
you know,

1154
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,089
i'm not saying they want to choose it, but the ir

1155
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:50,010
the irony of things is there are first order consequences and there are second order consequences.

1156
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,770
this is like a rule of life, okay? and most of the time

1157
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,290
the first order consequences

1158
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,650
whether they're likable or not

1159
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,890
has the opposite second quarter

1160
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,410
second order consequences.

1161
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,970
what i mean by that is like eating or exercising.

1162
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,490
okay, eat the foods you like. second order consequence is probably not going to be good.

1163
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:19,770
um

1164
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,010
you know i don't want to exercise

1165
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:23,930
um

1166
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,809
second order consequences won't be as good. okay. working hard

1167
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,730
which gives you strength.

1168
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,490
where does strength come from?

1169
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,369
i mean strength comes from working hard.

1170
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,170
so working hard will will give you power.

1171
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,890
power will make things easier and make things better.

1172
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,809
that's just the way it is.

1173
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,170
and being open-minded while you do it. something that was openminded to you. yeah.

1174
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,369
i say

1175
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:53,770
uh

1176
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:57,369
the importance of being open-minded and assertive at the same time.

1177
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,170
um

1178
00:59:58,799 --> 00:59:59,049
i

1179
00:59:59,059 --> 00:59:59,290
i

1180
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:07,290
i watch people becoming so tied to their own opinions

1181
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:15,049
like this is the greatest tragedy of mankind. the greatest transgen of mankind

1182
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,730
because it so easily can be fixed

1183
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:23,049
is holding a strong opinion that is wrong

1184
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,369
that you could have made right better if you were open to learning more.

1185
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,690
if you would said, " i want to be stress tested.

1186
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:41,290
i want my thinking to be stress tested. i want to make sure that i'm making the better decision

1187
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,290
and so i'll be challenged.

1188
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:50,010
but a lot of people view that challenging like a fight. it's not a fight.

1189
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,369
if somebody holds a different opinion, it should prompt a curiosity.

1190
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,730
you know, i don't know.

1191
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:57,369
am i wrong

1192
01:00:57,379 --> 01:00:58,089
or is they wrong?

1193
01:00:58,099 --> 01:00:59,369
there's a 50 % chance.

1194
01:00:59,440 --> 01:00:59,930
i don't know.

1195
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,650
maybe i'm wrong.

1196
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,730
so, it should prompt curiosity

1197
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,730
and in exchange to try to make sure that you're seeing the whole picture and so on.

1198
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,530
but subliminal instincts are i'm going to stick with it and i'm going to have a fight.

1199
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,130
that's a problem

1200
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,970
because there's too much on the line for so many people to

1201
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:19,849
it's subliminal.

1202
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:20,890
it's

1203
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:21,130
it's

1204
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:29,690
it just goes back to the mind thinking that the intellectual challenge is a fight and it's egotistical.

1205
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,049
you know,

1206
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:31,450
ego,

1207
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,770
i must be right.

1208
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,890
as an as an investor and entrepreneur, that's obviously particularly important

1209
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,490
because you're constantly dealing with your information and feedback, which you need to be flexible.

1210
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,049
that was one of the two things that changed my

1211
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:46,970
uh

1212
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:47,930
my

1213
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:48,170
my

1214
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:52,730
my whole direction and made me successful. i i can explain it if you want.

1215
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,650
please. 19

1216
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:56,490
79

1217
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:57,849
and 80

1218
01:01:59,119 --> 01:01:59,849
i had calculated

1219
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:04,569
that american banks had lent more money to foreign countries

1220
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,809
that they were going to be able to pay back

1221
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,809
and that we were going to have a debt crisis.

1222
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,849
very controversial point of view.

1223
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:18,490
in august of 1982, mexico defaulted on its debts

1224
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:24,170
and over the next decade, many other countries did and it caused bank problems.

1225
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,329
however, at that time, i thought things were going to get bad

1226
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,170
and that was the exact bottom in the stock market, august 1982.

1227
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:35,690
so, i couldn't have been more wrong.

1228
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,609
i lost money for me.

1229
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:40,650
i lost money for the clients.

1230
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,690
i lost money.

1231
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,890
i was so broke

1232
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:48,089
that i had to borrow $ 4, 000 from my dad to help to pay for family bills

1233
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,690
because i was faced with the choice.

1234
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,569
what am i going to do?

1235
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,369
and and do i do

1236
01:02:53,379 --> 01:02:58,650
i go back to work on wall street, get a uh tie, get on the train,

1237
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,849
and go back that

1238
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,410
which is again not in my nature or whatever.

1239
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,369
and and two things changed me. okay, reflection.

1240
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:07,849
first of all,

1241
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:10,730
um,

1242
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,490
i learned what we were just talking about.

1243
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:18,170
i learned humility and fear of being wrong and open-mindedness.

1244
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,250
so, i wanted the smartest people who could i could find to stress test my opinions

1245
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,450
because i'm always realized i could be wrong.

1246
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,490
and then i learned how to diversify my bets so

1247
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,250
that i could dramatically reduce my risk without reducing my returns.

1248
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,130
okay, that was the bottom.

1249
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:40,329
okay,

1250
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,369
from that point all the way over that

1251
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,650
following those principles took me to the biggest hedge fund in the world, the most successful

1252
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:49,369
and so on

1253
01:03:49,379 --> 01:03:51,849
because i applied it to the markets, applied it to what we did

1254
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,329
and so on. so that notion of reflection

1255
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,609
and then how do you deal with what reality is like

1256
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,130
and then you know

1257
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:01,530
okay

1258
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,569
the learn

1259
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,130
learn

1260
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,530
radical open-mindedness in other words

1261
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,809
and like there's a principle in the book you have to take in before you put out or that

1262
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:11,530
um

1263
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,010
decision making is a two-step process

1264
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,970
first take in then decide.

1265
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:24,329
okay. so, yes, open-mindedness. you don't doesn't in any way minimize your ability to decide.

1266
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,369
so, you still have the freedom to decide, but it's crazy not to be open-minded.

1267
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,450
you recognize that the biggest threat to good decision-m is harmful emotions.

1268
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,210
and that two-step process is first learn and then make the decision.

1269
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:37,770
which is funny

1270
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,130
because it sounds simple, but

1271
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:42,010
when you said it, i think about all the worst decisions i've ever made in business.

1272
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,970
and i missed step one. i forgot

1273
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:45,369
to

1274
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,730
i forgot to take a minute and do the evidence gathering or the like information gathering process.

1275
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,369
yeah, just smart people who care about your decision

1276
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,170
say

1277
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:55,369
stress test me.

1278
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:02,569
why don't we do that? that ego and also instinct that that's a fight.

1279
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:08,569
is there any advice you would give me on becoming a better decision maker? so i have a fund, i have many businesses.

1280
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,450
is there any sort of practical simple foundations of becoming a better decision maker

1281
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,970
that we haven't talked about? get smart people to interrogate my thinking.

1282
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,210
um, be open-minded. i think we've talked about almost all of them. um,

1283
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:33,210
i think then you have to then know about how to leverage yourself. okay.

1284
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,049
in other words, as you do more and more, uh,

1285
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:41,690
how do you do more and more when your brain has a capacity limit, okay,

1286
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:45,210
and there's only certain number of hours in the day or the week,

1287
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,089
okay, you have to know how to do that. is that focus

1288
01:05:48,099 --> 01:05:48,730
or is that something?

1289
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,450
no, no,

1290
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:49,930
no.

1291
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:58,490
it's knowing how to do it through others. okay. it's knowing how to pick others and orchestrate.

1292
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,410
well, it's like

1293
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:00,890
uh

1294
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,329
running a symphony or whatever.

1295
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,970
okay. get the best players. okay, when i say

1296
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:07,530
uh

1297
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:07,930
you know

1298
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:08,490
um

1299
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:15,130
good character and good capabilities and orchestrate them well and then provide that

1300
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:15,690
um

1301
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,089
that leverage

1302
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:16,490
like

1303
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:16,890
uh

1304
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:17,210
um

1305
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:18,490
when i was doing the most

1306
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,650
i had 30 direct reports

1307
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:23,690
whatever the number is.

1308
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:24,410
so

1309
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:25,210
uh

1310
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:25,609
it

1311
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,250
the process is how to get more out of a minute

1312
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:34,730
or a day, not how to work harder, okay? it's how to leverage yourself.

1313
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,690
and you're going to leverage yourself by picking the right people who you can trust.

1314
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,010
they're not going to screw you.

1315
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:45,210
they're going to operate in your interest and they're going to be capable.

1316
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,970
and so a lot of people what you can do is you can deal with them

1317
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,650
and then you can say

1318
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,089
like i i would deal with them on this 30 reports.

1319
01:06:54,799 --> 01:07:00,089
i'd have maybe um an hour meeting with them once every two weeks

1320
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,730
and and they go off and do things. and when you do that

1321
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,809
you can even find people who are much better at things than you would be if you did them.

1322
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,450
because if you have these different things, okay, you better

1323
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,970
because otherwise you don't have the capacity.

1324
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:23,450
you have these two key challenges to to overcome as an entrepreneur, which is find these great capable people

1325
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,170
that have great character

1326
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,049
and then

1327
01:07:25,059 --> 01:07:25,289
like

1328
01:07:25,299 --> 01:07:28,730
bind them with the right culture to make sure that they do the best work, right?

1329
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:37,849
and and in other words, it's meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical truthfulness and radical transparency.

1330
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,049
radical truthfulness and transparency.

1331
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:41,930
okay.

1332
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:52,089
first, if you can have um meaningful work and meaningful relationships, the people are on the mission with you.

1333
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,770
wow, that's fantastic.

1334
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,930
but you

1335
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,650
you better be truthful and transparent. that'll show that you're honest and you better

1336
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,170
because you have to get a truth

1337
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:12,170
including what people are bad at and how to deal with all those things

1338
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:13,289
and

1339
01:08:13,299 --> 01:08:18,330
and most people hide them. they don't bring them out into the open. okay,

1340
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:18,729
they

1341
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,969
everybody's worried about hurting each other's feelings

1342
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:22,649
or you know

1343
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:23,049
uh

1344
01:08:23,059 --> 01:08:23,210
that

1345
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:23,850
and then

1346
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:26,969
so they're not honest with each other and and they're

1347
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:27,929
that's the barrier

1348
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:28,330
you

1349
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:28,969
we talked about

1350
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,170
the barrier of disagreement

1351
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:31,290
there's

1352
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,170
it's like that

1353
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:32,569
okay

1354
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:33,290
um

1355
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,009
you know

1356
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:34,569
uh

1357
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:35,130
i don't know

1358
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,408
are you good at that

1359
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,448
or you're striking out

1360
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,170
if you're striking out and what is it

1361
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:41,210
how do we deal with it

1362
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,049
you better talk about that clearly

1363
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,850
because you need to have an a team of players

1364
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,210
you know you have to work yourself

1365
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,089
so your team is an a team of players who are tight.

1366
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,689
how did you do that at bridgewater?

1367
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,250
how did you make people honest? oh, well

1368
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:54,729
uh

1369
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:54,890
f

1370
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,609
first of all

1371
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,330
um

1372
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:59,929
i had a policy talk behind another person's back

1373
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:01,529
um

1374
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,250
critically.

1375
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,969
that happens three times, you're out.

1376
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,408
and then i would have radical transparency so everybody could see everything.

1377
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,448
so you could see why i'm making decisions and i would reflect.

1378
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:21,210
but the main thing is you know you know if it's happening or not.

1379
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,330
okay.

1380
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,049
and i made that comfortable because that's ordinarily uncomfortable.

1381
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,729
we talked about the fact that there's an intellectual you and there's an emotional subliminal you.

1382
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:37,049
okay. i made them understand like if i had a team

1383
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:42,408
a football team and so on that this is going to be better for the team.

1384
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,408
is going to be better for you and you'll have your evolution

1385
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,810
because what do you want to have dishonesty?

1386
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,810
do you want people to think one thing about you

1387
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:55,850
and really say something different? how is that going to work?

1388
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,090
so there's an intellectual

1389
01:09:59,360 --> 01:09:59,610
okay

1390
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,409
we believe it

1391
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,690
and then also by having the meaningful relationships. i mean i'm not

1392
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,570
i don't force them.

1393
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:12,489
i create a culture of meaningful relationships so that they have known each other for a long time.

1394
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:19,130
they go go to each other's parties or they go to each other's there are funerals.

1395
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,650
there are baby showers. there are these things. not that anybody's f

1396
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:32,650
i created uh clubs. i said, " any club that you want to create that has more than uh

1397
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,210
20 people

1398
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:34,489
um

1399
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,290
whatever it is

1400
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:41,449
up to $ 500 per half. " so, so i don't care what it is.

1401
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,370
if it's play softball

1402
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,570
or play chess

1403
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,409
or whatever it is that you're enjoying each other's company

1404
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,890
or you want to go to ball games or something, i don't care what it is.

1405
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,810
i'll pay for half up to that

1406
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,530
up to $ 500.

1407
01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:00,010
so i to nobody has obligations to or something

1408
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,449
but if i have that kind of meaningful relationships

1409
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,210
so you can talk honestly with each other

1410
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,090
uh

1411
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,929
i found that very helpful and you've built a famously built an idea

1412
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:12,730
meritocracy

1413
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:19,449
which in my understanding means where the best idea ends up winning in the company versus just your idea

1414
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,370
because you're the most powerful person in the business

1415
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:21,770
right

1416
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,850
i mean i want what do i want

1417
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,449
i want the best idea to win

1418
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:26,570
this sounds simple

1419
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,370
but but again

1420
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:27,610
it's

1421
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,810
it's not how businesses operate.

1422
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,969
one of the fascinations i've always had is that

1423
01:11:30,979 --> 01:11:35,449
when businesses get bigger and they have more intellectual horsepower by

1424
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,010
i mean if you just added up how many brains they had

1425
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,489
they sometimes get less innovative

1426
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:44,090
and it it feels like the the ceo well

1427
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:49,929
because they become more more bureaucratic and more fragmented. yeah. okay. there's

1428
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:50,570
um

1429
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,850
i found it to be true

1430
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,530
and it's wellestablished fact that if you get a group of people past a certain size

1431
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,730
which is 75 to 100 people

1432
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:02,489
um

1433
01:12:02,499 --> 01:12:04,330
they don't know each other. okay,

1434
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:04,730
they

1435
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:04,969
they

1436
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:07,210
they start to become different

1437
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,250
and then you lose those relationships. you lose a lot and so on.

1438
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,290
i found it because

1439
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:13,929
uh

1440
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:14,330
um

1441
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,650
at the holiday season every year,

1442
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:24,330
what i would do is i would write everybody notes, long notes in their cards

1443
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,090
and i would pick an individualized holiday gift for them.

1444
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,850
and when it got to be to 67 people, i remember the year, it broke my back.

1445
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,409
i mean, i i just couldn't do it. okay.

1446
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:43,130
and i realized that at that point i was going into another frame.

1447
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,330
okay. and so it's a organizational reality that you can keep that group

1448
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:51,290
and then what you have to do is then you have different

1449
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,610
those different areas and you have to create cohesiveness between those different and cohesiveness

1450
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,290
common mission

1451
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,010
and how do you do that between that. so, like

1452
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:02,409
for example,

1453
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,449
when we would have our holiday party where it used to be

1454
01:13:05,459 --> 01:13:10,489
everybody would be, you know, sort of go in and you have a holiday party and everybody together,

1455
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:15,370
what i found out is we had a big arena that we would uh

1456
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:18,409
go to and i'd have both. i'd have okay

1457
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:19,370
um

1458
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,690
that department is in that area and whatever

1459
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,650
and then they come out and they all mingle together and so on.

1460
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:32,090
so there's an organizational thing that you've got to realize in terms of culture and and management of that.

1461
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,370
it's like villages in a city

1462
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:33,770
i guess

1463
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:33,929
like

1464
01:13:33,939 --> 01:13:34,170
yeah

1465
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:37,770
you basically keep build the villages and then good example city. interesting.

1466
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:39,370
okay. yeah.

1467
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,850
our media company's at that exact point now. it's at

1468
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:42,810
it's at that

1469
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:43,449
90

1470
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,850
90 odd people. okay. there you are.

1471
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,370
so when you said 75 to 100

1472
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,090
i was like ah

1473
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:48,330
interesting.

1474
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:48,969
yeah.

1475
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:54,570
i was thinking about all the things i should be doing now to counteract some of those adverse effects of the culture splintering

1476
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,330
or relationships breaking down.

1477
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,370
but i guess you've described it there. uh

1478
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:00,409
interesting.

1479
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,810
and i have to say one of the things i found to be most

1480
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,370
i'm 33 years old. i just turned 33 last week.

1481
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:12,010
it's crazy how how often people say that hiring is the most important thing.

1482
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:12,810
yet

1483
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:17,770
when you look at how what entrepreneurs are spending their time on, it's usually like the product, the marketing, etc.

1484
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:23,290
and it's maybe like one or two hours in some cases if they're lucky on finding truly exceptional people.

1485
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,170
they often just outsource it to someone else, the recruitment team.

1486
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:33,290
when you think back through your career, how important was it to find truly exceptional people? of course.

1487
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,090
well, i systemized it first of all.

1488
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,050
um

1489
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:42,010
i think that anything i do or one does can be systemized.

1490
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:48,570
so i would think what are the personalities, what are the backgrounds of the people

1491
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,890
that i'm hiring, what are the choices,

1492
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,330
how do i specify it? and i've and i got it

1493
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,929
by also maintaining a lot of data with people.

1494
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:58,890
there's um

1495
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,370
there's a ted talk i did that

1496
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:02,409
uh

1497
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:04,170
explains how like data

1498
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:04,890
uh

1499
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,690
everybody's going around and they're operating in a certain way.

1500
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,130
so i know what people are like.

1501
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,810
if you know what people are like, you know what you can expect of them.

1502
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,810
and then i would then say uh

1503
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:17,850
in a very data way,

1504
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,850
those people who are successful in these jobs have the following attributes

1505
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:31,050
that would create a job specifications for that type of job.

1506
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,489
so i i knew

1507
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,290
that in that type of job there would be that type of person i'm looking for.

1508
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:38,409
okay.

1509
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:39,850
what works

1510
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:40,969
they work

1511
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:41,530
okay

1512
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:41,850
data

1513
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,530
and then i would find that would be my job spec

1514
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,010
and and so we had the systems

1515
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,210
and then we had some people who are responsible for doing that

1516
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,010
because you're right

1517
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:54,810
it takes time

1518
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,810
how can i interview all those people and so on

1519
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:00,170
but who can you trust and you're operating that way

1520
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:05,449
and then evaluation process doesn't stop when you hire them

1521
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:06,650
okay

1522
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,409
the valuation process continues from that moment

1523
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:15,449
and you still learn more about what they're like and you do that same process and still think

1524
01:16:15,459 --> 01:16:15,690
would

1525
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,530
i still have hired them and and if i wouldn't have hired them

1526
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:20,890
you know

1527
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,530
in the first place

1528
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,210
then they shouldn't be there

1529
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,570
and so i have a process and people

1530
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:27,610
people in process

1531
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,610
do people change after a certain point

1532
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:32,330
so if you've hired someone in six months and 12 months and they haven't changed

1533
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,330
is it worth giving them another year

1534
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,530
is it worth a performance review

1535
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,770
i found out that for me the big question

1536
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,610
mostly there were two big questions

1537
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,890
but um

1538
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,890
the big question is how do you adapt to my culture

1539
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,570
and that would take about 18 months to find out like

1540
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,650
can you speak honestly about what can we have thoughtful disagreement

1541
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,010
do you like this evolutionary process where you're challenged and all of this kind of thing

1542
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,969
that culture that'take about 18 months and then roughly speaking

1543
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,170
then learning about the people

1544
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,650
their strengths and weaknesses would take 18 months

1545
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,050
two

1546
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:15,690
two years

1547
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,449
maybe something along those lines

1548
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,969
and so then you know

1549
01:17:20,979 --> 01:17:22,810
you could pretty much decide

1550
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,330
but always being open every day by day

1551
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:29,850
so nobody's surprised that you're always talking about things

1552
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,650
you know

1553
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:31,290
how's it going

1554
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,409
make sure you keep what i'm about to say to yourself

01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:15,530
um

1585
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,929
a bit of an alien that seems to have entered the room um

1586
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,170
and has is going to change more

1587
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,409
almost every every industry. great.

1588
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:24,409
yeah.

1589
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,330
i can't tell if you're being sarcastic. no.

1590
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:27,690
truly,

1591
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,050
if you are

1592
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:30,170
um

1593
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:39,130
working with it, controlling it, if it's a good partner to be able to get a lot of leverage, it's truly fantastic.

1594
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:45,370
as i said in almost everything i did, we had the criteria, we had the systemized.

1595
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,730
would you do that? would you not do that? how do you know

1596
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:54,650
how does reality work? what are the principles? and and so it's a fantastic leveraging

1597
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,409
like i described. you know, i would make the decision-making model

1598
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:04,010
like the computer chess game that would make it. well, now it's better than uh

1599
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,370
ever those those resources.

1600
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,770
so it leverages you enormously. what about having a strong middle?

1601
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,409
we talked about having the strong sort of economic political middle.

1602
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,969
political middle. yeah. yeah. is it going to drive inequality? yes.

1603
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:17,290
it's going

1604
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,650
that's like all good

1605
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,370
like all things. going to be

1606
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,170
um

1607
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,050
it has good things and bad things and we were talking

1608
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,890
let's say first about managing and doing that

1609
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,330
i think in managing and knowing what people are like and how they're all

1610
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,010
it's going to be very valuable

1611
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,730
mostly very valuable in terms of changing

1612
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,170
um

1613
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:40,969
there'll be

1614
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,250
uh

1615
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:45,929
a limited number of winners and a bunch of losers and

1616
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:46,730
um

1617
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:49,210
i think it's going to create much greater polarity

1618
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:50,650
which

1619
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:54,250
as we're seeing um through the system

1620
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,610
the ways that we talked about

1621
01:20:56,159 --> 01:21:02,250
you know that top 1 to 10 % benefiting a lot and that you know

1622
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,010
so that will be a dividing

1623
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:05,850
uh force

1624
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,730
i think it's got to got to pose the question with robotics accelerating at the speed of of light

1625
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,090
with optimist and tesla

1626
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,130
and all the things they're doing

1627
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,010
and all these other companies

1628
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:14,969
humanoid robots

1629
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,730
and then with artificial intelligence

1630
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:22,010
having trillions of dollars plowed into it and accelerating. we're in this crazy boom at the moment.

1631
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,330
with these two things combining, you're going to be able to have a humanoid robot who

1632
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,850
that can navigate human spaces, but is also smarter than i am.

1633
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,370
lawyers, accountants,

1634
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:32,969
uh

1635
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,810
lots of people in the medical profession. why would you

1636
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:42,489
why would one need them if we had a humanoid robot that is smarter than all of us

1637
01:21:42,499 --> 01:21:43,690
and has a phd and everything?

1638
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:49,610
well, we will not need a lot of those jobs for the reasons that you're saying.

1639
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:54,250
okay. and then the question is what our society does

1640
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:02,570
and what do you think we do in such a world? i think we fight over about what we do unfortunately.

1641
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:03,690
um

1642
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,370
but as i say i i don't think we have escaped a world

1643
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:13,770
where most people to have a healthy society

1644
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:20,170
most people have to be productive and prosperous. i don't

1645
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:20,409
i

1646
01:22:20,419 --> 01:22:22,250
i think people need to be now

1647
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,010
certainly there

1648
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:28,889
and there certainly needs to be a redistribution policy.

1649
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,050
i don't think that's just a redistribution of money policy

1650
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:39,290
because uselessness and money may not be a great combination.

1651
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:44,650
so i think that you have that has to be figured out

1652
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:50,650
and the question is whether we're too fragmented to figure that out and agree on it

1653
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,090
and i'm worried about that.

1654
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,409
interesting times. is there any historical precedence for this in your view? someone that knows history.

1655
01:22:58,419 --> 01:23:01,610
is there any historical precedence for something like ai and robotics converging?

1656
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:02,330
well,

1657
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:02,969
um

1658
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:14,250
through um evolution, we have gone from a period of time

1659
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,530
which was called the dark ages or the agricultural age

1660
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,050
in which

1661
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:19,929
um

1662
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,489
basically there was land.

1663
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,409
it's agricultural and so on

1664
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,409
and people were treated

1665
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,050
they were essentially like oxen

1666
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,010
most people

1667
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,770
and then there were the landowners

1668
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:32,969
who were the nobles

1669
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,090
and then there were the royalty

1670
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,050
who

1671
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:35,690
uh

1672
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:37,610
were the families that control most things

1673
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:38,250
and so on

1674
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:39,610
and then in history

1675
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,250
with the uh invention of the printing press

1676
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,050
there became more knowledge

1677
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:48,810
um

1678
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:49,449
uh

1679
01:23:49,459 --> 01:23:50,170
more intelligence

1680
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,090
and we see an evolution in which

1681
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:54,810
um

1682
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,570
you start to see new ages emerge and thinking emerge and power change

1683
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,889
and i won't take you through the whole history

1684
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:09,370
but you start to see that individuals can be clever enough to earn money

1685
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,170
that

1686
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:18,889
so you begin the age of exploration and the industrial revolutions in which machines replaced people

1687
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,130
and it's almost like they first replaced them physically

1688
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:24,330
that

1689
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:24,889
um

1690
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,489
in other words they didn't have

1691
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,889
they were not like oxen doing the thing

1692
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:30,650
so you get a tractor or something

1693
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:36,010
and and it's almost like from the body up in terms of the mind

1694
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:44,010
and so you've seen that evolution through time and the rise of intelligence in its various forms

1695
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,650
go through this arc of rising in intelligence

1696
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:53,690
and now you see that intelligence matters more than anything.

1697
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,409
okay? it matters more than money.

1698
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,530
it matters more than anything

1699
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:04,650
because intelligence will attract people among those with money to invest in them in the development of that.

1700
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:13,130
and so we have seen this arc through history develop in that way, right? and we've seen people replaced.

1701
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,570
now the question is as we get higher

1702
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:22,730
and higher in thinking, okay, whether we've run out of capacity to shift

1703
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,730
or whether we're just going to be totally replaced. our muscles have been totally replaced, but okay,

1704
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,290
as this is happening, our best thinking may be totally replaced

1705
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,770
and we're going to have to deal with that question.

1706
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,730
are you hopeful? i'm excited.

1707
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,210
i'm

1708
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,130
i think it all comes down to human nature.

1709
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,170
okay.

1710
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:57,370
i'm excited in that. fast forward, make the most of it, jump on it.

1711
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,250
woo

1712
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:58,250
!

1713
01:25:58,639 --> 01:25:59,130
you know,

1714
01:25:59,140 --> 01:25:59,690
i'm excited.

1715
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,770
i've also watched

1716
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:02,730
uh

1717
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:03,929
the evolution of species.

1718
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,250
almost all species have come

1719
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,330
and gone for certain reasons

1720
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:15,610
and they uh one of the reasons that they come have come and gone is

1721
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:18,969
because almost their strengths are not in all respects

1722
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:19,850
great strengths.

1723
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:24,810
you can use these things, intelligence to your detriment.

1724
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,250
and i believe that

1725
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:29,530
um

1726
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,610
the things that these technologies and so on bring us while very important,

1727
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,210
it extends life expectancy

1728
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:43,370
and all of that is not import as important as human nature.

1729
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,290
and so if you were to go back in time

1730
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:54,090
and we're at different societies, do you have happier societies? is the well-being greater? okay.

1731
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,889
so you can go 50 years ago and you might say the well-being is greater

1732
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,090
50 years ago.

1733
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:03,690
not in all ways, not in in many ways

1734
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:09,050
the technologies and the consequences of those are much better, but you may have had a better life.

1735
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:14,010
and it's human nature of how people are going to deal with each other.

1736
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:19,449
so i think the real question is can people rise above this

1737
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:20,650
and

1738
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:23,290
and which it goes back to the spirituality question.

1739
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:32,650
can people then rise above it so that they think of the collective good and they think of you

1740
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:32,889
know

1741
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:33,290
collectively

1742
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,489
how do we make the best and also karma

1743
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:37,530
you know

1744
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,090
in other words

1745
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:38,889
um

1746
01:27:38,899 --> 01:27:39,449
the realization

1747
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,489
that if i help you in ways

1748
01:27:42,499 --> 01:27:46,170
that can be so simple for me to help you make such a big difference in your life

1749
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:49,130
and you do the same and we have win-win relationships

1750
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:50,889
it'll be good

1751
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,730
but if we don't do that

1752
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,530
and i worry about human nature

1753
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:01,850
and i worry about this process, especially when you've got geopolitical tensions. and it's because of human nature.

1754
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,530
i've had a lot of conversations on the podcast about ai

1755
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,050
and i just can't seem to get to my own solid conclusion about this

1756
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,810
because when i look at human nature, as you say,

1757
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,090
i see greed, i see power, hunger, status.

1758
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:15,050
yeah.

1759
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:15,690
some problems

1760
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,850
you just just accept the fact

1761
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,530
that you may not be able to be confident about a prediction in the future.

1762
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,810
so, it'll always be a question

1763
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,570
and just get on with the fact of using it for yourself in the best way

1764
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:27,210
that works for you.

1765
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,090
that's what i'm doing.

1766
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,090
we have a closing tradition on this podcast

1767
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,969
where the last leaves a question for the next not knowing who they're leaving it for.

1768
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,250
you know this person

1769
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:35,290
um

1770
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,449
because i've seen you with them.

1771
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:37,929
um

1772
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,889
the question they left for you is what is a book

1773
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,969
or books that you've recommended or gifted more than others

1774
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,810
and why? can't say your own but right

1775
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,010
um

1776
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:51,929
there are three books

1777
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,969
there's a book on evolution

1778
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,130
written by richard dawkins

1779
01:28:58,960 --> 01:28:59,210
uh

1780
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,610
river from eden

1781
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:02,730
i think it's called

1782
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:03,770
then

1783
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,650
a book by um will and ariel durant

1784
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,889
which are the maybe the greatest historians in time

1785
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,370
and it's called lessons from history

1786
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:17,449
it's a very short book.

1787
01:29:17,459 --> 01:29:24,570
i think it's 104 pages. they wrote massive amounts about 5, 000 years of history and so on.

1788
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:31,370
and they sort of condense their lessons, lessons from history. and then um

1789
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:39,929
joseph campbell's the hero's journey. is it the the hero with a thousand faces?

1790
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:40,810
yes, that's it.

1791
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,330
hero with a thousand faces.

1792
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,929
and why dawkins book?

1793
01:29:43,939 --> 01:29:46,250
why did you say that one? oh, he understands evolution.

1794
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,330
everything is evolving. okay. all species.

1795
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,810
man is one of 10, 000 species.

1796
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:58,570
i mean, and they're and they're all structured similarly. there's a structure. they

1797
01:29:58,639 --> 01:29:58,889
they

1798
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,449
you know,

1799
01:29:59,600 --> 01:29:59,850
like

1800
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,570
um

1801
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:05,130
two eyes, a brain that has a structure to it. um

1802
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,650
that and the same parts of the brain. there's the cereum,

1803
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,370
the cerebellum, the prefrontal cortex. there's this structure that makes you think differently

1804
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,889
and and so on. there's evolution. there's all evolution.

1805
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,489
so, it's not just limited to um

1806
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,969
human evolution or what humans are like.

1807
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,010
it's the force of evolution. man is only

1808
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:27,210
um

1809
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,370
mankind's only about 200, 000 years old. that's in history

1810
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,409
that's short.

1811
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:33,370
okay.

1812
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,889
and and the species and all species evolve. okay. and it's very interesting.

1813
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,090
so that's and you know that's what his books are about

1814
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,770
and you know i think they're very good

1815
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,530
and joseph campbell's the hero's journey

1816
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,409
the hero

1817
01:30:46,419 --> 01:30:46,650
with

1818
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:47,370
it's

1819
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:47,449
it's

1820
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:53,370
about human nature and and the evolution of life and the life journey that we're talking about.

1821
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:58,090
what i find so interesting ray is how you draw on principles from other domains

1822
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,929
whether it's from nature or biology

1823
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:04,650
as you were talking about there to tie into your work in business

1824
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,969
and investing and everything else and life and happiness.

1825
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,250
and it really says something to me about being more eclectic

1826
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,489
and be broadly curious in order to be successful in my more narrative.

1827
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,610
yeah. i just see i i don't

1828
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:20,969
is that to me

1829
01:31:20,979 --> 01:31:24,330
maybe too much of a specialist kind of mentality

1830
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:30,090
but the world is being interrelated to these things if you want to understand how reality works.

1831
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:31,130
um

1832
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,690
you can't say i'm going to be just a specialist.

1833
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,610
i mean these are all affected by each other.

1834
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,290
thank you so much for write writing these books. they are iconic

1835
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,250
and

1836
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:44,810
uh

1837
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,489
the youtube videos that explain these

1838
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:47,610
these books are iconic.

1839
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:52,250
i don't know who you have on your team that makes the animations and pulls it all together.

1840
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,130
but not only is the content so important

1841
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:01,850
because they are principles, so they're enduring through time, but they're so unbelievably accessible to all people of all ages.

1842
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:02,409
and if

1843
01:32:02,419 --> 01:32:02,730
if you

1844
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,730
if people haven't read this book, i'd be shocked. but

1845
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:05,610
um

1846
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,050
all of these books are fantastic. the this book, principles by ray dalia,

1847
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,610
which i'm going to link all of them below for anyone that wants to read them.

1848
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,610
i suggest you read them all, um

1849
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,409
will be formative in your life, even if you're not interested in business or investing

1850
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,530
because as as it says on the book, they're principles and the

1851
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,170
the economy affects us all in ways that we might not understand.

1852
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,130
we're all trying to be successful or happy in our own right.

1853
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,130
and that that's interwoven into all of these books.

1854
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:27,610
so, thank you.

1855
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,489
i hope you write more books.

1856
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:33,210
well, and thank you because yeah, i'm at a stage in my life, this is a symbiotic relationship

1857
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,370
otherwise we wouldn't be here. okay.

1858
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:35,929
and my

1859
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:36,570
um

1860
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,130
my benefit is that i want to pass along these things and we're doing it together.

1861
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:42,810
and i have found

1862
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:47,850
and it's joyous to me to know that these things have made a big difference in people's lives.

1863
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,130
people come up to me and they say, " thank you for the difference you've made.

1864
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:54,010
" and you know, at this stage in my life, that's what i want to do.

1865
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:54,810
i think that's an understatement.

1866
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,330
i think it's had a profound impact.

1867
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:01,130
in fact, every person i know, all of my best friends have taken something from your work

1868
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:05,290
which has had a profound impact on their decision-m which has led them to be happier in some way.

1869
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:05,449
and

1870
01:33:05,459 --> 01:33:06,090
when i told my friends

1871
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:10,570
that i was interviewing you, i'm interviewing 16 people while i'm in new york over the over the next month.

1872
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,650
when i told my friends, my best friends in the world,

1873
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:17,449
that i'm interviewing you, all of them were telling me to pass on a message of thanks

1874
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,090
because there's something in one of these books that's helped them.

1875
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,489
and they're all young people in that first season of their life.

1876
01:33:22,499 --> 01:33:26,489
and there's there's something in all of these books that's um pushed them closer to their success

1877
01:33:26,499 --> 01:33:27,050
and their happiness.

1878
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,090
so, thank you for on behalf of me because you've had a profound impact on me.

1879
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,770
but thank you. thank you for giving me that joy.

1880
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,530
you know that. thank you. i really really mean that. thank you so much, ray.
