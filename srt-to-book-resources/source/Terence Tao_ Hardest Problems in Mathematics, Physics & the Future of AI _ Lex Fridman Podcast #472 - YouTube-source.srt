00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,219
The following is a conversation with Terence Tao

2
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:07,879
widely considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians in history

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,239
often referred to as the Mozart of Math.

4
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:23,019
He won the Fields Medal and a Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics and has contributed groundbreaking work to a truly astonishing range of fields in mathematics and physics.

5
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:27,239
This was a huge honor for me, for many reasons

6
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:34,260
including the humility and kindness that Terry showed to me throughout all our interactions.

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,779
It means the world.

8
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:38,599

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,879
And now, dear friends, here's Terence Tao.

12
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,639
What was the first really difficult research-level math problem that you encountered?

13
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,259
One that gave you pause maybe?

14
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,179
Well, I mean, in your undergraduate, um

15
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,279
education, you learn about the really hard impossible problems

16
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:06,239
like the Riemann hypothesis, between primes conjecture.

17
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,439
You can make problems arbitrarily difficult, and that's not really a problem.

18
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,459
In fact there's even problems that we know to be unsolvable.

19
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,259
What's really interesting are, are the problems just on the

20
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,359
on the boundary between what we can do relatively easily and what are hopeless

21
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,279
um, but what, uh, problems where

22
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:25,879
like, existing techniques can do, like, 90% of the job and then y- you just need that remaining 10%.

23
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,459
Um, I think as a PhD student

24
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,619
the Kakeya problem certainly caught my eye, and it just got solved actually.

25
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:35,139
It's a problem I've worked on a lot in my early research.

26
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:38,099
Historically, it came from a little puzzle by the Japanese

27
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,659
uh, mathematician Shoji Kakeya, uh, in like 1918 or so.

28
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,379
Um, so, the puzzle is that you

29
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,539
you have, um, a needle, um

30
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:50,299
in c- on the plane, um, or- or think of like a

31
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:52,699
like driving on- on- on- on- on a road

32
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:55,259
something, and you want to- to execute a U-turn

33
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,099
you want to turn the needle around, um

34
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:59,699
but you want to do it in as little space as possible

35
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,739
uh, so you want to use as little area

36
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,499
uh, in order to turn it around.

37
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,519
So, um, but the needle is infinitely maneuverable.

38
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,119
So you can imagine just spinning it around its

39
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,699
um, as a unit needle, you can spin it around its center

40
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,639
um, and I think, um, that gives you a disc of- of area

41
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,499
I think, pi over 4.

42
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:19,119
Um, or you can do a three-point U-turn

43
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:22,559
which is what they, we teach people in- in the driving schools to do

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,579
uh, and that actually takes area pi over 8

45
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,839
uh, so it's- it's a little bit more efficient than

46
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:27,939
um, a rotation.

47
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,439
And so for a while people thought that was the most efficient

48
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,939
uh, way to turn things around, but Bazikovic

49
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:35,299
uh, showed that in fact, uh, you could actually

50
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:37,899
uh, turn the needle around using as little area as you wanted.

51
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:38,699
Mm.

52
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,559
So.

53
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,419
001, there was some really fancy multi, um

54
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,899
uh, um, back and forth U-turn thing that you could- you could do

55
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,019
that- that you could turn a needle around.

56
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,899
And in so doing, it would pass through every intermediate direction.

57
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,559
Is this in the two-dimensional plane?

58
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,879
This is in the two-dimensional plane, yeah.

59
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,939
So we understand everything in two dimensions.

60
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:58,279
So the next question is, what happens in three dimensions?

61
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:02,139
So suppose like the Hubble Space Telescope, this tube in space

62
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,199
and you want to observe every single star in the universe

63
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,079
so you want to rotate the telescope to reach every single direction.

64
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:11,379
And here's the unrealistic part, suppose that space is at a premium

65
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,419
which it totally is not.

66
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,399
 Yeah.

67
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:17,739
Uh, you want to occupy as little volume as possible in order to rotate your- your needle around

68
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,419
in order to see every single star in the sky.

69
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:22,739
Um, how small a volume do you need to do that?

70
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,399
And so you can modify Bazikovic's construction, and so if your telescope has zero thickness

71
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,499
then you can use as little volume as you need.

72
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:33,339
That's a- a simple modification of the two-dimensional construction.

73
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,259
But the question is that if your telescope is not zero thickness

74
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:39,199
but- but just very, very thin, some thickness delta

75
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:45,379
what is the minimum volume needed to be able to see every single direction as a function of delta?

76
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,019
So as delta gets smaller, as the needle gets- gets thinner

77
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,519
the volume should go down but- but how fast does it go down?

78
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,619
Um, and the conjecture was that it goes down very

79
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:58,279
very slowly, um, like logarithmically, um

80
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,759
uh, roughly speaking, and that was proved after a lot of work.

81
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,039
So this seems like a puzzle, why is it interesting?

82
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,599
So it turns out to be surprisingly connected to a lot of problems in partial differential equations

83
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,559
in number theory, in geometry, combinatorics.

84
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:15,759
For example, in- in wave propagation if you splash some- some water around

85
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,459
um, you create water waves an- they- they travel in various directions.

86
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,719
Um, but waves exhibit both w- both particle and wave type behavior.

87
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,879
So you can have what's called a wave packet

88
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,159
which is like a- a very localized wave that is localized in space and moving a certain direction in time.

89
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:32,699
And so if you plot it in both space and time

90
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,539
it occupies a region which looks like a tube.

91
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:43,699
And so what can happen is that you can have a wave which initially is- is very dispersed but it all come- it all focuses at a single point later in time.

92
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:47,639
Like, you can imagine dropping a- a pebble into a pond and ripples spread out

93
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,059
but then if you time reverse that- that

94
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:52,979
um, that scenario, and the equations of wave motion are time reversible

95
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,099
you can imagine ripples that are converging, um

96
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,759
to a single point and then a- a big splash occurs

97
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,439
um, maybe even a singularity.

98
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,579
Um, and so it's possible to do that

99
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,599
uh, and geometrically what's going on is that there's also light rays

100
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,859
um, so like if- if- if this wave represents light for example

101
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:13,559
um, you can imagine this wave as a superposition of photons

102
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,859
um, all traveling at the speed of light

103
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:18,919
they- they all travel on these light rays and they're all focusing at this one point.

104
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:27,799
So you can have a very dispersed wave focus into a very concentrated wave at one point in- in space and time but then it defocuses again and it's- it separates.

105
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:31,379
But potentially if the conjecture had a negative solution

106
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,599
so what I mean is that there's- there's a- a very efficient way to pack

107
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:37,399
um, tubes pointing in different directions into a very

108
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,039
very narrow region of- of- of, uh

109
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,639
very narrow volume.

110
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,999
Then you would also be able to create waves that start out

111
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:46,139
some- there'll be some arrangement of waves that start out very

112
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,439
very dispersed but they would concentrate not just at a single point but

113
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,779
um, um, there'll be a- a large

114
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,739
um, uh, there'll be a lot of concentrations in space and time

115
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:59,919
and, uh, um, and you could create what's called a blowup

116
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:07,519
where these waves, their amplitude becomes so great that the laws of physics that they're governed by are no longer wave equations but something more complicated and nonlinear.

117
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:13,788
Um-And so in mathematical physics, we care a lot about whether certain equations in- in- in wave equations are stable or not

118
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:16,348
uh, whether they can create, um, these singularities.

119
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:19,827
There's a famous, uh, unsolved problem called the Navier-Stokes regularity problem.

120
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:24,387
So the Navier-Stokes equations, the equations that govern the fluid flow of- of incompressible fluids

121
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:28,608
like water, the question asked, if you start with a smooth velocity field of water

122
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:31,307
can it ever concentrate so much that, like

123
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,027
the velocity become infinite at some point?

124
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:34,227
Uh, that's called a singularity.

125
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,887
We don't see that, um, in real life.

126
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:40,067
You know, if you splash around water on- on the bathtub

127
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:45,788
it won't explode on you, um, or- or have pa- have water leaving at the speed of light or anything

128
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,467
but potentially it is possible.

129
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:50,648
Um, and in fact, in recent years

130
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:54,088
the- the consensus has- has drifted towards the

131
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:59,088
uh, the- the belief that, uh, that in fact for certain very special con- initial con- uh

132
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:02,787
configurations of- of, say, water, that singularities can form.

133
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,747
But people have not yet been able to

134
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:06,207
uh, to actually establish this.

135
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:09,567
The Clay Foundation has these seven Millennium Prize problems

136
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,868
has a million dollar prize for solving one of these problems.

137
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:12,588
Uh, this is one of them.

138
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:14,767
Of these seven, only one of them has been solved

139
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,367
uh, uh, the Poincaré conjecture by Perelman.

140
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:23,427
So the Kakeya conjecture is not directly, directly related to the Navier-Stokes problem

141
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:29,068
but understanding it would help us understand some aspects of things like wave concentration

142
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:31,068
which would indirectly probably help us, uh

143
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:32,468
understand the Navier-Stokes problem better.

144
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:36,127
Can you speak to the Navier-Stokes, so the existence and smoothness

145
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:38,327
like you said, Millennial Prize problem?

146
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:38,767
Right.

147
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,348
You've made a lot of progress on this one.

148
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:46,627
In 2016, you published a paper, Finite Time Blow-Up For an Averaged Three-Dimensional Navier-Stokes Equation.

149
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:47,508
Right.

150
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:53,007
  So- so we're trying to figure out if this thing usually doesn't blow up- Right.

151
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:53,107
.

152
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:53,307
..

153
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,347
but can we say for sure it never blows up?

154
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:56,968
Right.

155
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:57,168
Yeah.

156
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:59,527
So yeah, that is literally the- the- the million dollar question.

157
00:07:59,527 --> 00:07:59,727
Yeah.

158
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:03,567
So, uh, this is what distinguishes mathematicians from pretty much everybody else.

159
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,257
Like, if- if- if something ho- holds 99.

160
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:09,147
99% of the time, um, that's good enough for most

161
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:11,667
you know, uh, for- for- for- for most things.

162
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:15,527
But mathematicians are one of the few people who really care about whether every

163
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,507
like, 100%, really 100% of all, um

164
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,387
situations are covered by- by, um.

165
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:20,467
..

166
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:20,787
Yeah.

167
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:23,127
So most fluids, most of the time

168
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,387
um, say water do- does not blow up

169
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:29,167
but could you design a s- very special initial state that does this?

170
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:35,386
And maybe we should say that this is a- this is a set of equations that govern in the field of fluid dynamics- Yes.

171
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:35,386
.

172
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:35,386
.

173
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:39,386
uh, trying to understand how a fluid behaves and it's actually turns out to be a really compli- you know

174
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,807
fluid is- Yeah.

175
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:40,827
.

176
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:40,866
..

177
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:43,067
extremely complicated thing to try to model.

178
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:43,267
Yeah.

179
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:44,587
So it has practical importance.

180
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:47,587
So this Clay Prize problem concerns what's called the incompressible Navier-Stokes

181
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:48,707
which governs things like water.

182
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:51,807
There's something called the compressible Navier-Stokes, which governs things like air.

183
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,267
And that's particularly important for weather prediction.

184
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,687
Weather prediction, it does a lot of computational fluid dynamics

185
00:08:56,687 --> 00:09:00,367
a lot of it is actually just trying to solve the Navier-Stokes equations as- as best they can.

186
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:05,887
Um, also gathering a lot of data so that they can get- they can ini- initialize the equation.

187
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,267
There's a lot of moving parts.

188
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:09,467
So it's very important problem practically.

189
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:15,547
Why is it difficult to prove general things about the set of equations

190
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:17,507
like it not- not blowing up?

191
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:19,247
Short answer is Maxwell's demon.

192
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:19,487
.

193
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:22,567
Uh, so Maxwell's demon is a concept in thermodynamics.

194
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,007
Like, if you have a box with two gases in

195
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:28,407
uh, oxygen and nitrogen, uh, and maybe you start with all the oxygen on one side and nitrogen on the other side

196
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:29,847
but there's no barrier between them, right?

197
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:33,107
Then they will mix, um, and they should stay mixed

198
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:33,327
right?

199
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:35,747
There's- there's- there's no reason why they should unmix.

200
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,667
But in principle, because of all the collisions between them

201
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,287
there could be some sort of weird conspiracy that- that

202
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:44,327
um, like maybe there's a microscopic demon called Maxwell's demon that will

203
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:44,811
um.

204
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:44,867
..

205
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,047
Every time a oxygen and nitrogen atom collide

206
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:50,987
they will bounce off in such a way that the oxygen sort of drifts onto one side and then nitrogen goes to the other

207
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:54,927
and, uh, you could have an extremely improbable configuration emerge

208
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,807
uh, which we never see.

209
00:09:56,807 --> 00:10:00,787
Um, and- and wh- which statistically it's extremely unlikely

210
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:05,627
but mathematically it's possible that this can happen and we can't rule it out.

211
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:09,847
Um, and this is a s- situation that shows up a lot in mathematics.

212
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:12,447
Um, a basic ex- example is the digits of pi

213
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:13,209
3.

214
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:14,507
14159 and so forth.

215
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:16,667
The digits look like they have no pattern

216
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,078
and we believe they have no pat-.

217
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:18,227
..

218
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:21,927
On the long term, you should see as many ones and twos and threes as fours and fives and sixes.

219
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:25,787
Uh, there- there should be no preference in the digits of pi to favor

220
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:27,187
let's say, seven over eight.

221
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:31,787
Um, but maybe there's some demon in the digits of pi that- that

222
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:33,347
like, every time you compute more and more digits

223
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:35,907
it sort of biases one digit to another.

224
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:39,967
Um, and this is a conspiracy that should not happen.

225
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,807
There's no reason it- it should happen, but

226
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,807
um, there's- there's- there's no way to prove it

227
00:10:43,807 --> 00:10:45,807
uh, with our current technology.

228
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:48,027
Okay, so getting back to Navier-Stokes.

229
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:49,747
Uh, fluid has a certain amount of energy

230
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:52,667
and because the fluid's in motion, the energy gets transported around.

231
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,947
And, uh, water is also viscous.

232
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:58,787
So if the energy is spread out over many different locations

233
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:03,207
the natural viscosity of the fluid will just damp out the energy and it will- it will- it will go to zero.

234
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,487
Um, and this is what happens, um

235
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:09,187
in, um, uh, when we actually experiment with water.

236
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:12,387
Like, it- you splash around, there's- there's some turbulence and- and waves and so forth

237
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:16,147
but eventually it- it settles down and- and- and the- the lower the amplitude

238
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:18,947
the- the smaller the velocity, the- the more calm it gets.

239
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:24,007
Um, but potentially, there is some sort of demon that keeps pushing the

240
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:26,867
uh, the energy of the fluid into a smaller and smaller scale.

241
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,527
And it'll move faster and faster.

242
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:31,627
And at faster speeds, the effect of viscosity is relatively less.

243
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:35,107
And so it could happen that- that it- it creates a s- some sort of

244
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:38,167
um, um, what's called a self-similar blob scenario

245
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:41,667
where, you know, um, the energy of the fluid sta- starts off at some

246
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,287
um, large scale, and then it all sort of

247
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,747
um, transfers its energy into a smaller

248
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,787
um, region of- of- of the fluid

249
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:50,627
which then, at a much faster rate

250
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,107
um, moves in- into, um, an even s- smaller

251
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:54,367
uh, region and so forth.

252
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,387
Um, and- and each time it does this

253
00:11:57,387 --> 00:12:00,447
uh, it takes maybe half as- as- as long as- as- as the previous one.

254
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:02,447
And then s- yeah, you could- you could- you could actually

255
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:04,847
uh, converge to- to all the energy

256
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:08,007
um, concentrating in one point in a f- a finite amount of time.

257
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:12,587
Um, and that- that- that's, uh, that scenario is called a finite time blow-up.

258
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:15,748
Um, so in practice, this doesn't happen.

259
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:18,055
Um, so water is what's called turbulent.

260
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:19,996
Um, so it is true that, um

261
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,535
if you have a big eddy of water

262
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:23,795
it will tend to break up into smaller eddies

263
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:27,456
but it won't transfer all the s- the energy from one big eddy into one small eddy.

264
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,815
It will transfer it into maybe three or four.

265
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:32,276
And then those might split up into maybe three or four small eddies of their own.

266
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:36,075
And so the energy gets dispersed till the point where the viscosity can

267
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:37,575
can then k- keep everything under control.

268
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:40,195
Um, but if it can somehow, um

269
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:44,495
concentrate, um, all the energy, keep it all together

270
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,255
um, and do it fast enough that

271
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:49,856
that the viscous effects, uh, don't have enough time to calm everything down

272
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:50,995
then this blowup can occur.

273
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,116
So there are papers who had claimed that

274
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:55,756
"Oh, you just need to take into account conservation of energy and

275
00:12:55,756 --> 00:13:00,895
and just carefully use the viscosity and you can keep everything under control for not just the Navier-Stokes

276
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:02,595
but for many, many types of equations like this.

277
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:07,615
" And so like in the past, there had been many attempts to try to obtain what's called global regularity for Navier-Stokes

278
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:09,575
which is the opposite of final time blowup

279
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:12,755
that velocity stays smooth, and it all failed.

280
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:15,135
There was always some sign error or some subtle mistake and

281
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,495
and it, it couldn't be salvaged.

282
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:24,315
Um, so what I was interested in doing was trying to explain why we were not able to disprove

283
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:25,495
um, final time blowup.

284
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:27,755
I couldn't do it for the actual equations of fluids

285
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:28,655
which were too complicated.

286
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:31,975
But if I could average the equations of motion of Navier-Stokes

287
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:35,675
so physically if, if, um, if I could turn off certain types of

288
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:38,815
of ways in which water interacts and, and only keep the ones that I want.

289
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:41,955
Um, so in particular, um, if

290
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:48,515
um, if it's a fluid and it could transfer its energy from a large eddy into this small eddy or this other small eddy

291
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:52,495
I would turn off the energy channel that would transfer energy to this

292
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,755
this one, and, and direct it only into

293
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:58,715
um, this smaller eddy while still preserving the law of conservation of energy.

294
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:00,195
So you're trying to make it blow up?

295
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:00,455
Yeah.

296
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:02,795
Yeah, so I, I, I basically engineer

297
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:05,735
um, a blowup by changing the laws of physics

298
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:07,295
which is one thing that mathematicians are allowed to do.

299
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:08,215
We can change the equation.

300
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,795
How does that help you get closer to the proof of something?

301
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:11,075
Right.

302
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:13,955
So it provides what's called an ob- obstruction in mathematics.

303
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:16,335
Um, so, so what I did was that

304
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:18,455
uh, basically if I turned off the

305
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:20,246
um, certain parts of the equation so that.

306
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:20,315
..

307
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:24,335
Which usually when you turn off certain interactions make it less nonlinear

308
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:26,535
it makes it more regular and less likely to blow up.

309
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:30,695
But I found that by turning off a very well designed set of

310
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,755
of, of, of, of, of interactions

311
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,795
I could force all the energy to blow up

312
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:36,015
uh, in finite time.

313
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:39,515
So what that means is that if you wanted to prove

314
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:43,715
um, global regularity for Navier-Stokes, um, for the actual equation

315
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:48,295
you had, uh, you must use some feature of the true equation

316
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:51,675
which, which my artificial equation, um, does not satisfy.

317
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:54,175
So it, it rules out certain, um

318
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:55,035
certain approaches.

319
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:57,592
So, um, it's.

320
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:57,655
..

321
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,615
The thing about math is, is, is it's not just about finding

322
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:02,175
uh, you know, taking a technique that is gonna work and applying it

323
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:05,235
but you, you need to not take the techniques that don't work.

324
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:08,475
Um, and for the problems that are really hard

325
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:13,435
often there are dozens of ways that m- y- you might think might apply to solve the problem

326
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:18,075
but, uh, it's only after a lot of experience that you realize there's no way that these methods are going to work.

327
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:21,535
So having these counterexamples for nearby problems, um

328
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:23,791
kind of rules out, um, uh.

329
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:23,855
..

330
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,915
It, it saves you a lot of time because you

331
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:28,455
you, you're not wasting, um, energy on

332
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:30,635
on things that you now know cannot possibly ever work.

333
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:34,835
How deeply connected is it to that specific problem of fluid dynamics

334
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:38,235
or is this a more general intuition you built up about mathematics?

335
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:38,755
Right.

336
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:40,795
Yeah, so the key phenomenon that, uh

337
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:44,155
was, uh, my, my technique exploits is what's called supercriticality.

338
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:49,235
So in partial differential equations, often these equations are like a tug of war between different forces.

339
00:15:49,235 --> 00:15:52,455
So in Navier-Stokes there's the dissipation, um

340
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:55,415
force coming from viscosity, it, and it's very well understood.

341
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:57,295
It's linear, it calms things down.

342
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:59,435
If, if viscosity was all there was

343
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:01,275
then, then nothing bad would ever happen.

344
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:04,295
Um, but there's also transport, um, that

345
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:09,195
that energy from, in one location of space can get transported because the fluid's in motion to

346
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:10,015
to other locations.

347
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:13,735
Um, and that's a nonlinear effect, and that causes all the

348
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:14,375
all the problems.

349
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:18,355
Um, so there are these two competing terms in the Navier-Stokes equation

350
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:20,135
uh, the dissipation term and the transport term.

351
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,335
If the dissipation term dominates, if it's

352
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:24,795
if it's large, then basically you get regularity.

353
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:27,555
And if, um, if the transport term dominates

354
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,915
then, uh, then we don't know what's going on.

355
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:30,975
It's a very nonlinear situation.

356
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,675
It's unpredictable.

357
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:32,615
It's turbulent.

358
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:36,035
So sometimes these forces are in balance at small scales

359
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:37,995
but not in balance at large scales or

360
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:38,775
or vice versa.

361
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:41,455
Um, so Navier-Stokes is what's called supercritical.

362
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:46,435
So at, at smaller and smaller scales the transport terms are much stronger than the viscosity terms.

363
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:48,995
So the viscosity terms are the things that calm things down

364
00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:52,215
um, and so this is, um, um

365
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:53,615
this is why the problem is hard.

366
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:56,915
In two dimensions, so the Soviet mathematician

367
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,255
uh, Ledochinskaya, she in the '60s showed that in two dimensions

368
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:01,035
there was no blowup.

369
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:04,355
And in two dimensions, the, the Navier-Stokes equations is what's called critical.

370
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:08,335
The effect of transport and the effect of viscosity are about the same strength even at very

371
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,135
very small scales.

372
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:13,555
And we have a lot of technology to handle critical and also subcritical equations and prove

373
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:14,395
um, regularity.

374
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:17,575
But for supercritical equations, it was not clear what was going on.

375
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:27,234
And I did a lot of work and then there's been a lot of follow-up showing that for many other types of supercritical equations you can create all kinds of blowup examples.

376
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:30,795
Once the nonlinear effects dominate the linear effects at small scales

377
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:32,335
you can have all kinds of bad things happen.

378
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:35,595
So this is sort of one of the main insights of this

379
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:39,255
this line of work is that supercriticality versus criticality and subcriticality

380
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:40,915
this, this makes a big difference.

381
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:46,695
I mean, the, that's a key qualitative feature that distinguishes some equations from being sort of nice and predictable and

382
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:48,355
and, you know, like, like planetary motion.

383
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:50,355
And I mean, there, there's certain equations that

384
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:52,775
that you can predict for millions of years and

385
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,135
uh, or, or thousands at least.

386
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:54,995
Again, it's not really a problem.

387
00:17:54,995 --> 00:18:01,415
But, but there's a reason why we can't predict the weather past two weeks into the future because it's a supercritical equation.

388
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,535
Lots of really strange things are going on at

389
00:18:03,535 --> 00:18:04,495
at very fine scales.

390
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:09,835
So whenever there is some huge source of nonlinearity- Yeah.

391
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:09,848
.

392
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:09,875
..

393
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,235
that can create a huge problem for predicting what's gonna happen?

394
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:13,635
Yeah.

395
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:17,095
And if the nonlinearity is somehow more and more featured and interesting at

396
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,171
at small scales.

397
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:20,787
Um, I mean there's- there's many equations that are nonlinear

398
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:24,107
but, um, in ma- in- in many equations you can approximate things by the bulk.

399
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:26,988
Um, so for example, planetary motion, you know

400
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:29,968
if you wanted to u- understand the orbit of the moon or Mars or something

401
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:32,588
you don't really need the microstructure of, uh

402
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:36,508
like the seismology of the moon or- or like exactly how the mass is distributed

403
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:37,902
um, you just.

404
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:37,988
..

405
00:18:37,988 --> 00:18:40,547
basically, you- you can almost approximate these planets by point masses.

406
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:41,407
Uh, and you.

407
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:41,447
..

408
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:43,607
it's just the aggregate behavior is important.

409
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:46,067
Um, but if you want to model a fluid

410
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,767
um, like- like the weather, you can't just say

411
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,467
"In Los Angeles, the temperature is this

412
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,334
the wind speed is this.

413
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:54,647
" For supercritical equations, the finest scale information is- is really important.

414
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:56,567
If we can just linger on the Navier-Stokes

415
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:57,827
uh, equations a little bit.

416
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:59,851
So you suggested.

417
00:18:59,851 --> 00:18:59,988
..

418
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:03,108
maybe you can describe it, that one of the ways to

419
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:07,767
uh, solve it, or to negatively resolve it

420
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:08,647
would be to.

421
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:08,888
..

422
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:13,367
sort of to construct a liquid, a kind of liquid computer- Right.

423
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:13,407
.

424
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:13,488
..

425
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:16,587
and then show that the halting problem from computation theory has

426
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:19,787
uh, consequences for fluid dynamics, so, uh- Right.

427
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:19,787
.

428
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:19,787
.

429
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:20,827
show it in that way.

430
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,687
Can you describe this- this idea?

431
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:22,827
Right.

432
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:27,367
Yeah, so this came out of- of this work of constructing th- this- this av- this average equation that- that blew up.

433
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,823
Um, so one, um.

434
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:29,927
..

435
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:32,249
as- as part of how I had to- to do this.

436
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:32,347
..

437
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:33,947
so there's sort of this naive way to do it

438
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:36,007
you j- you- you just keep tr- pushing

439
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,063
um, um.

440
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:37,087
..

441
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,867
every time you- you get energy at one scale

442
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:41,787
you- you push it immediately to the next scale as- as fast as possible.

443
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:44,987
This is sort of the naive way to- to- to- to force blow up

444
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:47,567
um, which is like in five and higher dimensions this works.

445
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:51,247
Um, but in three dimensions there was this funny phenomenon that I discovered

446
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,218
that if you- if you keep.

447
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:53,367
..

448
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:55,907
if- if you change the laws of physics

449
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:58,007
you just always keep trying to push, um

450
00:19:58,007 --> 00:20:00,407
the energy into smaller and smaller scales, um

451
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:04,847
what happens is that the energy s- starts getting spread out into multi- ma- many scales at once

452
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:07,427
um, so that you have- you have energy at one scale

453
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,427
you're pushing it i- into the next scale

454
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:11,987
and then, um, as soon as it enters that scale

455
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:13,207
you also push it to the next scale

456
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:15,607
but there's still some energy left over from the previous scale

457
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:17,427
um, you're trying to do everything at once

458
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:20,227
um, and this spreads out the energy too much

459
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,447
um, and then it turns out that- that

460
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:26,747
um, it makes it vulnerable for viscosity to come in and actually just damp out everything.

461
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:31,087
So, um, so it turns out this- this direct approach doesn't- doesn't actually work.

462
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:33,427
There was a separate paper by some other authors that actually showed this

463
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:35,267
um, in three dimensions.

464
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,987
Um, so what I needed was to program a delay

465
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,287
um, so kind of like airlocks, uh

466
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:47,127
so, um, I- I needed an equation which would start with a- a fluid doing something at one scale

467
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:49,187
it would push as energy into the next scale

468
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:54,727
but it would s- stay there until all the energy from the- from the larger scale got transferred

469
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:57,387
and only after you pushed all the energy in

470
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:58,827
then you sort of opened the next gate

471
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:01,127
uh, and- and then you- you push that in as well.

472
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,047
So, um, by doing that it kind of.

473
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:03,167
..

474
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,407
the energy inches forward scale by scale in such a way that it's always

475
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:08,107
um, localized at one scale at a time

476
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:11,767
um, and then it can resist the effects of viscosity because it's- it's not dispersed.

477
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:15,187
Um, so in order to make that happen

478
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:19,147
um, yeah, I had to construct a rather complicated non-linearity

479
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:22,047
um, and it was basically like, um

480
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,324
you know, like.

481
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:23,387
..

482
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:25,207
it was constructed like an e- electronic circuit

483
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:28,827
so I- I actually thank my wife for this because she was trained as a electrical engineer

484
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:31,967
um, and, um, you know, she- she talked about

485
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,079
um, uh.

486
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:33,127
..

487
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:35,067
you know, she had to design circuits and so forth

488
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:37,207
and, you know, if you- if you want a circuit that does a certain thing

489
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:41,327
like maybe have a light that- that flashes on and then turns off and then on and then off

490
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:43,767
you can build it from s- from more primitive components

491
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,667
you know, capacitors and resistors and so forth

492
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,347
and you have to board a diagram, and you

493
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:48,759
um.

494
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:48,847
..

495
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:52,127
and these diagrams, you can- you can sort of follow with your eyeballs and say

496
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:55,500
"Oh yeah, the- the- the current will- will board up here and then it will stop and then it will do that.

497
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,347
" So I knew how to build the analog of basic electronic components

498
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:01,327
you know, like resistors and capacitors and so forth

499
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:03,247
and- and I would- I would stack them together

500
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:08,652
um, in su- in such a way that- that I would create something that would open one gate and then there'd be a clock that would.

501
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:08,727
..

502
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,167
and then once the clock hits a certain threshold

503
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:10,727
it would close it.

504
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:13,067
Uh, become a Rube Goldberg type machine

505
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,087
but described mathematically, and this ended up working.

506
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:20,127
So what I realized is that if you could pull the same thing off for the actual equations

507
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:24,067
so if the equations of water support a computation

508
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:24,619
so, um.

509
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:24,747
..

510
00:22:24,747 --> 00:22:26,827
like if you can imagine kind of a steampunk

511
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:29,187
but it's really water punk, uh, type of thing where

512
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:30,372
um, you know.

513
00:22:30,372 --> 00:22:30,407
..

514
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:32,427
so modern computers are electronic, you know

515
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:39,487
they- they- they're powered by- by electrons p- passing through very tiny wires and interacting with oth- other electrons and- and so forth

516
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:45,107
but instead of electrons, you- you can imagine these pulses of- of water moving at a certain velocity

517
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:46,304
and maybe it's.

518
00:22:46,304 --> 00:22:46,407
..

519
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,667
they're two different configurations corresponding to a bit being up or down.

520
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:53,607
Probably that if you had two of these moving bodies of water collide

521
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:57,095
uh, they would come out with some new configuration which is.

522
00:22:57,095 --> 00:22:57,207
..

523
00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:59,387
which would be something like an AND gate or OR gate

524
00:22:59,387 --> 00:22:59,927
you know, that.

525
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:00,007
..

526
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:00,439
uh, it- it.

527
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:00,607
..

528
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:04,207
the- the output would depend in a very predictable way on- on the inputs.

529
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:07,987
And, like, you could chain these together and maybe create a Turing machine

530
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,667
and- and then you could.

531
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:09,747
..

532
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:12,287
you have computers, uh, which are made completely out of water

533
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:15,387
um, and if you have computers, then maybe you can do robotics

534
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:16,867
uh, you know, so.

535
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:16,867
..

536
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,167
you know, hydraulics and so forth.

537
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:25,967
Um, and so you could create some machine which is basically a- a fluid analog of what's called a Von Neumann machine.

538
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:29,367
Uh, so Von Neumann proposed if you want to colonize Mars

539
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:33,227
the sheer cost of transporting people and machines to Mars is just ridiculous

540
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:38,427
but if you could transport one machine to Mars and this machine had the ability to mine the planet

541
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:43,827
create some more materials, smelt them, and build more copies of the same machine

542
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:46,787
um, then you could colonize a whole planet

543
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:48,007
um, over time.

544
00:23:48,007 --> 00:23:53,147
Um, so, uh, if you could build a fluid machine which

545
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:53,399
uh.

546
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:53,527
..

547
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:56,427
yeah, so it's- it's- it's a- it's a robo- it's a fluid robot

548
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:57,927
okay, and what it would do.

549
00:23:57,927 --> 00:23:58,047
..

550
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:03,787
its- its purpose in life, it's programmed so that it would create a smaller version of itself in some sort of cold state

551
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:05,107
it- it wouldn't start just yet.

552
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:11,087
Once it's ready, the big robot configured with water would transfer a- all its energy into the s- the smaller configuration and then power down

553
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,324
okay, and then, like- like.

554
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:12,427
..

555
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:17,707
it cleaned itself up, and then what's left is this newest state which would then turn on and do the same thing

556
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,049
but smaller and faster.

557
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:19,250
..

558
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,391
. and then the equation has a certain scaling symmetry.

559
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:22,951
O- once you do that, it can just keep iterating.

560
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:26,232
So this, in principle, would create a blow up

561
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:30,212
uh, for the actual Navier-Stokes, and this is what I managed to accomplish for this average Navier-Stokes.

562
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:33,291
So it provided this sort of roadmap to solve the problem.

563
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:37,152
Now, this is, uh, a, a pipe dream because

564
00:24:37,152 --> 00:24:40,531
uh, there are so many things that are missing for this to actually be a reality.

565
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:44,771
Um, so, um, I, I, I can't create these ba- basic logic gates.

566
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:46,631
Um, I, I don't, I don't have these

567
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:48,672
these special configurations of water.

568
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:49,891
Um, I mean, there's candidates.

569
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:52,491
There's things called vortex rings that might possibly work

570
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,671
but, um, um, but also, you know

571
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:59,971
analog computing is really nasty, um, com- compared to digital computing.

572
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:01,172
I mean, 'cause there's always errors.

573
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:05,071
Um, you'll, you have to, you have to do a lot of error correction along the way.

574
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:09,012
I don't know how to completely power down the big machine so that it doesn't interfere with the

575
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:10,072
the running of the smaller machine.

576
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:12,871
But everything in principle can happen.

577
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:14,852
Like, it doesn't contradict any of the laws of physics.

578
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:18,851
Um, so it's sort of evidence that this thing is possible.

579
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:27,291
Um, there are other groups who are now pursuing ways to make Navier-Stokes blow up which are nowhere near as ridiculously complicated as this.

580
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,971
Um, um, they, they actually are

581
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:33,311
are pursuing much closer to the, the direct self-similar model

582
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:36,071
which can, uh, it, it doesn't quite work as is

583
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:40,252
but there could be some simpler scheme than what I just described to make this work.

584
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:46,671
There is a real leap of genius here to go from Navier-Stokes to this Turing machine.

585
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:53,512
So it goes from what, the self-similar blob scenario that you're trying to get the smaller and smaller blob- Mm-hmm.

586
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:53,578
.

587
00:25:53,578 --> 00:25:53,712
..

588
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:57,872
to now having a liquid Turing machine get smaller- Right.

589
00:25:57,872 --> 00:25:57,885
.

590
00:25:57,885 --> 00:25:57,911
..

591
00:25:57,911 --> 00:26:06,532
and smaller and smaller, and somehow seeing how that could be used to say something about a blow up.

592
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,371
I mean, that's a big leap.

593
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:09,471
So there's precedent.

594
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:12,832
I mean, um, so the, the thing about mathematics is that it's

595
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:16,471
it's really good at, um, spotting connections between what you think of

596
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:17,791
what you might think of as completely different

597
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,571
um, problems.

598
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:21,991
Um, but if, if the mathematical form is the same

599
00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:24,071
you, you, you can, you can draw a connection.

600
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:29,111
Um, so, um, there was a lot of work previously on what are called c- cellular automata.

601
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:29,471
Mm-hmm.

602
00:26:29,471 --> 00:26:32,011
Um, the most famous of which is Conway's Game of Life.

603
00:26:32,011 --> 00:26:34,931
There's this infinite discrete grid, and any given time

604
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:36,911
the grid is either occupied by a cell or it's empty.

605
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:39,411
And there's a very simple rule that, uh

606
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:40,611
that tells you how these cells evolve.

607
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:42,151
So s- sometimes cells live, and sometimes they

608
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:42,631
they die.

609
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:44,631
Um, and there's a, um, you know

610
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:46,591
um, when I was a, a student

611
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:49,191
uh, it was a very popular screen saver to actually just have these

612
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,951
these animations l- like going, and, and they look very chaotic.

613
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:54,211
In, in fact they look a little bit like turbulent flow sometimes.

614
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:58,511
But at some point people discovered more and more interesting structures within this game of life.

615
00:26:58,511 --> 00:27:00,671
Um, so for example they discovered this thing called a glider.

616
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:03,731
So a glider is a very tiny configuration of like four or five cells

617
00:27:03,731 --> 00:27:06,091
which evolves, and it just moves at a certain direction.

618
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,171
And that's like this, this vortex rings

619
00:27:08,171 --> 00:27:08,951
this analog.

620
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:11,031
Um, yeah, so this is an a- analogy

621
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:14,211
the game of life is kind of like a discrete equation and

622
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:17,371
and, um, the fluid, Navier-Stokes is a continuous equation

623
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:19,771
but mathematically they have some similar features.

624
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:27,811
Um, and, um, so over time people discovered more and more interesting things that you could build within the game of life.

625
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,111
The game of life is a very simple system

626
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:30,311
it only has like three or four rules

627
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:31,611
um, to, to do with it.

628
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:34,571
But, but you can design all kinds of interesting configurations inside it.

629
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:38,591
Um, there's something ca- called a glider gun that does nothing else but spit out gliders one at a t- one

630
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:39,251
one at a time.

631
00:27:39,251 --> 00:27:45,431
Um, and then after a lot of effort people managed to create

632
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,471
um, AND gates and OR gates for gliders.

633
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:51,471
Like there's this massive ridiculous structure which if you

634
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:53,851
if a, if a, if you have a stream of gliders

635
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:55,931
um, coming in here, and a stream of gliders coming in here

636
00:27:55,931 --> 00:28:00,671
then you may produce extreme gliders coming out if m- s- may- maybe if both of

637
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:03,531
of the, um, streams, um, have gliders

638
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:05,531
then there'll be an- an ou- output stream.

639
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:07,451
But if only one of them does, then nothing comes out.

640
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:08,011
Mm-hmm.

641
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:09,311
So they could build something like that.

642
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:13,291
And once you could build an, um

643
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:18,511
these basic gates, then just from software engineering you can build almost anything.

644
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:20,451
Um, uh, you can build a Turing machine.

645
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:23,391
I mean, the, it's, it's like an enormous steampunk type thing

646
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:29,031
it's, they look ridiculous, but then people also generated self-replicating objects in the game of life

647
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:33,051
a massive machine, a Bonomo machine, which over a lo- huge period of time and

648
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:36,791
and it always looked like glider guns inside doing these very steampunk calculations.

649
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:42,131
It would create another version of itself which could replicate- That's so incredible.

650
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:44,031
A lot of this was like community crowdsourced by

651
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:45,891
uh, like amateur mathematicians actually.

652
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,231
Um, so I knew about that, that

653
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:53,371
that work, and so th- that is part of what inspired me to propose the same thing for Navier-Stokes.

654
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:56,191
Um, that really just, a much, as I said

655
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:57,631
analog is much worse than digital.

656
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:59,631
Like, uh, it's gonna be, um

657
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:03,691
you can't just directly take the constructions in the game of life and plunk them in

658
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:05,711
but again, it just, it shows it's possible.

659
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:13,291
You know, there's a kind of emergence that happens with these cellular automata local rules.

660
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:13,551
Mm-hmm.

661
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,031
Maybe it's similar to fluids, I don't know

662
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:24,671
but local rules operating at scale can create these incredibly complex dynamic structures.

663
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:29,191
Do you think any of that is amenable to mathematical analysis?

664
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:33,671
Do we have the tools to say something profound about that?

665
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,651
The thing is you can get this emergent very complicated structures

666
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:39,411
but only with very carefully prepared initial conditions

667
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:39,571
yeah.

668
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:42,131
So, so these, these, these glider guns

669
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:44,251
and, and gates, and, and software machines

670
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:47,251
if you just plunk down randomly some cells and you run the game of life

671
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:48,391
you will not see any of these.

672
00:29:48,391 --> 00:29:52,611
Um, and th- that's the analogous situation with Navier-Stokes again

673
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:58,011
you know, that, that with, with typical initial conditions you will n- you will not have any of this weird computation going on.

674
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:01,411
Um, but basically through engineering, you know

675
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:07,311
by, by, by s- specially designing things in a very special way you can make clever constructions.

676
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:15,071
I wonder if it's possible to prove the sort of the negative of like basically prove that only through engineering can you ever create- Yeah.

677
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:15,251
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

678
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:15,251
.

679
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:15,251
.

680
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:16,351
something interesting.

681
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:18,971
This, this is a recurring challenge in mathematics that

682
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:19,588
um-.

683
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:19,867
..

684
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:22,008
I call it the dichotomy between structure and randomness

685
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:25,427
that most objects that you can generate in mathematics are random.

686
00:30:25,427 --> 00:30:26,260
Uh, they look like rad.

687
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:26,327
..

688
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:29,188
Like, the digits of pi, well, we believe is a good example.

689
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:32,487
Um, but there's a very small number of things that have patterns.

690
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:36,787
Um, but, um, now, you can prove something has a pattern by just constructing

691
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:36,927
you know.

692
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:39,087
Like if, if something has a simple pattern and you have a proof that it

693
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,587
it does something like repeat itself every so often

694
00:30:41,587 --> 00:30:42,487
you can do that.

695
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:43,507
But, um.

696
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:43,667
..

697
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,735
And you c- you can prove that, that.

698
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:45,827
..

699
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:48,087
For example, you can, you can prove that most sequences of

700
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,187
of digits have no pattern.

701
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:51,628
Um, so like if, if you just pick digits randomly

702
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:54,767
there's something called the law of large numbers that tells you that you're going to get as many ones as

703
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,447
as twos, uh, in the long run.

704
00:30:56,447 --> 00:31:01,127
Um, but, um, we have a lot fewer tools to

705
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:01,563
to, to.

706
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:01,667
..

707
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,648
If I give you a specific pattern like the digits of pi

708
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:06,927
how can I show that this doesn't have some weird pattern to it?

709
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:14,607
Some other work that I spend a lot of time on is to prove what are called structure theorems or inverse theorems that give tests for when something is

710
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:15,407
is very structured.

711
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:20,587
So some functions are what's called additive, like if you have a function that maps the natural numbers to the natural numbers

712
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,287
so maybe, um, you know, two maps to four

713
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:24,707
three maps to six and so forth.

714
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:26,987
Um, some functions are what's, what's called additive

715
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:27,847
which means that if you add.

716
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:27,967
..

717
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,227
if you add two inputs together, the output gets

718
00:31:30,227 --> 00:31:31,087
gets added as well.

719
00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:33,147
Uh, for example, uh, multiplying by a constant.

720
00:31:33,147 --> 00:31:35,087
If you multiply a number by 10, um

721
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:38,027
if you, i- i- if you multiply A plus B by 10

722
00:31:38,027 --> 00:31:40,647
that's the same as multiplying A by 10 and B by 10 and then adding them together

723
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:43,407
so some, um, functions are additive.

724
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:46,987
Some functions are kind of additive but not completely additive.

725
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:50,247
Um, so for example, if I take a number N

726
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:54,047
I multiply by the square root of two and I take the integer part of that

727
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:56,967
so 10 by the square root of two is like 14 point something

728
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,127
so 10 will map to 14.

729
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:00,287
Um, 20 will map to 28.

730
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:03,987
Um, so in that case, a- additivity is true then

731
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:06,167
so 10 plus 10 is 20 and 14 plus 14 is 28

732
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:09,687
but because of this rounding, uh, sometimes there's round off errors and

733
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:12,027
and sometimes when you, um, add A plus B

734
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:14,027
this function doesn't quite give you the sum of

735
00:32:14,027 --> 00:32:16,627
of the two individual outputs, but the sum plus minus one.

736
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:19,847
Um, so it's almost additive, but not quite additive.

737
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:24,287
Um, so there's a lot of useful results in mathematics

738
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:25,947
and I've worked a lot on developing things like this

739
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:29,027
to the effect that if, if a function exhibits some structure like this

740
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:34,727
then, um, it's basically th- there's a reason for why it's true and the reason is because there's

741
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:36,907
there's some other nearby function which is actually

742
00:32:36,907 --> 00:32:42,527
um, compl- completely structured, which is explaining this sort of partial pattern that you have.

743
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,627
Um, and so if you have these sort of inverse theorems

744
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:47,847
it, um, it creates this sort of dichotomy that

745
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:54,687
that either the objects that you study are either have no structure at all or they are somehow related to something that is structured.

746
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:57,287
Um, and in either way, in either

747
00:32:57,287 --> 00:32:59,647
um, uh, in either case, you can make progress.

748
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:05,167
Um, a good example of this is that there's this old theorem in mathematics called Szemerédi's theorem

749
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,587
uh, proven in the 1970s.

750
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:10,147
It concerns trying to find a certain type of pattern in a set of numbers and the

751
00:33:10,147 --> 00:33:12,307
the pattern is arithmetic progression, things like 3

752
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:14,027
5, and 7, or, or, or 10

753
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:15,067
15, and 20.

754
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:18,347
And Szemerédi, Endre Szemerédi proved that, um

755
00:33:18,347 --> 00:33:21,027
any set of, of numbers that's sufficiently big

756
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:22,987
um, what's called, what's called positive density

757
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:26,307
has, um, arithmetic progressions in it of

758
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:27,207
of any length you wish.

759
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:31,227
Um, so for example, um, the odd numbers have a set of density one half

760
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:34,187
um, and they contain arithmetic progressions of any length.

761
00:33:34,187 --> 00:33:36,227
Um, so in that case, it's obvious because the

762
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:38,227
the od- the odd numbers are really, really structured.

763
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,347
I can just take, uh, uh, 11

764
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:41,227
13, 15, 17.

765
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:41,578
I can just.

766
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:41,647
..

767
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,827
I can, I can easily find arithmetic progressions in

768
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:44,687
in, in that set.

769
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:48,847
Um, but, um, Szemerédi's theorem also applies to random sets.

770
00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:51,827
If, if I take the set of all numbers and I flip a coin

771
00:33:51,827 --> 00:33:53,847
um, and I, uh, for each number

772
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:56,167
and I only keep th- the numbers which

773
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,767
for which I got a heads, okay

774
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:58,627
so I just flip coins.

775
00:33:58,627 --> 00:34:00,387
I just randomly take out half the numbers

776
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:02,427
I keep one half, so that's a set that has no

777
00:34:02,427 --> 00:34:06,187
no patterns at all, but just from random fluctuations

778
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:07,767
you will still get a lot of, um

779
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:10,827
um, of arithmetic pro- progressions in that set.

780
00:34:10,827 --> 00:34:18,387
Can you prove that there's arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length within a random- Yes.

781
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:20,067
Um, have you heard of the infinite monkey theorem?

782
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:23,327
Usually methodicians give boring names to theorems, but occasionally- Yeah.

783
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:23,353
.

784
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:23,407
..

785
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:24,306
they, they give colorful names.

786
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:24,627
Yes.

787
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:30,726
The popular version of the infinite monkey theorem is that if you have an infinite number of monkeys in a room with each a typewriter

788
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:32,806
they type out, uh, text randomly.

789
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:38,147
Almost surely one of them is going to generate the entire screw of Hamlet or any other finite string of text.

790
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:39,607
Uh, it will just take some time

791
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:40,987
uh, quite a lot of time actually.

792
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:42,907
But if you have an infinite number, then it happens.

793
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:49,027
Um, so, um, basically the theorem says that if you take an infinite string of

794
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:53,647
of digits or whatever, um, eventually any finite pattern you wish will emerge.

795
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,407
Uh, it may take a long time

796
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:57,007
but it will eventually happen.

797
00:34:57,007 --> 00:35:00,387
Um, in particular, arithmetic progressions of any length will eventually happen.

798
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:04,427
Okay, but you need, uh, but you need an extremely long random sequence for this to happen.

799
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:08,227
I suppose that's intuitive, it's just infinity.

800
00:35:08,227 --> 00:35:10,727
Yeah, infinity absorbs a lot of sins.

801
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:11,647
Yeah.

802
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:14,607
How are we humans supposed to deal with infinity?

803
00:35:14,607 --> 00:35:16,767
Well, you can think of infinity as

804
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:20,407
as, as an abstraction of, um, a finite number for which you

805
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:21,587
you do not have a bound full.

806
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:24,707
Um, that, uh, you know, I mean

807
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,687
so nothing in real life is truly infinite.

808
00:35:26,687 --> 00:35:28,507
Um, but, you know, you can

809
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:31,987
um, you know, you can ask these old questions like

810
00:35:31,987 --> 00:35:33,547
what if I had as much money as I wanted

811
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:35,607
you know, or what if I could go as fast as I wanted?

812
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:44,087
And a way in which mathematicians formalize that is mathematics has found a formulism to idealize instead of something being extremely large or extremely small

813
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:45,967
to actually be exactly infinite or zero.

814
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:48,587
Um, and often the, the mathematics becomes a

815
00:35:48,587 --> 00:35:50,287
a lot cleaner when you do that.

816
00:35:50,287 --> 00:35:52,707
I mean, in physics we, we joke about

817
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:54,387
uh, assuming spherical cows.

818
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:58,187
Um, you know, like, real world problems have got all kinds of real world effects

819
00:35:58,187 --> 00:36:00,967
but you can idealize, send some things to infinity

820
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:02,227
send some things to zero.

821
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:06,587
Um, and, um, and the mathematics becomes a lot simpler to work with there.

822
00:36:06,587 --> 00:36:13,127
I wonder how often using infinity, uh

823
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:16,667
forces us to deviate from, um, the physics of reality.

824
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,347
Yeah.

825
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:19,007
So there's, there's a lot of pitfalls.

826
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:23,447
Um, so, you know, we, we spend a lot of time in undergraduate math classes teaching analysis

827
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,647
um, and analysis.

828
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:26,647
It's often about how to take limits and

829
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:27,940
and, and whether you.

830
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,067
..

831
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:31,251
You know, so for example, A plus B is always B plus A-Um

832
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:33,451
so when, when you have a finite number of terms and you add them

833
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:34,991
you can swap them and there's, there's no problem.

834
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:37,392
But when you have an infinite number of terms

835
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:44,091
there are these sort of show games you can play where you can have a series which converges to one value but you rearrange it and it suddenly converges to another value.

836
00:36:44,091 --> 00:36:46,411
And so you can make mistakes.

837
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:48,831
You have to know what you're doing when you allow infinity.

838
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,592
Um, you have to introduce these epsilons and deltas and

839
00:36:51,592 --> 00:36:56,152
and, and there's, there's a certain type of way of reasoning that helps you avoid mistakes.

840
00:36:56,152 --> 00:37:03,312
Um, in more recent years, um, people have started taking results that are true in

841
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:06,611
in infinite limits and try what's cal- and what's called finitizing them

842
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:09,552
um, so you know that something is true eventually but

843
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:11,691
um, you don't know when, now give me a rate.

844
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:14,891
Okay, so such that if I don't have an infinite number of monkeys but

845
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:18,851
but a large finite number of monkeys, how long do you have to wait for Hamlet to come out?

846
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:22,312
Um, and, uh, that's a more qua- quantitative question.

847
00:37:22,312 --> 00:37:24,311
Um, and this is something that you can

848
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:28,771
you can, um, attack by purely finite methods and you can use your finite intuition.

849
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:33,691
Um, and i- in this case it turns out to be exponential in the length of the text that you're

850
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:34,671
you're trying to generate.

851
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:35,439
Um, so if.

852
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:35,511
..

853
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:39,071
um, and so this is why you never see the monkeys create Hamlet.

854
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:40,791
You can maybe see them create a four-letter word

855
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,031
but nothing that big.

856
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:46,651
And so I personally find once you finitize an infinite statement it's

857
00:37:46,651 --> 00:37:50,051
it does become much more intuitive a- and it's no longer so

858
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:50,991
so weird.

859
00:37:50,991 --> 00:37:51,447
Um.

860
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:51,551
..

861
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:57,391
So even if you're working with infinity it's good to finitize so that you can have some intuition?

862
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:57,891
Yeah.

863
00:37:57,891 --> 00:37:59,891
The downside is that the finitized proofs are just much

864
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:00,631
much messier.

865
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:00,831
Yeah.

866
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:02,351
And, and, uh, yeah, so the

867
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:04,291
so the infinite ones are found first usually

868
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:07,551
like decades earlier, uh, and then later on people finitized them.

869
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,611
So since we mentioned a lot of the math and a lot of physics- Mm-hmm.

870
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:10,617
.

871
00:38:10,617 --> 00:38:10,631
..

872
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:14,391
uh, what to you is the difference between mathematics and physics as disciplines

873
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:17,391
as ways of understanding, of seeing the world?

874
00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:19,551
Maybe we can throw in engineering in there

875
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:22,851
you mentioned your wife is an engineer, give a new perspective on circuits.

876
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:23,271
Right.

877
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:27,191
So there's a different way of looking at the world given that you've done mathematical physics

878
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:29,491
so you, you've, you've worn all the hats.

879
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,371
Right.

880
00:38:30,371 --> 00:38:33,631
So I think science in general is an interaction between three things.

881
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:38,491
Um, there's the real world, um, there's what we observe of the real world

882
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:43,751
our observations, and then our mental models as to h- how we think the world w- works.

883
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:48,251
Um, so, um, we can't directly access reality

884
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:48,851
okay?

885
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:50,111
Uh, all we have are the, uh

886
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:53,251
observations which are incomplete and they, they have errors

887
00:38:53,251 --> 00:38:55,791
um, and, um, there are many

888
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,831
many cases where we would, um, uh

889
00:38:57,831 --> 00:39:02,831
we want to know, for example, what is the weather like tomorrow and we don't yet ha- have the observation and we'd like to make a prediction.

890
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:05,691
Um, and then we have these simplified models

891
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:08,911
sometimes making unrealistic assumptions, you know, spherical cow type things.

892
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:10,531
Those are the mathematical models.

893
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:11,011
Mm-hmm.

894
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:13,391
Mathematics is concerned with the models.

895
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:19,871
Science collects the observations and it proposes the models that might explain these observations.

896
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:25,171
What mathematics does i- uh, we, we stay within the model and we ask what are the consequences of that model

897
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:29,911
what observations, what, what predictions will the model make of the

898
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,271
of future observations.

899
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:34,291
Uh, or past observations, does, does it fit observed data?

900
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,931
Um, so there, there's definitely a symbiosis.

901
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:39,536
Um, it's math.

902
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:39,651
..

903
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:44,931
I guess mathematics is, is unusual among other disciplines is that we start from hypotheses

904
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:49,331
like the axioms of a model, and ask what conclusions come out from that model.

905
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:52,331
Um, in almost any other discipline, uh

906
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:54,571
you start with conclusions, you know, I want to do this

907
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:56,251
I want to build a bridge, you know

908
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:57,771
I want, I want to, to make money

909
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:58,531
I want to do this, okay?

910
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:02,331
And then you, you, you find the paths to get there.

911
00:40:02,331 --> 00:40:04,271
Um, a lot.

912
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:04,391
..

913
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:06,211
there's, uh, there's a lot less sort of speculation about

914
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:07,971
you know, suppose I did this, what would happen?

915
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:11,171
Um, you know, planning and, and modeling.

916
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:15,091
Um, uh, speculative fiction maybe is, is one other place

917
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:17,211
uh, but, uh, that's about it actually.

918
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:19,471
Most of things we do in life is conclusions driven

919
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:20,951
including physics and sci- you know, I mean

920
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,851
they want to know, you know, where is this asteroid gonna go

921
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:25,331
you know, or what, what, what is the weather gonna be tomorrow?

922
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:29,991
Um, but, um, mathematics also has this other direction of

923
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:32,231
of going from the, uh, the axioms.

924
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:36,751
What do you think, there is this tension in physics between theory and experiment.

925
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:37,091
Mm-hmm.

926
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:42,031
What do you think is a more powerful way of discovering truly novel ideas about reality?

927
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:43,971
Well, you need both, top-down and bottom-up.

928
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:47,111
Um, yeah, it's just a, it's a really interaction between all these thing

929
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:47,431
AI.

930
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:53,751
So over time the observations and the theory and the modeling should g- both g- get closer to reality.

931
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,331
But initially, and it is, I mean

932
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,631
uh, this is, um, this is always the case out there

933
00:40:58,631 --> 00:41:00,171
they're always far apart to begin with.

934
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:02,711
Um, but you need one to figure out

935
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,291
uh, where, where to push the other

936
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:04,651
you know?

937
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:07,311
So, um, if your model is predicting anomalies

938
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:09,631
um, that are not picked up by experiment

939
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:12,231
that tells experimenters where to look, you know

940
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:15,931
um, to, to, to, to find more data to refine the models.

941
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,031
Um, you know, so it, it goes

942
00:41:18,031 --> 00:41:18,951
it goes back and forth.

943
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:24,471
Um, within mathematics itself, there's, there's also a theory and experimental component.

944
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:29,251
It's just that until very recently, theory has dominated almost completely.

945
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:34,351
Like 99% of mathematics is theoretical mathematics, and there's a very tiny amount of experimental mathematics.

946
00:41:34,351 --> 00:41:37,131
Um, I mean, people do do it

947
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:39,471
you know, like if they want to study prime numbers or whatever

948
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:43,371
they can just generate large datasets and with a com- so once we had computers

949
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:45,491
um, we began to do it a little bit.

950
00:41:45,491 --> 00:41:47,191
Um, although even before.

951
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:47,351
..

952
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:50,151
well, like Gauss for example, he discovered

953
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:52,391
he conjectured the most basic theorem in, in number theory

954
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:55,751
it's called the prime number theorem, which predicts how many primes that are up to a million

955
00:41:55,751 --> 00:41:56,451
up to a trillion.

956
00:41:56,451 --> 00:42:00,431
It's not an obvious question, and basically what he did was that he computed

957
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:03,391
uh, I mean, mostly, uh, um

958
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,751
by himself, but also hired human computers

959
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:08,811
um, people who, whose professional job it was to do arithmetic

960
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:14,271
um, to compute the first 100,000 primes of something and made tables and made a prediction.

961
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:17,151
Um, that was an early example of experimental mathematics.

962
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:21,331
Um, but until very recently it was not

963
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:24,371
um, yeah, I mean, theoretical mathematics was just much more successful.

964
00:42:24,371 --> 00:42:28,071
I mean, because doing complicated mathematical computations is

965
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:29,971
uh, was just not, not feasible, uh

966
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:31,224
until very recently.

967
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:34,135
Uh, and even nowadays, you know, even though- though we have powerful computers

968
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,295
only some mathematical things can be, um

969
00:42:36,295 --> 00:42:37,375
explored numerically.

970
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,975
There's something called the Commodore explosion.

971
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,775
If you want to- to study, for example

972
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:44,289
Zeamer–Modyi's theorem, you want to study all possible subsets of the numbers one to 1

973
00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:45,895
000, there's only 1,000 numbers.

974
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:46,575
How bad could it be?

975
00:42:46,575 --> 00:42:48,975
It turns out the number of different subsets of- of one to 1

976
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:50,135
000 is two to the power of 1

977
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:55,196
000, which is way bigger than- than- than any computer can currently can- can enu- in fact

978
00:42:55,196 --> 00:42:56,756
any computer ever will ever get, uh

979
00:42:56,756 --> 00:42:57,395
enumerate.

980
00:42:57,395 --> 00:43:00,355
Um, so if you have to be

981
00:43:00,355 --> 00:43:00,679
um.

982
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:00,856
..

983
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:07,516
There are certain math problems that very quickly become just intractable to attack by direct brute force computation.

984
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:09,275
Uh, chess is another, um, uh

985
00:43:09,275 --> 00:43:10,215
famous example.

986
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:11,935
Uh, it's the number of chess positions

987
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:14,815
uh, we can't get a c- computer to fully explore

988
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:18,835
but now we have AI, um, um

989
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:23,215
we have tools to explore this space not with 100% guarantees of s-success

990
00:43:23,215 --> 00:43:25,175
but with experiment, you know?

991
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:28,775
So like, um, we can empirically solve chess now

992
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:29,256
right?

993
00:43:29,256 --> 00:43:31,175
For example, uh, we have, we have a

994
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,055
uh, very, very good AIs that they can.

995
00:43:33,055 --> 00:43:33,155
..

996
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:35,895
you know, they don't explore every single position in- in the game tree

997
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:37,715
but they have found some very good approximation.

998
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,675
Um, and people are using actually these chess engines

999
00:43:40,675 --> 00:43:41,460
uh, to make.

1000
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:41,575
..

1001
00:43:41,575 --> 00:43:43,515
uh, to do experimental chess.

1002
00:43:43,515 --> 00:43:46,555
Um, that, uh, they're- they're revisiting old chess theories about

1003
00:43:46,555 --> 00:43:47,215
oh, you know, when you.

1004
00:43:47,215 --> 00:43:47,295
..

1005
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:50,015
this type of opening, you know, th- this is a good- this is a good type of move

1006
00:43:50,015 --> 00:43:52,295
this is not, and they can use these chess engines to actually

1007
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:54,555
uh, refine, uh, and in some cases overturn

1008
00:43:54,555 --> 00:43:57,795
um, um, conventional wisdom about chess.

1009
00:43:57,795 --> 00:43:59,755
And I- I do hope that, uh

1010
00:43:59,755 --> 00:44:03,435
that mathematics will- will have a larger experimental component in the future

1011
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:04,895
perhaps powered by AI.

1012
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:06,815
We'll, of course, ta- talk about that

1013
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:09,855
but in the case of chess, and there's a similar thing in mathematics

1014
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,175
the.

1015
00:44:10,175 --> 00:44:10,275
..

1016
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:17,675
I don't believe it's providing a kind of formal explanation of the different positions.

1017
00:44:17,675 --> 00:44:17,855
No.

1018
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,875
It's just saying which position is better or not

1019
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,495
and then you can intuit as a human being

1020
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:24,955
and then from that, we humans can construct- Yes.

1021
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:24,955
.

1022
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:24,955
.

1023
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:26,375
a theory of the matter.

1024
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,335
Right.

1025
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:30,035
You've mentioned the Plato's cave allegory.

1026
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:30,555
Mm-hmm.

1027
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:36,795
So in case people don't know, it's where people are observing shadows of reality

1028
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:41,715
not reality itself, and they believe what they're observing to be reality.

1029
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:45,535
Is that, in some sense, what mathematicians and maybe all humans are doing

1030
00:44:45,535 --> 00:44:50,995
is, um, looking at shadows of reality?

1031
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:51,151
Do.

1032
00:44:51,151 --> 00:44:51,255
..

1033
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:55,155
is it possible for us to truly access reality?

1034
00:44:55,155 --> 00:44:57,895
Well, there are these three ontological things.

1035
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:02,975
There's actual reality, there's our observations, and our- our models.

1036
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:06,035
Um, and- and technically, they are distinct

1037
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:07,635
and I think they will always be distinct

1038
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:08,355
um- Right.

1039
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:08,361
.

1040
00:45:08,361 --> 00:45:08,375
..

1041
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:12,495
but they can get closer, um, over time.

1042
00:45:12,495 --> 00:45:14,959
Um, you know, so, um.

1043
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:15,015
..

1044
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:18,941
and the process of getting closer often means that you're.

1045
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:19,035
..

1046
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:21,315
you have to discard your initial intuitions, um

1047
00:45:21,315 --> 00:45:25,435
so, um, a- astronomy r- provides great examples

1048
00:45:25,435 --> 00:45:26,335
you know, like, you know, like

1049
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:27,109
your.

1050
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:27,195
..

1051
00:45:27,195 --> 00:45:29,383
an initial model of the world is that it's flat because it's.

1052
00:45:29,383 --> 00:45:29,435
..

1053
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,275
it looks flat, you know, and- and

1054
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:32,795
um, and that it's.

1055
00:45:32,795 --> 00:45:32,875
..

1056
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,615
and it's big, you know, and the rest of the universe

1057
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:35,561
the skies is not.

1058
00:45:35,561 --> 00:45:35,715
..

1059
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:36,675
you know, like, the sun, for example

1060
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:41,395
looks really tiny, um, and so you- you start off with a model which is actually really far from reality

1061
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:44,315
um, but it fits kind of the observations that you have

1062
00:45:44,315 --> 00:45:45,175
um, you know?

1063
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,448
So, you know, so things look good for.

1064
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:46,495
..

1065
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:47,011
you know, but if it.

1066
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:47,035
..

1067
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,875
over time, as you make more and more observations

1068
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:51,155
bringing it closer to- to- to reality, um

1069
00:45:51,155 --> 00:45:52,975
the model gets dragged along with it, you know?

1070
00:45:52,975 --> 00:45:55,175
And so over time, we had to realize that the Earth was round

1071
00:45:55,175 --> 00:45:57,635
that it spins, it goes around the solar system

1072
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:00,155
the solar system goes around the galaxy, and so on and so forth

1073
00:46:00,155 --> 00:46:00,535
and the.

1074
00:46:00,535 --> 00:46:00,575
..

1075
00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:02,215
it goes by the universe and it's expanding.

1076
00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:06,955
Um, the expansions are self-expanding, accelerating, and in fact very recently

1077
00:46:06,955 --> 00:46:08,245
in- in this year or so, there's a.

1078
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:08,435
..

1079
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,675
even the assertion of the universe itself is

1080
00:46:10,675 --> 00:46:10,831
uh.

1081
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:10,935
..

1082
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,495
there's evidence now that it's- it's non-constant.

1083
00:46:12,495 --> 00:46:15,795
And, uh, the explanation behind why that is

1084
00:46:15,795 --> 00:46:17,195
is- It's catching up.

1085
00:46:17,195 --> 00:46:18,795
Um-  It's catching up.

1086
00:46:18,795 --> 00:46:20,375
I mean, it's still, you know, the dark matter

1087
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:21,255
dark energy- Yes.

1088
00:46:21,255 --> 00:46:21,455
Mm-hmm.

1089
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:21,455
.

1090
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:21,455
.

1091
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:21,935
this- this kind of thing.

1092
00:46:21,935 --> 00:46:22,215
Yes.

1093
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:24,465
We have a- we have a model that sort of explains.

1094
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:24,575
..

1095
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:25,555
that fits the data really well.

1096
00:46:25,555 --> 00:46:27,775
It just has a few parameters that, um

1097
00:46:27,775 --> 00:46:29,255
uh, you have to specify.

1098
00:46:29,255 --> 00:46:31,455
Um, but so, you know, people say

1099
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,555
"Oh, that's fudge factors," you know

1100
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:34,675
with- with enough fudge factors, you can- you can explain anything.

1101
00:46:34,675 --> 00:46:38,875
Um, yeah, but, uh, the mathematical point of the model is that

1102
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:43,075
um, you want to have fewer parameters in your model than data points in your observational set.

1103
00:46:43,075 --> 00:46:46,455
So if you have a model with 10 parameters that explains 10 out- 10 observations

1104
00:46:46,455 --> 00:46:48,615
that is a completely useless model.

1105
00:46:48,615 --> 00:46:49,835
It's what's called overfitted.

1106
00:46:49,835 --> 00:46:51,635
But, like, if you have a model with- with

1107
00:46:51,635 --> 00:46:55,095
you know, two parameters and it explains a- a trillion observations

1108
00:46:55,095 --> 00:46:55,888
which is basically.

1109
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:55,995
..

1110
00:46:55,995 --> 00:46:56,087
uh.

1111
00:46:56,087 --> 00:46:56,095
..

1112
00:46:56,095 --> 00:46:56,727
so, uh.

1113
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:56,775
..

1114
00:46:56,775 --> 00:47:01,815
yeah, the- the- the dark matter model I think has like 14 parameters and it explains petabytes of data

1115
00:47:01,815 --> 00:47:04,835
um, that- that- that- that- the astronomers have.

1116
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:07,535
Um, you can think of a- of a theory

1117
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:08,855
uh, like one way to think about

1118
00:47:08,855 --> 00:47:10,797
um, a- a physical mathematical theory.

1119
00:47:10,797 --> 00:47:10,895
..

1120
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,755
a- a theory is- it's- it's a compression of- of the universe

1121
00:47:13,755 --> 00:47:15,735
um, and, uh, uh, data compression.

1122
00:47:15,735 --> 00:47:18,155
So, you know, you have these petabytes of observations

1123
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:24,755
you like to compress it to a model which you can describe in five pages and specify a certain number of parameters

1124
00:47:24,755 --> 00:47:26,735
and if it can fit to reasonable accuracy

1125
00:47:26,735 --> 00:47:29,235
you know, a- almost all of your- of your observations

1126
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:29,723
that.

1127
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:29,815
..

1128
00:47:29,815 --> 00:47:31,395
I mean, the more compression that you make

1129
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:32,395
the better your theory.

1130
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:38,075
In fact, one of the great surprises of our universe and of everything in it is that it's compressible at all.

1131
00:47:38,075 --> 00:47:38,555
That's the- Yeah.

1132
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:38,568
.

1133
00:47:38,568 --> 00:47:38,595
..

1134
00:47:38,595 --> 00:47:40,555
unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.

1135
00:47:40,555 --> 00:47:40,715
Yeah.

1136
00:47:40,715 --> 00:47:41,835
Einstein had a quote like that.

1137
00:47:41,835 --> 00:47:44,795
The- the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.

1138
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:45,915
Right.

1139
00:47:45,915 --> 00:47:47,415
And not just comprehensibly.

1140
00:47:47,415 --> 00:47:49,715
You can do an equation like E equals MC squared.

1141
00:47:49,715 --> 00:47:50,485
There is actually a.

1142
00:47:50,485 --> 00:47:50,595
..

1143
00:47:50,595 --> 00:47:52,835
some mathematical possible explanation for that.

1144
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:56,595
Um, so there's this phenomenon in mathematics called universality.

1145
00:47:56,595 --> 00:48:01,735
So many complex systems at the macroscale are coming out of lots of tiny interactions at- at the macroscale

1146
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:04,635
and normally because of the common form of explosion

1147
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:08,535
you would think that, uh, the macroscale equations must be like infinitely

1148
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:11,095
exponentially more complicated than- than the, uh

1149
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:15,335
the microscale ones, and they are if you want to solve them completely exactly.

1150
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,355
Like if you want to model, um

1151
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:20,275
all the atoms in a box of- of air

1152
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:22,895
uh, that's like Avogadro's number is humongous

1153
00:48:22,895 --> 00:48:23,055
right?

1154
00:48:23,055 --> 00:48:24,215
There's a huge number of particles.

1155
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,955
If you actually had to track each one

1156
00:48:25,955 --> 00:48:26,955
it would be ridiculous.

1157
00:48:26,955 --> 00:48:35,335
But certain laws emerge at the microscopic scale that almost don't depend on what's going on at the macroscale or only depend on a very small number of parameters.

1158
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:37,175
So if you want to model a gas

1159
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:39,330
um, of, you know-.

1160
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:39,495
..

1161
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:41,235
quintillion particles in, in a box.

1162
00:48:41,235 --> 00:48:44,335
You just need to know its temperature and pressure and volume and a few parameters

1163
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:47,675
like five or six, and it models almost everything you

1164
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:51,976
you need to know about these 10 to the 23 or whatever particles.

1165
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:56,015
Um, so we, we have, um

1166
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:59,995
we, we don't understand universality anywhere near as we would like mathematically

1167
00:48:59,995 --> 00:49:02,935
but there are much simpler toy models where we do

1168
00:49:02,935 --> 00:49:06,015
um, have a good understanding of why universi- universality occurs.

1169
00:49:06,015 --> 00:49:08,995
Um, uh, most basic one is, is the central limit theorem.

1170
00:49:08,995 --> 00:49:11,955
That explains why the bell curve shows up everywhere in nature

1171
00:49:11,955 --> 00:49:14,295
that so many things are distributed by, uh

1172
00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:16,496
what's called a Gaussian distribution, uh, famous bell curve.

1173
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:18,716
Uh, there's now even a meme with this curve.

1174
00:49:18,716 --> 00:49:20,996
And even the meme applies broadly.

1175
00:49:20,996 --> 00:49:21,175
Yeah.

1176
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:22,595
There's a universality to the meme.

1177
00:49:22,595 --> 00:49:23,115
Yeah.

1178
00:49:23,115 --> 00:49:24,655
Yes, you can call meta, uh-  .

1179
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:24,655
..

1180
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:25,155
if you like.

1181
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:27,315
But there are many, many processes.

1182
00:49:27,315 --> 00:49:29,095
For example, you c- you can take lots and lots of independent

1183
00:49:29,095 --> 00:49:31,055
um, random variables and average them together

1184
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:33,675
um, uh, in, in various ways.

1185
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:34,245
You basically.

1186
00:49:34,245 --> 00:49:34,295
..

1187
00:49:34,295 --> 00:49:36,175
you take a simple average or more complicated average

1188
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:38,355
and we can prove in various cases that

1189
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:40,895
that these, these bell curves, these Gaussians emerge

1190
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:43,395
and it is a satisfying, satisfying explanation.

1191
00:49:43,395 --> 00:49:45,095
Um, sometimes they don't.

1192
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:49,175
Um, so, so if you have many different inputs and they're all correlated in some s- systemic way

1193
00:49:49,175 --> 00:49:52,035
then y- you can get something very far from a bell curve to show up.

1194
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:55,095
Uh, and this is also important to know when such a system fails.

1195
00:49:55,095 --> 00:49:59,656
So universality is not a 100% reliable thing to rely on at that

1196
00:49:59,656 --> 00:50:00,415
um, um.

1197
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:00,575
..

1198
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:04,295
there the global financial crisis was a, a famous example of this.

1199
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:06,335
Uh, people thought that, uh, um

1200
00:50:06,335 --> 00:50:09,796
mortgage de- defaults, um, um, had this sort of

1201
00:50:09,796 --> 00:50:12,215
um, Gaussian-type behavior that, that if you

1202
00:50:12,215 --> 00:50:13,055
if you ask.

1203
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:13,175
..

1204
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:14,695
if a population of, of, of, uh

1205
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:17,835
you know, 100,000 Americans with mortgages

1206
00:50:17,835 --> 00:50:20,136
ask what, what proportion of them will default on their mortgages

1207
00:50:20,136 --> 00:50:23,615
um, if everything was decorrelated, it would be a nice bell curve and

1208
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:27,535
and like you can, you can, you can manage risk of options and derivatives and so forth and

1209
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:29,815
um, and it is a very beautiful theory.

1210
00:50:29,815 --> 00:50:34,235
Um, but if there are systemic shocks in the economy  uh

1211
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:36,476
that can push everybody to default at the same time

1212
00:50:36,476 --> 00:50:38,075
uh, that's very non-Gaussian behavior.

1213
00:50:38,075 --> 00:50:42,236
Um, and, uh, this wasn't fully accounted for  in

1214
00:50:42,236 --> 00:50:43,375
uh, 2008.

1215
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,185
Um, now I think there's some more awareness that this is a.

1216
00:50:46,185 --> 00:50:46,196
..

1217
00:50:46,196 --> 00:50:49,075
systemic risk is actually a, a much bigger issue.

1218
00:50:49,075 --> 00:50:51,176
And, uh, just because the model is pretty

1219
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:54,095
uh, and nice, uh, it may not match reality.

1220
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:59,576
And so, so the mathematics of working out what models do is really important

1221
00:50:59,576 --> 00:51:02,375
um, but, um, also the, the

1222
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,815
the science of validating when the models, uh

1223
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:06,156
fit reality and when they don't.

1224
00:51:06,156 --> 00:51:07,380
Um, I mean, that.

1225
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:07,455
..

1226
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:08,375
you need both.

1227
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:11,655
Um, and, but mathematics can help because it c- it can

1228
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:13,455
it c- uh, for example, these central limit theorems

1229
00:51:13,455 --> 00:51:15,475
it, it tells you that, that if you have certain axioms like

1230
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:19,076
like, like, uh, non-correlation, that if all the inputs were not correlated to each other

1231
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,035
um, then you have this kind of behavior that things are fine.

1232
00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:24,995
It, it tells you where to look for weaknesses in the model.

1233
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:33,115
So b- if you have a mathematical understanding of central limit theorem and someone proposes to use these Gaussian copulas or whatever to mo- to model

1234
00:51:33,115 --> 00:51:37,135
um, default risk, um, if you're mathematically

1235
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,495
um, trained, you would say, "Okay

1236
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,225
but what are the systemic correlation between all your inputs?

1237
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:42,848
" And so then the.

1238
00:51:42,848 --> 00:51:42,975
..

1239
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,355
then you can ask the economists, you know

1240
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:46,155
how, how, how much of a risk is that?

1241
00:51:46,155 --> 00:51:47,555
Um, and then you can, you can

1242
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:48,295
you can go look for that.

1243
00:51:48,295 --> 00:51:51,775
So there's always this, this, uh, this synergy between science and

1244
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,435
and mathematics.

1245
00:51:52,435 --> 00:51:54,921
A little bit on the topic of universality.

1246
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:55,055
..

1247
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:55,335
Mm-hmm.

1248
00:51:55,335 --> 00:52:01,515
You're known and celebrated for working across an incredible breadth of mathematics

1249
00:52:01,515 --> 00:52:03,775
reminiscent of Hilbert a century ago.

1250
00:52:03,775 --> 00:52:07,855
In fact, the great Fields Medal-winning mathematician

1251
00:52:07,855 --> 00:52:12,155
Tim Gowers, has said that you are the closest thing we get to Hilbert.

1252
00:52:12,155 --> 00:52:12,495
Ah.

1253
00:52:12,495 --> 00:52:15,695
  He's a colleague of yours.

1254
00:52:15,695 --> 00:52:15,975
Oh, yeah.

1255
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:16,695
Good friend.

1256
00:52:16,695 --> 00:52:22,655
But anyway, so y- you are known for this ability to go both deep and broad in mathematics

1257
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:30,775
so you're the perfect person to ask, do you think there are threads that connect all the disparate area- areas of mathematics?

1258
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:33,315
Is there a kind of deep underlying structure

1259
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:36,055
uh, to all of mathematics?

1260
00:52:36,055 --> 00:52:38,655
There's certainly a lot of connecting threads, um

1261
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:42,028
and a lot of the progress of mathematics has.

1262
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:42,195
..

1263
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:45,108
can be represented by taking.

1264
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:45,215
..

1265
00:52:45,215 --> 00:52:49,895
by stories of two fields of mathematics that were previously not connected and finding connections.

1266
00:52:49,895 --> 00:52:54,255
Um, an ancient example is, um, geometry and number theory.

1267
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,355
You know, so, so in the times of the ancient Greeks

1268
00:52:56,355 --> 00:52:58,035
these were considered different subjects.

1269
00:52:58,035 --> 00:53:00,275
Um, I mean, mathematicians worked on both.

1270
00:53:00,275 --> 00:53:02,715
You know, you could, uh, work both on

1271
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:04,715
on geometry most famously, but also on numbers.

1272
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:08,835
Um, but they were not really considered related.

1273
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:10,795
Um, I mean, a little bit, like

1274
00:53:10,795 --> 00:53:11,935
you know, you, you could say that

1275
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:12,301
that the.

1276
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:12,395
..

1277
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:15,815
this length was five times this length because you could take five copies of this length and so forth.

1278
00:53:15,815 --> 00:53:18,677
But it wasn't until Descartes who really realized that.

1279
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:18,735
..

1280
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:21,175
uh, who developed what we now call analytic geometry

1281
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:23,815
that you can, you can parametrize the plane

1282
00:53:23,815 --> 00:53:26,675
a geometric object, by, um, by two real numbers

1283
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:26,815
right?

1284
00:53:26,815 --> 00:53:27,507
Every point can be.

1285
00:53:27,507 --> 00:53:27,675
..

1286
00:53:27,675 --> 00:53:30,675
uh, and so geometric problems can be turned into

1287
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,075
into problems about numbers.

1288
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,675
Um, and the, the.

1289
00:53:34,675 --> 00:53:34,755
..

1290
00:53:34,755 --> 00:53:37,741
today this feels almost trivial, like the.

1291
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:37,815
..

1292
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:38,475
there's like.

1293
00:53:38,475 --> 00:53:38,475
..

1294
00:53:38,475 --> 00:53:39,695
there's, there's, there's no content to this.

1295
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:41,275
Like, of course, uh, you.

1296
00:53:41,275 --> 00:53:41,295
..

1297
00:53:41,295 --> 00:53:42,835
you know, um, a plane is X

1298
00:53:42,835 --> 00:53:44,115
X and Y, you know, of course

1299
00:53:44,115 --> 00:53:46,335
that's what we teach and it's internalized.

1300
00:53:46,335 --> 00:53:49,835
Um, but it was an important development that these

1301
00:53:49,835 --> 00:53:50,788
these two fields are, are.

1302
00:53:50,788 --> 00:53:50,815
..

1303
00:53:50,815 --> 00:53:51,735
were unified.

1304
00:53:51,735 --> 00:53:56,135
Um, and I suppose this has just gone on throughout mathematics over and over again

1305
00:53:56,135 --> 00:54:00,335
that algebra and geometry were separated and now we have this root algebraic geometry that connects them and

1306
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:01,375
and over and over again.

1307
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:05,135
And that's certainly the type of mathematics that I enjoy the most.

1308
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:08,495
So I think there's sort of different styles to being a mathematician.

1309
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,935
I think hedgehogs and foxes.

1310
00:54:09,935 --> 00:54:11,875
A fox knows many things a little bit

1311
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,295
but a, a hedgehog knows one thing very

1312
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:13,775
very well.

1313
00:54:13,775 --> 00:54:17,535
Um, and in mathematics there's definitely both hedgehogs and foxes

1314
00:54:17,535 --> 00:54:19,591
um, and then there's people who are kind of.

1315
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:19,695
..

1316
00:54:19,695 --> 00:54:21,135
uh, who can play both roles.

1317
00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:27,995
Um, and I think i- ideal collaboration between mathematicians in- involves very d- you need some diversity

1318
00:54:27,995 --> 00:54:31,615
y- like, um, a f- a fox working with many h- hedgehogs or

1319
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:32,315
or vice versa.

1320
00:54:32,315 --> 00:54:35,595
So yeah, but, but I identify mostly a- as a fox

1321
00:54:35,595 --> 00:54:36,475
uh, certainly.

1322
00:54:36,475 --> 00:54:40,395
I, I, I like, uh, arbitrage somehow

1323
00:54:40,395 --> 00:54:43,115
you know, like, like, um, learning how one field works

1324
00:54:43,115 --> 00:54:45,879
learning the tricks of that world and then going into another field which.

1325
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:46,047
..

1326
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:46,215
..

1327
00:54:46,215 --> 00:54:47,499
. people don't think of it as related

1328
00:54:47,499 --> 00:54:49,419
but I can, I can adapt the tricks.

1329
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,759
So see the connections between- Yeah.

1330
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:51,759
.

1331
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:51,759
.

1332
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:52,379
the fields.

1333
00:54:52,379 --> 00:54:52,660
Yeah.

1334
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,540
So there are other mathematicians who are far deeper than I am

1335
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,480
like who, they're, who have, they're really hedgehogs

1336
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:57,619
you know.

1337
00:54:57,619 --> 00:55:01,059
They, they've, they, they know everything about one field and they're much faster and

1338
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:03,639
and more effective in that field, but I can

1339
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:04,879
I can give them these extra tools.

1340
00:55:04,879 --> 00:55:07,580
I mean, you've said that you can be both a hedgehog and a

1341
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,019
and the fox, depending on the context- Yeah.

1342
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:10,039
.

1343
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:10,079
..

1344
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,240
depending on the collaboration.

1345
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:11,759
So what.

1346
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:11,879
..

1347
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,699
Can you, if it's at all possible

1348
00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:18,359
speak to the difference between those two ways of thinking about a problem?

1349
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:21,140
Say you're encountering a new problem, you know

1350
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:26,399
searching for the connections versus, like, a very singular focus.

1351
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:28,680
I'm much more comfortable with, with the

1352
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,939
uh, the, uh, the fox paradigm.

1353
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:35,279
Yeah, so, um, yeah, I, I like looking for analogies

1354
00:55:35,279 --> 00:55:36,119
narratives.

1355
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:38,479
Um, I, I spend a lot of time

1356
00:55:38,479 --> 00:55:42,140
if, if there's a result, I see it in one field and I like the result

1357
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,519
it's a cool result, but I don't like the proof.

1358
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:44,159
Like-  .

1359
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:44,159
..

1360
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:47,959
it uses types of mathematics that I'm not super familiar with.

1361
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:48,339
Um- Yes.

1362
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:48,425
.

1363
00:55:48,425 --> 00:55:48,599
..

1364
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:51,919
I often try to reprove it myself using the tools that I favor.

1365
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:54,779
Um, often my proof is worse, um

1366
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:57,819
but, um, by the exercise of doing so

1367
00:55:57,819 --> 00:56:01,285
um, I can say, "Oh, now I can see what the other proof was trying to do.

1368
00:56:01,285 --> 00:56:05,260
" Um, and from that, I can get some understanding of

1369
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,579
of the tools that are used in, in that field.

1370
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:12,279
So it's very exploratory, very doing crazy things in crazy fields and like

1371
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:13,679
yeah, reinventing the wheel a lot.

1372
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:16,540
Yeah, whereas, so the hedgehog style is

1373
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,280
uh, I think much more scholarly, you know

1374
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,219
you, you are very knowledge based, you

1375
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:23,719
you, you, you stay up to speed on like all the developments in this field

1376
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:25,700
you, you know all the history, um

1377
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,900
you have a very good understanding of, of exactly the strengths and weaknesses of

1378
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,500
of each particular, uh, technique.

1379
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,079
Um, yeah, uh, I think you

1380
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,239
you'd rely a lot more on sort of calculation than sort of trying to find narratives.

1381
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:41,279
Um, so yeah, I mean, I can do that too

1382
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:43,739
but, uh, there are other people who are extremely good at that.

1383
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:48,519
Let's step back and, uh, uh, maybe look at the

1384
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:52,659
the, a bit of a romanticized version of mathematics.

1385
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,059
Mm-hmm.

1386
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:57,279
So, uh, I think you've said that early on in your life

1387
00:56:57,279 --> 00:57:01,699
uh, math was more like a puzzle-solving activity- Mm-hmm.

1388
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:01,699
 .

1389
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:01,699
 .

1390
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:03,539
when you were, uh, young.

1391
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:11,159
When did you first encounter a problem or proof where you realized math can have a kind of elegance and beauty to it?

1392
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:15,259
That's a good question.

1393
00:57:15,259 --> 00:57:17,459
Um, when I came to graduate school

1394
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:20,499
uh, in Princeton, um, so John Conway was there at the time

1395
00:57:20,499 --> 00:57:22,079
he, he passed away a few years ago

1396
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,839
but, uh, I remember one of the very first research talks I

1397
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,939
I went to was a talk by Conway on what he called extreme proof.

1398
00:57:27,939 --> 00:57:30,779
So Conway just had this, this amazing way of

1399
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:32,519
of thinking about all kinds of things in a

1400
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:33,919
in a way that you wouldn't normally think of.

1401
00:57:33,919 --> 00:57:38,159
So, um, he thought of proofs themselves as occupying some sort of space

1402
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:41,339
you know, so, so, um, if you wanted to prove something

1403
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:42,939
let- let's say that there's infinitely many primes

1404
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:43,179
okay?

1405
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:45,259
There are always different proofs, but you could

1406
00:57:45,259 --> 00:57:47,459
you could rank them in different axes, like some proofs are elegant

1407
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:48,939
some proofs are long, some proofs are

1408
00:57:48,939 --> 00:57:50,999
are, um, are elementary and so forth.

1409
00:57:50,999 --> 00:57:52,739
Um, and so there's this cloud.

1410
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:52,899
..

1411
00:57:52,899 --> 00:57:56,239
So the space of all proofs itself has some sort of shape.

1412
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,679
Um, and so he, he was interested in

1413
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,239
in extreme points of the shape, like out of all

1414
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,199
all these proofs, which one is the shortest at the ex- at the expense of everyth- everything else or

1415
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:08,639
or the most elementary or, or whatever.

1416
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,499
Um, and so he gave some examples of well-known theorems

1417
00:58:12,499 --> 00:58:13,799
and then he would give what he thought was

1418
00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:17,359
was the extreme proof, um, in these different aspects.

1419
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,699
Um, um, I just found that really eye-opening

1420
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:23,339
um, that, that, um, you know

1421
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:25,619
it's not just getting a proof what was

1422
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:28,959
uh, was interesting, but, but once you have that proof

1423
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:30,459
you know, trying to, to, uh

1424
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:33,599
to optimize it in various ways, um

1425
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,779
that, that proof, um, uh, proofing itself had some craftsmanship to it.

1426
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:42,019
Um, it certainly informed my writing style

1427
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,619
um, that, you know, like when you do your

1428
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:47,139
your math assignments in undergraduate, your homework and so forth

1429
00:58:47,139 --> 00:58:50,319
you, you're sort of encouraged to just write down any proof that works

1430
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:50,819
okay?

1431
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,359
And hand it in and get a, as long as it gets a tick mark

1432
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,139
you, you move on.

1433
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:59,919
Um, but if you want your, your results to actually be influential and be read by people

1434
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:01,719
um, it can't just be correct.

1435
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:04,819
It should also, um, be a pleasure to read

1436
00:59:04,819 --> 00:59:07,999
you know, um, motivated, um, be adaptable to

1437
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:09,859
to generalize to other, um, things.

1438
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:12,039
Um, it's the same in, in many other disciplines

1439
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:12,799
like, like coding.

1440
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,179
There's, there's a lot of analogies between math and coding.

1441
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:17,079
I like analogies, if you haven't noticed.

1442
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:19,099
 Um, but, um- Yeah.

1443
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:19,105
.

1444
00:59:19,105 --> 00:59:19,119
..

1445
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,559
like you can code something, a spaghetti code that works for a certain task and it's quick and

1446
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:27,039
and dirty and it works, but there's lots of good principles for

1447
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,379
for, um, writing code well so that other people can use it

1448
00:59:30,379 --> 00:59:33,239
build upon it and so on, and has fewer bugs and whatever.

1449
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:33,579
Mm-hmm.

1450
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:37,319
Um, and there's similar things with math- mathematics

1451
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:37,699
so.

1452
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,465
Yeah, the.

1453
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:38,559
..

1454
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:43,519
 First of all, there's so many beautiful things there and Conway is one of the great minds

1455
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,499
uh, in mathematics ever and computer science.

1456
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:50,399
Uh, just even considering the space of proofs- Yeah.

1457
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,479
.

1458
00:59:50,479 --> 00:59:50,639
..

1459
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:53,719
and saying, "Okay, what does this space look like?

1460
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:55,475
And what are the extremes?

1461
00:59:55,475 --> 01:00:01,159
" Uh, like you mentioned, coding as an analogy is interesting because there's also this activity called

1462
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:02,779
uh, Code Golf- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1463
01:00:02,779 --> 01:00:02,799
.

1464
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:02,839
..

1465
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:06,119
which I also find beautiful and fun, uh

1466
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:12,179
where people use different programming languages to try to write the shortest possible program that accomplishes a particular task.

1467
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:12,519
Yeah.

1468
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:14,339
And I believe there's even competitions on this.

1469
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:14,859
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1470
01:00:14,859 --> 01:00:15,459
Yeah.

1471
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:21,785
And, uh, it's also a nice way to stress test not just the.

1472
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:22,019
..

1473
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:25,519
sort of the programs, or in this case the proofs

1474
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:30,199
but also the different languages, maybe that's a different notation or whatever to use to

1475
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:31,619
to accomplish a different task.

1476
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:31,639
Yeah.

1477
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:32,339
Yeah, you learn a lot.

1478
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:34,499
I mean, it, it may seem like a frivolous exercise

1479
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:37,319
but it, it can generate all these insights which

1480
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:39,544
if you didn't have this artificial, um-.

1481
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:39,807
..

1482
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,727
objective, uh, to, to, to pursue

1483
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:42,607
you, you might not see.

1484
01:00:42,607 --> 01:00:48,527
What to you is the most beautiful or elegant equation in mathematics?

1485
01:00:48,527 --> 01:00:51,207
I mean, one of the things that people often look to in

1486
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:53,847
in beauty is the simplicity.

1487
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:56,167
So if you look at E equals MC squared.

1488
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:56,688
Mm-hmm.

1489
01:00:56,688 --> 01:00:59,107
So when, when a few concepts come together

1490
01:00:59,107 --> 01:01:01,228
that's why the Euler identity- Hmm.

1491
01:01:01,228 --> 01:01:01,254
.

1492
01:01:01,254 --> 01:01:01,307
..

1493
01:01:01,307 --> 01:01:05,127
is often considered, uh, the most beautiful equation in mathematics.

1494
01:01:05,127 --> 01:01:05,407
Mm-hmm.

1495
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:05,748
Mm-hmm.

1496
01:01:05,748 --> 01:01:07,787
Do you, do you find beauty in that one

1497
01:01:07,787 --> 01:01:08,667
in the Euler identity?

1498
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:08,907
Yeah.

1499
01:01:08,907 --> 01:01:11,147
Well, as I said, I mean, what I find most appealing is

1500
01:01:11,147 --> 01:01:13,447
is connections between different things that y- that

1501
01:01:13,447 --> 01:01:13,675
um.

1502
01:01:13,675 --> 01:01:13,827
..

1503
01:01:13,827 --> 01:01:16,708
So the, if you, uh, E to the Phi I equals minus one.

1504
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:18,627
Um, so yeah, people are like, "Oh

1505
01:01:18,627 --> 01:01:20,064
this uses all the fundamental constants.

1506
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:20,348
" Okay.

1507
01:01:20,348 --> 01:01:21,350
That- that- that's.

1508
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:21,448
..

1509
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:22,167
I mean that's cute.

1510
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:23,867
Um, but, but-  .

1511
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:23,867
..

1512
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:25,167
to me- Yeah.

1513
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:25,167
.

1514
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:25,167
.

1515
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:28,547
so the exponential function was introduced by Euler to measure exponential growth

1516
01:01:28,547 --> 01:01:30,308
you know, so comp- compound interest or decay

1517
01:01:30,308 --> 01:01:32,787
or anything which is continuously growing, continuously decreasing.

1518
01:01:32,787 --> 01:01:37,527
Growth and decay or dilation or contraction is modeled by the exponential function.

1519
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:42,267
Um, whereas Pi, uh, comes around from circles and rotation

1520
01:01:42,267 --> 01:01:42,587
right?

1521
01:01:42,587 --> 01:01:44,327
If you want to rotate a needle, for example

1522
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:46,567
180 degrees, uh, you need to rotate it by Pi radians.

1523
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:50,847
And I, complex numbers, represents this function on an imaginary axis

1524
01:01:50,847 --> 01:01:53,667
so a 90-degree rotation, so a change in direction.

1525
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:59,127
So the exponential function represents growth and decay in the direction that you already are.

1526
01:01:59,127 --> 01:02:02,327
Um, when you stick an I in the exponential

1527
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:03,043
it, it, it.

1528
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:03,067
..

1529
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:07,067
Now it's, it's instead of motion in the same direction as your current position

1530
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:09,207
it's motion as right angles to your current position

1531
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:09,847
so rotation.

1532
01:02:09,847 --> 01:02:12,787
Um, and then so E to the

1533
01:02:12,787 --> 01:02:15,967
E to the Pi equals minus one tells you that if you rotate for time Pi

1534
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:17,687
you end up at the other direction.

1535
01:02:17,687 --> 01:02:20,847
So it unifies geometry through dilation and exponential growth

1536
01:02:20,847 --> 01:02:23,227
you know, dynamics through this act of

1537
01:02:23,227 --> 01:02:25,547
of complexification, rotation by, by, by I.

1538
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:28,207
So it, it connects together all these towards mathematics

1539
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:28,407
you know.

1540
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:29,347
Yeah.

1541
01:02:29,347 --> 01:02:30,967
That that was geometerically complex, and complex

1542
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:33,953
and, um, the complex numbers, they're all considered almost.

1543
01:02:33,953 --> 01:02:34,047
..

1544
01:02:34,047 --> 01:02:35,927
Yeah, they were all next door neighbors in mathematics

1545
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:37,487
because of this iden- identity.

1546
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,347
Do, do you think the thing you mentioned is cute

1547
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:43,087
the, the, the collisional notations from these disparate fields

1548
01:02:43,087 --> 01:02:46,927
um, is just a frivolous side effect?

1549
01:02:46,927 --> 01:02:48,567
Or do you think there is legitimate, like

1550
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:49,867
value in- Um- .

1551
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:49,907
..

1552
01:02:49,907 --> 01:02:54,447
notation, although our old friends come together  in the night.

1553
01:02:54,447 --> 01:02:54,507
Right.

1554
01:02:54,507 --> 01:02:57,467
Well, it's, it's, it's confirmation that you have the right concepts.

1555
01:02:57,467 --> 01:03:00,707
Um, so when you first study anything

1556
01:03:00,707 --> 01:03:03,587
um, you, you have to measure things and give them names.

1557
01:03:03,587 --> 01:03:06,824
Um, and initially, sometimes your.

1558
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:06,887
..

1559
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:09,327
Because your, your model is getting too far off from reality

1560
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,747
you give the wrong things the best names

1561
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:14,667
and you only find out later what's, what's really important.

1562
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,247
Physicists can do this sometimes.

1563
01:03:16,247 --> 01:03:17,987
I mean, but it turns out okay.

1564
01:03:17,987 --> 01:03:20,427
So actually, physics, so E equals MC squared.

1565
01:03:20,427 --> 01:03:20,707
Okay.

1566
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:23,027
So, uh, one of the, the big things was the E

1567
01:03:23,027 --> 01:03:23,487
right?

1568
01:03:23,487 --> 01:03:27,167
So when, when Aristotle first came up with his laws of

1569
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:28,607
of motion and then, and then, um

1570
01:03:28,607 --> 01:03:30,707
Galileo and Newton and so forth, you know

1571
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:32,487
they saw the things they could, they could measure.

1572
01:03:32,487 --> 01:03:35,027
They could measure mass and acceleration and force and so forth.

1573
01:03:35,027 --> 01:03:37,107
And so Newtonian mechanics, for example, you know

1574
01:03:37,107 --> 01:03:39,427
F equals MA was the famous, uh

1575
01:03:39,427 --> 01:03:40,387
Newton's second law of motion.

1576
01:03:40,387 --> 01:03:41,727
So those were the, the primary objects

1577
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:43,827
so they gave them the central billing in the theory.

1578
01:03:43,827 --> 01:03:48,467
It was only later after people started analyzing these equations

1579
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:50,587
that there always seemed to be these quantities that were conserved.

1580
01:03:50,587 --> 01:03:53,027
Um, so, um, in particular momentum and energy.

1581
01:03:53,027 --> 01:03:57,727
Um, uh, and it's not obvious that things happen in energy.

1582
01:03:57,727 --> 01:04:00,527
Like, it's not something you can directly measure the same way you can measure mass and

1583
01:04:00,527 --> 01:04:02,147
and, and velocity and so forth.

1584
01:04:02,147 --> 01:04:04,687
But over time, people realized that this was actually a really fundamental concept.

1585
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:10,687
Hamilton eventually, in the 19th century, reformulated Newton's laws of physics into what is called Hamiltonian mechanics

1586
01:04:10,687 --> 01:04:13,527
where the energy, which is now called the Hamiltonian

1587
01:04:13,527 --> 01:04:14,747
was the dominant object.

1588
01:04:14,747 --> 01:04:17,967
Once you know how to measure the Hamiltonian of any system

1589
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:19,967
you can describe completely the, the dynamics

1590
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,047
like what, what happens to, to all

1591
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:21,687
to all the states.

1592
01:04:21,687 --> 01:04:22,261
Like it's.

1593
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:22,427
..

1594
01:04:22,427 --> 01:04:25,087
Um, it, it really was a central actor

1595
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,507
which was not obvious initially.

1596
01:04:26,507 --> 01:04:30,847
Um, and this, uh, helped actually

1597
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:31,087
uh.

1598
01:04:31,087 --> 01:04:31,167
..

1599
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:34,067
This change of perspective really helped when quantum mechanics came along

1600
01:04:34,067 --> 01:04:36,251
uh, because i- um.

1601
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:36,427
..

1602
01:04:36,427 --> 01:04:45,427
The early physicists who studied quantum mechanics, they had a lot of trouble trying to adapt their New- Newtonian thinking because you know everything was a particle and so forth

1603
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:47,207
to, to, to quantum mechanics, you know

1604
01:04:47,207 --> 01:04:48,687
because now everything, because it was a wave

1605
01:04:48,687 --> 01:04:50,507
it just looked really, really weird.

1606
01:04:50,507 --> 01:04:53,382
Um, like you ask, "What is the quantum version of F equals MA?

1607
01:04:53,382 --> 01:04:56,127
" And it's really, really hard to, to give an answer to that.

1608
01:04:56,127 --> 01:04:58,367
Um, but it turns out that the Hamiltonian

1609
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:02,947
which was so, um, secretly behind the scenes in classical mechanics

1610
01:05:02,947 --> 01:05:06,107
also is the key, uh, object in

1611
01:05:06,107 --> 01:05:08,127
um, um, in quantum mechanics, that this.

1612
01:05:08,127 --> 01:05:08,207
..

1613
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:09,547
There's also an object called a Hamiltonian.

1614
01:05:09,547 --> 01:05:11,007
It's a di- different type of object.

1615
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,907
It's what's called an operator rather than, than a function

1616
01:05:12,907 --> 01:05:14,595
but, um, and, um.

1617
01:05:14,595 --> 01:05:14,627
..

1618
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:17,347
But again, once you specify it, you specify the entire dynamics.

1619
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:22,607
So there's something called Schoenibers equation that tells you exactly how quantum systems evolve once you have a Hamiltonian.

1620
01:05:22,607 --> 01:05:25,927
So side by side, they look completely different objects

1621
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:26,147
you know.

1622
01:05:26,147 --> 01:05:29,887
Like, so one involves particles, one involves waves and so forth.

1623
01:05:29,887 --> 01:05:36,467
But with this centrality, you could start actually transferring a lot of intuition and facts from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.

1624
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:38,947
So for example, in, in classical mechanics

1625
01:05:38,947 --> 01:05:40,307
there's this thing called Noether's theorem.

1626
01:05:40,307 --> 01:05:42,847
Every time there's a symmetry in a physical system

1627
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:44,027
there is a conservation law.

1628
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:46,567
So the laws of physics are translation invariant.

1629
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,987
Like, if I move 10 steps to the left

1630
01:05:47,987 --> 01:05:49,887
I experience the same laws of physics as if I was here

1631
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:53,387
and that corresponds to conservation of moment- momentum.

1632
01:05:53,387 --> 01:05:56,027
Um, if I turn around by ni- by some angle

1633
01:05:56,027 --> 01:05:57,767
again I experience the same laws of physics.

1634
01:05:57,767 --> 01:05:59,747
Uh, this corresponds to the conservation of angular momentum.

1635
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,967
If I wait for 10 minutes, um

1636
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:03,727
I still have the same laws, laws of physics

1637
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:05,367
um, so there's time translation variance.

1638
01:06:05,367 --> 01:06:06,887
This corresponds to the law of conservation of energy.

1639
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:11,727
Um, so there's this fundamental connection between symmetry and conservation

1640
01:06:11,727 --> 01:06:16,587
um, and that's also true in quantum mechanics even though the equations are completely different.

1641
01:06:16,587 --> 01:06:19,007
But because they're both coming from the Hamiltonian

1642
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:22,107
the Hamiltonian controls everything, um, every time the Hamiltonian has symmetry

1643
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:24,747
the equations will, will have a conservation law.

1644
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:27,249
Um, so it's, it's, it's, it's.

1645
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:27,347
..

1646
01:06:27,347 --> 01:06:30,167
Once you have the right language, it actually makes things

1647
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,047
um, uh, a lot, a lot cleaner.

1648
01:06:32,047 --> 01:06:36,047
One of the problems why we can't unify quantum mechanics and general relativity yet

1649
01:06:36,047 --> 01:06:38,247
we haven't figured out what the fundamental objects are.

1650
01:06:38,247 --> 01:06:42,927
Like, for example, we have to give up the notion of space and time being these almost Euclidean type spaces

1651
01:06:42,927 --> 01:06:44,647
and it has to be s- um.

1652
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:44,807
..

1653
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:44,967
..

1654
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,667
. you know, and, you know, w- we kind of know that at very tiny scales

1655
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:51,867
uh, um, there's gonna be quantum fluctuations as a space- space-time foam

1656
01:06:51,867 --> 01:06:54,708
um, and trying to- to use Cartesian coordinates X

1657
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:55,703
Y, Z is gonna be.

1658
01:06:55,703 --> 01:06:55,807
..

1659
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:57,447
It's- it's just, it's- it's a non-starter.

1660
01:06:57,447 --> 01:07:00,587
But we don't know how to, what to replace it with.

1661
01:07:00,587 --> 01:07:04,367
Um, we don't actually have the mathematical re- um

1662
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:08,628
uh, concepts, you know, the analog of the Hamiltonian that sort of organized everything.

1663
01:07:08,628 --> 01:07:11,968
Does your gut say that there is a theory of everything

1664
01:07:11,968 --> 01:07:14,868
so this is po- even possible to unify

1665
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:19,287
to find this language that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics?

1666
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:20,287
I believe so.

1667
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,508
I mean, the history of physics has been that of unification

1668
01:07:22,508 --> 01:07:25,127
much like mathematics, um, over the years.

1669
01:07:25,127 --> 01:07:28,908
You know, electricity and magnetism were, were separate theories and then Maxwell unified them.

1670
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:32,287
You know, Newton unified the- the motions of the heavens with the motions on

1671
01:07:32,287 --> 01:07:33,807
of objects on the Earth and so forth.

1672
01:07:33,807 --> 01:07:35,867
So it should happen.

1673
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:38,583
Uh, it's just that the, um, uh.

1674
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:38,687
..

1675
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,167
again, to go back to this model of the

1676
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:44,647
of the observations and- and- and theory, part of our problem is that physics is a victim of its own success.

1677
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:48,368
That, uh, two big theories of- of- of physics

1678
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:51,567
general relativity and quantum mechanics are so- are so good now.

1679
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,703
It's that together they cover 99.

1680
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:55,747
9% of sort of all the observations we can make.

1681
01:07:55,747 --> 01:08:03,208
Um, and you have to, like, either go to extremely insane particle accelerations or- or the early universe or- or- or things that are really hard to measure

1682
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:07,468
um, in order to get any deviation from either of these two theories

1683
01:08:07,468 --> 01:08:10,868
to the point where you can actually figure out how to- how to c- combine them together.

1684
01:08:10,868 --> 01:08:13,675
Um, but I have faith that we.

1685
01:08:13,675 --> 01:08:13,787
..

1686
01:08:13,787 --> 01:08:17,127
you know, we've- we've- we've been doing this for centuries and we've made progress before.

1687
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:18,546
There- there's no reason why we should stop.

1688
01:08:18,546 --> 01:08:24,247
Do you think it will be a mathematician that develops a theory of everything?

1689
01:08:24,247 --> 01:08:28,327
What often happens is that when the physicists need

1690
01:08:28,327 --> 01:08:31,187
uh, um, some theory of math- math- mathematics

1691
01:08:31,187 --> 01:08:34,227
there's often some precursor that the mathematicians, um

1692
01:08:34,227 --> 01:08:35,567
worked out earlier.

1693
01:08:35,567 --> 01:08:38,506
So when Einstein started realizing that space was curved

1694
01:08:38,506 --> 01:08:40,886
he went to some mathematician and asked, you know

1695
01:08:40,886 --> 01:08:45,652
"Is there, is there some theory of curved space that the mathematicians already came up with that could be useful?

1696
01:08:45,652 --> 01:08:46,487
" And he said, "Oh, yeah.

1697
01:08:46,487 --> 01:08:46,817
There's a.

1698
01:08:46,817 --> 01:08:46,886
..

1699
01:08:46,886 --> 01:08:48,683
I think, uh, Riemann came up with something.

1700
01:08:48,683 --> 01:08:51,926
" Um, and so yeah, Riemann had developed Riemannian geometry

1701
01:08:51,926 --> 01:08:53,886
um, which is precisely, um, you know

1702
01:08:53,886 --> 01:08:57,707
a- a- a- a theory of spaces that are curved in- in various general ways

1703
01:08:57,707 --> 01:09:00,027
which turned out to be almost exactly what was needed

1704
01:09:00,027 --> 01:09:01,227
um, for Einstein's theory.

1705
01:09:01,227 --> 01:09:04,346
This is going back to- to Wigner's unreasonable effectiveness on mathematics.

1706
01:09:04,346 --> 01:09:11,947
I think the theories that work well to explain the universe tend to also involve the same mathematical objects that work well to solve mathematical problems.

1707
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:12,207
Mm-hmm.

1708
01:09:12,207 --> 01:09:14,867
Ultimately, they're just sort of both ways of organizing data

1709
01:09:14,867 --> 01:09:16,947
um, in- in- in- in useful ways.

1710
01:09:16,947 --> 01:09:23,267
It just feels like you might need to go to some weird land that's very hard to- to intuit.

1711
01:09:23,267 --> 01:09:23,520
Like.

1712
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:23,607
..

1713
01:09:23,607 --> 01:09:23,727
Yeah, yeah.

1714
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:23,727
.

1715
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:23,727
.

1716
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:25,247
you know, you have like string theory.

1717
01:09:25,247 --> 01:09:25,447
Yeah.

1718
01:09:25,447 --> 01:09:27,827
That- that's, that was, that was a leading candidate for many decades.

1719
01:09:27,827 --> 01:09:33,247
It's- I think it's slowly falling out of fashion because it's- it's not matching experiment

1720
01:09:33,247 --> 01:09:33,487
uh.

1721
01:09:33,487 --> 01:09:33,647
..

1722
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:34,947
So one of the big challenges, of course

1723
01:09:34,947 --> 01:09:38,407
like you said, is experiment is very tough- Yes.

1724
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:38,426
.

1725
01:09:38,426 --> 01:09:38,466
..

1726
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:41,087
because of the how effective- Yeah.

1727
01:09:41,087 --> 01:09:41,093
.

1728
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:41,107
..

1729
01:09:41,107 --> 01:09:41,886
both theories are.

1730
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,867
But the other is like just, you know

1731
01:09:45,867 --> 01:09:49,907
you're talking about you're not just deviating from space-time

1732
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:52,407
you're going into like some crazy number of dimensions.

1733
01:09:52,407 --> 01:09:52,527
Yeah.

1734
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:52,587
Yeah.

1735
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:55,299
You're doing all kinds of weird stuff that to us.

1736
01:09:55,299 --> 01:09:55,467
..

1737
01:09:55,467 --> 01:09:58,907
We've gone so far from this flat Earth that we started on- Yes.

1738
01:09:58,907 --> 01:09:58,907
.

1739
01:09:58,907 --> 01:09:58,907
.

1740
01:09:58,907 --> 01:09:59,707
like you mentioned.

1741
01:09:59,707 --> 01:09:59,887
Yeah.

1742
01:09:59,887 --> 01:10:00,287
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1743
01:10:00,287 --> 01:10:01,069
That now we're just.

1744
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:01,167
..

1745
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:05,207
It's- it's very hard to use our limited ape descendants of

1746
01:10:05,207 --> 01:10:10,327
uh, uh, cognition to intuit what that reality really is like.

1747
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:12,147
This is why analogies are so important, you know?

1748
01:10:12,147 --> 01:10:12,978
I mean, so yeah, when.

1749
01:10:12,978 --> 01:10:13,087
..

1750
01:10:13,087 --> 01:10:16,647
The round Earth is not intuitive because we're- we're stuck on it.

1751
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:18,827
Um, but, you know, but y- y- y- you know

1752
01:10:18,827 --> 01:10:20,967
but round objects in general, we have pretty good intuition

1753
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:23,867
a little bit, uh, and we have intuition about light works and so forth.

1754
01:10:23,867 --> 01:10:33,867
And like it's- it's actually a good exercise to actually work out how eclipses and phases of- of the sun and the moon and so forth can be really easily explained by- by- by- by round Earth and round moon

1755
01:10:33,867 --> 01:10:36,347
you know, um, and models.

1756
01:10:36,347 --> 01:10:38,167
Um, and- and you can just take

1757
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:43,287
you know, a basketball and a golf ball and- and- and- and a light source and actually do these things yourself.

1758
01:10:43,287 --> 01:10:45,587
Um, so the intuition is there, um

1759
01:10:45,587 --> 01:10:47,247
but yeah, you have to transfer it.

1760
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:51,480
That is a big leap intellectually for us to go from flat to round Earth-  .

1761
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:51,587
..

1762
01:10:51,587 --> 01:10:55,207
because, you know, our life is mostly lived in flat land.

1763
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:55,807
Yeah.

1764
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:57,059
To load that information in.

1765
01:10:57,059 --> 01:10:57,107
..

1766
01:10:57,107 --> 01:10:58,347
We're all like take it for granted.

1767
01:10:58,347 --> 01:11:03,387
We take so many things for granted because science has established a lot of evidence- Mm-hmm.

1768
01:11:03,387 --> 01:11:03,387
.

1769
01:11:03,387 --> 01:11:03,387
.

1770
01:11:03,387 --> 01:11:04,027
for this kind of thing.

1771
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:08,547
But, you know, we're on a r- ro- round rock - Yeah.

1772
01:11:08,547 --> 01:11:08,593
.

1773
01:11:08,593 --> 01:11:08,687
..

1774
01:11:08,687 --> 01:11:09,887
flying through space.

1775
01:11:09,887 --> 01:11:10,607
Yeah, yeah.

1776
01:11:10,607 --> 01:11:10,727
Yeah.

1777
01:11:10,727 --> 01:11:15,787
And it's a big leap and you have to take a chain of those leaps the more and more and more we progress.

1778
01:11:15,787 --> 01:11:16,207
Right.

1779
01:11:16,207 --> 01:11:16,467
Yeah.

1780
01:11:16,467 --> 01:11:19,027
So modern science is maybe again a victim of its own success

1781
01:11:19,027 --> 01:11:21,947
is that, you know, in order to be more accurate

1782
01:11:21,947 --> 01:11:24,807
it has to- to move further and further away from your initial intuition.

1783
01:11:24,807 --> 01:11:28,967
And so, um, for someone who hasn't gone through the whole process of science education

1784
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:30,687
it looks more and more sus- suspicious- Yeah.

1785
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:30,693
.

1786
01:11:30,693 --> 01:11:30,707
..

1787
01:11:30,707 --> 01:11:31,207
because of that.

1788
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:33,067
So, you know, we- we- we need

1789
01:11:33,067 --> 01:11:34,527
we need more grounding.

1790
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:35,623
I mean, I- I think, um.

1791
01:11:35,623 --> 01:11:35,727
..

1792
01:11:35,727 --> 01:11:38,227
I mean, you know, there are- there are scientists who do excellent outreach

1793
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:41,807
um, but there's- there's- there's- there's- there's lots of science things that you can do at home.

1794
01:11:41,807 --> 01:11:42,037
I- I.

1795
01:11:42,037 --> 01:11:42,047
..

1796
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,427
there's lots of YouTube videos.

1797
01:11:43,427 --> 01:11:45,667
I did a YouTube video recently with Grant Sandeson

1798
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:47,147
we talked about this earlier, that, uh

1799
01:11:47,147 --> 01:11:50,667
you know, how- how the ancient Greeks were able to measure things like the distance of the moon

1800
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:52,307
distance of the Earth, and, you know

1801
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:55,287
using techniques that you c- you could also replicate yourself.

1802
01:11:55,287 --> 01:12:00,987
Um, it doesn't all have to be like fancy space telescopes and- and very intimidating mathematics.

1803
01:12:00,987 --> 01:12:01,607
Yeah.

1804
01:12:01,607 --> 01:12:02,011
That's, uh.

1805
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:02,067
..

1806
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,227
I highly recommend that.

1807
01:12:03,227 --> 01:12:07,527
I believe you give a lecture and you also did an incredible video with Grant.

1808
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:12,667
It's a beautiful experience to try to put yourself in the mind of a person from that time- Mm-hmm.

1809
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:12,747
.

1810
01:12:12,747 --> 01:12:12,907
..

1811
01:12:12,907 --> 01:12:14,827
shrouded in mystery.

1812
01:12:14,827 --> 01:12:15,507
Right.

1813
01:12:15,507 --> 01:12:17,747
You know, you're like on this planet.

1814
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:20,307
You don't know the shape of it, the size of it.

1815
01:12:20,307 --> 01:12:22,367
You see some stars, you see some

1816
01:12:22,367 --> 01:12:25,607
you see some things and you try to like localize yourself in this world- Yeah

1817
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:25,867
yeah.

1818
01:12:25,867 --> 01:12:25,880
.

1819
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:25,907
..

1820
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:29,507
and try to make some kind of general statements about distance to places.

1821
01:12:29,507 --> 01:12:31,007
Change of perspective is really important.

1822
01:12:31,007 --> 01:12:32,707
They say travel broadens the mind, right?

1823
01:12:32,707 --> 01:12:34,087
This is intellectual travel, you know.

1824
01:12:34,087 --> 01:12:37,528
Put yourself in the mind of- of the ancient Greeks or- or some other-.

1825
01:12:37,528 --> 01:12:37,655
..

1826
01:12:37,655 --> 01:12:39,955
person from some other time period, make hypotheses

1827
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,455
spherical cows, whatever- Mm-hmm.

1828
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:41,482
.

1829
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:41,536
..

1830
01:12:41,536 --> 01:12:42,815
you know, speculate.

1831
01:12:42,815 --> 01:12:46,375
Um, and you know, this is- this is what mathematicians do

1832
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,115
and some art- you know, sort of artists do

1833
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:48,395
actually.

1834
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:51,235
It's just incredible that given the extreme constraints

1835
01:12:51,235 --> 01:12:53,455
you can still say very powerful things.

1836
01:12:53,455 --> 01:12:54,755
That's why it's inspiring.

1837
01:12:54,755 --> 01:12:58,976
Looking back in history, how much can be figured out- Right.

1838
01:12:58,976 --> 01:12:59,009
.

1839
01:12:59,009 --> 01:12:59,076
..

1840
01:12:59,076 --> 01:13:01,836
when you don't have much to figure out stuff with.

1841
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:04,136
Right, well if you propose axioms, then the mathematics lets you

1842
01:13:04,136 --> 01:13:06,015
you know, follow those axioms to- to their conclusions

1843
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:08,495
and sometimes you can get quite a long way from

1844
01:13:08,495 --> 01:13:10,215
you know, initial hypotheses.

1845
01:13:10,215 --> 01:13:11,736
If we're gonna stay in the land of the weird

1846
01:13:11,736 --> 01:13:13,235
you mentioned general relativity.

1847
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:16,055
You've, uh,  you've contributed, uh

1848
01:13:16,055 --> 01:13:18,955
to the mathematical understanding of Einstein's field equations.

1849
01:13:18,955 --> 01:13:21,556
Can you explain this work, and, uh

1850
01:13:21,556 --> 01:13:24,535
from a sort of mathematical standpoint, uh

1851
01:13:24,535 --> 01:13:29,335
wh- what aspects of general relativity are intriguing to you

1852
01:13:29,335 --> 01:13:30,755
challenging to you?

1853
01:13:30,755 --> 01:13:33,475
I have worked on some equations.

1854
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,175
There's something called the- the wave maps equation

1855
01:13:35,175 --> 01:13:40,755
or the sigma field model, which is not quite the equation of spacetime gravity itself

1856
01:13:40,755 --> 01:13:44,975
but of certain fields that might exist on top of spacetime.

1857
01:13:44,975 --> 01:13:49,856
Um, so Einstein's equations of relativity just describes space and time itself

1858
01:13:49,856 --> 01:13:52,436
um, but then there's other fields that live on top of that.

1859
01:13:52,436 --> 01:13:56,095
Uh, there's the e- electromagnetic field, there's things called Yang-Mills fields

1860
01:13:56,095 --> 01:13:59,015
and there's this whole hierarchy of different equations

1861
01:13:59,015 --> 01:14:01,975
of which Einstein's is considered one of the most non-linear and difficult

1862
01:14:01,975 --> 01:14:05,935
but relatively low on the hierarchy was this thing called the wave maps equation.

1863
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:08,795
So it's a wave which, at any given point

1864
01:14:08,795 --> 01:14:10,876
uh, is fixed to be like on a sphere.

1865
01:14:10,876 --> 01:14:15,316
Um, so, uh, like think of a bunch of arrows in space and time

1866
01:14:15,316 --> 01:14:18,135
and- and- and yeah, so it's pointing in- in different directions

1867
01:14:18,135 --> 01:14:20,235
um, but they propagate like waves.

1868
01:14:20,235 --> 01:14:24,715
If- if- if you wiggle an arrow, it will- it will propagate and- and make all the arrows move kind of like

1869
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:26,815
uh, sheaves of wheat in a wheat field.

1870
01:14:26,815 --> 01:14:31,356
And I was interested in the global regularity problem again for this ques- like

1871
01:14:31,356 --> 01:14:34,775
is it possible for- for all the energy here to- to collect at a point?

1872
01:14:34,775 --> 01:14:38,275
So the equation I considered was actually what's called a critical equation

1873
01:14:38,275 --> 01:14:41,315
where it's actually the behavior at all scales is roughly the same

1874
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:44,775
um, and I was able barely to show that- um

1875
01:14:44,775 --> 01:14:48,655
that you couldn't actually force a scenario where all the energy concentrated at one point

1876
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:50,875
that the energy w- I had to dismiss a little bit

1877
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:52,615
and the moment it disappeared a little- a little bit

1878
01:14:52,615 --> 01:14:54,175
it would- it would- it would stay regular.

1879
01:14:54,175 --> 01:14:55,975
Yeah, this was back in 2000.

1880
01:14:55,975 --> 01:14:58,195
That was part of why I got interested in Navier-Stokes afterwards

1881
01:14:58,195 --> 01:14:58,675
actually.

1882
01:14:58,675 --> 01:15:01,535
Yeah, so I developed some techniques to

1883
01:15:01,535 --> 01:15:02,915
um, solve that problem.

1884
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,775
So part of it is- it- it was

1885
01:15:04,775 --> 01:15:06,555
um, this problem is really non-linear, uh

1886
01:15:06,555 --> 01:15:08,395
because of the curvature of the sphere, um

1887
01:15:08,395 --> 01:15:12,575
there's- there was a certain non-linear effect, which was a non-perturbative effect.

1888
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,695
It was, when you sort of looked at it normally

1889
01:15:14,695 --> 01:15:17,895
it- it looked larger than the linear effects of the wave eq- equation

1890
01:15:17,895 --> 01:15:21,415
um, and so it was hard to- to keep things under control

1891
01:15:21,415 --> 01:15:23,195
even when the energy was small.

1892
01:15:23,195 --> 01:15:25,655
But I developed what's called a gauge transformation.

1893
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:29,695
So the equation is kind of like an evolution of- of- of sheaves of wheat

1894
01:15:29,695 --> 01:15:31,335
and- and they're all bending back and forth

1895
01:15:31,335 --> 01:15:33,375
and so there's a lot of motion, um

1896
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:38,415
but like if you imagine like stabilizing the flow by attaching little cameras at different points in space

1897
01:15:38,415 --> 01:15:41,735
which are trying to move in a way that captures most of the motion

1898
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:45,955
and under the sort of stabilized flow, the flow becomes a lot more linear.

1899
01:15:45,955 --> 01:15:52,655
I discovered a way to transform the- the equation to reduce the amount of non-linear effects

1900
01:15:52,655 --> 01:15:55,875
um, and then I was able to- to- to- to solve the equation.

1901
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:59,235
I found this transformation while visiting my aunt in Australia

1902
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:02,375
and I was trying to understand the dynamics of all these fields

1903
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:04,035
and I- I couldn't do it with pen and paper

1904
01:16:04,035 --> 01:16:07,995
um, and I hadn't non-officialated computers to- to do any computer simulations.

1905
01:16:07,995 --> 01:16:11,395
So I ended up closing my eyes, being on- on the floor

1906
01:16:11,395 --> 01:16:14,375
and just imagining myself to actually be this vector field

1907
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:21,875
and rolling around to try to- to see how to change coordinates in such a way that somehow things in all directions would behave in a reasonably linear fashion.

1908
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:25,135
And, uh, yeah, my aunt walked in on- on me while I was doing that

1909
01:16:25,135 --> 01:16:27,595
and she was asking what did I- why am I doing- doing this.

1910
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:29,895
Um- It's complicated is the answer.

1911
01:16:29,895 --> 01:16:30,315
Yeah, yeah.

1912
01:16:30,315 --> 01:16:31,615
 And, you know, she went, "Okay

1913
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:31,915
fine.

1914
01:16:31,915 --> 01:16:32,635
You know, you're a young man.

1915
01:16:32,635 --> 01:16:33,525
I don't ask questions.

1916
01:16:33,525 --> 01:16:36,015
" I- I- I have to ask about the

1917
01:16:36,015 --> 01:16:40,655
you know, um, how do you approach solving difficult problems?

1918
01:16:40,655 --> 01:16:40,983
What.

1919
01:16:40,983 --> 01:16:41,115
..

1920
01:16:41,115 --> 01:16:47,155
If it's possible to go inside your mind when you're thinking

1921
01:16:47,155 --> 01:16:52,295
are you visualizing in your mind the mathematical objects

1922
01:16:52,295 --> 01:16:53,315
symbols maybe?

1923
01:16:53,315 --> 01:16:57,075
What are you visualizing in your mind usually when you're thinking?

1924
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:58,315
Um, a lot of pen and paper.

1925
01:16:58,315 --> 01:17:01,195
One thing you pick up as a mathematician is sort of

1926
01:17:01,195 --> 01:17:03,155
uh, I call it cheating strategically.

1927
01:17:03,155 --> 01:17:09,055
Um, so, uh, the- the beauty of mathematics is that- is that you get to change the ru- change the problem

1928
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:10,815
change the rules as you wish, uh

1929
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:13,535
because you don't get to do this for any other field.

1930
01:17:13,535 --> 01:17:15,615
Like, you know, if- if you're an engineer and someone says

1931
01:17:15,615 --> 01:17:17,595
"Build a bridge over this- this river," you can't say

1932
01:17:17,595 --> 01:17:19,117
"I want to build this- a bridge over here instead

1933
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,335
" or, "I want to build it out of paper in- instead of steel.

1934
01:17:21,335 --> 01:17:24,415
" Um, but a mathematician, you can- you can do whatever you want.

1935
01:17:24,415 --> 01:17:29,881
Um, it's- it's like trying to solve a computer game where you can.

1936
01:17:29,881 --> 01:17:29,975
..

1937
01:17:29,975 --> 01:17:33,515
there's unlimited cheat codes available, uh, and so

1938
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:35,666
you know, you- you can- you can set this.

1939
01:17:35,666 --> 01:17:35,775
..

1940
01:17:35,775 --> 01:17:36,105
uh, so I.

1941
01:17:36,105 --> 01:17:36,175
..

1942
01:17:36,175 --> 01:17:38,835
there's a dimension that's too large, I'll set it to one.

1943
01:17:38,835 --> 01:17:40,055
I'll solve the one-dimensional problem first.

1944
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:42,255
Or there's a main term and an error term

1945
01:17:42,255 --> 01:17:45,155
I'm gonna make a spherical cow assumption, I- I'll assume the error term is zero.

1946
01:17:45,155 --> 01:17:50,795
And so the way you should solve these problems is- is not in sort of this Iron Man mode where you make things maximally difficult

1947
01:17:50,795 --> 01:17:54,795
um, but actually, uh, the way you should- you should approach

1948
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,968
um, uh, any reasonable math problem is that you.

1949
01:17:56,968 --> 01:17:57,055
..

1950
01:17:57,055 --> 01:17:59,655
if- if there- if there are 10 things that are making your life difficult

1951
01:17:59,655 --> 01:18:02,455
find a version of the problem that turns off nine of the difficulties

1952
01:18:02,455 --> 01:18:04,155
but only keeps one of them, um

1953
01:18:04,155 --> 01:18:05,375
and solve that.

1954
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:07,435
Um, and then that just figures.

1955
01:18:07,435 --> 01:18:07,495
..

1956
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:09,415
so you- you- you install nine cheats.

1957
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:11,275
Okay, if you install 10 cheats, then- then the game is trivial

1958
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:13,355
but you install nine cheats, you solve one problem

1959
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:16,855
that- that- that- that- that teaches you how to deal with that particular difficulty.

1960
01:18:16,855 --> 01:18:19,855
And then you turn that one off, and you turn someone else- something else on

1961
01:18:19,855 --> 01:18:20,755
and then you solve that one.

1962
01:18:20,755 --> 01:18:24,295
And after you- you know how to solve the 10 problems- 10 difficulties separately

1963
01:18:24,295 --> 01:18:26,815
then you have to start merging them a- a few at a time.

1964
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,035
Um, I- I.

1965
01:18:29,035 --> 01:18:29,095
..

1966
01:18:29,095 --> 01:18:31,875
as a kid, I watched a lot of these Hong Kong action movies.

1967
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,795
Um, you know, it's s- it's part of my culture.

1968
01:18:33,795 --> 01:18:37,515
Um, and, uh, one thing is that every time it's a fight scene

1969
01:18:37,515 --> 01:18:40,265
you know, so maybe the- the hero gets swarmed by 100.

1970
01:18:40,265 --> 01:18:40,440
..

1971
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:40,615
..

1972
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:41,963
. bad guy, goons, whatever.

1973
01:18:41,963 --> 01:18:44,423
But it would always be choreographed so that he'd only be

1974
01:18:44,423 --> 01:18:47,504
only fighting one person at a time, and then he would defeat that person and move on.

1975
01:18:47,504 --> 01:18:49,543
And, and because of that, he could

1976
01:18:49,543 --> 01:18:50,663
he could defeat all of them.

1977
01:18:50,663 --> 01:18:50,924
Right?

1978
01:18:50,924 --> 01:18:55,563
But whereas if they had fought a bit more intelligently and just swarmed the guy all at once

1979
01:18:55,563 --> 01:18:57,603
uh, it would make for much, uh

1980
01:18:57,603 --> 01:18:59,884
much worse choreo- um, cinema, but, uh

1981
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:01,343
but they would win.

1982
01:19:01,343 --> 01:19:04,763
 Are you usually, uh, pen and paper?

1983
01:19:04,763 --> 01:19:07,563
Are you working, uh, with computer latex?

1984
01:19:07,563 --> 01:19:09,643
I'm mostly pen and paper actually.

1985
01:19:09,643 --> 01:19:12,544
So in, in my office I have four giant blackboards.

1986
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:20,143
Um, and sometimes I just have to write everything I know about the problem on the four blackboards and then sit on my couch and just sort of see the whole thing.

1987
01:19:20,143 --> 01:19:23,763
Is it all symbols like notation or is there some drawings?

1988
01:19:23,763 --> 01:19:26,623
Oh, there's a lot of drawing and a lot of bespoke doodles that

1989
01:19:26,623 --> 01:19:28,063
that only make sense to me.

1990
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:32,563
Um, I mean, and, and that's the beauty of blackboard is you can erase and it's

1991
01:19:32,563 --> 01:19:34,083
it's, it's very organic thing.

1992
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:36,563
Um, I'm beginning to use more and more computers.

1993
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:41,083
Um, partly because AI makes it much easier to do simple coding things that

1994
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:43,623
you know, if I wanted to plot a function before

1995
01:19:43,623 --> 01:19:45,523
which is moderately complicated as some iteration or something

1996
01:19:45,523 --> 01:19:48,763
you know, I'd had to, to remember how to set up a Python program and

1997
01:19:48,763 --> 01:19:51,063
and, and, and, and how does a full loop work and

1998
01:19:51,063 --> 01:19:53,783
and debug it and it would've taken two hours and so forth.

1999
01:19:53,783 --> 01:19:55,323
And, and now I can do it in 10

2000
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:56,903
15 minutes as, as much.

2001
01:19:56,903 --> 01:19:58,863
Um, yeah, I'm, I'm using more and more

2002
01:19:58,863 --> 01:20:00,343
uh, computers to do simple ex- uh

2003
01:20:00,343 --> 01:20:01,003
explorations.

2004
01:20:01,003 --> 01:20:04,203
Let's talk about AI a l- a little bit if we could.

2005
01:20:04,203 --> 01:20:10,043
So, um, maybe a good entry point is just talking about computer assisted proofs in general.

2006
01:20:10,043 --> 01:20:23,403
Can you describe the lean formal proof programming language and how it can help as a proof assistant and maybe how you started using it and how

2007
01:20:23,403 --> 01:20:25,103
uh, it has helped you?

2008
01:20:25,103 --> 01:20:28,063
So, um, Lean is a computer language

2009
01:20:28,063 --> 01:20:32,383
um, much like sort of standard languages like Python and C and so forth

2010
01:20:32,383 --> 01:20:36,823
except that in most languages the focus is on producing executable code.

2011
01:20:36,823 --> 01:20:38,783
Lines of code do things, you know

2012
01:20:38,783 --> 01:20:41,263
they, they flip bits or, or they make a robot move or

2013
01:20:41,263 --> 01:20:43,643
or they, they deliver you text on the internet or something.

2014
01:20:43,643 --> 01:20:47,243
Um, so Lean is a language that can also do that.

2015
01:20:47,243 --> 01:20:49,223
Uh, it can also be run as a standard

2016
01:20:49,223 --> 01:20:52,643
uh, traditional language, but it can also produce certificates.

2017
01:20:52,643 --> 01:20:57,083
So a software language like, like Python might do a computation and give you the answer as seven.

2018
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:57,363
Okay.

2019
01:20:57,363 --> 01:20:59,223
Does the sum of three plus four is equal to seven.

2020
01:20:59,223 --> 01:21:02,123
But, uh, Lean can produce not just the answer

2021
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:05,083
but, but a proof that, uh, how it got the

2022
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,523
the answer of seven as three plus four

2023
01:21:06,523 --> 01:21:09,203
a-a-and all the steps involved in, in

2024
01:21:09,203 --> 01:21:09,867
in, in, um.

2025
01:21:09,867 --> 01:21:09,923
..

2026
01:21:09,923 --> 01:21:12,803
so it, so it creates these more complicated objects

2027
01:21:12,803 --> 01:21:15,463
not just statements, but statements with proofs attached to them.

2028
01:21:15,463 --> 01:21:21,183
Um, and, um, every line of code is just a way of pre- piecing together previous statements to

2029
01:21:21,183 --> 01:21:22,003
to create new ones.

2030
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:23,683
So the idea is not new.

2031
01:21:23,683 --> 01:21:25,463
These things are ca- are called proof assistants.

2032
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:29,423
And so they provide languages for which you c- you can create quite complicated

2033
01:21:29,423 --> 01:21:33,603
um, intricate mathematical proofs and, um, they produce these certificates that

2034
01:21:33,603 --> 01:21:40,083
that give a 100%, um, guarantee that your arguments are correct if you trust the compiler of Lean.

2035
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:42,723
But they made the compiler really small and you can.

2036
01:21:42,723 --> 01:21:42,823
..

2037
01:21:42,823 --> 01:21:44,323
there are several different compilers available for the same

2038
01:21:44,323 --> 01:21:47,103
like Can you give people some intuition about the

2039
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:52,903
the difference between writing on pen and paper versus using Lean programming language?

2040
01:21:52,903 --> 01:21:55,743
How hard is it to formalize- Right.

2041
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:55,749
.

2042
01:21:55,749 --> 01:21:55,763
..

2043
01:21:55,763 --> 01:21:56,263
a statement?

2044
01:21:56,263 --> 01:21:59,923
So Lean, a lot of mathematicians were involved in the design of Lean.

2045
01:21:59,923 --> 01:22:02,543
So it's, it's designed so that, um

2046
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:06,423
individual lines of code resemble individual lines of mathematical argument.

2047
01:22:06,423 --> 01:22:07,943
Like you might want to introduce a variable

2048
01:22:07,943 --> 01:22:09,983
you might want to proof by contradiction, you

2049
01:22:09,983 --> 01:22:10,615
you're, um.

2050
01:22:10,615 --> 01:22:10,783
..

2051
01:22:10,783 --> 01:22:13,383
There are various standard things that you can do and

2052
01:22:13,383 --> 01:22:16,603
and it's, it's written so that ideally it should be like a one-to-one correspondence.

2053
01:22:16,603 --> 01:22:23,703
In practice, it isn't because Lean is like explaining a proof to an extremely pedantic colleague who will-  .

2054
01:22:23,703 --> 01:22:23,703
..

2055
01:22:23,703 --> 01:22:25,363
will point out, "Okay, did you really mean this?

2056
01:22:25,363 --> 01:22:26,803
Like what, what happens if this is zero?

2057
01:22:26,803 --> 01:22:27,143
Okay.

2058
01:22:27,143 --> 01:22:27,876
Um, did you.

2059
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:27,923
..

2060
01:22:27,923 --> 01:22:28,983
how do you justify this?

2061
01:22:28,983 --> 01:22:32,403
" Um, so Lean has a lot of automation in it

2062
01:22:32,403 --> 01:22:34,403
um, to try to, to, uh

2063
01:22:34,403 --> 01:22:35,423
to be less annoying.

2064
01:22:35,423 --> 01:22:39,323
Um, so for example, um, every mathematical object has to come with a type.

2065
01:22:39,323 --> 01:22:41,023
Like if I, if I, I talk about X

2066
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:43,083
is X a real number or, um

2067
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:46,363
a, a, a natural number or, or a function or something?

2068
01:22:46,363 --> 01:22:49,223
Um, if, if you write things informally

2069
01:22:49,223 --> 01:22:51,483
um, it's often in terms of context.

2070
01:22:51,483 --> 01:22:54,163
You say, you know, um, "Clearly X is equal to.

2071
01:22:54,163 --> 01:22:54,323
..

2072
01:22:54,323 --> 01:22:56,223
uh, let X be the sum of Y and Z

2073
01:22:56,223 --> 01:22:57,543
and Y and Z were already real numbers.

2074
01:22:57,543 --> 01:22:59,333
So X should also be a real number.

2075
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:01,423
" Um, so Lean can do a lot of that.

2076
01:23:01,423 --> 01:23:03,123
Um, but every so often it, it says

2077
01:23:03,123 --> 01:23:03,623
"Wait a minute.

2078
01:23:03,623 --> 01:23:05,883
Can you tell me more about what this object is

2079
01:23:05,883 --> 01:23:07,623
uh, what type of object it is?

2080
01:23:07,623 --> 01:23:07,963
" You see?

2081
01:23:07,963 --> 01:23:13,543
You have to think more, um, at a philosophical level about not just sort of computations that you're doing

2082
01:23:13,543 --> 01:23:15,923
but sort of what each object actually, um

2083
01:23:15,923 --> 01:23:17,423
is in some sense.

2084
01:23:17,423 --> 01:23:20,363
Is it using something like LMS to do

2085
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:23,283
uh, the type inference or like you mentioned with the real number?

2086
01:23:23,283 --> 01:23:26,583
It's, it's using much more traditional, what's called good old fashioned AI.

2087
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:30,683
You can represent all these things as trees and there's always algorithm to ma- match one tree to another tree.

2088
01:23:30,683 --> 01:23:33,763
So it's actually doable to figure out if something is a

2089
01:23:33,763 --> 01:23:35,863
a real number or- Yeah.

2090
01:23:35,863 --> 01:23:35,929
.

2091
01:23:35,929 --> 01:23:36,063
..

2092
01:23:36,063 --> 01:23:36,723
a natural number?

2093
01:23:36,723 --> 01:23:36,943
Yeah.

2094
01:23:36,943 --> 01:23:39,363
Every object sort of comes with a history of where it came from and you can

2095
01:23:39,363 --> 01:23:40,983
you can kind of trace- Oh, I see.

2096
01:23:40,983 --> 01:23:41,143
Okay.

2097
01:23:41,143 --> 01:23:41,923
Um, yeah.

2098
01:23:41,923 --> 01:23:43,763
So it's, it's, it's designed for reliability.

2099
01:23:43,763 --> 01:23:46,979
So, uh, modern AIs are not used in.

2100
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:47,203
..

2101
01:23:47,203 --> 01:23:48,243
it's a disjoint technology.

2102
01:23:48,243 --> 01:23:50,943
People are beginning to use AIs on top of Lean.

2103
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:53,243
So when a mathematician tries to program, um

2104
01:23:53,243 --> 01:23:55,923
a proof in, in Lean, um, often there's a step

2105
01:23:55,923 --> 01:23:57,663
"Okay, now I want to use, um

2106
01:23:57,663 --> 01:23:59,723
the fundamental theorem calculus to say, okay

2107
01:23:59,723 --> 01:24:00,476
to do the next step.

2108
01:24:00,476 --> 01:24:03,023
" So the Lean developers have built this

2109
01:24:03,023 --> 01:24:08,923
this massive project called MathLib, a collection of tens of thousands of useful facts about mathematical objects.

2110
01:24:08,923 --> 01:24:11,763
And somewhere in there is the fundamental theorem calculus

2111
01:24:11,763 --> 01:24:12,963
but you need to find it.

2112
01:24:12,963 --> 01:24:16,103
So a lot of the bottleneck now is actually Lemma search.

2113
01:24:16,103 --> 01:24:17,283
You know, there's a tool that, that

2114
01:24:17,283 --> 01:24:20,903
you know, is in there somewhere and you need to find it.

2115
01:24:20,903 --> 01:24:22,103
Um, and so you can.

2116
01:24:22,103 --> 01:24:22,183
..

2117
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:24,883
there are various search engines specialized for MathLib that you can do.

2118
01:24:24,883 --> 01:24:27,743
Um, but there's now these large language models that you can say

2119
01:24:27,743 --> 01:24:29,988
"Look, um, I need the fundamental calculus at this point

2120
01:24:29,988 --> 01:24:31,983
" and it's like, okay, uh, um

2121
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:40,443
for example, when I code I have GitHub Copilot installed as a plug-in to my IDE and it scans my text and it sees what I need.

2122
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:41,163
It says, you know.

2123
01:24:41,163 --> 01:24:41,243
..

2124
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:43,877
I might even type, "Okay, now I need to use the fundamental theorem calculus.

2125
01:24:43,877 --> 01:24:44,183
" Okay.

2126
01:24:44,183 --> 01:24:45,963
And then it, it might suggest, "Okay

2127
01:24:45,963 --> 01:24:49,083
try this," and like maybe 25% of the time it works exactly.

2128
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:50,369
And then another-.

2129
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:50,553
..

2130
01:24:50,553 --> 01:24:52,334
10, 50% of the time it doesn't quite work but

2131
01:24:52,334 --> 01:24:53,933
it- it's close enough that I can say

2132
01:24:53,933 --> 01:24:55,354
"Oh yeah, if I just change it here and here

2133
01:24:55,354 --> 01:24:56,039
it will, it will work.

2134
01:24:56,039 --> 01:24:58,233
" And then like half the time it gives me complete rubbish.

2135
01:24:58,233 --> 01:25:02,633
Um, so but people are beginning to use AIs a little bit on top.

2136
01:25:02,633 --> 01:25:06,193
Um, uh, mostly on the level of fancy auto-complete.

2137
01:25:06,193 --> 01:25:10,593
Um, that, uh, you can type half or one line of a proof and it will find

2138
01:25:10,593 --> 01:25:11,353
it will tell you- Yeah.

2139
01:25:11,353 --> 01:25:14,933
But what a fancy, especially Fancy with a sort of capital letter effort has

2140
01:25:14,933 --> 01:25:18,533
uh, uh, removed some of the friction- Yeah.

2141
01:25:18,533 --> 01:25:18,540
.

2142
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:18,554
..

2143
01:25:18,554 --> 01:25:23,513
a mathematician might feel when they move from pen and paper to formalizing.

2144
01:25:23,513 --> 01:25:24,193
Yes, yeah.

2145
01:25:24,193 --> 01:25:26,413
So right now I estimate that the effort

2146
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:29,794
time and effort taken to formalize a proof is about 10 times the amount taken to

2147
01:25:29,794 --> 01:25:30,474
to write it out.

2148
01:25:30,474 --> 01:25:34,538
Yeah, so it's doable but, uh, you don't.

2149
01:25:34,538 --> 01:25:34,653
..

2150
01:25:34,653 --> 01:25:35,953
It's, it's annoying.

2151
01:25:35,953 --> 01:25:39,353
But doesn't it like kill the whole vibe of being a mathematician- Yeah.

2152
01:25:39,353 --> 01:25:40,539
 Just- So I mean- .

2153
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:40,593
..

2154
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:42,193
having a pedantic co-worker?

2155
01:25:42,193 --> 01:25:43,273
 Right, yeah.

2156
01:25:43,273 --> 01:25:44,733
If, if that was the only aspect of it

2157
01:25:44,733 --> 01:25:45,093
okay.

2158
01:25:45,093 --> 01:25:47,353
But, um, okay, there, there are some

2159
01:25:47,353 --> 01:25:49,953
there, there are some cases where it's actually more pleasant to do things formally.

2160
01:25:49,953 --> 01:25:53,393
So th- there was, there was a theorem I formalized and there was a certain constant 12

2161
01:25:53,393 --> 01:25:55,093
um, that, that came up, uh

2162
01:25:55,093 --> 01:25:58,513
at, um, in, in the final statement and so this 12 had to be carried all through the proof

2163
01:25:58,513 --> 01:26:00,793
um, and like everything had to checked.

2164
01:26:00,793 --> 01:26:02,033
They'd, it goes, uh, all the

2165
01:26:02,033 --> 01:26:05,013
there are all these other numbers that had to be consistent with this final number 12.

2166
01:26:05,013 --> 01:26:09,373
And then, so we wrote a paper between this theorem with this number 12 and then a few weeks later

2167
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:12,915
someone said, "Oh, we can actually improve this 12 to an 11 by reworking s- some of these steps.

2168
01:26:12,915 --> 01:26:15,073
" And when this happens with pen and paper

2169
01:26:15,073 --> 01:26:17,073
um, like every time you change a parameter

2170
01:26:17,073 --> 01:26:20,633
you have to check line by line that every single line of your proof still works

2171
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:22,993
and there can be subtle things that you didn't quite realize.

2172
01:26:22,993 --> 01:26:26,353
Some properties on number 12 that you didn't even realize that you were taking advantage of.

2173
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:28,473
So a proof can break down at a subtle place.

2174
01:26:28,473 --> 01:26:32,833
Um, so we had formalized the proof with this constant 12 and then when this

2175
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:34,293
this new paper came out, uh, we said

2176
01:26:34,293 --> 01:26:34,593
"Okay.

2177
01:26:34,593 --> 01:26:34,873
Let's.

2178
01:26:34,873 --> 01:26:34,966
..

2179
01:26:34,966 --> 01:26:37,293
" Uh, so that took like three weeks to formalize

2180
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:39,413
uh, and, and like 20 people to formalize this

2181
01:26:39,413 --> 01:26:40,413
this, this original proof.

2182
01:26:40,413 --> 01:26:42,653
So, oh, but n- now let's, let's

2183
01:26:42,653 --> 01:26:47,753
um, uh, uh, let's update the 12 to 11 and what you can do with Lean is that you just

2184
01:26:47,753 --> 01:26:50,073
in your headline theorem, you, you change your 12 to an 11

2185
01:26:50,073 --> 01:26:53,793
you run the compiler, and like of the thousands of lines of code you have

2186
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:57,653
90% of them still work and there's a couple that are lined in red.

2187
01:26:57,653 --> 01:27:01,713
Now I can't justify these, these steps but it immediately isolates which steps you need to change.

2188
01:27:01,713 --> 01:27:04,113
But you can skip over everything which, which works just fine.

2189
01:27:04,113 --> 01:27:06,613
Um, and if you program things correctly

2190
01:27:06,613 --> 01:27:10,313
um, with good programming practices, most of your lines will not be red

2191
01:27:10,313 --> 01:27:13,139
um, and there'll just be a few places where you.

2192
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:13,273
..

2193
01:27:13,273 --> 01:27:15,873
I mean, if, if you don't hard code your constants but you sort of

2194
01:27:15,873 --> 01:27:16,513
uh- Mm-hmm.

2195
01:27:16,513 --> 01:27:16,613
.

2196
01:27:16,613 --> 01:27:16,813
..

2197
01:27:16,813 --> 01:27:19,153
um, um, y- you use smart tactics and so forth

2198
01:27:19,153 --> 01:27:22,633
yeah, y- you can localize, um, the things you need to change to

2199
01:27:22,633 --> 01:27:24,573
to a, a very small, um, period of time.

2200
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:25,813
So it's like within a day or two

2201
01:27:25,813 --> 01:27:27,901
we had updated our proof to have.

2202
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:27,953
..

2203
01:27:27,953 --> 01:27:29,673
'Cause this is a very quick process, you know.

2204
01:27:29,673 --> 01:27:32,953
Um, you make a change, there are 10 things now that don't work.

2205
01:27:32,953 --> 01:27:34,513
For each one, you make a change

2206
01:27:34,513 --> 01:27:35,873
another five more things that don't work but

2207
01:27:35,873 --> 01:27:40,153
but the process converges much more smoothly than with pen and paper.

2208
01:27:40,153 --> 01:27:41,373
So that's for writing.

2209
01:27:41,373 --> 01:27:42,353
Are you able to read it?

2210
01:27:42,353 --> 01:27:44,544
Like if somebody else sends a proof, are you able to like.

2211
01:27:44,544 --> 01:27:44,653
..

2212
01:27:44,653 --> 01:27:48,533
How, what's, what's the, uh, versus paper and- Yeah.

2213
01:27:48,533 --> 01:27:53,113
So the proofs are longer but each individual piece is easier to read.

2214
01:27:53,113 --> 01:28:01,513
So, um, if you take a math paper and you jump to page 27 and you look at paragraph six and y- you have a line of text of math

2215
01:28:01,513 --> 01:28:04,753
I often can't read it immediately because it

2216
01:28:04,753 --> 01:28:06,813
it assumes various definitions which I have to

2217
01:28:06,813 --> 01:28:10,633
to go back and, and maybe on ten pages earlier this was defined and there's the

2218
01:28:10,633 --> 01:28:14,553
um, the proof is scattered all over the place and you basically are forced to read fairly sequentially.

2219
01:28:14,553 --> 01:28:17,693
Um, it's, it's not like say a novel where like

2220
01:28:17,693 --> 01:28:18,853
you know, in a theory you could

2221
01:28:18,853 --> 01:28:21,153
you know, open up a novel halfway through and start reading.

2222
01:28:21,153 --> 01:28:22,373
There's a lot of context.

2223
01:28:22,373 --> 01:28:25,653
But with Lean, if you put your cursor on a line of code

2224
01:28:25,653 --> 01:28:28,333
every single object there, you can hover over it and it would

2225
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:29,993
it would say what it is, where it came from

2226
01:28:29,993 --> 01:28:31,513
wh- whether something's justified.

2227
01:28:31,513 --> 01:28:34,893
You can trace things back much easier than sort of flipping through a math paper.

2228
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:42,013
So one thing that Lean really enables is actually collaborating on proofs at a really atomic scale that you really couldn't do in the past.

2229
01:28:42,013 --> 01:28:44,193
So traditionally with pen and paper, um

2230
01:28:44,193 --> 01:28:46,453
when you want to collaborate with another mathematician

2231
01:28:46,453 --> 01:28:48,853
um, either you do it at a blackboard where you

2232
01:28:48,853 --> 01:28:52,353
um, you can really interact, but if you're doing it sort of by email or something

2233
01:28:52,353 --> 01:28:54,833
um, basically, yeah, you have to segment it.

2234
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:56,893
Say I'm gonna, I'm gonna finish section three

2235
01:28:56,893 --> 01:29:00,813
you do section four but, uh, you can't really sort of work on the same thing

2236
01:29:00,813 --> 01:29:02,513
uh, collaboratively at the same time.

2237
01:29:02,513 --> 01:29:06,293
But with Lean, you can be trying to formalize some portion of the proof and say

2238
01:29:06,293 --> 01:29:08,433
"Oh, I got stuck at line 67 here

2239
01:29:08,433 --> 01:29:09,853
I need to prove this thing but it

2240
01:29:09,853 --> 01:29:10,693
it doesn't quite work.

2241
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:12,879
Here's the, like the three lines of code I'm having trouble with.

2242
01:29:12,879 --> 01:29:14,853
" Um, but because all the context is there

2243
01:29:14,853 --> 01:29:17,493
someone else can say, "Oh, okay, I recognize what you need to do.

2244
01:29:17,493 --> 01:29:19,816
You need to, to do, to apply this trick or this tool

2245
01:29:19,816 --> 01:29:22,873
" and you can do extremely atomic level conversations.

2246
01:29:22,873 --> 01:29:25,093
So because of Lean, I can collaborate

2247
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,873
you know, with dozens of people across the world

2248
01:29:27,873 --> 01:29:28,568
most of whom I don't.

2249
01:29:28,568 --> 01:29:28,633
..

2250
01:29:28,633 --> 01:29:31,246
have never met in person, um, and I'm.

2251
01:29:31,246 --> 01:29:31,373
..

2252
01:29:31,373 --> 01:29:33,137
may not know actually even whether they're.

2253
01:29:33,137 --> 01:29:33,233
..

2254
01:29:33,233 --> 01:29:35,093
um, how reliable they are in, in

2255
01:29:35,093 --> 01:29:37,713
in their, um, um, in, in the proof they give me.

2256
01:29:37,713 --> 01:29:40,013
But Lean gives me a certificate of, of trust

2257
01:29:40,013 --> 01:29:42,973
um, so I can do, I can do trustless mathematics.

2258
01:29:42,973 --> 01:29:45,013
So there's so many interesting questions.

2259
01:29:45,013 --> 01:29:45,397
There's.

2260
01:29:45,397 --> 01:29:45,493
..

2261
01:29:45,493 --> 01:29:49,813
So, so one, you're, you're known for being a great collaborator.

2262
01:29:49,813 --> 01:29:58,053
So what is the right way to approach solving a difficult problem in mathematics when you're collaborating?

2263
01:29:58,053 --> 01:30:02,421
Are you doing a divide and conquer type of thing or are you brain s-.

2264
01:30:02,421 --> 01:30:02,493
..

2265
01:30:02,493 --> 01:30:05,513
Are you focusing on a particular part and you're brainstorming?

2266
01:30:05,513 --> 01:30:08,373
There's always a brainstorming process first, yeah.

2267
01:30:08,373 --> 01:30:10,913
So math research projects sort of by their nature

2268
01:30:10,913 --> 01:30:13,853
when you start, you don't really know how to do the problem.

2269
01:30:13,853 --> 01:30:19,033
Um, it's not like an engineering project where some other theory has been established for decades and it's

2270
01:30:19,033 --> 01:30:20,793
it's implementation is the main difficulty.

2271
01:30:20,793 --> 01:30:23,213
You have to figure out even what is the right path.

2272
01:30:23,213 --> 01:30:24,633
Uh, so, so this is what I said about

2273
01:30:24,633 --> 01:30:25,793
about cheating first, you know.

2274
01:30:25,793 --> 01:30:27,569
Um, it's like, um.

2275
01:30:27,569 --> 01:30:27,673
..

2276
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:29,693
To go back to the bridge building analogy

2277
01:30:29,693 --> 01:30:31,933
you know, so first assume you have infinite budget and

2278
01:30:31,933 --> 01:30:34,633
and like unlimited amounts of, of, of workforce and so forth.

2279
01:30:34,633 --> 01:30:36,193
Now can you, can you build this bridge?

2280
01:30:36,193 --> 01:30:36,953
Okay, okay.

2281
01:30:36,953 --> 01:30:39,373
Now have infinite budget but only finite workforce

2282
01:30:39,373 --> 01:30:39,619
right?

2283
01:30:39,619 --> 01:30:40,673
Now can you do that and so forth?

2284
01:30:40,673 --> 01:30:43,713
Um, so, uh, I mean, of course

2285
01:30:43,713 --> 01:30:47,853
you know, no engineer can actually do this 'cause they have fixed requirements.

2286
01:30:47,853 --> 01:30:53,073
Yes, there's these sort of jam sessions always at the beginning where you try all kinds of crazy things and you

2287
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:56,453
you make all these assumptions that are unrealistic but you plan to fix later

2288
01:30:56,453 --> 01:30:59,807
um, and you try to see if there's even some-.

2289
01:30:59,807 --> 01:31:00,085
..

2290
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:01,825
skeleton of an approach that might work.

2291
01:31:01,825 --> 01:31:06,745
Um, and then hopefully that breaks up the problem into smaller sub-problems

2292
01:31:06,745 --> 01:31:08,525
which you don't know how to do but then you f- uh

2293
01:31:08,525 --> 01:31:10,325
you focus on, on the sub-ones.

2294
01:31:10,325 --> 01:31:12,966
Uh, and sometimes different collaborators are better at

2295
01:31:12,966 --> 01:31:14,385
at working on, on certain things.

2296
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:18,885
Um, so one of my theorems I'm known for is a theorem with Ben Green we sampled

2297
01:31:18,885 --> 01:31:19,665
the Green-Tao Theorem.

2298
01:31:19,665 --> 01:31:23,805
Um, it's a statement that the primes contain arithmetic progressions of any length.

2299
01:31:23,805 --> 01:31:25,965
So it, it was a modification of this theorem with Szemerédi.

2300
01:31:25,965 --> 01:31:31,745
And the way we collaborated was that Ben had already proven a similar result for progressions of length three.

2301
01:31:31,745 --> 01:31:36,106
Um, he showed that sets like the primes contain lots and lots of progressions of length three

2302
01:31:36,106 --> 01:31:39,305
um, even, and even, um, subsets of the primes.

2303
01:31:39,305 --> 01:31:40,145
So the subsets do.

2304
01:31:40,145 --> 01:31:42,946
Um, but his techniques only worked for

2305
01:31:42,946 --> 01:31:44,265
um, for the three progressions.

2306
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:45,506
They didn't work for longer progressions.

2307
01:31:45,506 --> 01:31:48,725
Um, but I had these techniques coming from ergodic theory

2308
01:31:48,725 --> 01:31:50,785
which is something that I had been playing with and

2309
01:31:50,785 --> 01:31:52,885
and, uh, and I knew better than Ben at the time.

2310
01:31:52,885 --> 01:31:59,225
Um, and so, um, if I could justify certain randomness properties of se- some set relating of the primes

2311
01:31:59,225 --> 01:31:59,245
right?

2312
01:31:59,245 --> 01:32:03,926
There's, there's a certain technical condition which if I could have it

2313
01:32:03,926 --> 01:32:05,225
if, if Ben could supply me this

2314
01:32:05,225 --> 01:32:07,025
this fact, I could give, I could conclude the theorem.

2315
01:32:07,025 --> 01:32:07,875
But I.

2316
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:07,945
..

2317
01:32:07,945 --> 01:32:10,685
what I asked was a really difficult question in number theory

2318
01:32:10,685 --> 01:32:13,835
which, um, he said, "No, there's no way we can prove this.

2319
01:32:13,835 --> 01:32:14,493
" "Can you.

2320
01:32:14,493 --> 01:32:14,567
..

2321
01:32:14,567 --> 01:32:18,981
" So he said, "Can you prove your part of the theorem using a weaker hypothesis that I have a chance to prove it?

2322
01:32:18,981 --> 01:32:21,165
" And he proposed something which he could prove

2323
01:32:21,165 --> 01:32:22,245
but it was too weak for me.

2324
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:22,946
 Yeah.

2325
01:32:22,946 --> 01:32:23,825
Uh, I- I can't use this.

2326
01:32:23,825 --> 01:32:26,766
Um, so there's this, there was this conversation going back and forth.

2327
01:32:26,766 --> 01:32:29,765
 Um, so, so different cheats too.

2328
01:32:29,765 --> 01:32:30,606
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2329
01:32:30,606 --> 01:32:32,385
I wanted to cheat more and he wants to cheat less.

2330
01:32:32,385 --> 01:32:32,725
Yeah.

2331
01:32:32,725 --> 01:32:34,745
Uh, but eventually we found a, a

2332
01:32:34,745 --> 01:32:36,326
a, a, a, a property which A

2333
01:32:36,326 --> 01:32:38,065
he could prove, uh, and B, I could use.

2334
01:32:38,065 --> 01:32:40,578
Um, and then we, we could prove our theorem and.

2335
01:32:40,578 --> 01:32:40,905
..

2336
01:32:40,905 --> 01:32:43,065
Um, yeah, so there's, there's a

2337
01:32:43,065 --> 01:32:44,925
there are all kinds of dynamics, you know.

2338
01:32:44,925 --> 01:32:46,385
I mean, it's, it's, it's every

2339
01:32:46,385 --> 01:32:49,326
every, um, collaboration has its, has its- Mm-hmm.

2340
01:32:49,326 --> 01:32:49,326
.

2341
01:32:49,326 --> 01:32:49,326
.

2342
01:32:49,326 --> 01:32:50,105
has some story.

2343
01:32:50,105 --> 01:32:50,290
It's.

2344
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:50,365
..

2345
01:32:50,365 --> 01:32:51,106
no two are the same.

2346
01:32:51,106 --> 01:32:52,825
And then on, on the flip side of that

2347
01:32:52,825 --> 01:32:55,105
like you mentioned, with Lean programming- Mm-hmm.

2348
01:32:55,105 --> 01:32:55,111
.

2349
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:55,125
..

2350
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:58,021
now that's a- almost like a different story because you can do.

2351
01:32:58,021 --> 01:32:58,205
..

2352
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:02,505
you can create I think you've mentioned a kind of a blueprint- Mm-hmm.

2353
01:33:02,505 --> 01:33:03,285
Right.

2354
01:33:03,285 --> 01:33:03,332
.

2355
01:33:03,332 --> 01:33:03,426
..

2356
01:33:03,426 --> 01:33:04,605
for a problem.

2357
01:33:04,605 --> 01:33:07,105
And then you can really do a divide-and-conquer- Yeah.

2358
01:33:07,105 --> 01:33:07,112
.

2359
01:33:07,112 --> 01:33:07,126
..

2360
01:33:07,126 --> 01:33:11,365
with Lean, where you're working on separate parts- Right.

2361
01:33:11,365 --> 01:33:11,378
.

2362
01:33:11,378 --> 01:33:11,405
..

2363
01:33:11,405 --> 01:33:14,806
and, uh, using the computer system proof checker essentially- Yeah.

2364
01:33:14,806 --> 01:33:14,832
.

2365
01:33:14,832 --> 01:33:14,886
..

2366
01:33:14,886 --> 01:33:17,165
to make sure that everything is correct along the way.

2367
01:33:17,165 --> 01:33:17,206
Yeah.

2368
01:33:17,206 --> 01:33:18,845
So it makes everything compatible and, uh

2369
01:33:18,845 --> 01:33:19,125
yeah.

2370
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:20,105
A- and trustable.

2371
01:33:20,105 --> 01:33:25,806
Um, yeah, so currently, uh, only a few mathematical projects can be cut up in this way.

2372
01:33:25,806 --> 01:33:30,965
At the current state-of-the-art most of the Lean activity is on formalizing proofs that have already been proven by humans.

2373
01:33:30,965 --> 01:33:31,465
Mm-hmm.

2374
01:33:31,465 --> 01:33:35,465
A math paper basically is a boop- a blueprint in a sense.

2375
01:33:35,465 --> 01:33:37,385
It, it is taking a, a difficult statement

2376
01:33:37,385 --> 01:33:39,765
like big theorem, and breaking up into maybe a- a hundred little lemmas.

2377
01:33:39,765 --> 01:33:46,245
Um, but often not all written with enough detail that each one can be sort of directly formalized.

2378
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:53,285
A blueprint is like a really pedantically written version of a paper where every step is explained as

2379
01:33:53,285 --> 01:33:58,105
uh, as much detail as, as, as possible and tr- trying to make each step kind of self-contained

2380
01:33:58,105 --> 01:34:01,485
um, and, or depending on only a very specific number of

2381
01:34:01,485 --> 01:34:08,485
of previous statements that have been proven, so that each node of this blueprint graph that gets generated can be tackled independently of

2382
01:34:08,485 --> 01:34:09,165
of the others.

2383
01:34:09,165 --> 01:34:11,665
And you don't even need to know how the whole thing works.

2384
01:34:11,665 --> 01:34:13,525
Um, so it's like a modern supply chain

2385
01:34:13,525 --> 01:34:13,805
you know?

2386
01:34:13,805 --> 01:34:13,885
Mm-hmm.

2387
01:34:13,885 --> 01:34:16,845
Like if you want to create an iPhone or s- or some other complicated object

2388
01:34:16,845 --> 01:34:19,205
um, no one person can, can build a

2389
01:34:19,205 --> 01:34:21,905
um, s- single object but you get a specialist to

2390
01:34:21,905 --> 01:34:22,427
to just.

2391
01:34:22,427 --> 01:34:22,525
..

2392
01:34:22,525 --> 01:34:24,765
if they're given some widgets from some other company

2393
01:34:24,765 --> 01:34:27,385
they can combine them together to form a slightly bigger widget.

2394
01:34:27,385 --> 01:34:30,187
I think that's a really exciting possibility because you can have.

2395
01:34:30,187 --> 01:34:30,325
..

2396
01:34:30,325 --> 01:34:33,905
if you can find problems that could be- Right.

2397
01:34:33,905 --> 01:34:33,945
.

2398
01:34:33,945 --> 01:34:34,025
..

2399
01:34:34,025 --> 01:34:35,925
uh, broken down this way then you could have

2400
01:34:35,925 --> 01:34:37,865
you know, thousands of contributors, right?

2401
01:34:37,865 --> 01:34:38,545
Yes, yes, yes, yeah.

2402
01:34:38,545 --> 01:34:42,945
And this will be completely distributed- So I told you before about the split between theoretical and experimental mathematics

2403
01:34:42,945 --> 01:34:46,505
and right now most mathematics is theoretical and only a tiny bit is experimental.

2404
01:34:46,505 --> 01:34:49,685
I think the platform that Lean and, and other software tools

2405
01:34:49,685 --> 01:34:49,997
uh.

2406
01:34:49,997 --> 01:34:50,005
..

2407
01:34:50,005 --> 01:34:51,565
so, um, you know, GitHub and things like that

2408
01:34:51,565 --> 01:34:55,225
um, allow, uh, they will allow ex- experimental mathematics to be.

2409
01:34:55,225 --> 01:34:55,305
..

2410
01:34:55,305 --> 01:34:58,505
to scale up, um, to a much greater degree than we can do now.

2411
01:34:58,505 --> 01:35:00,825
So right now if you want to, um

2412
01:35:00,825 --> 01:35:06,045
um, do any mathematical exploration, uh, of some mathematical p- pattern or something

2413
01:35:06,045 --> 01:35:07,731
you need some code to write out the pattern and.

2414
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:07,845
..

2415
01:35:07,845 --> 01:35:14,545
I mean, sometimes there are some computer algebra packages that could help but often it's just one mathematician coding lots and lots of Python or whatever.

2416
01:35:14,545 --> 01:35:17,725
And because coding is such an error-prone activity

2417
01:35:17,725 --> 01:35:24,105
it's not practical to allow other people to collaborate with you on writing the modules for your code because if one of the modules has a bug in it

2418
01:35:24,105 --> 01:35:25,925
the whole thing's- is un- unreliable.

2419
01:35:25,925 --> 01:35:28,173
Um, so it's.

2420
01:35:28,173 --> 01:35:28,305
..

2421
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:28,933
these are, uh.

2422
01:35:28,933 --> 01:35:29,005
..

2423
01:35:29,005 --> 01:35:33,419
so you get these bespoke, uh, spaghetti code written by non-.

2424
01:35:33,419 --> 01:35:33,505
..

2425
01:35:33,505 --> 01:35:35,765
not professional programmers but by mathematicians, you know

2426
01:35:35,765 --> 01:35:38,525
and they're clunky and, and, and slow and

2427
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:39,389
um.

2428
01:35:39,389 --> 01:35:39,485
..

2429
01:35:39,485 --> 01:35:40,705
and so because of that it's, it's

2430
01:35:40,705 --> 01:35:44,125
it's hard to, to really mass produce experimental results.

2431
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:48,725
Um, but, um, yeah, but I think with Lean

2432
01:35:48,725 --> 01:35:54,505
I mean, so I'm already starting some projects where we are not just experimenting with data but experimenting with proofs.

2433
01:35:54,505 --> 01:35:56,745
So I have this project called the Equational Theories Project.

2434
01:35:56,745 --> 01:36:00,665
Basically, we generated about 22 million little problems in abstract algebra.

2435
01:36:00,665 --> 01:36:02,205
Maybe I should back up and tell you what

2436
01:36:02,205 --> 01:36:03,025
what the project is.

2437
01:36:03,025 --> 01:36:08,285
Okay, so abstract algebra studies operations like multiplication and addition and their abstract properties.

2438
01:36:08,285 --> 01:36:08,565
Okay?

2439
01:36:08,565 --> 01:36:10,645
So multiplication for example is commutative.

2440
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:12,045
X times Y is always Y times X

2441
01:36:12,045 --> 01:36:12,865
at least for numbers.

2442
01:36:12,865 --> 01:36:15,305
Um, and, uh, it's also associative.

2443
01:36:15,305 --> 01:36:18,205
X times Y times Z is the same as X times Y times Z.

2444
01:36:18,205 --> 01:36:22,145
Um, so, um, these operations obey some laws that

2445
01:36:22,145 --> 01:36:23,905
you know, uh, that, that don't obey others.

2446
01:36:23,905 --> 01:36:25,725
For example, X times X is not always equal to X

2447
01:36:25,725 --> 01:36:27,185
so that law is- is not always true.

2448
01:36:27,185 --> 01:36:31,305
So given any, any operation, it obeys some laws and not others.

2449
01:36:31,305 --> 01:36:34,217
Um, and so we generated about 4

2450
01:36:34,217 --> 01:36:37,485
000 of these possible laws o- of algebra that certain operations satisfy

2451
01:36:37,485 --> 01:36:40,165
and our question is which laws imply which other ones?

2452
01:36:40,165 --> 01:36:44,325
Um, so for example does commutativity imply associativity?

2453
01:36:44,325 --> 01:36:49,545
And the answer is no because it turns out you can describe an operation which obeys the commutative law but doesn't obey the associative law.

2454
01:36:49,545 --> 01:36:54,385
So by producing an example you can, you can show that commutativity does not imply associativity.

2455
01:36:54,385 --> 01:36:57,965
But some other laws do imply other laws by substitution and so forth

2456
01:36:57,965 --> 01:36:59,045
uh, and you can write down some

2457
01:36:59,045 --> 01:37:00,345
some algebraic proof.

2458
01:37:00,345 --> 01:37:02,441
So we look at all the pairs between these 4

2459
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:05,125
000 laws, and there's like 22- 22 million of these pairs.

2460
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:08,526
And for each pair we ask, "Does this law imply this la- um

2461
01:37:08,526 --> 01:37:09,146
law?

2462
01:37:09,146 --> 01:37:10,405
If so, give a, give, uh

2463
01:37:10,405 --> 01:37:11,025
give a proof.

2464
01:37:11,025 --> 01:37:12,067
If not, give a counter-example.

2465
01:37:12,067 --> 01:37:12,445
" Mm-hmm.

2466
01:37:12,445 --> 01:37:16,325
Um, so 22 million problems, each one of which you could give to a

2467
01:37:16,325 --> 01:37:20,325
like an, an undergraduate algebra student and they had a decent chance of solving the problem.

2468
01:37:20,325 --> 01:37:22,265
Although there are a few, of these 22 million

2469
01:37:22,265 --> 01:37:24,505
there are like 100 or so that are really quite hard

2470
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:24,806
okay?

2471
01:37:24,806 --> 01:37:25,605
But a lot are easy.

2472
01:37:25,605 --> 01:37:28,525
And the project was just to, to work out

2473
01:37:28,525 --> 01:37:31,425
to determine the entire graph, like, like which ones imply which other ones.

2474
01:37:31,425 --> 01:37:33,066
That's an incredible project, by the way.

2475
01:37:33,066 --> 01:37:37,806
Such a good idea, such a good test of the very thing we've been talking about on a scale that's remarkable.

2476
01:37:37,806 --> 01:37:39,705
Yeah, so it would not have been feasible

2477
01:37:39,705 --> 01:37:42,665
you know, I mean the state of the art in the literature was like

2478
01:37:42,665 --> 01:37:44,353
you know, 15 equations and sort of how they entire.

2479
01:37:44,353 --> 01:37:44,425
..

2480
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:47,386
Uh, that's sort of at the limit of what a human pen and paper can do.

2481
01:37:47,386 --> 01:37:49,165
So yeah, so you need to scale that up

2482
01:37:49,165 --> 01:37:53,365
so you need a crowd source, but you also need to trust all the

2483
01:37:53,365 --> 01:37:53,497
um.

2484
01:37:53,497 --> 01:37:53,585
..

2485
01:37:53,585 --> 01:37:54,925
Now I, uh, yeah, I mean

2486
01:37:54,925 --> 01:37:57,766
uh, no one person can check 22 million of these proofs.

2487
01:37:57,766 --> 01:37:58,125
Mm-hmm.

2488
01:37:58,125 --> 01:37:58,205
Right?

2489
01:37:58,205 --> 01:37:59,665
You, you need it to be computerized

2490
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:02,665
and so it only became possible with, with Lean.

2491
01:38:02,665 --> 01:38:05,885
Um, we were hoping to use a lot of AI as well

2492
01:38:05,885 --> 01:38:07,666
um, so that the project is almost complete.

2493
01:38:07,666 --> 01:38:10,966
Um, so of these 22 million, all but two have been settled.

2494
01:38:10,966 --> 01:38:12,005
Um- Wow.

2495
01:38:12,005 --> 01:38:14,325
And, uh, well actually, and of those two

2496
01:38:14,325 --> 01:38:16,505
uh, we have a pen and paper proof of the two

2497
01:38:16,505 --> 01:38:17,745
uh, and we, we're formalizing it.

2498
01:38:17,745 --> 01:38:19,406
In fact, I was, uh, this morning I was working on it

2499
01:38:19,406 --> 01:38:20,265
finishing it.

2500
01:38:20,265 --> 01:38:22,726
 Um, so we're almost done on this.

2501
01:38:22,726 --> 01:38:23,945
Um, it's, it's- That's incredible.

2502
01:38:23,945 --> 01:38:25,225
It's, yeah, uh, uh, fantastic.

2503
01:38:25,225 --> 01:38:26,585
How many people were you able to get?

2504
01:38:26,585 --> 01:38:26,798
Uh.

2505
01:38:26,798 --> 01:38:26,806
..

2506
01:38:26,806 --> 01:38:27,265
About 50.

2507
01:38:27,265 --> 01:38:30,906
Uh, which in mathematics is, is considered a huge number.

2508
01:38:30,906 --> 01:38:31,925
It's a huge number.

2509
01:38:31,925 --> 01:38:31,945
Yeah.

2510
01:38:31,945 --> 01:38:32,925
That's crazy.

2511
01:38:32,925 --> 01:38:33,145
Yeah.

2512
01:38:33,145 --> 01:38:34,885
So we're gonna have a paper with 50 authors

2513
01:38:34,885 --> 01:38:38,245
uh, and a, a big appendix of who contributed what.

2514
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:42,345
Here's an interesting question, now to maybe speak even more generally about it.

2515
01:38:42,345 --> 01:38:46,765
When you have this pool of people, is there a way to

2516
01:38:46,765 --> 01:38:50,166
uh, organize the contributions by level of expertise of the people

2517
01:38:50,166 --> 01:38:51,165
of the contributors?

2518
01:38:51,165 --> 01:38:55,625
Now, okay, uh, I'm asking a lot of pothead questions here

2519
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:58,025
but I, I'm imagining a bunch of humans

2520
01:38:58,025 --> 01:39:00,005
and maybe in the future some AIs- Yeah.

2521
01:39:00,005 --> 01:39:04,350
Can there be like an Elo rating type of situation where.

2522
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:04,465
..

2523
01:39:04,465 --> 01:39:07,205
 Like a gamification of this?

2524
01:39:07,205 --> 01:39:09,165
The beauty of, of these Lean projects is

2525
01:39:09,165 --> 01:39:10,845
is that automatically you get all this data

2526
01:39:10,845 --> 01:39:11,165
you know.

2527
01:39:11,165 --> 01:39:13,045
So like, like everything's being uploaded to this GitHub

2528
01:39:13,045 --> 01:39:15,105
and GitHub tracks who contributed what.

2529
01:39:15,105 --> 01:39:18,885
Um, so you could generate statistics from

2530
01:39:18,885 --> 01:39:20,625
at, at any, at any later point in time.

2531
01:39:20,625 --> 01:39:22,805
You could say, "Oh, this person contributed this many

2532
01:39:22,805 --> 01:39:24,125
this many lines of code," or whatever.

2533
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,745
I mean, these are very crude metrics.

2534
01:39:25,745 --> 01:39:28,605
Um, I would, I would definitely not want this to become like

2535
01:39:28,605 --> 01:39:30,205
you know, part of your tenure review or something.

2536
01:39:30,205 --> 01:39:32,985
Uh, um, but um, I mean

2537
01:39:32,985 --> 01:39:35,625
uh, I think already in, in, in enterprise computing

2538
01:39:35,625 --> 01:39:38,945
right, people do use some of these metrics as part of

2539
01:39:38,945 --> 01:39:41,205
of the assessment of, of, uh, performance of a

2540
01:39:41,205 --> 01:39:41,965
of an employee.

2541
01:39:41,965 --> 01:39:46,045
Um, again, this is a direction which is a bit scary for academics to go down.

2542
01:39:46,045 --> 01:39:49,045
We, we, we don't like metrics so much.

2543
01:39:49,045 --> 01:39:52,265
And yet academics use metrics.

2544
01:39:52,265 --> 01:39:54,905
They just use old ones.

2545
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:56,485
Number of papers.

2546
01:39:56,485 --> 01:39:57,625
Yeah, uh, yeah.

2547
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:58,965
Uh, it's true, it's true that, uh

2548
01:39:58,965 --> 01:40:01,245
I mean, um- It feels like this is a metric

2549
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:04,165
while flawed, is, is going in the

2550
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:05,405
more in the right direction, right?

2551
01:40:05,405 --> 01:40:06,065
Yeah.

2552
01:40:06,065 --> 01:40:06,805
It's an interesting.

2553
01:40:06,805 --> 01:40:06,885
..

2554
01:40:06,885 --> 01:40:08,645
At, at least it's a very interesting metric.

2555
01:40:08,645 --> 01:40:10,745
Yeah, I think it's interesting to study.

2556
01:40:10,745 --> 01:40:12,545
I mean, I think you can, you can do studies of

2557
01:40:12,545 --> 01:40:14,225
of whether these are better predictors.

2558
01:40:14,225 --> 01:40:16,525
Um, there's this problem called Goodhart's law.

2559
01:40:16,525 --> 01:40:19,445
If a statistic is actually used to incentivize performance

2560
01:40:19,445 --> 01:40:22,465
it becomes gamed, um, and then it is no longer a useful measure.

2561
01:40:22,465 --> 01:40:24,825
Oh, humans, always ga-  Yeah, yeah

2562
01:40:24,825 --> 01:40:25,925
no- A- always gaming the systems.

2563
01:40:25,925 --> 01:40:26,525
No, I mean, it's, it's, it's rational.

2564
01:40:26,525 --> 01:40:28,465
So what we've done for this pr- project is

2565
01:40:28,465 --> 01:40:29,345
is self-report.

2566
01:40:29,345 --> 01:40:32,145
So, um, there are actually standard categories

2567
01:40:32,145 --> 01:40:35,005
um, from the sciences of what types of contributions people give.

2568
01:40:35,005 --> 01:40:38,565
So there's, there's, uh, concept and validation and resources and

2569
01:40:38,565 --> 01:40:40,585
and, and, and, and coding and so forth.

2570
01:40:40,585 --> 01:40:41,997
Um, so we, we, we.

2571
01:40:41,997 --> 01:40:42,085
..

2572
01:40:42,085 --> 01:40:44,125
There's a standard list of 12 or so categories

2573
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:46,577
um, and we just ask each contributor to.

2574
01:40:46,577 --> 01:40:46,705
..

2575
01:40:46,705 --> 01:40:49,725
There's a big matrix of all the, of all the authors and all the categories

2576
01:40:49,725 --> 01:40:52,645
just to tick the boxes where they think that they contributed.

2577
01:40:52,645 --> 01:40:54,605
Um, and just to give a rough idea

2578
01:40:54,605 --> 01:40:57,205
you know, like, oh, so you did some coding and

2579
01:40:57,205 --> 01:41:02,085
and, uh, and you provided some compute but you didn't do any of the pen and paper verification or whatever.

2580
01:41:02,085 --> 01:41:03,965
And I think that, that works out.

2581
01:41:03,965 --> 01:41:07,125
Traditionally, mathematicians just order a- alphabetically by surname.

2582
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:09,665
So we don't have this tradition as in the sciences of

2583
01:41:09,665 --> 01:41:11,685
you know, lead author and second author and so forth

2584
01:41:11,685 --> 01:41:13,205
like, which we're proud of.

2585
01:41:13,205 --> 01:41:15,545
You know, we make all the authors equal status

2586
01:41:15,545 --> 01:41:18,425
but it doesn't quite scale to this size.

2587
01:41:18,425 --> 01:41:21,985
So a decade ago, I was involved in these thi- things called Polymath projects.

2588
01:41:21,985 --> 01:41:25,505
It was a crowdsourcing mathematics, but without the Lean component.

2589
01:41:25,505 --> 01:41:30,565
So it was limited by you needed a human moderator to actually check that all the contributions coming in were actually valid

2590
01:41:30,565 --> 01:41:33,085
um, and this was a huge bottleneck actually.

2591
01:41:33,085 --> 01:41:35,845
Um, but still we had projects that were

2592
01:41:35,845 --> 01:41:38,125
you know, 10 authors or so.

2593
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:40,665
But we had decided at the time, um

2594
01:41:40,665 --> 01:41:43,305
not to try to decide who did what

2595
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:45,465
um, but to have a single pseudonym.

2596
01:41:45,465 --> 01:41:50,885
Um, so we created this fictional character called DHJ Polymath in the spirit of Bob Akee.

2597
01:41:50,885 --> 01:41:53,045
Bob Akee is this, uh, the pseudonym for

2598
01:41:53,045 --> 01:41:55,785
uh, a famous, uh, group of mathematicians in the 20th century.

2599
01:41:55,785 --> 01:41:58,725
But, um, and so the paper was auth- authored under pseudonym

2600
01:41:58,725 --> 01:42:00,405
so none of us got the author credit.

2601
01:42:00,405 --> 01:42:04,445
Um, this actually turned out to be not so great for a couple reasons.

2602
01:42:04,445 --> 01:42:09,005
Uh, so, so one is that if you actually wanted to be considered for tenure or whatever

2603
01:42:09,005 --> 01:42:11,905
you could not use this paper in your

2604
01:42:11,905 --> 01:42:14,105
uh, uh, as your submitted, as your

2605
01:42:14,105 --> 01:42:15,549
one of your publications because it wasn't.

2606
01:42:15,549 --> 01:42:15,625
..

2607
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:17,305
you didn't have the formal author credit.

2608
01:42:17,305 --> 01:42:24,905
Um, um, but the other thing that we've recognized much later is that when people referred to these projects

2609
01:42:24,905 --> 01:42:28,485
they naturally refer to the most famous person who was involved in the project.

2610
01:42:28,485 --> 01:42:30,278
"Oh, so this was Tim Gow's polymath project

2611
01:42:30,278 --> 01:42:32,022
" or, "This was Terence Tao's polymath project

2612
01:42:32,022 --> 01:42:36,185
" and not mention the, the other 19 or whatever people that were involved.

2613
01:42:36,185 --> 01:42:37,285
Ah, yeah.

2614
01:42:37,285 --> 01:42:40,945
So we're trying something different this time round where we have everyone's an author

2615
01:42:40,945 --> 01:42:45,465
um, but we will have an a- an appendix with this matrix and we'll see how that works.

2616
01:42:45,465 --> 01:42:47,585
I mean, uh, so both pr- projects are incredible

2617
01:42:47,585 --> 01:42:50,825
just the fact that you're involved in such huge collaborations.

2618
01:42:50,825 --> 01:42:53,825
But I think I saw a talk from Kevin Buzzard about

2619
01:42:53,825 --> 01:42:56,825
uh, the Lean programming languages a few years ago and he was saying that

2620
01:42:56,825 --> 01:43:00,125
uh, this might be the future of mathematics.

2621
01:43:00,125 --> 01:43:02,425
And so it's also exciting that you're embracing

2622
01:43:02,425 --> 01:43:06,785
uh, one of the greatest mathematicians i- i- in the world embracing this

2623
01:43:06,785 --> 01:43:07,211
uh.

2624
01:43:07,211 --> 01:43:07,495
..

2625
01:43:07,495 --> 01:43:07,779
..

2626
01:43:07,779 --> 01:43:11,601
. what seems like the paving of the future of mathematics.

2627
01:43:11,601 --> 01:43:27,161
Um, so I have to ask you here about the integration of AI into this whole process of Deep Mind's AlphaProof was trained using reinforcement learning on both failed and successful formal lean proofs- Mm-hmm.

2628
01:43:27,161 --> 01:43:27,167
.

2629
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:27,181
..

2630
01:43:27,181 --> 01:43:28,222
of IMO problems.

2631
01:43:28,222 --> 01:43:28,322
Yes, yes, yes.

2632
01:43:28,322 --> 01:43:31,941
So this is sort of high-level high school.

2633
01:43:31,941 --> 01:43:33,222
Oh, very high level, yes.

2634
01:43:33,222 --> 01:43:35,582
Very high level high school of mathematics problems.

2635
01:43:35,582 --> 01:43:43,602
What do you think about this system and maybe what is the gap between this system that is able to prove the high school level problems- Right.

2636
01:43:43,602 --> 01:43:43,615
.

2637
01:43:43,615 --> 01:43:43,641
..

2638
01:43:43,641 --> 01:43:46,801
uh, versus graduate level, uh, problems?

2639
01:43:46,801 --> 01:43:52,662
Yeah, th- the difficulty in- increases exponentially with the- the number of steps involved in the proof.

2640
01:43:52,662 --> 01:43:54,461
It's a combinatorial explosion, right?

2641
01:43:54,461 --> 01:43:56,582
So the thing with large language models is

2642
01:43:56,582 --> 01:43:58,335
is that they make mistakes and.

2643
01:43:58,335 --> 01:43:58,442
..

2644
01:43:58,442 --> 01:44:02,582
So if a proof has got 20 steps and your large language model has a 10% failure rate

2645
01:44:02,582 --> 01:44:05,461
um, at each step, um, of g- of going in the wrong direction

2646
01:44:05,461 --> 01:44:08,881
like, uh, it's- it's- it's extremely unlikely to actually

2647
01:44:08,881 --> 01:44:09,781
uh, reach the end.

2648
01:44:09,781 --> 01:44:12,581
Actually, uh, just to take a small tangent here

2649
01:44:12,581 --> 01:44:19,201
is, how hard is the problem of mapping from natural language to the formal program?

2650
01:44:19,201 --> 01:44:19,681
Oh, yeah.

2651
01:44:19,681 --> 01:44:21,021
It's extremely hard, actually.

2652
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:24,041
Um, natural language, you know, it's very fault tolerant.

2653
01:44:24,041 --> 01:44:28,921
Um, like you can make a few minor grammatical errors and a speaker in a second language can get some idea of what you're saying.

2654
01:44:28,921 --> 01:44:31,841
Um, yeah, but, but formal language

2655
01:44:31,841 --> 01:44:33,981
yeah, you know, if- if you get one little thing wrong

2656
01:44:33,981 --> 01:44:36,621
um, I think that the whole thing is- is- is nonsense.

2657
01:44:36,621 --> 01:44:36,981
Got it.

2658
01:44:36,981 --> 01:44:39,781
Um, even formal to formal is- is- is very hard.

2659
01:44:39,781 --> 01:44:42,081
There, there are different incompatible, um, uh

2660
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:43,041
proof assistant languages.

2661
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:46,022
Uh, there's Lean but also Coq and Isabelle and- and so forth.

2662
01:44:46,022 --> 01:44:46,721
And I keep.

2663
01:44:46,721 --> 01:44:46,802
..

2664
01:44:46,802 --> 01:44:48,742
Even converting from a formal language to an informal language

2665
01:44:48,742 --> 01:44:51,141
um, is, uh, is an unsolved

2666
01:44:51,141 --> 01:44:52,081
basically unsolvable problem.

2667
01:44:52,081 --> 01:44:53,601
That is fascinating.

2668
01:44:53,601 --> 01:44:57,661
Okay, so, uh, but once you have an informal language

2669
01:44:57,661 --> 01:45:05,981
they're using, um, their RL-trained model, so some- something akin to AlphaZero that they use in Go- Yes.

2670
01:45:05,981 --> 01:45:06,827
 .

2671
01:45:06,827 --> 01:45:06,841
..

2672
01:45:06,841 --> 01:45:08,161
to then try to come up with proofs.

2673
01:45:08,161 --> 01:45:11,761
They also have a model, I believe it's a separate model for geometric problems.

2674
01:45:11,761 --> 01:45:11,881
Yes.

2675
01:45:11,881 --> 01:45:15,141
So what impresses you about this system and

2676
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:18,401
um, what do you think is the gap?

2677
01:45:18,401 --> 01:45:18,641
Yeah.

2678
01:45:18,641 --> 01:45:22,261
We talked earlier about things that are amazing over time become kind of normalized.

2679
01:45:22,261 --> 01:45:24,941
Um, so, yeah, now somehow it's

2680
01:45:24,941 --> 01:45:26,881
oh, of course geometry is a solvable problem.

2681
01:45:26,881 --> 01:45:27,381
Right.

2682
01:45:27,381 --> 01:45:27,921
That's true.

2683
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:28,321
That's true.

2684
01:45:28,321 --> 01:45:30,921
I mean, it's still beautiful, the- the work they're doing.

2685
01:45:30,921 --> 01:45:32,681
Yeah, yeah, no, uh, it- it's- it's a great work because it shows what's possible.

2686
01:45:32,681 --> 01:45:33,865
I mean, um, it's, it.

2687
01:45:33,865 --> 01:45:34,041
..

2688
01:45:34,041 --> 01:45:36,401
Um, the approach doesn't scale currently.

2689
01:45:36,401 --> 01:45:36,721
Yeah.

2690
01:45:36,721 --> 01:45:40,101
Three days of Google's server as server time to solve one

2691
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:41,741
uh, high school math problem there.

2692
01:45:41,741 --> 01:45:43,281
This- this is not a scalable, uh

2693
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:46,681
prospect, um, especially with the exponential increase in

2694
01:45:46,681 --> 01:45:46,873
um.

2695
01:45:46,873 --> 01:45:47,001
..

2696
01:45:47,001 --> 01:45:49,421
as- as the complexity, um, increases.

2697
01:45:49,421 --> 01:45:52,381
We should mention that they got a silver medal performance.

2698
01:45:52,381 --> 01:45:53,421
The equivalent of.

2699
01:45:53,421 --> 01:45:54,721
I mean, yeah- Equivalent of a silver medal performance.

2700
01:45:54,721 --> 01:45:54,727
.

2701
01:45:54,727 --> 01:45:54,741
..

2702
01:45:54,741 --> 01:45:55,135
I mean, they.

2703
01:45:55,135 --> 01:45:55,221
..

2704
01:45:55,221 --> 01:45:57,141
So first of all, they took way more time than was

2705
01:45:57,141 --> 01:45:57,381
uh- Mm-hmm.

2706
01:45:57,381 --> 01:45:57,394
.

2707
01:45:57,394 --> 01:45:57,421
..

2708
01:45:57,421 --> 01:45:58,021
alloted.

2709
01:45:58,021 --> 01:46:02,001
Um, and they had this assistance with- where the humans started helped by- by formalizing.

2710
01:46:02,001 --> 01:46:08,601
Um, but, uh, also they- they gave them those full marks for the solution which I guess is formally verified

2711
01:46:08,601 --> 01:46:10,001
so I guess that's- that's- that's fair.

2712
01:46:10,001 --> 01:46:11,681
Um, yeah.

2713
01:46:11,681 --> 01:46:14,041
Um, there- there are efforts.

2714
01:46:14,041 --> 01:46:14,161
..

2715
01:46:14,161 --> 01:46:14,481
There was.

2716
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:14,581
..

2717
01:46:14,581 --> 01:46:24,101
There will be a proposal at some point to actually have an- an AI Math Olympiad where at the same time as the human contestants get the- the actual olympiad

2718
01:46:24,101 --> 01:46:27,561
um, problems, AIs will also be given the same problems

2719
01:46:27,561 --> 01:46:31,801
the same time period, um, and the outputs will have to be graded by the same judges.

2720
01:46:31,801 --> 01:46:34,167
Um, um, and.

2721
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:34,261
..

2722
01:46:34,261 --> 01:46:37,601
Which means it will have to be written in natural language rather than formal language.

2723
01:46:37,601 --> 01:46:39,041
Oh, I hope that happens.

2724
01:46:39,041 --> 01:46:39,121
Yeah.

2725
01:46:39,121 --> 01:46:40,801
I hope that this IMO it happens.

2726
01:46:40,801 --> 01:46:41,861
I hope, I hope next one.

2727
01:46:41,861 --> 01:46:41,946
It's.

2728
01:46:41,946 --> 01:46:41,981
..

2729
01:46:41,981 --> 01:46:43,361
It won't happen this IMO.

2730
01:46:43,361 --> 01:46:46,561
The performance is not good enough in- in the time period and- and

2731
01:46:46,561 --> 01:46:47,581
uh, um.

2732
01:46:47,581 --> 01:46:47,741
..

2733
01:46:47,741 --> 01:46:50,053
But there are smaller competitions, uh.

2734
01:46:50,053 --> 01:46:50,181
..

2735
01:46:50,181 --> 01:46:54,941
There are competitions where the- the answer is a- is a number rather than a- a long form proof.

2736
01:46:54,941 --> 01:46:57,183
Um, and that's- that's.

2737
01:46:57,183 --> 01:46:57,321
..

2738
01:46:57,321 --> 01:46:59,641
Um, AI is actually a lot better at

2739
01:46:59,641 --> 01:47:02,321
um, problems where there's a specific numerical answer

2740
01:47:02,321 --> 01:47:05,241
um, because it's- it's- it's easy to- to- to- uh

2741
01:47:05,241 --> 01:47:07,101
to reinforce, do reinforcement learning on it.

2742
01:47:07,101 --> 01:47:08,641
Yeah, you got the right answer, you got the wrong answer.

2743
01:47:08,641 --> 01:47:10,361
Uh, it's- it's- it's a very clear signal.

2744
01:47:10,361 --> 01:47:13,801
But a long form proof either has to be formal and then you.

2745
01:47:13,801 --> 01:47:13,881
..

2746
01:47:13,881 --> 01:47:15,841
Uh, the Lean can give it thumbs up/thumbs down

2747
01:47:15,841 --> 01:47:19,721
or it's informal, um, but then you need a human to grade it- Mm-hmm.

2748
01:47:19,721 --> 01:47:19,721
.

2749
01:47:19,721 --> 01:47:19,721
.

2750
01:47:19,721 --> 01:47:20,095
to tell.

2751
01:47:20,095 --> 01:47:20,181
..

2752
01:47:20,181 --> 01:47:23,801
Uh, and if you're trying to do billions of- of reinforcement learning

2753
01:47:23,801 --> 01:47:26,541
um, you know, um, um, runs

2754
01:47:26,541 --> 01:47:27,067
you're not.

2755
01:47:27,067 --> 01:47:27,141
..

2756
01:47:27,141 --> 01:47:28,741
you can't hire enough humans to, uh

2757
01:47:28,741 --> 01:47:29,841
to grade those.

2758
01:47:29,841 --> 01:47:37,181
Um, I mean, it's already hard enough for- for the large language models to do reinforcement learning on- on just the- the regular text that- that people get.

2759
01:47:37,181 --> 01:47:43,241
But now if you actually hire people not just to give thumbs up/thumbs down but actually check the- the output mathematically

2760
01:47:43,241 --> 01:47:45,261
yeah, uh, that's too expensive.

2761
01:47:45,261 --> 01:47:48,821
So if we, uh, just explore this possible future

2762
01:47:48,821 --> 01:47:53,741
what- what- what is the thing that humans do that's most special in

2763
01:47:53,741 --> 01:47:55,445
um, in mathematics so.

2764
01:47:55,445 --> 01:47:55,581
..

2765
01:47:55,581 --> 01:48:00,301
That you could see AI, uh, not cracking for a while?

2766
01:48:00,301 --> 01:48:02,421
So i- inventing new theories?

2767
01:48:02,421 --> 01:48:05,341
So coming up with new conjectures versus, uh

2768
01:48:05,341 --> 01:48:06,881
proving the conjectures?

2769
01:48:06,881 --> 01:48:08,101
Right.

2770
01:48:08,101 --> 01:48:09,661
Building new abstractions?

2771
01:48:09,661 --> 01:48:11,161
New representations?

2772
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:14,601
Maybe, uh, in AI Terrence style with

2773
01:48:14,601 --> 01:48:17,221
uh, seeing new connections between disparate fields?

2774
01:48:17,221 --> 01:48:18,501
It's a good question.

2775
01:48:18,501 --> 01:48:21,681
Um, I- I think the nature of what mathematicians do over time has changed a lot.

2776
01:48:21,681 --> 01:48:24,029
Um, you know, um, so 1

2777
01:48:24,029 --> 01:48:27,001
000 years ago, mathematicians had to compute the date of Easter

2778
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:29,561
uh, and there was really complicated, uh

2779
01:48:29,561 --> 01:48:31,921
calculations, you know, but it's all automated

2780
01:48:31,921 --> 01:48:33,001
been automated for centuries.

2781
01:48:33,001 --> 01:48:34,321
Uh, we don't need that anymore.

2782
01:48:34,321 --> 01:48:37,441
You know, they used to navigate, to do spherical navigation

2783
01:48:37,441 --> 01:48:39,621
spherical trigonometry, to navigate how to get from-from

2784
01:48:39,621 --> 01:48:41,461
um, the old world to the new or something

2785
01:48:41,461 --> 01:48:44,141
uh, very complicated calculations, again, been automated.

2786
01:48:44,141 --> 01:48:47,981
Um, you know, even a lot of undergraduate mathematics

2787
01:48:47,981 --> 01:48:51,021
even before AI, um, like Wolfram|Alpha for example

2788
01:48:51,021 --> 01:48:54,821
uh, is- is not a language model but it can solve a lot of undergraduate level math tasks.

2789
01:48:54,821 --> 01:49:00,381
So on the computational side, verifying routine things like having a- a problem and

2790
01:49:00,381 --> 01:49:03,001
um, and say, "Here's a problem in partial differential equations.

2791
01:49:03,001 --> 01:49:05,337
Could you solve it using any of the 20 standard techniques?

2792
01:49:05,337 --> 01:49:06,321
" Um, and- Mm-hmm.

2793
01:49:06,321 --> 01:49:06,321
.

2794
01:49:06,321 --> 01:49:06,321
.

2795
01:49:06,321 --> 01:49:06,881
they are.

2796
01:49:06,881 --> 01:49:06,941
..

2797
01:49:06,941 --> 01:49:11,321
Yes, I've tried all 20 and here are the 100 different permutations and- and here's my results.

2798
01:49:11,321 --> 01:49:14,621
Um, and th- that type of thing I think will work very well.

2799
01:49:14,621 --> 01:49:17,433
Um, type of scaling to once you solve one-.

2800
01:49:17,433 --> 01:49:17,631
..

2801
01:49:17,631 --> 01:49:21,091
problem to, to a- make the AI attack a hundred adjacent problems.

2802
01:49:21,091 --> 01:49:25,511
Um, the things that humans do still

2803
01:49:25,511 --> 01:49:28,771
uh, is also where the AI really struggles right now

2804
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:31,391
um, is knowing when it's made a wrong turn

2805
01:49:31,391 --> 01:49:34,451
um, that it can say, "Oh, I'm gonna solve this problem.

2806
01:49:34,451 --> 01:49:36,471
I'm gonna split up this one into, um

2807
01:49:36,471 --> 01:49:37,771
into these two cases.

2808
01:49:37,771 --> 01:49:38,802
I'm gonna try this technique.

2809
01:49:38,802 --> 01:49:42,651
" And, um, sometimes if you're lucky and it- it's a simple problem

2810
01:49:42,651 --> 01:49:45,211
it's the right technique and you solve the problem and sometimes it will

2811
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:45,597
it will get.

2812
01:49:45,597 --> 01:49:45,751
..

2813
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:49,871
it will have a prob- it would, it would propose an approach which is just complete nonsense.

2814
01:49:49,871 --> 01:49:53,411
Um, and but, like, it looks like a proof.

2815
01:49:53,411 --> 01:49:57,171
Um, so this is one annoying thing about LLM-generated mathematics.

2816
01:49:57,171 --> 01:49:59,412
S- so, um- Yeah.

2817
01:49:59,412 --> 01:49:59,465
.

2818
01:49:59,465 --> 01:49:59,572
..

2819
01:49:59,572 --> 01:50:02,372
we, we've, we've had human-generated mathematics that's very low quality

2820
01:50:02,372 --> 01:50:06,592
um, uh, like, you know, su- submissions maybe who don't have the formal training and so forth.

2821
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:10,432
But if a human proof is bad, you can tell it's bad pretty quickly.

2822
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:10,591
Mm-hmm.

2823
01:50:10,591 --> 01:50:12,191
It makes really basic mistakes.

2824
01:50:12,191 --> 01:50:17,472
But the AI-generated proofs, they can look superficially flawless- Yeah.

2825
01:50:17,472 --> 01:50:17,472
.

2826
01:50:17,472 --> 01:50:17,472
.

2827
01:50:17,472 --> 01:50:20,831
uh, and it's partly because that's what the reinforcement learning has actually trained them to do

2828
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:21,888
uh, to, to make things.

2829
01:50:21,888 --> 01:50:21,951
..

2830
01:50:21,951 --> 01:50:24,591
to, to produce text that looks like c- um

2831
01:50:24,591 --> 01:50:27,312
uh, what is correct, which for many applications is good enough.

2832
01:50:27,312 --> 01:50:31,651
Um, uh, so the errors are often really subtle and then when you spot them

2833
01:50:31,651 --> 01:50:32,871
they- they're really stupid.

2834
01:50:32,871 --> 01:50:33,916
Um, like, you know, they.

2835
01:50:33,916 --> 01:50:34,031
..

2836
01:50:34,031 --> 01:50:35,871
like, no human would have actually made that mistake.

2837
01:50:35,871 --> 01:50:38,811
Yeah, it's actually really frustrating in the programming context because I

2838
01:50:38,811 --> 01:50:40,112
I program a lot and- Mm-hmm.

2839
01:50:40,112 --> 01:50:42,371
Yeah, when a human makes.

2840
01:50:42,371 --> 01:50:42,551
..

2841
01:50:42,551 --> 01:50:46,051
when a low-quality code, there's something called code smell

2842
01:50:46,051 --> 01:50:46,371
right?

2843
01:50:46,371 --> 01:50:46,631
Mm-hmm.

2844
01:50:46,631 --> 01:50:46,651
Yes.

2845
01:50:46,651 --> 01:50:46,651
Yeah.

2846
01:50:46,651 --> 01:50:46,672
Yeah.

2847
01:50:46,672 --> 01:50:47,091
You can tell.

2848
01:50:47,091 --> 01:50:49,708
You can tell immediately like, "Okay, there's signs.

2849
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:50,211
" Right.

2850
01:50:50,211 --> 01:50:50,231
Yeah, yeah.

2851
01:50:50,231 --> 01:50:52,851
But with, with AI-generated code- Odorous.

2852
01:50:52,851 --> 01:50:52,884
.

2853
01:50:52,884 --> 01:50:52,952
..

2854
01:50:52,952 --> 01:50:54,131
and then you're right- Yeah.

2855
01:50:54,131 --> 01:50:54,137
.

2856
01:50:54,137 --> 01:50:54,151
..

2857
01:50:54,151 --> 01:50:58,612
eventually you find an obvious dumb thing that just looks- Yeah.

2858
01:50:58,612 --> 01:50:58,625
.

2859
01:50:58,625 --> 01:50:58,651
..

2860
01:50:58,651 --> 01:50:59,552
like good code.

2861
01:50:59,552 --> 01:51:00,071
Yeah.

2862
01:51:00,071 --> 01:51:01,811
So, um- It's very tricky to.

2863
01:51:01,811 --> 01:51:01,971
..

2864
01:51:01,971 --> 01:51:04,092
and frustrating for some reason to- Yeah.

2865
01:51:04,092 --> 01:51:04,412
So- .

2866
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:04,412
..

2867
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:05,212
 have to work.

2868
01:51:05,212 --> 01:51:06,532
Yeah, so the sense of smell.

2869
01:51:06,532 --> 01:51:07,772
Yes, yes.

2870
01:51:07,772 --> 01:51:09,251
This, this is, this is one thing that humans have

2871
01:51:09,251 --> 01:51:13,571
um, and it, it, there's a metaphor called mathematical smell that- Yeah.

2872
01:51:13,571 --> 01:51:13,671
.

2873
01:51:13,671 --> 01:51:13,871
..

2874
01:51:13,871 --> 01:51:15,603
uh, there's.

2875
01:51:15,603 --> 01:51:15,671
..

2876
01:51:15,671 --> 01:51:15,803
we.

2877
01:51:15,803 --> 01:51:15,891
..

2878
01:51:15,891 --> 01:51:18,331
it's not clear how to get the AIs to duplicate that.

2879
01:51:18,331 --> 01:51:21,791
Eventually, um, I mean so the, the

2880
01:51:21,791 --> 01:51:25,131
the way, um, AlphaZero and so forth that make progress on Go and

2881
01:51:25,131 --> 01:51:30,111
and chess and so forth is, is in some sense they have developed a sense of smell for Go and chess positions- Mm-hmm.

2882
01:51:30,111 --> 01:51:30,117
.

2883
01:51:30,117 --> 01:51:30,131
..

2884
01:51:30,131 --> 01:51:31,871
that, that this position is good for white

2885
01:51:31,871 --> 01:51:32,611
this good for black.

2886
01:51:32,611 --> 01:51:36,731
Um, they can't enunciate why, um, but just having that

2887
01:51:36,731 --> 01:51:40,131
that sense of smell lets them strategize.

2888
01:51:40,131 --> 01:51:45,411
So if AIs gain that ability to sort of assess the viability of certain proof strategies

2889
01:51:45,411 --> 01:51:47,871
so, so you can say, "I'm going to try to

2890
01:51:47,871 --> 01:51:51,151
to break up this problem into two small sub-tasks" and they can say

2891
01:51:51,151 --> 01:51:52,571
"Oh, this looks good.

2892
01:51:52,571 --> 01:51:55,211
The, the two tasks look like they're simpler tasks than

2893
01:51:55,211 --> 01:51:57,651
than your main task and they still got a good chance of being true

2894
01:51:57,651 --> 01:51:59,387
um, so this is good to try

2895
01:51:59,387 --> 01:52:04,317
" or, "No, you've, you've, you made the problem worse because each of the two sub-problems is actually harder than your original problem

2896
01:52:04,317 --> 01:52:06,991
" which is actually what normally happens if you try a random

2897
01:52:06,991 --> 01:52:08,291
uh, thing to try.

2898
01:52:08,291 --> 01:52:09,221
Normally you actually.

2899
01:52:09,221 --> 01:52:09,291
..

2900
01:52:09,291 --> 01:52:11,751
it's very easy to transform a problem into an even harder problem.

2901
01:52:11,751 --> 01:52:12,171
Mm-hmm.

2902
01:52:12,171 --> 01:52:13,579
Very rarely do you problem.

2903
01:52:13,579 --> 01:52:13,631
..

2904
01:52:13,631 --> 01:52:14,931
transform to a simpler problem.

2905
01:52:14,931 --> 01:52:19,311
Um, yeah, so if they can pick up a sense of smell

2906
01:52:19,311 --> 01:52:22,611
then they could maybe start competing with, uh

2907
01:52:22,611 --> 01:52:24,271
uh, human-level mathematicians.

2908
01:52:24,271 --> 01:52:25,751
So, so this is a hard question

2909
01:52:25,751 --> 01:52:27,751
but not competing but collaborating.

2910
01:52:27,751 --> 01:52:28,111
Yeah.

2911
01:52:28,111 --> 01:52:28,403
If.

2912
01:52:28,403 --> 01:52:28,531
..

2913
01:52:28,531 --> 01:52:29,711
okay, hypothetical.

2914
01:52:29,711 --> 01:52:37,471
If I gave you an oracle that was able to do some aspect of what you do and you could just collaborate with it- Yeah

2915
01:52:37,471 --> 01:52:37,731
yeah, yeah.

2916
01:52:37,731 --> 01:52:37,757
.

2917
01:52:37,757 --> 01:52:37,811
..

2918
01:52:37,811 --> 01:52:38,928
what would that oracle.

2919
01:52:38,928 --> 01:52:39,071
..

2920
01:52:39,071 --> 01:52:41,011
what would you like that oracle to be able to do?

2921
01:52:41,011 --> 01:52:44,611
Would you like it to, uh, maybe be a verifier

2922
01:52:44,611 --> 01:52:45,991
like check- Mm-hmm.

2923
01:52:45,991 --> 01:52:45,997
.

2924
01:52:45,997 --> 01:52:46,011
..

2925
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:47,793
do the code sme- like your.

2926
01:52:47,793 --> 01:52:47,891
..

2927
01:52:47,891 --> 01:52:51,907
yes, uh, Professor Tsao, this is the correct.

2928
01:52:51,907 --> 01:52:51,991
..

2929
01:52:51,991 --> 01:52:52,473
this is a good.

2930
01:52:52,473 --> 01:52:52,531
..

2931
01:52:52,531 --> 01:52:55,091
this is a p- promising fruitful direction- Yeah

2932
01:52:55,091 --> 01:52:55,571
yeah, yeah.

2933
01:52:55,571 --> 01:52:57,691
Or, or would you like it to

2934
01:52:57,691 --> 01:53:03,671
uh, generate possible proofs and then you see which one is the right one- Mm-hmm.

2935
01:53:03,671 --> 01:53:07,931
Um, or would you like it to maybe generate different representation

2936
01:53:07,931 --> 01:53:08,297
different.

2937
01:53:08,297 --> 01:53:08,371
..

2938
01:53:08,371 --> 01:53:10,591
totally different ways of seeing this problem?

2939
01:53:10,591 --> 01:53:10,851
Yeah.

2940
01:53:10,851 --> 01:53:11,931
I think all of the above.

2941
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:15,591
Um, a l- a lot of it is we don't know how to use these tools because it

2942
01:53:15,591 --> 01:53:17,371
it's a paradigm that i- is not.

2943
01:53:17,371 --> 01:53:17,611
..

2944
01:53:17,611 --> 01:53:25,451
um, yeah, we have not had in the past assistants that are competent enough to understand complex instructions- Mm-hmm.

2945
01:53:25,451 --> 01:53:25,551
.

2946
01:53:25,551 --> 01:53:25,751
..

2947
01:53:25,751 --> 01:53:29,571
um, that can work at massive scale but are also unreliable.

2948
01:53:29,571 --> 01:53:32,311
 Uh, like it's, it's an interesting

2949
01:53:32,311 --> 01:53:35,575
uh, a b- bit unreliable in subtle ways whilst we.

2950
01:53:35,575 --> 01:53:35,711
..

2951
01:53:35,711 --> 01:53:37,651
whilst providing s- sufficiently good output.

2952
01:53:37,651 --> 01:53:40,091
Um, it's a interesting combination.

2953
01:53:40,091 --> 01:53:42,891
Um, you know, I mean, you have r- you have

2954
01:53:42,891 --> 01:53:46,511
like, graduate students who you work with who are kind of like this but n- not as scaled.

2955
01:53:46,511 --> 01:53:50,571
Um, you know, and, and, and with previous software tools that

2956
01:53:50,571 --> 01:53:53,131
um, can work at scale but, but very narrow.

2957
01:53:53,131 --> 01:53:55,411
Um, so we have to figure out how to

2958
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:56,395
how to use, um.

2959
01:53:56,395 --> 01:53:56,571
..

2960
01:53:56,571 --> 01:53:59,571
I mean, um, so Tim Kao, actually you mentioned

2961
01:53:59,571 --> 01:54:04,911
he actually f- foresaw like in, in 2000 he was envisioning what mathematics would look like in

2962
01:54:04,911 --> 01:54:07,031
in actually two and a half decades.

2963
01:54:07,031 --> 01:54:09,351
  That's funny.

2964
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:10,524
And, yeah, he, he wrote in his.

2965
01:54:10,524 --> 01:54:10,611
..

2966
01:54:10,611 --> 01:54:12,111
in, in his article, uh, like a

2967
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:16,131
a, a hypothetical conversation between a mathematical assistant of the future

2968
01:54:16,131 --> 01:54:19,451
um, and himself, you know, trying to solve a problem and they would have

2969
01:54:19,451 --> 01:54:22,111
have a conversation that sometimes the human would

2970
01:54:22,111 --> 01:54:23,691
would propose an idea and the AI would

2971
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:26,891
would evaluate it and sometimes the AI would propose an idea

2972
01:54:26,891 --> 01:54:31,271
um, and, uh, and sometimes a competition was required and the AI would just go and say

2973
01:54:31,271 --> 01:54:33,594
"Okay, I've, I've checked the, the 100 cases needed here.

2974
01:54:33,594 --> 01:54:36,011
" Or, um, uh, "The first, uh

2975
01:54:36,011 --> 01:54:36,427
uh.

2976
01:54:36,427 --> 01:54:36,451
..

2977
01:54:36,451 --> 01:54:39,191
you, you said this is true for all and I've checked up to 100

2978
01:54:39,191 --> 01:54:40,575
um, and it looks good so far.

2979
01:54:40,575 --> 01:54:42,601
" Or, "Hang on, there's a problem at N equals 46.

2980
01:54:42,601 --> 01:54:49,711
" And so just a freeform conversation where you don't know in advance where things are going to go but just based on

2981
01:54:49,711 --> 01:54:51,871
on I think ideas are good proposed on both sides

2982
01:54:51,871 --> 01:54:53,411
calculations are good proposed on both sides.

2983
01:54:53,411 --> 01:54:56,611
I've had conversations with AI where I say

2984
01:54:56,611 --> 01:54:57,061
"Okay, let's.

2985
01:54:57,061 --> 01:54:57,131
..

2986
01:54:57,131 --> 01:54:58,724
we're going to collaborate to, to solve this math problem

2987
01:54:58,724 --> 01:55:00,531
" and it's a problem that I already k- know the solution to

2988
01:55:00,531 --> 01:55:02,011
so I, I try to prompt it

2989
01:55:02,011 --> 01:55:02,851
"Okay, so here's the problem.

2990
01:55:02,851 --> 01:55:04,094
I, I suggest using this tool.

2991
01:55:04,094 --> 01:55:08,511
" And then it'll find this, this lovely argument using a completely different tool e- which eventually goes

2992
01:55:08,511 --> 01:55:09,391
you know, into the weeds and say

2993
01:55:09,391 --> 01:55:10,654
"No, no, no, try using this.

2994
01:55:10,654 --> 01:55:13,191
" Okay, and it might start using this and then it'll go back to the

2995
01:55:13,191 --> 01:55:14,031
the tool that it wanted to, to

2996
01:55:14,031 --> 01:55:14,651
to do before.

2997
01:55:14,651 --> 01:55:17,731
Um, and, like, you have to keep railroading it

2998
01:55:17,731 --> 01:55:19,211
um, onto the path you want and I

2999
01:55:19,211 --> 01:55:21,033
I could eventually force it-.

3000
01:55:21,033 --> 01:55:21,295
..

3001
01:55:21,295 --> 01:55:22,215
to get the proof I wanted.

3002
01:55:22,215 --> 01:55:24,696
Um, but it was like herding cats

3003
01:55:24,696 --> 01:55:27,775
um, like and the amount of personal effort I had to take to

3004
01:55:27,775 --> 01:55:30,555
not just to prompt it, but also check its output

3005
01:55:30,555 --> 01:55:32,755
because it, like a lot of what it looked like it was going to work

3006
01:55:32,755 --> 01:55:34,576
and I know there's a problem on line 17.

3007
01:55:34,576 --> 01:55:37,615
And I, basically arguing with it 

3008
01:55:37,615 --> 01:55:41,255
um, like it was more exhausting than doing it unassisted.

3009
01:55:41,255 --> 01:55:41,812
So like it.

3010
01:55:41,812 --> 01:55:41,916
..

3011
01:55:41,916 --> 01:55:43,895
But that's the current state of the art.

3012
01:55:43,895 --> 01:55:54,315
I wonder if there's, there's a phase shift that happens to where it no longer feels like herding cats and m- maybe it'll surprise us how quickly that comes

3013
01:55:54,315 --> 01:55:54,595
you know?

3014
01:55:54,595 --> 01:55:55,555
I, I, I believe so.

3015
01:55:55,555 --> 01:55:58,195
Um, so in formalization, like I mentioned before

3016
01:55:58,195 --> 01:56:01,236
that it takes ten times longer to formalize a proof than to write it by hand.

3017
01:56:01,236 --> 01:56:04,035
With these modern AI tools, it's, uh

3018
01:56:04,035 --> 01:56:06,036
and also just better tooling, it's, um

3019
01:56:06,036 --> 01:56:12,055
the Lean, um, um, developers are doing a great job adding more and more features and making it user-friendly.

3020
01:56:12,055 --> 01:56:14,275
Uh, it's going from nine to eight to seven

3021
01:56:14,275 --> 01:56:15,355
okay, no big deal.

3022
01:56:15,355 --> 01:56:17,615
But one day it will drop below one

3023
01:56:17,615 --> 01:56:21,495
um, and that's a phase shift because suddenly

3024
01:56:21,495 --> 01:56:24,935
um, it makes sense when you write a paper

3025
01:56:24,935 --> 01:56:26,875
to, to write it in Lean first

3026
01:56:26,875 --> 01:56:29,595
uh, or through a conversation with AI who's generating Lean

3027
01:56:29,595 --> 01:56:30,835
um, on the fly with you.

3028
01:56:30,835 --> 01:56:33,895
And it becomes natural for journals to accept

3029
01:56:33,895 --> 01:56:37,175
uh, maybe they'll offer expedite refereeing, you know

3030
01:56:37,175 --> 01:56:39,175
like if, if a paper has already been formalized in

3031
01:56:39,175 --> 01:56:42,695
in, in Lean, um, they'll just ask the referee to comment on

3032
01:56:42,695 --> 01:56:46,055
on the significance of the results and how it connects to literature

3033
01:56:46,055 --> 01:56:48,095
and not worry so much about the correctness

3034
01:56:48,095 --> 01:56:49,975
um, because it, that's been certified.

3035
01:56:49,975 --> 01:56:55,495
Um, papers are getting longer and longer in mathematics and it gets harder and harder to get good ref- refereeing for

3036
01:56:55,495 --> 01:56:57,835
um, the, the really long ones, unless they're really important.

3037
01:56:57,835 --> 01:57:00,425
Uh, it, it is actually an issue which.

3038
01:57:00,425 --> 01:57:00,555
..

3039
01:57:00,555 --> 01:57:02,435
And the formalization is coming at just the right time

3040
01:57:02,435 --> 01:57:07,295
for this to be- And easier and easier it gets because of the tooling and all the other factors- Right.

3041
01:57:07,295 --> 01:57:07,295
.

3042
01:57:07,295 --> 01:57:07,295
.

3043
01:57:07,295 --> 01:57:11,575
then you're going to see much more like Mathlib will grow- Right.

3044
01:57:11,575 --> 01:57:11,588
.

3045
01:57:11,588 --> 01:57:11,615
..

3046
01:57:11,615 --> 01:57:12,695
potentially exponentially.

3047
01:57:12,695 --> 01:57:13,075
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3048
01:57:13,075 --> 01:57:14,955
It's, uh, it's a, it's a virtuous

3049
01:57:14,955 --> 01:57:16,175
uh, cycle, okay.

3050
01:57:16,175 --> 01:57:19,635
I mean, one phase shift of this type that happened in the past was the adoption of LaTeX.

3051
01:57:19,635 --> 01:57:20,135
Mm-hmm.

3052
01:57:20,135 --> 01:57:23,275
So, so LaTeX is, is typesetting language that all mathematicians use now.

3053
01:57:23,275 --> 01:57:26,975
So in the past people used all kinds of word processors and typewriters and

3054
01:57:26,975 --> 01:57:27,495
and whatever.

3055
01:57:27,495 --> 01:57:32,195
But at some point, LaTeX became easier to use than all other competitors.

3056
01:57:32,195 --> 01:57:33,975
And like people would switch, you know

3057
01:57:33,975 --> 01:57:36,135
within a few years, like it was just a dramatic

3058
01:57:36,135 --> 01:57:37,375
um, phase shift.

3059
01:57:37,375 --> 01:57:40,515
It's a wild out there question, but what

3060
01:57:40,515 --> 01:57:46,155
what year, how far away are we from a

3061
01:57:46,155 --> 01:57:53,135
uh, AI system being a collaborator on a proof that wins the Fields Medal?

3062
01:57:53,135 --> 01:57:54,355
 Or that level?

3063
01:57:54,355 --> 01:57:55,755
Okay.

3064
01:57:55,755 --> 01:57:58,075
Um, well it depends on the level of collaboration

3065
01:57:58,075 --> 01:58:00,555
I mean- No, like it deserves to be- Right.

3066
01:58:00,555 --> 01:58:00,555
.

3067
01:58:00,555 --> 01:58:00,555
.

3068
01:58:00,555 --> 01:58:03,175
to get the Fields Medal, like so half and half .

3069
01:58:03,175 --> 01:58:03,275
Okay.

3070
01:58:03,275 --> 01:58:08,755
Already, like I c- I can imagine a Fields Medal winning paper having some AI assistance in writing it

3071
01:58:08,755 --> 01:58:12,175
you know, uh, just you know, like the autocomplete alone is already.

3072
01:58:12,175 --> 01:58:12,255
..

3073
01:58:12,255 --> 01:58:13,895
I, I, I use it, like it speeds up my

3074
01:58:13,895 --> 01:58:14,575
my own writing.

3075
01:58:14,575 --> 01:58:16,815
Um, um, like you know, you

3076
01:58:16,815 --> 01:58:20,475
you could have a theorem and you have a proof and the proof has three cases and I

3077
01:58:20,475 --> 01:58:22,995
I, I write down the proof of the first case and the autocomplete just suggests

3078
01:58:22,995 --> 01:58:25,441
"Oh, now here's how the proof of the second case could work

3079
01:58:25,441 --> 01:58:27,335
" and like it was exactly correct, and that was great.

3080
01:58:27,335 --> 01:58:29,035
Saved me like five, ten minutes of

3081
01:58:29,035 --> 01:58:30,315
uh, of typing.

3082
01:58:30,315 --> 01:58:33,375
But in that case the AI system doesn't get the Fields Medal?

3083
01:58:33,375 --> 01:58:33,735
No.

3084
01:58:33,735 --> 01:58:36,055
 Uh.

3085
01:58:36,055 --> 01:58:36,055
..

3086
01:58:36,055 --> 01:58:40,315
are we talking 20 years, 50 years

3087
01:58:40,315 --> 01:58:41,235
100 years?

3088
01:58:41,235 --> 01:58:41,855
What do you think?

3089
01:58:41,855 --> 01:58:42,215
Okay.

3090
01:58:42,215 --> 01:58:44,615
Uh, so I, I gave a prediction in print

3091
01:58:44,615 --> 01:58:46,395
it was about 2026 which is now next year.

3092
01:58:46,395 --> 01:58:50,315
Um, there will be math collaborations, you know

3093
01:58:50,315 --> 01:58:51,015
with AI.

3094
01:58:51,015 --> 01:58:56,355
So not Fields Medal winning but, but like actual research level math papers- Like published ideas that are- Yeah.

3095
01:58:56,355 --> 01:58:56,381
.

3096
01:58:56,381 --> 01:58:56,435
..

3097
01:58:56,435 --> 01:58:57,755
in part generated by AI.

3098
01:58:57,755 --> 01:59:01,035
Um, maybe not the ideas but at least some of the computations

3099
01:59:01,035 --> 01:59:03,895
um, um, the verifications, yeah.

3100
01:59:03,895 --> 01:59:05,415
I mean, there, there are- Has that already happened?

3101
01:59:05,415 --> 01:59:06,515
It's already happened, yeah.

3102
01:59:06,515 --> 01:59:09,135
There, there are, there are problems that were solved

3103
01:59:09,135 --> 01:59:13,035
uh, by a complicated process con- conversing with

3104
01:59:13,035 --> 01:59:15,615
with AI to propose things and then the human goes and tries it and it

3105
01:59:15,615 --> 01:59:18,115
and the contract doesn't work, um, but the

3106
01:59:18,115 --> 01:59:20,655
it might pose a different idea, um

3107
01:59:20,655 --> 01:59:23,235
it, it's hard to disentangle exactly.

3108
01:59:23,235 --> 01:59:29,335
Um, there are certainly math results which could only have been accomplished because there was a math

3109
01:59:29,335 --> 01:59:31,515
method, human mathematician and an AI involved.

3110
01:59:31,515 --> 01:59:35,755
Um, but it's hard to sort of disentangle credit.

3111
01:59:35,755 --> 01:59:41,115
Um, I mean these tools, they, they do not

3112
01:59:41,115 --> 01:59:44,235
uh, replicate all the skills needed to do mathematics.

3113
01:59:44,235 --> 01:59:47,355
But they can replicate sort of some non-trivial percentage of them

3114
01:59:47,355 --> 01:59:48,435
you know, 30, 40%.

3115
01:59:48,435 --> 01:59:50,435
So they can fill in gaps, um

3116
01:59:50,435 --> 01:59:53,195
you know, so uh, coding is, is

3117
01:59:53,195 --> 01:59:54,955
is a good example, you know, so I

3118
01:59:54,955 --> 01:59:59,135
I, um, um, it's annoying for me to code in Python and I'm not

3119
01:59:59,135 --> 02:00:02,515
I'm not a native, um, I'm not a professional programmer.

3120
02:00:02,515 --> 02:00:09,255
Um, but um, the- with AI the fr- the friction cost of doing it is much reduced.

3121
02:00:09,255 --> 02:00:11,355
Uh, so it fills in that gap for me.

3122
02:00:11,355 --> 02:00:15,035
Um, AI is getting quite good at literature review.

3123
02:00:15,035 --> 02:00:17,015
Um, I mean there's still a problem with

3124
02:00:17,015 --> 02:00:19,935
um, hallucinating, you know, references that don't exist.

3125
02:00:19,935 --> 02:00:22,775
Um, but this I think is a solvable problem.

3126
02:00:22,775 --> 02:00:25,255
If you train in the right way and so forth

3127
02:00:25,255 --> 02:00:26,421
you can, you can.

3128
02:00:26,421 --> 02:00:26,495
..

3129
02:00:26,495 --> 02:00:29,615
And um, and verify, um, using the internet.

3130
02:00:29,615 --> 02:00:37,515
Um, you should in a few years get to the point where you have a lemma that you need and say

3131
02:00:37,515 --> 02:00:38,910
"Has anyone proven this lemma before?

3132
02:00:38,910 --> 02:00:42,735
" And it will do basically a fancy web search AI system to say

3133
02:00:42,735 --> 02:00:45,815
"Yeah, yeah, there are these six papers where something similar has happened.

3134
02:00:45,815 --> 02:00:47,192
" And I mean it will.

3135
02:00:47,192 --> 02:00:47,255
..

3136
02:00:47,255 --> 02:00:51,635
You can ask it right now and it will give you six papers of which maybe one is legitimate and relevant

3137
02:00:51,635 --> 02:00:54,575
one exists but is not relevant, and four are hallucinated.

3138
02:00:54,575 --> 02:00:57,815
Um, it has a non-zero success rate right now

3139
02:00:57,815 --> 02:01:00,832
but there's so much garbage, so much.

3140
02:01:00,832 --> 02:01:00,895
..

3141
02:01:00,895 --> 02:01:02,815
The signal to noise ratio is so poor that it's

3142
02:01:02,815 --> 02:01:04,003
it's, um.

3143
02:01:04,003 --> 02:01:04,155
..

3144
02:01:04,155 --> 02:01:07,995
It's most helpful when you already somewhat know the literature

3145
02:01:07,995 --> 02:01:13,935
um, and you just need to be prompted to be reminded of a paper that was already subconsciously in your memory.

3146
02:01:13,935 --> 02:01:19,155
Versus helping you discover new you were not even aware of what is the correct citation.

3147
02:01:19,155 --> 02:01:20,130
Yeah, that's.

3148
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:20,255
..

3149
02:01:20,255 --> 02:01:22,335
Yeah, that it can sometimes do but

3150
02:01:22,335 --> 02:01:26,575
but when it does it's, it's buried in a list of options which the other- That are bad.

3151
02:01:26,575 --> 02:01:26,975
Yeah.

3152
02:01:26,975 --> 02:01:30,635
I mean being able to automatically generate a related work section

3153
02:01:30,635 --> 02:01:32,320
that is correct- Yeah.

3154
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:37,883
That's actually a beautiful thing, that might be another phase shift because it assigns credit correctly.

3155
02:01:37,883 --> 02:01:38,464
Yeah, yeah.

3156
02:01:38,464 --> 02:01:41,084
It does, it breaks you out of the silos of- Yeah

3157
02:01:41,084 --> 02:01:41,730
yeah, yeah, no- .

3158
02:01:41,730 --> 02:01:41,784
..

3159
02:01:41,784 --> 02:01:42,323
thought, you know?

3160
02:01:42,323 --> 02:01:45,463
Yeah, no but it, it, there's a big hump to overcome right now.

3161
02:01:45,463 --> 02:01:47,223
I mean, it's, it's like self-driving cars

3162
02:01:47,223 --> 02:01:48,263
you know?

3163
02:01:48,263 --> 02:01:48,284
Right.

3164
02:01:48,284 --> 02:01:50,983
It, it, the safety margin, it has to be really high- Yeah.

3165
02:01:50,983 --> 02:01:50,983
.

3166
02:01:50,983 --> 02:01:50,983
.

3167
02:01:50,983 --> 02:01:53,124
for it to be, um, uh, to be feasible.

3168
02:01:53,124 --> 02:01:54,843
So yeah, so there's a last mile problem

3169
02:01:54,843 --> 02:01:56,823
um, with a lot of AI applications

3170
02:01:56,823 --> 02:02:01,663
um, that, uh, you know, they can develop tools that work 20%

3171
02:02:01,663 --> 02:02:04,664
80% of the time, but it's still not good enough

3172
02:02:04,664 --> 02:02:08,043
um, and in fact even worse than good in some ways.

3173
02:02:08,043 --> 02:02:16,103
I mean, another way of asking the field's mental question is what year do you think you'll wake up and be like real surprised?

3174
02:02:16,103 --> 02:02:20,203
You read the headline, the news or something happened that AI did

3175
02:02:20,203 --> 02:02:23,643
like, you know, real breakthrough, something.

3176
02:02:23,643 --> 02:02:26,423
It doesn't, you know, like field's metal or even hypothesis

3177
02:02:26,423 --> 02:02:31,683
it could be like really just this AlphaZero moment would go

3178
02:02:31,683 --> 02:02:32,283
that kind of thing.

3179
02:02:32,283 --> 02:02:32,783
Right, right.

3180
02:02:32,783 --> 02:02:35,403
Um, yeah this, uh, this decade I can

3181
02:02:35,403 --> 02:02:40,163
I can see it like making a conjecture between two unrelated

3182
02:02:40,163 --> 02:02:42,483
two, two things that people thought was unrelated.

3183
02:02:42,483 --> 02:02:43,183
Oh, interesting.

3184
02:02:43,183 --> 02:02:45,683
Generating a conjecture, that's a beautiful conjecture.

3185
02:02:45,683 --> 02:02:45,863
Yeah.

3186
02:02:45,863 --> 02:02:48,863
And, and actually has a real chance of being correct and

3187
02:02:48,863 --> 02:02:53,303
and meaningful, and, um- Because that's actually kind of doable

3188
02:02:53,303 --> 02:02:55,343
I suppose, but where the data is

3189
02:02:55,343 --> 02:02:56,043
it's yeah.

3190
02:02:56,043 --> 02:02:56,283
Yeah.

3191
02:02:56,283 --> 02:02:58,023
Well, it's- No, that would be truly amazing.

3192
02:02:58,023 --> 02:03:00,643
 Um, the current models struggle a lot.

3193
02:03:00,643 --> 02:03:02,543
I mean, so, um, a version of this is

3194
02:03:02,543 --> 02:03:06,043
um, I mean the, the physicists have a dream of getting the AIs to discover new

3195
02:03:06,043 --> 02:03:06,863
new laws of physics.

3196
02:03:06,863 --> 02:03:11,243
Um, uh, you know, they, the dream is you just feed it all this data

3197
02:03:11,243 --> 02:03:11,743
okay?

3198
02:03:11,743 --> 02:03:13,423
Uh, uh, and, and this is a

3199
02:03:13,423 --> 02:03:15,203
here, here is a new patent that we didn't see before.

3200
02:03:15,203 --> 02:03:19,743
But it actually even struggle, the current state of the art even struggles to discover old laws of physics

3201
02:03:19,743 --> 02:03:21,183
um, from the data.

3202
02:03:21,183 --> 02:03:23,303
I mean, uh, or if it does

3203
02:03:23,303 --> 02:03:25,443
uh, there's a big concern of contamination that

3204
02:03:25,443 --> 02:03:28,983
that it did only because like somewhere in its training data it already somehow knew

3205
02:03:28,983 --> 02:03:31,783
um, you know, Boyle's Law or whatever law you

3206
02:03:31,783 --> 02:03:33,223
you're trying to, to reconstruct.

3207
02:03:33,223 --> 02:03:38,183
Um, part of it's that we don't have the right type of training data for this

3208
02:03:38,183 --> 02:03:40,423
um, you know, so for laws of physics like we

3209
02:03:40,423 --> 02:03:43,383
we don't have like a million different universes with a million different laws of nature.

3210
02:03:43,383 --> 02:03:51,543
 Um, and, um, like a lot of what we're missing in math is actually the negative space of.

3211
02:03:51,543 --> 02:03:51,663
..

3212
02:03:51,663 --> 02:03:54,583
so we have published things of things that people have been able to prove

3213
02:03:54,583 --> 02:03:57,523
um, and conjectures that ended up being verified

3214
02:03:57,523 --> 02:03:59,743
um, or maybe counter examples produced.

3215
02:03:59,743 --> 02:04:01,963
But, um, we don't have data on

3216
02:04:01,963 --> 02:04:05,323
on things that were proposed and they're kind of a good thing to try

3217
02:04:05,323 --> 02:04:09,383
but then people quickly realized that it was the wrong conjecture and then they

3218
02:04:09,383 --> 02:04:11,463
they said, "Oh, but we, we should actually change

3219
02:04:11,463 --> 02:04:13,423
um, our claim to modify it in

3220
02:04:13,423 --> 02:04:14,857
in this way to actually make it more plausible.

3221
02:04:14,857 --> 02:04:21,343
" Um, there's this, there's a trial and error process which is a real integral part of human mathematical discovery

3222
02:04:21,343 --> 02:04:23,863
which we don't record because it's, it's embarrassing.

3223
02:04:23,863 --> 02:04:26,703
Uh, we make mistakes and, and we only like to publish our

3224
02:04:26,703 --> 02:04:27,243
our wins.

3225
02:04:27,243 --> 02:04:32,363
Um, and, uh, the AI has no access to this data to tr- train on.

3226
02:04:32,363 --> 02:04:35,023
Um, I sometimes joke that basically, you know

3227
02:04:35,023 --> 02:04:36,743
AI has to go through, um, um

3228
02:04:36,743 --> 02:04:40,123
grad school and actually, you know, go to grad courses

3229
02:04:40,123 --> 02:04:41,983
do the assignments, go to office hours

3230
02:04:41,983 --> 02:04:45,983
make mistakes, um, get advice on how to correct the mistakes

3231
02:04:45,983 --> 02:04:47,183
and learn from that.

3232
02:04:47,183 --> 02:04:50,283
Let me, uh, ask you, if I may

3233
02:04:50,283 --> 02:04:52,643
about, uh, Grigori Perelman.

3234
02:04:52,643 --> 02:04:52,923
Mm-hmm.

3235
02:04:52,923 --> 02:04:58,543
You mentioned that you try to be careful in your work and not let a problem completely consume you.

3236
02:04:58,543 --> 02:05:03,483
Just, you really fall in love with the problem and it really cannot rest until you solve it.

3237
02:05:03,483 --> 02:05:08,063
But you also hasted to add that sometimes this approach actually can be very successful.

3238
02:05:08,063 --> 02:05:08,403
Mm-hmm.

3239
02:05:08,403 --> 02:05:20,083
An example you gave is Grigori Perelman who proved the Poincaré conjecture and did so by working alone for seven years with basically little contact with the outside world.

3240
02:05:20,083 --> 02:05:25,903
Can you explain this one Millennium Prize problem that has been solved

3241
02:05:25,903 --> 02:05:31,243
Poincaré conjecture, and maybe speak to the journey that Grigori Perelman's been on?

3242
02:05:31,243 --> 02:05:32,003
All right.

3243
02:05:32,003 --> 02:05:34,623
So it's, it's a question about curved spaces.

3244
02:05:34,623 --> 02:05:35,523
Earth is a good example.

3245
02:05:35,523 --> 02:05:37,003
So let's do, let's think of it as a 2D surface.

3246
02:05:37,003 --> 02:05:38,903
In just being round, you know, there could maybe

3247
02:05:38,903 --> 02:05:41,403
happy a torus with a hole in it or it can have many holes

3248
02:05:41,403 --> 02:05:45,023
and there are, there are many different topologies a priori that

3249
02:05:45,023 --> 02:05:47,743
that surface could have, even if you assume that it's

3250
02:05:47,743 --> 02:05:49,263
it's bounded and, and, uh, and

3251
02:05:49,263 --> 02:05:50,343
and smooth and so forth.

3252
02:05:50,343 --> 02:05:53,083
So we, we have figured out how to classify surfaces.

3253
02:05:53,083 --> 02:05:55,723
As a first approximation, uh, everything's determined by something called the genus

3254
02:05:55,723 --> 02:05:56,583
how many holes it has.

3255
02:05:56,583 --> 02:05:59,503
So the sphere has ze- genus zero, a donut has genus one

3256
02:05:59,503 --> 02:06:00,023
and so forth.

3257
02:06:00,023 --> 02:06:02,923
And one way you can tell these surfaces apart

3258
02:06:02,923 --> 02:06:04,823
probably the sphere has, which is called simply connected.

3259
02:06:04,823 --> 02:06:07,483
If you take any closed loop on the sphere

3260
02:06:07,483 --> 02:06:12,223
like a big closed loop rope, you can contract it to a point and while staying on the surface.

3261
02:06:12,223 --> 02:06:14,783
And the sphere has this property, but a torus doesn't.

3262
02:06:14,783 --> 02:06:18,123
And if you own a torus and you take a rope that goes around

3263
02:06:18,123 --> 02:06:19,723
say the, the outer diameter of the torus- Mm-hmm.

3264
02:06:19,723 --> 02:06:19,789
.

3265
02:06:19,789 --> 02:06:19,923
..

3266
02:06:19,923 --> 02:06:22,343
there's no way, it, it can't get through the hole.

3267
02:06:22,343 --> 02:06:24,183
There's no way to, to contract it to a point.

3268
02:06:24,183 --> 02:06:30,523
So it turns out that the, the sp- sphere is the only surface with this property of contractibility.

3269
02:06:30,523 --> 02:06:32,583
I mean up to like continuous deformations of the sphere.

3270
02:06:32,583 --> 02:06:34,763
So, um, there's things that are what are called topologically

3271
02:06:34,763 --> 02:06:36,203
um, equivalent to the sphere.

3272
02:06:36,203 --> 02:06:38,943
So Poincaré asked the same question in higher dimensions.

3273
02:06:38,943 --> 02:06:41,203
Um, so this, it becomes hard to visualize

3274
02:06:41,203 --> 02:06:44,563
uh, because, um, surface you can think of as embedded in three dimensions

3275
02:06:44,563 --> 02:06:49,163
but a, a curved three space, we don't have good intuition of 4D space to

3276
02:06:49,163 --> 02:06:49,803
to, to live in.

3277
02:06:49,803 --> 02:06:53,303
And then there are also 3D spaces that can't even fit into four dimensions.

3278
02:06:53,303 --> 02:06:55,323
You need five or six or s- or higher.

3279
02:06:55,323 --> 02:06:58,003
But anyway, uh, mathematically you can still pose this question

3280
02:06:58,003 --> 02:07:00,923
that if you have a bounded three dimensional space now

3281
02:07:00,923 --> 02:07:04,683
which is also has this simply connected property that every loop can be contracted

3282
02:07:04,683 --> 02:07:06,783
can you turn it into a three dimensional version of a sphere?

3283
02:07:06,783 --> 02:07:08,803
And so this is the Poincaré conjecture.

3284
02:07:08,803 --> 02:07:11,963
Weirdly in higher dimensions, four and five it actually was easier.

3285
02:07:11,963 --> 02:07:14,703
So the, uh, it was solved first in higher dimensions.

3286
02:07:14,703 --> 02:07:16,783
There's somehow more room to do the deformation.

3287
02:07:16,783 --> 02:07:19,283
It, it's easier to, to, to move things around to

3288
02:07:19,283 --> 02:07:20,063
to, to be a sphere.

3289
02:07:20,063 --> 02:07:21,943
But three was really hard.

3290
02:07:21,943 --> 02:07:24,243
So people tried many approaches.

3291
02:07:24,243 --> 02:07:26,123
There's sort of combinatorial approaches where you chop up the

3292
02:07:26,123 --> 02:07:28,603
the, the surface into little triangles or

3293
02:07:28,603 --> 02:07:32,123
or tetrahedra and you, you just try to argue based on how the faces interact each other.

3294
02:07:32,123 --> 02:07:33,181
Um-.

3295
02:07:33,181 --> 02:07:33,451
..

3296
02:07:33,451 --> 02:07:35,991
there were, um, algebraic approaches.

3297
02:07:35,991 --> 02:07:38,232
Uh, there's, there's various algebraic objects, uh

3298
02:07:38,232 --> 02:07:42,271
like this called the fundamental group that you can attach to these homology and co-homology and

3299
02:07:42,271 --> 02:07:44,651
and, and all these very fancy tools.

3300
02:07:44,651 --> 02:07:46,051
Um, they also didn't quite work.

3301
02:07:46,051 --> 02:07:50,471
Um, but Richard Hamilton proposed a, um

3302
02:07:50,471 --> 02:07:52,031
partial differential equations approach.

3303
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:54,143
So you take, um, you take.

3304
02:07:54,143 --> 02:07:54,292
..

3305
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:56,124
So the problem is that you.

3306
02:07:56,124 --> 02:07:56,231
..

3307
02:07:56,231 --> 02:07:58,491
so you have this object which is so secretly a sphere

3308
02:07:58,491 --> 02:08:00,552
but it's given to you in a, in a really

3309
02:08:00,552 --> 02:08:03,211
um, in a weird way.

3310
02:08:03,211 --> 02:08:05,912
So it's like, like, think of a ball that's been kind of crumpled up and twisted

3311
02:08:05,912 --> 02:08:07,431
and it's not obvious that it's a ball.

3312
02:08:07,431 --> 02:08:10,211
Um, but, um, like if you

3313
02:08:10,211 --> 02:08:11,732
if you have some sort of surface which is

3314
02:08:11,732 --> 02:08:15,191
which is a deformed sphere, you could

3315
02:08:15,191 --> 02:08:17,051
um, uh, you could.

3316
02:08:17,051 --> 02:08:17,211
..

3317
02:08:17,211 --> 02:08:18,771
For example, think of it as a surface of a balloon

3318
02:08:18,771 --> 02:08:19,872
you could try to inflate it.

3319
02:08:19,872 --> 02:08:23,811
You, you blow it up, um, and naturally as you fill it with air

3320
02:08:23,811 --> 02:08:27,292
um, the, the wrinkles will sort of smooth out and it will turn into

3321
02:08:27,292 --> 02:08:28,911
um, um, a nice round sphere.

3322
02:08:28,911 --> 02:08:32,772
Um, yeah, unless of course it was a torus or something in which case it would get stuck at some point

3323
02:08:32,772 --> 02:08:34,511
like, if you inflate a torus, it

3324
02:08:34,511 --> 02:08:34,696
it would.

3325
02:08:34,696 --> 02:08:34,751
..

3326
02:08:34,751 --> 02:08:37,251
there, there'd be a point in the middle when the inner ring shrinks to zero

3327
02:08:37,251 --> 02:08:39,672
you get a, you get a singularity and you can't blow up any further.

3328
02:08:39,672 --> 02:08:41,491
Uh, you can't flow any further.

3329
02:08:41,491 --> 02:08:44,011
So he created this flow, which is now called Ricci flow

3330
02:08:44,011 --> 02:08:46,971
which is a way of taking a, an arbitrary surface or

3331
02:08:46,971 --> 02:08:50,091
or space and smoothing it out to make it rounder and rounder- Mm-hmm.

3332
02:08:50,091 --> 02:08:50,091
.

3333
02:08:50,091 --> 02:08:50,091
.

3334
02:08:50,091 --> 02:08:50,991
to make it look like a sphere.

3335
02:08:50,991 --> 02:08:53,931
And he wanted to show that, that either

3336
02:08:53,931 --> 02:08:57,331
uh, this process would give you a sphere or it would create a singularity.

3337
02:08:57,331 --> 02:08:59,743
Um, actually very much like how PDEs either have.

3338
02:08:59,743 --> 02:08:59,812
..

3339
02:08:59,812 --> 02:09:01,511
they have global regularity or finitely blow up.

3340
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:02,314
Like, it, it basically.

3341
02:09:02,314 --> 02:09:02,351
..

3342
02:09:02,351 --> 02:09:04,411
it's almost exactly, exactly the same thing.

3343
02:09:04,411 --> 02:09:05,191
It's all connected.

3344
02:09:05,191 --> 02:09:07,131
Um, and so.

3345
02:09:07,131 --> 02:09:07,211
..

3346
02:09:07,211 --> 02:09:09,031
and, and he showed that for two dimensions

3347
02:09:09,031 --> 02:09:13,631
two-dimensional surfaces, um, if you started something like no singularities ever formed

3348
02:09:13,631 --> 02:09:16,511
um, you, you never ran into trouble and you could flow and

3349
02:09:16,511 --> 02:09:17,491
and it will give you a sphere.

3350
02:09:17,491 --> 02:09:17,732
Mm-hmm.

3351
02:09:17,732 --> 02:09:18,319
And it.

3352
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:18,391
..

3353
02:09:18,391 --> 02:09:20,431
so he, he got a new proof of the two-dimensional result.

3354
02:09:20,431 --> 02:09:24,351
Well, by the way, that's a beautiful explanation of Ricci flow and its application in this context.

3355
02:09:24,351 --> 02:09:26,472
How difficult is the mathematics here, like

3356
02:09:26,472 --> 02:09:27,431
for the 2D case?

3357
02:09:27,431 --> 02:09:32,491
Is it- Yeah, these are quite sophisticated equations on par with the Einstein equations of 

3358
02:09:32,491 --> 02:09:34,883
but slightly simpler, but, um, um.

3359
02:09:34,883 --> 02:09:34,971
..

3360
02:09:34,971 --> 02:09:38,731
Yeah, but, but they were considered hard nonlinear equations to solve.

3361
02:09:38,731 --> 02:09:41,391
Um, and there's lots of special tricks in 2D that

3362
02:09:41,391 --> 02:09:42,191
that, that helped.

3363
02:09:42,191 --> 02:09:44,811
But in 3D the problem was that, uh

3364
02:09:44,811 --> 02:09:46,811
th- this equation was actually super critical.

3365
02:09:46,811 --> 02:09:48,511
So this has the same promise as Navier-Stokes.

3366
02:09:48,511 --> 02:09:51,711
As you blow up, um, maybe s- the curvature could get concentrated in

3367
02:09:51,711 --> 02:09:54,251
in finer and smaller and smaller regions, and it

3368
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:57,991
um, it looked more and more nonlinear and things just looked worse and worse.

3369
02:09:57,991 --> 02:10:00,251
And there could be all kinds of singularities that

3370
02:10:00,251 --> 02:10:00,791
that showed up.

3371
02:10:00,791 --> 02:10:03,984
Um, some singularities, um, like if you.

3372
02:10:03,984 --> 02:10:04,051
..

3373
02:10:04,051 --> 02:10:06,091
uh, there's these things called neck pinches where

3374
02:10:06,091 --> 02:10:08,471
where the, uh, the surface sort of creates a.

3375
02:10:08,471 --> 02:10:08,531
..

3376
02:10:08,531 --> 02:10:10,011
behaves like a, like a, like a

3377
02:10:10,011 --> 02:10:12,171
a barbell and it, it, it pinches at a point.

3378
02:10:12,171 --> 02:10:15,051
Some s- some singularities are simple enough that you can still see what to do next

3379
02:10:15,051 --> 02:10:18,431
you just make a snip and then you can turn one surface into two and you evolve them separately.

3380
02:10:18,431 --> 02:10:22,511
But there was, there was a con- the prospect that there's some really nasty

3381
02:10:22,511 --> 02:10:24,231
like, knotted singularities showed up that you

3382
02:10:24,231 --> 02:10:28,111
you couldn't see how to, um, resolve in any way

3383
02:10:28,111 --> 02:10:30,111
uh, that you couldn't do any surgery to.

3384
02:10:30,111 --> 02:10:30,371
Mm-hmm.

3385
02:10:30,371 --> 02:10:33,311
Um, so you need to classify all the singularities

3386
02:10:33,311 --> 02:10:35,131
like, what are all the possible ways that things can go wrong?

3387
02:10:35,131 --> 02:10:38,344
Um, so what Perelman did was.

3388
02:10:38,344 --> 02:10:38,491
..

3389
02:10:38,491 --> 02:10:40,019
first of all, he, he made the problem.

3390
02:10:40,019 --> 02:10:40,091
..

3391
02:10:40,091 --> 02:10:42,291
he turned the problem from a super critical problem to a critical problem.

3392
02:10:42,291 --> 02:10:44,911
Um, I said before about how, um

3393
02:10:44,911 --> 02:10:47,651
the admission of the o- of energy, the Hamiltonian

3394
02:10:47,651 --> 02:10:50,991
like, really clarified, um, Newtonian mechanics.

3395
02:10:50,991 --> 02:10:53,371
Um, uh, so he introduced, uh

3396
02:10:53,371 --> 02:10:56,071
something which is now called Perelman's reduced volume and Perelman's entropy

3397
02:10:56,071 --> 02:10:56,603
um.

3398
02:10:56,603 --> 02:10:56,691
..

3399
02:10:56,691 --> 02:10:59,071
he introduced new quantities, kind of like energy

3400
02:10:59,071 --> 02:11:07,091
that looked the same at every single scale and turned the problem into a cr- critical one where the nonlinearities actually suddenly looked a lot less scary than they did before.

3401
02:11:07,091 --> 02:11:09,051
Um, and then he had to solve.

3402
02:11:09,051 --> 02:11:09,131
..

3403
02:11:09,131 --> 02:11:11,431
he still had to analyze the singularities of this critical problem.

3404
02:11:11,431 --> 02:11:15,111
Uh, and that itself was a problem similar to this wave path thing I worked on

3405
02:11:15,111 --> 02:11:16,471
actually .

3406
02:11:16,471 --> 02:11:18,291
Um, so on the, on the level of difficulty of that.

3407
02:11:18,291 --> 02:11:18,411
..

3408
02:11:18,411 --> 02:11:23,511
so he managed to classify all the singularities of this problem and show how to apply surgery to each of these

3409
02:11:23,511 --> 02:11:26,291
and through that was able to, to resolve the Poincaré conjecture.

3410
02:11:26,291 --> 02:11:28,861
So, um, quite.

3411
02:11:28,861 --> 02:11:29,051
..

3412
02:11:29,051 --> 02:11:30,611
uh, like, a lot of really ambitious steps

3413
02:11:30,611 --> 02:11:33,331
um, and like, like nothing that a large language model today

3414
02:11:33,331 --> 02:11:34,026
for example, could.

3415
02:11:34,026 --> 02:11:34,131
..

3416
02:11:34,131 --> 02:11:36,811
I mean, um, at best, uh

3417
02:11:36,811 --> 02:11:42,031
I could imagine a, a model proposing this idea as one of hundreds of different things to try.

3418
02:11:42,031 --> 02:11:45,151
Um, but the other 99 would be complete dead ends

3419
02:11:45,151 --> 02:11:46,511
but you'd only find out after months of

3420
02:11:46,511 --> 02:11:47,011
of work.

3421
02:11:47,011 --> 02:11:51,351
He must have had some sense that this was the right track to pursue because like

3422
02:11:51,351 --> 02:11:53,371
you know, like, it takes years to get from

3423
02:11:53,371 --> 02:11:54,011
from A to B.

3424
02:11:54,011 --> 02:11:56,031
So you've done, like you said, actually

3425
02:11:56,031 --> 02:12:02,311
you see, even strictly mathematically, but more broadly in terms of the process

3426
02:12:02,311 --> 02:12:06,431
you've done s- similarly difficult things.

3427
02:12:06,431 --> 02:12:10,431
What, what can you infer from the process he was going through because he was doing it alone?

3428
02:12:10,431 --> 02:12:13,811
What are some low points in a process like that when you start to

3429
02:12:13,811 --> 02:12:14,145
like.

3430
02:12:14,145 --> 02:12:14,271
..

3431
02:12:14,271 --> 02:12:18,671
you've mentioned hardship, like, uh, AI doesn't know when it's failing.

3432
02:12:18,671 --> 02:12:19,191
Yeah.

3433
02:12:19,191 --> 02:12:21,591
What, what happens to you, you're sitting in your office

3434
02:12:21,591 --> 02:12:25,051
when you realize the thing you did for the last few days

3435
02:12:25,051 --> 02:12:26,791
maybe weeks- Yeah.

3436
02:12:26,791 --> 02:12:26,844
.

3437
02:12:26,844 --> 02:12:26,951
..

3438
02:12:26,951 --> 02:12:27,691
is a failure?

3439
02:12:27,691 --> 02:12:29,731
Well, for me, I switch to different problems .

3440
02:12:29,731 --> 02:12:31,531
 Uh, so, uh, as I said

3441
02:12:31,531 --> 02:12:33,431
I'm, I'm, I'm a fox, I'm not a hedgehog.

3442
02:12:33,431 --> 02:12:34,047
But you legitimately.

3443
02:12:34,047 --> 02:12:34,111
..

3444
02:12:34,111 --> 02:12:35,911
that is a break that you can take is

3445
02:12:35,911 --> 02:12:37,871
is to step away and look at it from a problem.

3446
02:12:37,871 --> 02:12:38,071
Yeah, yeah.

3447
02:12:38,071 --> 02:12:39,891
You can modify the problem too.

3448
02:12:39,891 --> 02:12:42,146
Um, I mean, um, you can add some cheat.

3449
02:12:42,146 --> 02:12:42,211
..

3450
02:12:42,211 --> 02:12:44,631
uh, if, if there's a specific thing that's blocking you

3451
02:12:44,631 --> 02:12:45,943
uh, th- this, um.

3452
02:12:45,943 --> 02:12:46,071
..

3453
02:12:46,071 --> 02:12:49,171
some bad case keeps showing up that, that

3454
02:12:49,171 --> 02:12:49,422
that.

3455
02:12:49,422 --> 02:12:49,491
..

3456
02:12:49,491 --> 02:12:52,211
for which your tool doesn't work, you can just assume by fiat this

3457
02:12:52,211 --> 02:12:53,691
this bad case doesn't occur.

3458
02:12:53,691 --> 02:12:55,631
So you, you do some magical thinking

3459
02:12:55,631 --> 02:12:57,217
um, for the.

3460
02:12:57,217 --> 02:12:57,331
..

3461
02:12:57,331 --> 02:12:59,131
uh, but, but strategically, okay?

3462
02:12:59,131 --> 02:12:59,626
For the point.

3463
02:12:59,626 --> 02:12:59,731
..

3464
02:12:59,731 --> 02:13:01,271
to see if the rest of the argument goes through.

3465
02:13:01,271 --> 02:13:03,831
Um, if there's multiple problems, uh, with

3466
02:13:03,831 --> 02:13:05,791
with, with your approach, then maybe you just give up

3467
02:13:05,791 --> 02:13:06,051
okay?

3468
02:13:06,051 --> 02:13:07,751
 But if this is the only problem

3469
02:13:07,751 --> 02:13:09,431
uh, you know, and everything else checks out

3470
02:13:09,431 --> 02:13:10,751
you know, then it's still worth fighting.

3471
02:13:10,751 --> 02:13:14,011
Um, so yeah, yeah, you have to do some

3472
02:13:14,011 --> 02:13:16,431
some sort of forward reconnaissance sometimes to-  .

3473
02:13:16,431 --> 02:13:16,631
..

3474
02:13:16,631 --> 02:13:20,271
uh, you know- And that is sometimes productive to assume like

3475
02:13:20,271 --> 02:13:22,151
"Okay, we'll figure it out-" Oh, yeah

3476
02:13:22,151 --> 02:13:22,291
yeah, yeah.

3477
02:13:22,291 --> 02:13:22,301
".

3478
02:13:22,301 --> 02:13:22,311
..

3479
02:13:22,311 --> 02:13:22,714
eventually.

3480
02:13:22,714 --> 02:13:25,551
" Um, sometimes actually it's, it's even productive to make mistakes.

3481
02:13:25,551 --> 02:13:27,344
So, um, one of the.

3482
02:13:27,344 --> 02:13:27,431
..

3483
02:13:27,431 --> 02:13:28,235
I mean, um.

3484
02:13:28,235 --> 02:13:28,331
..

3485
02:13:28,331 --> 02:13:30,431
there was a project which actually, uh

3486
02:13:30,431 --> 02:13:33,251
we won some prizes for  actually, with

3487
02:13:33,251 --> 02:13:34,351
uh, with four other people.

3488
02:13:34,351 --> 02:13:36,031
Um, we were working on this PDE problem

3489
02:13:36,031 --> 02:13:38,111
a- again, actually this blow up regularity type problem

3490
02:13:38,111 --> 02:13:40,411
um, and it, it was considered very hard.

3491
02:13:40,411 --> 02:13:41,431
Um-.

3492
02:13:41,431 --> 02:13:41,831
..

3493
02:13:41,831 --> 02:13:43,631
Jean Bourgain, um, uh, who was a

3494
02:13:43,631 --> 02:13:45,911
another field specialist who worked on, on a special case of this

3495
02:13:45,911 --> 02:13:47,791
but he could not solve the general case.

3496
02:13:47,791 --> 02:13:51,151
Um, and we worked on this problem for two months and we found

3497
02:13:51,151 --> 02:13:51,851
we thought we solved it.

3498
02:13:51,851 --> 02:13:54,651
We, we had this, this cute argument that if everything fit and

3499
02:13:54,651 --> 02:13:55,632
and we were excited.

3500
02:13:55,632 --> 02:13:57,471
Uh, we were planning a celebration.

3501
02:13:57,471 --> 02:13:59,991
We, um, said we'll get together and have champagne or something.

3502
02:13:59,991 --> 02:14:02,672
Um, and we started writing it up

3503
02:14:02,672 --> 02:14:04,311
um, and one of, one of us

3504
02:14:04,311 --> 02:14:06,531
not me actually but another co-author said, "Oh

3505
02:14:06,531 --> 02:14:08,432
um, in this, in this lemma here

3506
02:14:08,432 --> 02:14:13,031
we s- um, we have to estimate these 13 terms that sh- that show up in this expansion.

3507
02:14:13,031 --> 02:14:15,592
" And we estimated 12 of them, but in our notes I can't find the

3508
02:14:15,592 --> 02:14:16,692
the estimation of the 13th.

3509
02:14:16,692 --> 02:14:18,194
"Can you, can someone supply that?

3510
02:14:18,194 --> 02:14:19,857
" And I said, "Sure, I'll look at this.

3511
02:14:19,857 --> 02:14:21,011
" And, and actually it's, oh yeah

3512
02:14:21,011 --> 02:14:22,931
we didn't cover, we completely omitted this term.

3513
02:14:22,931 --> 02:14:25,791
And this term turned out to be worse than the other 12 terms put together.

3514
02:14:25,791 --> 02:14:27,611
Um, in fact, we could not estimate this term.

3515
02:14:27,611 --> 02:14:30,031
Um, and we tried for a few more months

3516
02:14:30,031 --> 02:14:32,771
uh, and all different permutations and there was always this one thing

3517
02:14:32,771 --> 02:14:34,631
one term that we could not control.

3518
02:14:34,631 --> 02:14:38,672
Um, and so like, um, this was very frustrating.

3519
02:14:38,672 --> 02:14:43,371
Um, but because we had already invested months and months of effort into this already

3520
02:14:43,371 --> 02:14:45,231
um, we stuck at this.

3521
02:14:45,231 --> 02:14:47,131
We, we tried increasingly desperate things and

3522
02:14:47,131 --> 02:14:47,911
and crazy things.

3523
02:14:47,911 --> 02:14:53,531
Um, and after two years, we found an approach which is actually somewhat different by quite a bit from our initial

3524
02:14:53,531 --> 02:14:57,851
um, strategy, which did actually, didn't generate these problematic terms and

3525
02:14:57,851 --> 02:14:59,211
and, and actually solved the problem.

3526
02:14:59,211 --> 02:15:00,911
So we, we solved the pr- problem after two years.

3527
02:15:00,911 --> 02:15:05,311
But if we hadn't had that initial full storm of nearly solving the problem

3528
02:15:05,311 --> 02:15:07,931
we would have given up by month two or something

3529
02:15:07,931 --> 02:15:09,411
and, and worked on an easier problem.

3530
02:15:09,411 --> 02:15:13,031
Um, yeah, if we had known it would take two years 

3531
02:15:13,031 --> 02:15:14,431
not sure we would've started the project.

3532
02:15:14,431 --> 02:15:17,207
You know, sometimes actually having the incorrect.

3533
02:15:17,207 --> 02:15:17,331
..

3534
02:15:17,331 --> 02:15:19,571
you know, it's, it's like Columbus traveling to the New Y- New World.

3535
02:15:19,571 --> 02:15:21,411
He had an in- incorrect version of, uh

3536
02:15:21,411 --> 02:15:23,131
measurement of the, uh, size of the earth

3537
02:15:23,131 --> 02:15:26,391
um, and he thought he was going to find a n- new trade route to India.

3538
02:15:26,391 --> 02:15:29,471
Uh, or at least that was how he s- sold it in his prospectus.

3539
02:15:29,471 --> 02:15:31,451
I mean, it c- it could be that he actually secretly knew

3540
02:15:31,451 --> 02:15:31,671
but.

3541
02:15:31,671 --> 02:15:31,771
..

3542
02:15:31,771 --> 02:15:35,491
Just on the psychological element, do you have

3543
02:15:35,491 --> 02:15:41,131
like, emotional or, like, self-doubt that just overwhelms you

3544
02:15:41,131 --> 02:15:41,991
moments like that?

3545
02:15:41,991 --> 02:15:43,611
You know, 'cause it, th- this stuff

3546
02:15:43,611 --> 02:15:49,111
it feels like math, it's so engrossing that

3547
02:15:49,111 --> 02:15:50,231
like, it can break you.

3548
02:15:50,231 --> 02:15:54,331
When you, like, invest so much of yourself in the problem and then it turns out wrong

3549
02:15:54,331 --> 02:15:55,239
you could start to.

3550
02:15:55,239 --> 02:15:55,391
..

3551
02:15:55,391 --> 02:15:59,031
similar way chess has broken some people.

3552
02:15:59,031 --> 02:15:59,651
Yeah.

3553
02:15:59,651 --> 02:16:05,751
Um, I, I think different mathematicians have different levels of emotional investment in what they do.

3554
02:16:05,751 --> 02:16:07,311
I mean, I think for some people it's just a job.

3555
02:16:07,311 --> 02:16:09,811
You know, you, you have a problem and if it doesn't work out

3556
02:16:09,811 --> 02:16:11,251
you, you work on, you work on the next one.

3557
02:16:11,251 --> 02:16:16,611
Um, yeah, so the fact that you can always move on to another problem

3558
02:16:16,611 --> 02:16:19,411
um, it reduces the emotional connection.

3559
02:16:19,411 --> 02:16:22,351
I mean, there are cases, you know

3560
02:16:22,351 --> 02:16:25,151
so there are certain problems that are mathematical diseases where

3561
02:16:25,151 --> 02:16:31,251
where, where just latch onto that one problem and they spend years and years thinking about nothing but that one problem

3562
02:16:31,251 --> 02:16:33,710
and, and, um, you know, maybe their

3563
02:16:33,710 --> 02:16:35,290
their career suffers and so forth, and they say

3564
02:16:35,290 --> 02:16:36,751
"Oh, but I've got this big win.

3565
02:16:36,751 --> 02:16:39,751
This will, you know, once I, once I finish this

3566
02:16:39,751 --> 02:16:42,691
this problem, I will, that will, that will make up for all the years of

3567
02:16:42,691 --> 02:16:44,665
of, of, of lost opportunity.

3568
02:16:44,665 --> 02:16:45,745
" And th- that's, that's.

3569
02:16:45,745 --> 02:16:45,831
..

3570
02:16:45,831 --> 02:16:48,831
I mean, occasionally, occasionally it works 

3571
02:16:48,831 --> 02:16:53,231
but I, I, um, I really don't recommend it for people without the

3572
02:16:53,231 --> 02:16:54,130
the right fortitude.

3573
02:16:54,130 --> 02:16:58,450
Yeah, so I, I've never been super invested in any one problem.

3574
02:16:58,450 --> 02:17:02,591
Um, one thing that helps is that we don't need to call our problems in advance.

3575
02:17:02,591 --> 02:17:06,191
Uh, um, well, uh, when we do grant proposals

3576
02:17:06,191 --> 02:17:07,071
uh, we sort of say, "We will

3577
02:17:07,071 --> 02:17:08,721
we will study this set of problems.

3578
02:17:08,721 --> 02:17:14,063
" But even though we don't promise, "Definitely by five years I will supply a proof of all these things

3579
02:17:14,063 --> 02:17:14,290
" you know.

3580
02:17:14,290 --> 02:17:18,950
We, um, you promise to make some progress or discover some interesting phenomena

3581
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:22,831
uh, and maybe you don't solve the problem but you find some related problem that you

3582
02:17:22,831 --> 02:17:24,370
you can say something new about.

3583
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:26,630
Uh, and that's, that's a much more feasible task.

3584
02:17:26,630 --> 02:17:29,751
But I'm sure for you there's problems like this.

3585
02:17:29,751 --> 02:17:38,031
You have, you have, um, made so much progress towards the hardest problems in the history of mathematics.

3586
02:17:38,031 --> 02:17:42,011
So is there, is there a problem that just haunts you

3587
02:17:42,011 --> 02:17:44,571
it sits there in the dark corners, you know

3588
02:17:44,571 --> 02:17:48,271
twin prime conjecture, Riemann hypothesis, Goldbach conjecture?

3589
02:17:48,271 --> 02:17:49,986
Twin prime, that sounds.

3590
02:17:49,986 --> 02:17:50,111
..

3591
02:17:50,111 --> 02:17:53,050
 Well, again, so I mean, the problems like the Riemann hypothesis

3592
02:17:53,050 --> 02:17:54,331
those are so far out of reach.

3593
02:17:54,331 --> 02:17:55,550
Uh, I, I- Oh, you think so?

3594
02:17:55,550 --> 02:17:56,130
Yeah.

3595
02:17:56,130 --> 02:17:57,971
There, there's no even viable strategy.

3596
02:17:57,971 --> 02:18:00,130
Like, even if I activate all my

3597
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:01,591
all the cheats that I know of-  .

3598
02:18:01,591 --> 02:18:01,671
..

3599
02:18:01,671 --> 02:18:05,191
um, in this problem, like it, there's just still no way to get from A to B.

3600
02:18:05,191 --> 02:18:05,630
Yeah.

3601
02:18:05,630 --> 02:18:13,531
Um, like it's, it's, um, I think it needs a breakthrough in another area of mathematics to happen first

3602
02:18:13,531 --> 02:18:18,411
and for someone to recognize that, that that would be a useful thing to transport into this problem.

3603
02:18:18,411 --> 02:18:22,671
So we, we should maybe s- step back for a little bit and just talk about prime numbers.

3604
02:18:22,671 --> 02:18:22,991
Okay.

3605
02:18:22,991 --> 02:18:26,391
So they're often referred to as the atoms of mathematics.

3606
02:18:26,391 --> 02:18:29,691
Can you just speak to the structure that these

3607
02:18:29,691 --> 02:18:31,271
uh, atoms provide?

3608
02:18:31,271 --> 02:18:34,271
So the natural numbers have two basic operations attached to them

3609
02:18:34,271 --> 02:18:35,471
addition and m- multiplication.

3610
02:18:35,471 --> 02:18:38,191
Um, so if you want to generate the natural numbers

3611
02:18:38,191 --> 02:18:39,091
you can do one of two things.

3612
02:18:39,091 --> 02:18:41,691
You can just start with one and add one to itself over and over again

3613
02:18:41,691 --> 02:18:42,870
and that generates you the natural numbers.

3614
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:44,891
So additively they're very easy to generate, one

3615
02:18:44,891 --> 02:18:45,450
two, three, four, five.

3616
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:47,621
Or you can take the prime num-.

3617
02:18:47,621 --> 02:18:47,731
..

3618
02:18:47,731 --> 02:18:49,971
if you want to generate multiplicatively, you can take all the prime numbers

3619
02:18:49,971 --> 02:18:51,911
two, three, five, seven, and multiply them all together.

3620
02:18:51,911 --> 02:18:55,171
Um, and together they, they, they get you all the

3621
02:18:55,171 --> 02:18:56,751
the, the natural numbers except maybe for one.

3622
02:18:56,751 --> 02:19:00,671
So there are these two separate ways of thinking about the natural numbers

3623
02:19:00,671 --> 02:19:03,050
from a additive point of view and a mul- multiplicative point of view.

3624
02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:05,630
Um, and separately they're not so bad.

3625
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:11,331
Um, so like any question about the natural numbers that only involves addition is relatively easy to solve

3626
02:19:11,331 --> 02:19:14,611
and any question that only involves multiplication is relatively easy to solve.

3627
02:19:14,611 --> 02:19:18,411
Um, but what has been frustrating is that you combine the two together

3628
02:19:18,411 --> 02:19:21,768
um, and suddenly you get an extremely rich.

3629
02:19:21,768 --> 02:19:21,911
..

3630
02:19:21,911 --> 02:19:24,891
I mean, we know that there are statements in number theory that are actually as

3631
02:19:24,891 --> 02:19:25,771
uh, undecidable.

3632
02:19:25,771 --> 02:19:28,130
There are certain polynomials in some number of variables

3633
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:29,751
you know, is there a solution in the natural numbers?

3634
02:19:29,751 --> 02:19:32,491
And the answer depends on, on an undecidable statement

3635
02:19:32,491 --> 02:19:35,191
um, like, like whether, um, the axioms of

3636
02:19:35,191 --> 02:19:36,710
of mathematics are consistent or not.

3637
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:44,171
Um, but, um, yeah, but even the s- the simplest problems that combine something multiplicative

3638
02:19:44,171 --> 02:19:45,771
such as the primes, with something additive

3639
02:19:45,771 --> 02:19:49,911
such as shifting by two, uh, separately we understand both of them well

3640
02:19:49,911 --> 02:19:51,931
but if you ask, when you shift a prime by two

3641
02:19:51,931 --> 02:19:55,031
do you, can you get a, how often can you get another prime?

3642
02:19:55,031 --> 02:19:57,034
We, it's been-.

3643
02:19:57,034 --> 02:19:57,255
..

3644
02:19:57,255 --> 02:19:59,295
amazingly hard to relate the two.

3645
02:19:59,295 --> 02:20:02,375
And we should say that the twin prime conjecture is just that.

3646
02:20:02,375 --> 02:20:07,135
It posits that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by two.

3647
02:20:07,135 --> 02:20:07,675
Yes.

3648
02:20:07,675 --> 02:20:16,336
Now, the interesting thing is that you have been very successful at pushing forward the field in answering these complicated questions

3649
02:20:16,336 --> 02:20:19,396
uh, of this variety, like you mentioned

3650
02:20:19,396 --> 02:20:20,496
the green tile theorem.

3651
02:20:20,496 --> 02:20:25,015
It proves that prime numbers contain arithmetic progressions of any length.

3652
02:20:25,015 --> 02:20:25,375
Right.

3653
02:20:25,375 --> 02:20:27,795
Which is mind-blowing that you can prove something like that.

3654
02:20:27,795 --> 02:20:28,175
Right.

3655
02:20:28,175 --> 02:20:30,975
Yeah, so what we've realized because of th- this

3656
02:20:30,975 --> 02:20:32,849
this type of research is that this.

3657
02:20:32,849 --> 02:20:32,975
..

3658
02:20:32,975 --> 02:20:35,776
different patterns have different levels of, uh

3659
02:20:35,776 --> 02:20:37,395
indestructibility.

3660
02:20:37,395 --> 02:20:42,695
Um, so, so what makes the twin prime problem hard is that if you take all the primes in the world

3661
02:20:42,695 --> 02:20:44,856
you know, 3, 5, 7, 11

3662
02:20:44,856 --> 02:20:46,636
and so forth, there are some twins in there

3663
02:20:46,636 --> 02:20:49,535
11 and 13 is a twin prime, pair of twin primes and so forth

3664
02:20:49,535 --> 02:20:52,396
but you could easily, if you wanted to

3665
02:20:52,396 --> 02:20:55,175
um, redact the primes to get rid of

3666
02:20:55,175 --> 02:20:57,455
to get rid of the, um, these twins.

3667
02:20:57,455 --> 02:21:00,675
Like, uh, the twins, they show up and there are infinitely many of them

3668
02:21:00,675 --> 02:21:01,915
but they're actually reasonably sparse.

3669
02:21:01,915 --> 02:21:02,608
Um, not the.

3670
02:21:02,608 --> 02:21:02,675
..

3671
02:21:02,675 --> 02:21:03,268
there's not.

3672
02:21:03,268 --> 02:21:03,455
..

3673
02:21:03,455 --> 02:21:04,715
I mean, initially there's quite a few

3674
02:21:04,715 --> 02:21:05,875
but once you go out to the millions

3675
02:21:05,875 --> 02:21:08,055
trillions, they become rarer and rarer.

3676
02:21:08,055 --> 02:21:09,755
And you could actually just.

3677
02:21:09,755 --> 02:21:09,835
..

3678
02:21:09,835 --> 02:21:12,835
you know, li- if, if someone was given access to the database of primes

3679
02:21:12,835 --> 02:21:15,075
they'd just edit out a few, a few primes here and there.

3680
02:21:15,075 --> 02:21:17,995
They could make the twin prime conjecture false by just removing

3681
02:21:17,995 --> 02:21:18,659
like, 0.

3682
02:21:18,659 --> 02:21:19,935
01% of the primes or something.

3683
02:21:19,935 --> 02:21:20,315
Hmm.

3684
02:21:20,315 --> 02:21:23,015
Um, just well, well chosen to, to

3685
02:21:23,015 --> 02:21:23,855
um, to do this.

3686
02:21:23,855 --> 02:21:32,355
And so you could present a censored database of the primes which passes all of the statistical tests of the primes

3687
02:21:32,355 --> 02:21:34,595
you know, that it, it obeys things like the prime number theorem and

3688
02:21:34,595 --> 02:21:37,815
and other facts about the primes, but doesn't contain any twin primes anymore.

3689
02:21:37,815 --> 02:21:41,215
Um, and this is a real obstacle for the twin prime conjecture.

3690
02:21:41,215 --> 02:21:50,115
It, it means that any proof strategy to actually find twin primes in the actual primes must fail when applied to these slightly

3691
02:21:50,115 --> 02:21:51,635
uh, edited primes.

3692
02:21:51,635 --> 02:21:54,135
And so it, it must be some very

3693
02:21:54,135 --> 02:21:58,435
um, subtle, delicate feature of the primes that you can't just get from

3694
02:21:58,435 --> 02:22:01,475
like, like, aggregate cis- s- s- statistical analysis.

3695
02:22:01,475 --> 02:22:02,715
Okay, so that's out.

3696
02:22:02,715 --> 02:22:03,255
 Yeah.

3697
02:22:03,255 --> 02:22:07,135
On the other hand, arithmetic progressions has turned out to be much more robust.

3698
02:22:07,135 --> 02:22:11,095
Um, like you can take the primes and you can eliminate 99% of the primes actually

3699
02:22:11,095 --> 02:22:13,735
you know, and you can take, take any 99% that you want

3700
02:22:13,735 --> 02:22:14,835
and, uh, it turns out.

3701
02:22:14,835 --> 02:22:14,895
..

3702
02:22:14,895 --> 02:22:17,875
and this is another thing we've proved is that you still get arithmetic progressions.

3703
02:22:17,875 --> 02:22:20,463
Um, arithmetic progressions are much.

3704
02:22:20,463 --> 02:22:20,555
..

3705
02:22:20,555 --> 02:22:21,615
you know, they're like cockroaches.

3706
02:22:21,615 --> 02:22:23,395
Of arbitrary length though.

3707
02:22:23,395 --> 02:22:23,415
Yes.

3708
02:22:23,415 --> 02:22:24,155
Yes.

3709
02:22:24,155 --> 02:22:25,395
That's crazy.

3710
02:22:25,395 --> 02:22:25,695
Yeah.

3711
02:22:25,695 --> 02:22:28,375
I mean, so, so, uh, for people who don't know

3712
02:22:28,375 --> 02:22:32,455
arithmetic progressions is a sequence of numbers that differ by some fixed amount.

3713
02:22:32,455 --> 02:22:32,795
Yeah.

3714
02:22:32,795 --> 02:22:33,760
But it's, again, like.

3715
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:33,875
..

3716
02:22:33,875 --> 02:22:35,515
it's, it's infinite monkey type phenomenon.

3717
02:22:35,515 --> 02:22:39,315
For any fixed length of your set, you don't get arbitrary length progressions.

3718
02:22:39,315 --> 02:22:40,595
You only get quite short progressions.

3719
02:22:40,595 --> 02:22:44,715
But you're saying twin prime is not an infinite monkey phenomena?

3720
02:22:44,715 --> 02:22:44,835
Hmm?

3721
02:22:44,835 --> 02:22:46,510
No- I mean, it's a very subtle monk-.

3722
02:22:46,510 --> 02:22:46,635
..

3723
02:22:46,635 --> 02:22:48,495
it's still an infinite monkey phenomena, isn't it?

3724
02:22:48,495 --> 02:22:48,555
Right.

3725
02:22:48,555 --> 02:22:48,775
Yeah, yeah.

3726
02:22:48,775 --> 02:22:51,615
If, if the primes were really genuinely random

3727
02:22:51,615 --> 02:22:53,875
if the primes were generated by monkeys, um

3728
02:22:53,875 --> 02:22:56,835
then yes, in fact the infinite monkey theorem would- Oh

3729
02:22:56,835 --> 02:23:00,143
but you're saying that twin prime is.

3730
02:23:00,143 --> 02:23:00,295
..

3731
02:23:00,295 --> 02:23:00,867
it doesn't.

3732
02:23:00,867 --> 02:23:00,975
..

3733
02:23:00,975 --> 02:23:03,075
you can't use the same tools, like

3734
02:23:03,075 --> 02:23:03,301
the.

3735
02:23:03,301 --> 02:23:03,415
..

3736
02:23:03,415 --> 02:23:05,015
it doesn't appear random almost.

3737
02:23:05,015 --> 02:23:05,875
Well, we don't know.

3738
02:23:05,875 --> 02:23:10,055
Uh, yeah, we, we, we believe the primes behave like a random set.

3739
02:23:10,055 --> 02:23:12,495
And so the reason why we care about the twin prime conjecture is

3740
02:23:12,495 --> 02:23:16,995
is it's a test case for whether we can genuinely confidently say with

3741
02:23:16,995 --> 02:23:20,555
with 0% chance of error that the primes behave like a random set.

3742
02:23:20,555 --> 02:23:22,008
Okay, random.

3743
02:23:22,008 --> 02:23:22,115
..

3744
02:23:22,115 --> 02:23:24,435
yeah, random versions of the primes we know contain twins.

3745
02:23:24,435 --> 02:23:27,015
Um, at least wi- wi- with 100% probability

3746
02:23:27,015 --> 02:23:30,735
uh, or probably turning to 100% as you go out further and further.

3747
02:23:30,735 --> 02:23:34,495
Um, yeah, so the primes, we believe that they're random.

3748
02:23:34,495 --> 02:23:42,015
Um, the reason why arithmetic progressions are indestructible is that regardless of whether your set looks random or looks s- um

3749
02:23:42,015 --> 02:23:45,035
structured, like periodic, in both cases, um

3750
02:23:45,035 --> 02:23:47,815
arithmetic progressions appear, but for different reasons.

3751
02:23:47,815 --> 02:23:50,800
Um, and this is basically all, all the ways in which the thing.

3752
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:50,895
..

3753
02:23:50,895 --> 02:24:01,235
uh, there are many proofs of, of these sort of arithmetic progression theorems and they're all proven by some sort of dichotomy where your set is either structured or random and in both cases you can say something and then you put the two together.

3754
02:24:01,235 --> 02:24:06,275
Um, but in twin primes, if, if the primes are random then you're happy

3755
02:24:06,275 --> 02:24:06,795
you win.

3756
02:24:06,795 --> 02:24:09,355
But if your primes are structured, they could be structured in

3757
02:24:09,355 --> 02:24:12,335
in a specific way that eliminates the twin

3758
02:24:12,335 --> 02:24:12,835
the twins.

3759
02:24:12,835 --> 02:24:15,715
Uh, and we can't rule out that one conspiracy.

3760
02:24:15,715 --> 02:24:19,155
And yet you're able to make a, as I understand

3761
02:24:19,155 --> 02:24:21,135
progress on the k-tuple version.

3762
02:24:21,135 --> 02:24:22,055
Right, yeah.

3763
02:24:22,055 --> 02:24:26,995
So, um, the one funny thing about conspiracies is that any one conspiracy theory is really hard to disprove.

3764
02:24:26,995 --> 02:24:27,575
Uh-huh.

3765
02:24:27,575 --> 02:24:27,735
Yeah.

3766
02:24:27,735 --> 02:24:29,935
Uh, that, you know, if, if you believe the world is run by lizards

3767
02:24:29,935 --> 02:24:31,915
you say here's some evidence that, that it

3768
02:24:31,915 --> 02:24:32,735
it's not run by lizards.

3769
02:24:32,735 --> 02:24:34,635
Well, that, that evidence was planted by the lizards.

3770
02:24:34,635 --> 02:24:35,135
Yeah.

3771
02:24:35,135 --> 02:24:37,155
 Like, um, you might have encountered

3772
02:24:37,155 --> 02:24:38,515
uh, uh, this kind of phenomena.

3773
02:24:38,515 --> 02:24:38,715
Yeah.

3774
02:24:38,715 --> 02:24:39,175
So, so- Yes.

3775
02:24:39,175 --> 02:24:39,181
.

3776
02:24:39,181 --> 02:24:39,195
..

3777
02:24:39,195 --> 02:24:40,840
like, like, um, a pure.

3778
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:40,955
..

3779
02:24:40,955 --> 02:24:42,495
like there's, there's almost no way to

3780
02:24:42,495 --> 02:24:45,175
to, um, definitively rule out a conspiracy.

3781
02:24:45,175 --> 02:24:48,341
And the same is true in mathematics, that a conspiracy that is to-.

3782
02:24:48,341 --> 02:24:48,515
..

3783
02:24:48,515 --> 02:24:51,135
solely devo- devoted to eliminating twin primes, you know

3784
02:24:51,135 --> 02:24:51,585
like it would.

3785
02:24:51,585 --> 02:24:51,635
..

3786
02:24:51,635 --> 02:24:54,315
you'd have to also infiltrate other areas of mathematics to do so.

3787
02:24:54,315 --> 02:24:56,475
But, but, like, it could be made consistent

3788
02:24:56,475 --> 02:24:57,315
at least as far as we know.

3789
02:24:57,315 --> 02:25:01,115
But there's a weird phenomena that you can make one con- um

3790
02:25:01,115 --> 02:25:03,975
uh, one conspiracy rule out other conspiracies.

3791
02:25:03,975 --> 02:25:05,215
So, you know- Hmm.

3792
02:25:05,215 --> 02:25:05,248
.

3793
02:25:05,248 --> 02:25:05,315
..

3794
02:25:05,315 --> 02:25:07,715
if the world is run by lizards they can't also be run by aliens.

3795
02:25:07,715 --> 02:25:09,655
  Right, right.

3796
02:25:09,655 --> 02:25:11,695
So one unreasonable thing is, is, is

3797
02:25:11,695 --> 02:25:13,275
is hard to disprove, but, but more than one

3798
02:25:13,275 --> 02:25:14,255
there are, there are tools.

3799
02:25:14,255 --> 02:25:16,655
Um, so yeah, so for example we

3800
02:25:16,655 --> 02:25:18,655
we know there's infinitely many primes that are

3801
02:25:18,655 --> 02:25:20,395
um, uh, no two which are.

3802
02:25:20,395 --> 02:25:20,475
..

3803
02:25:20,475 --> 02:25:22,935
so they're the only pairs of primes which differ by at most

3804
02:25:22,935 --> 02:25:25,815
uh, um, 246 actually is, is

3805
02:25:25,815 --> 02:25:26,595
is the current record.

3806
02:25:26,595 --> 02:25:28,255
Oh, so there's like a bound- Yes.

3807
02:25:28,255 --> 02:25:28,295
.

3808
02:25:28,295 --> 02:25:28,375
..

3809
02:25:28,375 --> 02:25:28,815
on the.

3810
02:25:28,815 --> 02:25:28,915
..

3811
02:25:28,915 --> 02:25:29,335
Right.

3812
02:25:29,335 --> 02:25:33,535
So, like, there's twin primes, there's this thing called cousin primes that differ by

3813
02:25:33,535 --> 02:25:36,515
by four, um, there's this thing called sexy primes that differ by six.

3814
02:25:36,515 --> 02:25:38,135
Uh, what are sexy primes?

3815
02:25:38,135 --> 02:25:39,135
Primes that differ by six.

3816
02:25:39,135 --> 02:25:39,355
Okay.

3817
02:25:39,355 --> 02:25:43,055
The name is much less ex- it's constantly much less exciting than the name suggests.

3818
02:25:43,055 --> 02:25:43,395
Got it.

3819
02:25:43,395 --> 02:25:47,515
 So you can make a conspiracy rule out one of these

3820
02:25:47,515 --> 02:25:49,315
but, like, once you have like 50 of them

3821
02:25:49,315 --> 02:25:51,035
it turns out that you can't rule out all of them at once.

3822
02:25:51,035 --> 02:25:51,552
It just.

3823
02:25:51,552 --> 02:25:51,655
..

3824
02:25:51,655 --> 02:25:55,435
it requires too much energy somehow in this conspiracy space.

3825
02:25:55,435 --> 02:25:57,415
 How do you do the bound part?

3826
02:25:57,415 --> 02:26:01,735
How do you, how do you develop a bound for the difference between the primes that- Okay

3827
02:26:01,735 --> 02:26:02,355
so, um- .

3828
02:26:02,355 --> 02:26:02,435
..

3829
02:26:02,435 --> 02:26:03,655
that there's an infinite number of?

3830
02:26:03,655 --> 02:26:06,825
So it's ultimately based on, uh, what's called the Pitchfork Principle.

3831
02:26:06,825 --> 02:26:11,879
Um, so the pigeonhole principle, uh, it's a statement that if you have a number of pigeons and they all have to go into

3832
02:26:11,879 --> 02:26:13,979
into pigeonholes, and you have more pigeons than pigeonholes

3833
02:26:13,979 --> 02:26:16,799
then one of the pigeonholes has to have at least two pigeons in.

3834
02:26:16,799 --> 02:26:17,719
So there has to be two pigeons that are

3835
02:26:17,719 --> 02:26:18,539
that are close together.

3836
02:26:18,539 --> 02:26:20,899
So for instance, if you have, uh

3837
02:26:20,899 --> 02:26:22,659
100 numbers and they all range from one to 1

3838
02:26:22,659 --> 02:26:24,999
000, um, two of them have to be at

3839
02:26:24,999 --> 02:26:25,859
at most 10 apart.

3840
02:26:25,859 --> 02:26:26,279
Mm-hmm.

3841
02:26:26,279 --> 02:26:30,339
'Cause y- y- you can divide up the numbers from one to 100 into 100 pigeonholes.

3842
02:26:30,339 --> 02:26:32,639
Let's, let's say we have 100, we have 101 numbers.

3843
02:26:32,639 --> 02:26:34,800
101 numbers, then two of them have to be

3844
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:38,279
uh, distance less than 10 apart, because two of them have to belong to the same pigeonhole.

3845
02:26:38,279 --> 02:26:42,380
So it, it's a basic, um, basic feature of

3846
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:44,059
uh, a basic principle in mathematics.

3847
02:26:44,059 --> 02:26:47,060
Um, so it doesn't quite work with the primes regularly

3848
02:26:47,060 --> 02:26:49,900
'cause the primes get sparser and sparser as you go out

3849
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:51,919
that, that fewer and fewer numbers are prime.

3850
02:26:51,919 --> 02:26:56,300
But it turns out that there's a way to assign weights to the pr- to

3851
02:26:56,300 --> 02:26:56,779
to numbers.

3852
02:26:56,779 --> 02:26:58,739
Like, um, so there are numbers that are kind of

3853
02:26:58,739 --> 02:27:00,793
uh, almost prime, uh, but they're not.

3854
02:27:00,793 --> 02:27:00,920
..

3855
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:04,359
they, they don't have no factors at all other than themselves and one

3856
02:27:04,359 --> 02:27:05,700
but they have very few factors.

3857
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:09,999
Um, and it turns out that we understand almost primes a lot better than we understand primes.

3858
02:27:09,999 --> 02:27:12,419
Um, and so, uh, for example

3859
02:27:12,419 --> 02:27:14,839
uh, it was known for a long time that there were twin almost primes

3860
02:27:14,839 --> 02:27:16,039
uh, that this has been worked out.

3861
02:27:16,039 --> 02:27:18,280
So almost primes are things we, we kind of understand.

3862
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:23,380
So you can actually restrict the attention to a s- a suitable set of almost primes

3863
02:27:23,380 --> 02:27:29,239
and, uh, whereas the primes are very sparse overall

3864
02:27:29,239 --> 02:27:31,379
uh, relative to the almost primes, they actually are

3865
02:27:31,379 --> 02:27:32,219
are much less sparse.

3866
02:27:32,219 --> 02:27:33,148
They may, um.

3867
02:27:33,148 --> 02:27:33,180
..

3868
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:35,419
You can set up a se- a set of almost primes where the primes are densely like

3869
02:27:35,419 --> 02:27:36,120
say, 1%.

3870
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:41,600
Um, and that gives you a shot at proving by applying some sort of pigeonhole principle that

3871
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:43,179
that there's pairs of primes that are distinct only 100

3872
02:27:43,179 --> 02:27:43,979
100 apart.

3873
02:27:43,979 --> 02:27:46,399
But in order to prove the twin prime conjecture

3874
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:48,800
you need to get the density of primes in something almost always up to

3875
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:50,239
up to a threshold of 50%.

3876
02:27:50,239 --> 02:27:52,559
Um, once you get up to 50%

3877
02:27:52,559 --> 02:27:53,440
you will get twin primes.

3878
02:27:53,440 --> 02:27:55,480
But, uh, unfortunately, there are barriers.

3879
02:27:55,480 --> 02:28:00,079
Um, w- we know that, that no matter what kind of good set of almost primes you pick

3880
02:28:00,079 --> 02:28:02,419
the density of primes can never get above 50%.

3881
02:28:02,419 --> 02:28:03,900
It's called the parity barrier.

3882
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:05,976
Um, and I would love to find.

3883
02:28:05,976 --> 02:28:06,119
..

3884
02:28:06,119 --> 02:28:08,419
Yeah, so one of my long-term dreams is to find a way to breach that barrier

3885
02:28:08,419 --> 02:28:11,439
because it would open up not only the t- twin prime conjecture

3886
02:28:11,439 --> 02:28:15,419
but the Goldbach conjecture and many other problems in number theory are currently blocked

3887
02:28:15,419 --> 02:28:20,059
because our current techniques would require impro- going beyond this theoretical

3888
02:28:20,059 --> 02:28:21,539
um, parity barrier.

3889
02:28:21,539 --> 02:28:23,559
It's, it's like, it's like pulling fast at the speed of light.

3890
02:28:23,559 --> 02:28:24,539
Yeah.

3891
02:28:24,539 --> 02:28:28,560
So we should say twin prime conjecture, one of the biggest problems in the history of mathematics.

3892
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:29,959
Goldbach conjecture also.

3893
02:28:29,959 --> 02:28:33,079
Uh, they feel like next door neighbors.

3894
02:28:33,079 --> 02:28:37,340
Uh, has there been days when you felt you saw the path?

3895
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:38,400
Oh, yeah.

3896
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:39,207
Um, um.

3897
02:28:39,207 --> 02:28:39,319
..

3898
02:28:39,319 --> 02:28:40,519
 Yeah.

3899
02:28:40,519 --> 02:28:41,980
Uh, sometimes you try something and it

3900
02:28:41,980 --> 02:28:42,940
it works super well.

3901
02:28:42,940 --> 02:28:44,569
Um, you, you again.

3902
02:28:44,569 --> 02:28:44,679
..

3903
02:28:44,679 --> 02:28:46,599
Again, the sense of mathematical smell, uh

3904
02:28:46,599 --> 02:28:47,419
we talked about earlier.

3905
02:28:47,419 --> 02:28:50,699
Uh, you learn from experience when things are going too well.

3906
02:28:50,699 --> 02:28:52,379
 Yeah.

3907
02:28:52,379 --> 02:28:55,179
Because there are certain difficulties that you sort of have to encounter.

3908
02:28:55,179 --> 02:28:59,660
Um, um, think the way a, a c- colleague might put it is that

3909
02:28:59,660 --> 02:29:01,459
um, you know, like, if, if you

3910
02:29:01,459 --> 02:29:04,999
uh, on the streets of New York and you're put in a blindfold and you're put in a car and

3911
02:29:04,999 --> 02:29:07,239
and, um, after some hours, um

3912
02:29:07,239 --> 02:29:07,599
you.

3913
02:29:07,599 --> 02:29:07,679
..

3914
02:29:07,679 --> 02:29:09,139
the blindfold's off and, and you're in Beijing.

3915
02:29:09,139 --> 02:29:12,859
Um, you know, I mean, that was too easy somehow.

3916
02:29:12,859 --> 02:29:12,879
Yeah.

3917
02:29:12,879 --> 02:29:14,759
Like, like there was no ocean being crossed.

3918
02:29:14,759 --> 02:29:17,172
Even if you don't know exactly what Howard.

3919
02:29:17,172 --> 02:29:17,279
..

3920
02:29:17,279 --> 02:29:20,139
what, what was done, uh, you're suspecting that

3921
02:29:20,139 --> 02:29:21,419
that something w- wasn't right.

3922
02:29:21,419 --> 02:29:23,575
But is that still in the back of your head to.

3923
02:29:23,575 --> 02:29:23,759
..

3924
02:29:23,759 --> 02:29:26,329
Do you return to these, to the prime.

3925
02:29:26,329 --> 02:29:26,439
..

3926
02:29:26,439 --> 02:29:29,719
Do you return to the prime numbers every once in a while to see?

3927
02:29:29,719 --> 02:29:31,179
Yeah, when I have nothing better to do

3928
02:29:31,179 --> 02:29:32,819
which is less and less now, 10 times

3929
02:29:32,819 --> 02:29:35,019
which is I get busy with so many things these days.

3930
02:29:35,019 --> 02:29:37,065
But yeah, when I have free time and I'm not.

3931
02:29:37,065 --> 02:29:37,199
..

3932
02:29:37,199 --> 02:29:41,259
and I'm too frustrated to, to work on my sort of real research projects

3933
02:29:41,259 --> 02:29:43,299
and I also don't want to do my administrative support

3934
02:29:43,299 --> 02:29:45,219
I don't want to do some errand for my family

3935
02:29:45,219 --> 02:29:46,825
um-  .

3936
02:29:46,825 --> 02:29:46,839
..

3937
02:29:46,839 --> 02:29:48,199
I can play with these, these things

3938
02:29:48,199 --> 02:29:49,439
uh, for fun.

3939
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:51,039
Uh, and usually you get nowhere.

3940
02:29:51,039 --> 02:29:52,779
Yeah, yeah, so you have to learn to just say

3941
02:29:52,779 --> 02:29:53,299
"Okay, fine.

3942
02:29:53,299 --> 02:29:53,419
I.

3943
02:29:53,419 --> 02:29:53,539
..

3944
02:29:53,539 --> 02:29:54,899
Once again, uh, nothing happened.

3945
02:29:54,899 --> 02:29:56,209
I wi- I will move on.

3946
02:29:56,209 --> 02:29:59,739
" Um, yeah, very occasionally one of these problems I actually solved.

3947
02:29:59,739 --> 02:30:01,719
Uh, uh, well, sometimes as you say

3948
02:30:01,719 --> 02:30:04,679
uh, you think you solved it and then you're euphoric for

3949
02:30:04,679 --> 02:30:06,979
uh, maybe 15 minutes and then you think

3950
02:30:06,979 --> 02:30:09,559
"I should check this 'cause this is too easy

3951
02:30:09,559 --> 02:30:10,145
too good to be true.

3952
02:30:10,145 --> 02:30:10,859
" And it usually is.

3953
02:30:10,859 --> 02:30:14,619
What's your gut say about when these problems would be

3954
02:30:14,619 --> 02:30:15,339
uh, solved?

3955
02:30:15,339 --> 02:30:15,435
Um.

3956
02:30:15,435 --> 02:30:15,499
..

3957
02:30:15,499 --> 02:30:17,339
Twin prime and Goldbach prime?

3958
02:30:17,339 --> 02:30:18,919
Twin prime, I think we will keep getting- Ten years?

3959
02:30:18,919 --> 02:30:18,979
.

3960
02:30:18,979 --> 02:30:19,099
..

3961
02:30:19,099 --> 02:30:20,559
keep getting more partial results.

3962
02:30:20,559 --> 02:30:24,245
Um, uh, it does need at least one.

3963
02:30:24,245 --> 02:30:24,339
..

3964
02:30:24,339 --> 02:30:27,019
Uh, this parity barrier is, is the biggest remaining obstacle.

3965
02:30:27,019 --> 02:30:31,579
Um, there are simpler versions of the conjecture where we are getting really close.

3966
02:30:31,579 --> 02:30:34,461
Um, so I think we will.

3967
02:30:34,461 --> 02:30:34,559
..

3968
02:30:34,559 --> 02:30:38,779
In 10 years, we will have many more much closer results.

3969
02:30:38,779 --> 02:30:39,699
We may not have the whole thing.

3970
02:30:39,699 --> 02:30:42,759
Um, yeah, so twin primes is somewhat close.

3971
02:30:42,759 --> 02:30:42,999
Yeah.

3972
02:30:42,999 --> 02:30:45,119
Riemann hypothesis, uh, I have no clue.

3973
02:30:45,119 --> 02:30:47,179
I mean, it o- it has to happen by accident I think

3974
02:30:47,179 --> 02:30:53,059
uh- So th- the Riemann hypothesis is a kind of more general conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers

3975
02:30:53,059 --> 02:30:53,299
right?

3976
02:30:53,299 --> 02:30:53,419
Right.

3977
02:30:53,419 --> 02:30:53,599
Yeah.

3978
02:30:53,599 --> 02:30:55,899
It's, it's, it's states that are sort of viewed multiplicative

3979
02:30:55,899 --> 02:30:57,839
like for, for questions only involving multiplication

3980
02:30:57,839 --> 02:31:00,019
no addition, the primes really do behave

3981
02:31:00,019 --> 02:31:01,959
uh, as randomly as, as you could hope.

3982
02:31:01,959 --> 02:31:06,419
So there's a phenomenon in probability called square root cancellation that

3983
02:31:06,419 --> 02:31:06,687
um.

3984
02:31:06,687 --> 02:31:06,839
..

3985
02:31:06,839 --> 02:31:08,559
You know, like if, if you want to poll

3986
02:31:08,559 --> 02:31:10,899
say, America, uh, about s- on some issue

3987
02:31:10,899 --> 02:31:13,999
um, and you, you ask one or two voters

3988
02:31:13,999 --> 02:31:15,399
and you may have sampled a bad sample

3989
02:31:15,399 --> 02:31:16,279
and then you get, you get a

3990
02:31:16,279 --> 02:31:18,279
a really imprecise, um, measurement of the

3991
02:31:18,279 --> 02:31:19,739
of the full average.

3992
02:31:19,739 --> 02:31:21,719
But if you sample more and more people

3993
02:31:21,719 --> 02:31:23,691
the accuracy gets, gets better and better and it.

3994
02:31:23,691 --> 02:31:23,779
..

3995
02:31:23,779 --> 02:31:27,019
The accuracy improves like the square root of the number of

3996
02:31:27,019 --> 02:31:28,359
of people you, uh, you sample.

3997
02:31:28,359 --> 02:31:30,467
So yeah, if you sample, um, 1

3998
02:31:30,467 --> 02:31:31,639
000 people, you can get like a two

3999
02:31:31,639 --> 02:31:32,599
3% margin of error.

4000
02:31:32,599 --> 02:31:36,599
So in the same sense, if you measure the primes in a certain multiplicative sense

4001
02:31:36,599 --> 02:31:39,799
there's a certain type of statistic you, you can measure and it's

4002
02:31:39,799 --> 02:31:41,959
it's called the Riemann zeta function, and it fluctuates up and down.

4003
02:31:41,959 --> 02:31:44,099
But, uh, in some sense, um

4004
02:31:44,099 --> 02:31:46,659
as you keep averaging more and more, if you sample more and more

4005
02:31:46,659 --> 02:31:48,639
the fluctuations should go down as if they were random.

4006
02:31:48,639 --> 02:31:50,819
And there's a very precise way to quantify that

4007
02:31:50,819 --> 02:31:54,779
and the Riemann hypothesis is a very elegant way that captures this.

4008
02:31:54,779 --> 02:31:58,439
But, um, as with many other ways in mathematics

4009
02:31:58,439 --> 02:32:02,339
we have very few tools to show that something really genuinely behaves r- like

4010
02:32:02,339 --> 02:32:03,059
really random.

4011
02:32:03,059 --> 02:32:05,359
And this is actually not, not just a little bit random

4012
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:09,039
but it's, it's asking that it behaves as random as an actually random set

4013
02:32:09,039 --> 02:32:11,483
this, this, this square root cancellation.

4014
02:32:11,483 --> 02:32:11,656
..

4015
02:32:11,656 --> 02:32:14,883
. and we know actually because of things related to parity problem

4016
02:32:14,883 --> 02:32:19,363
actually, that- that most of us usual techniques cannot hope to settle this question.

4017
02:32:19,363 --> 02:32:22,423
Um, the proof has to come out of left field.

4018
02:32:22,423 --> 02:32:26,243
Um, yeah, but, uh, what that is

4019
02:32:26,243 --> 02:32:29,303
you know, no one has any serious proposal.

4020
02:32:29,303 --> 02:32:32,163
Um, yeah, and- and there's- there's various ways to sort of

4021
02:32:32,163 --> 02:32:34,064
as I said, you- you can modify the primes a little bit

4022
02:32:34,064 --> 02:32:35,923
and you can destroy the Riemann- Riemann hypothesis.

4023
02:32:35,923 --> 02:32:38,943
Um, so, like, it has to be very delicate.

4024
02:32:38,943 --> 02:32:41,743
You can't apply something that has huge margins of error.

4025
02:32:41,743 --> 02:32:44,503
It has to just barely work, um

4026
02:32:44,503 --> 02:32:48,564
and like, um, there's like all these pits- pitfalls that you have to

4027
02:32:48,564 --> 02:32:52,323
like, dodge very adeptly to- The prime numbers is just fascinating.

4028
02:32:52,323 --> 02:32:53,063
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4029
02:32:53,063 --> 02:32:57,883
What- what to you is, um, most mysterious about the prime numbers?

4030
02:32:57,883 --> 02:33:00,843
That's a- that's a good question.

4031
02:33:00,843 --> 02:33:03,504
It's also, like, conjecturally we have a good model of them.

4032
02:33:03,504 --> 02:33:04,703
I mean, like, as I said, I mean

4033
02:33:04,703 --> 02:33:06,123
they have certain patterns.

4034
02:33:06,123 --> 02:33:07,823
Like the primes are usually odd, for instance.

4035
02:33:07,823 --> 02:33:11,224
But apart from this of obvious patterns, they behave very randomly

4036
02:33:11,224 --> 02:33:12,987
and just assuming that they behave.

4037
02:33:12,987 --> 02:33:13,103
..

4038
02:33:13,103 --> 02:33:17,403
So there's something called the Cramer random model of the primes that- that- that after a certain point

4039
02:33:17,403 --> 02:33:18,763
primes just behave like a random set.

4040
02:33:18,763 --> 02:33:21,923
Um, and there's various slight modifications to this model

4041
02:33:21,923 --> 02:33:23,523
but this has been a very good model.

4042
02:33:23,523 --> 02:33:25,023
It matches the numerics.

4043
02:33:25,023 --> 02:33:26,683
It tells us what to predict.

4044
02:33:26,683 --> 02:33:29,303
Like, I can tell you with complete certainty the Turing complete conjecture is true.

4045
02:33:29,303 --> 02:33:32,423
Uh, the random model gives overwhelming odds that it's true.

4046
02:33:32,423 --> 02:33:33,183
I just can't prove it.

4047
02:33:33,183 --> 02:33:38,343
Most of our mathematics is optimized for solving things with patterns in them

4048
02:33:38,343 --> 02:33:41,903
um, and the primes have this anti-pattern

4049
02:33:41,903 --> 02:33:47,103
um, as do almost everything really, but we can't prove that.

4050
02:33:47,103 --> 02:33:53,003
Yeah, I guess it's not mysterious how the primes be ran- kind of random because there's no reason for them to be

4051
02:33:53,003 --> 02:33:56,583
um, uh, to have any kind of secret pattern.

4052
02:33:56,583 --> 02:34:02,043
But what is mysterious is what is the mechanism that really forces the randomness to happen

4053
02:34:02,043 --> 02:34:04,063
uh, and this is just absent.

4054
02:34:04,063 --> 02:34:09,703
Another incredibly surprisingly difficult problem is the Collatz conjecture.

4055
02:34:09,703 --> 02:34:10,323
Oh, yes.

4056
02:34:10,323 --> 02:34:12,103
Simple to state- Mm-hmm.

4057
02:34:12,103 --> 02:34:12,156
.

4058
02:34:12,156 --> 02:34:12,263
..

4059
02:34:12,263 --> 02:34:14,283
beautiful to visualize- Yes.

4060
02:34:14,283 --> 02:34:14,289
.

4061
02:34:14,289 --> 02:34:14,303
..

4062
02:34:14,303 --> 02:34:17,623
in its simplicity, and yet extremely, uh

4063
02:34:17,623 --> 02:34:20,823
difficult to solve, and yet you have been able to make progress.

4064
02:34:20,823 --> 02:34:24,443
Uh, uh, Paul Rudyar said about the Collatz conjecture

4065
02:34:24,443 --> 02:34:27,553
"That mathematics may not be ready for such problems.

4066
02:34:27,553 --> 02:34:28,263
" Mm-hmm.

4067
02:34:28,263 --> 02:34:33,223
Others have stated that it is an extraordinarily difficult problem completely out of reach

4068
02:34:33,223 --> 02:34:36,983
this is in 2010, out of reach of present day mathematics and yet- Yeah.

4069
02:34:36,983 --> 02:34:36,996
.

4070
02:34:36,996 --> 02:34:37,023
..

4071
02:34:37,023 --> 02:34:38,143
you have made some progress.

4072
02:34:38,143 --> 02:34:39,943
Why is it so difficult to make?

4073
02:34:39,943 --> 02:34:41,663
Can you actually even explain what it is

4074
02:34:41,663 --> 02:34:42,063
is it easy to- Oh, yeah, yeah

4075
02:34:42,063 --> 02:34:42,283
yeah.

4076
02:34:42,283 --> 02:34:44,423
So it's a- it's a- it's a problem that you can explain

4077
02:34:44,423 --> 02:34:46,623
um, you know, it- it, um

4078
02:34:46,623 --> 02:34:48,903
it helps with some, um, visual aids

4079
02:34:48,903 --> 02:34:51,963
but yeah, so you take any natural number like say 13

4080
02:34:51,963 --> 02:34:54,403
and you apply the following procedure to it.

4081
02:34:54,403 --> 02:34:56,403
So if it's even, you divide it by two

4082
02:34:56,403 --> 02:34:59,643
and if it's odd, you multiply it by three and add one.

4083
02:34:59,643 --> 02:35:01,883
So even numbers get smaller, odd numbers get bigger.

4084
02:35:01,883 --> 02:35:05,423
So 13, uh, would become 40, because 13 times three is 39

4085
02:35:05,423 --> 02:35:06,203
add one, you get 40.

4086
02:35:06,203 --> 02:35:08,403
So it's a simple process.

4087
02:35:08,403 --> 02:35:11,443
For odd numbers and even numbers, they're both very easy operations

4088
02:35:11,443 --> 02:35:13,643
and then you put them together, it's still reasonably simple.

4089
02:35:13,643 --> 02:35:17,043
Um, but then you ask what happens when you iterate it.

4090
02:35:17,043 --> 02:35:19,203
You- you take the output that you just got and feed it back in.

4091
02:35:19,203 --> 02:35:22,043
So 13 becomes 40, 40 is now even

4092
02:35:22,043 --> 02:35:24,043
divide by two is 20, 20 is still even

4093
02:35:24,043 --> 02:35:28,063
divide by two, 10, five, and then five times three plus one is 16

4094
02:35:28,063 --> 02:35:30,023
and then eight, four, two, one.

4095
02:35:30,023 --> 02:35:32,443
So, uh, and then from one it goes one

4096
02:35:32,443 --> 02:35:33,543
four, two, one, four, two, one.

4097
02:35:33,543 --> 02:35:34,323
It cycles forever.

4098
02:35:34,323 --> 02:35:36,863
So the sequence I just described, um

4099
02:35:36,863 --> 02:35:39,043
you know, 13, 40, 20, 10 so forth

4100
02:35:39,043 --> 02:35:44,823
these are also called hailstone sequences because there's an oversimplified model of- of hailstone formation

4101
02:35:44,823 --> 02:35:49,463
you know, which is not actually quite correct but it's still somehow taught to high school students as a first approximation

4102
02:35:49,463 --> 02:35:53,343
is that, um, like a- a little nugget of ice gets- gets

4103
02:35:53,343 --> 02:35:55,483
uh, an ice crystal, forms in- in a cloud

4104
02:35:55,483 --> 02:35:57,743
and it goes up and down because of the wind

4105
02:35:57,743 --> 02:35:59,803
uh, and- and sometimes when it's cold

4106
02:35:59,803 --> 02:36:01,463
it acquires a bit- a bit more mass

4107
02:36:01,463 --> 02:36:07,023
and maybe it melts a little bit, and this process of going up and down creates this sort of partially melted ice

4108
02:36:07,023 --> 02:36:09,863
which eventually creates this hailstone, and eventually it falls down to the earth.

4109
02:36:09,863 --> 02:36:13,703
So the conjecture is that no matter how high you start up

4110
02:36:13,703 --> 02:36:15,623
like you take a number which is in the millions or billions

4111
02:36:15,623 --> 02:36:19,843
you co- you have this process that- that goes up if you're odd and- and down if you're even

4112
02:36:19,843 --> 02:36:23,303
it eventually goes down to- to- to earth all the time.

4113
02:36:23,303 --> 02:36:26,003
No matter where you start with this very simple algorithm

4114
02:36:26,003 --> 02:36:27,103
you end up at one.

4115
02:36:27,103 --> 02:36:27,323
Right.

4116
02:36:27,323 --> 02:36:29,483
And you might climb for a while- Right.

4117
02:36:29,483 --> 02:36:30,223
Yeah, so it's- .

4118
02:36:30,223 --> 02:36:30,223
..

4119
02:36:30,223 --> 02:36:30,763
and come down.

4120
02:36:30,763 --> 02:36:32,883
Yeah, if you plotted, um, these sequences

4121
02:36:32,883 --> 02:36:34,183
they look like Brownian motion.

4122
02:36:34,183 --> 02:36:35,463
Um, they look like the stock market

4123
02:36:35,463 --> 02:36:38,943
you know, they just go up and down in a- in a seemingly random pattern.

4124
02:36:38,943 --> 02:36:42,863
And in fact usually that's what happens, th- that- that if you plug in a random number

4125
02:36:42,863 --> 02:36:45,363
you can actually prove at least initially that it would look like

4126
02:36:45,363 --> 02:36:46,923
um, a random walk.

4127
02:36:46,923 --> 02:36:48,883
Um, and it's actually a random walk with

4128
02:36:48,883 --> 02:36:50,023
uh, a downward drift.

4129
02:36:50,023 --> 02:36:52,983
Um, it's like if you're always gambling on- on

4130
02:36:52,983 --> 02:36:56,383
uh, roulette at a- at the casino with odds slightly weighted against you

4131
02:36:56,383 --> 02:36:58,243
so sometimes you- you win, sometimes you lose

4132
02:36:58,243 --> 02:37:01,523
but over, in the long run, you lose a bit more than you win

4133
02:37:01,523 --> 02:37:04,683
um, and so normally your wallet will hit- will go to zero

4134
02:37:04,683 --> 02:37:06,743
um, if you just keep playing over and over again.

4135
02:37:06,743 --> 02:37:10,003
So statistically it makes sense that it would do it.

4136
02:37:10,003 --> 02:37:10,023
Yes.

4137
02:37:10,023 --> 02:37:10,023
Yeah.

4138
02:37:10,023 --> 02:37:14,423
So- so the result that I- I proved roughly speaking asserts that- that statistically

4139
02:37:14,423 --> 02:37:19,363
like 99% of all inputs would- would drift down to

4140
02:37:19,363 --> 02:37:21,843
maybe not all the way to one, but to be much

4141
02:37:21,843 --> 02:37:23,283
much smaller than what you started.

4142
02:37:23,283 --> 02:37:26,763
So i- it's- it's like if I told you that if you go to a- a casino

4143
02:37:26,763 --> 02:37:28,223
most of the time you will end up

4144
02:37:28,223 --> 02:37:32,423
if you keep playing for long enough, you end up with a smaller amount in your wallet than when you started.

4145
02:37:32,423 --> 02:37:34,883
Uh, that's kind of like the res- what- the result that I proved.

4146
02:37:34,883 --> 02:37:42,523
So why is that result, like, can you continue down that thread to prove the full conjecture?

4147
02:37:42,523 --> 02:37:44,363
Well, the- the problem is that, um

4148
02:37:44,363 --> 02:37:46,603
my- I- I used arguments from probability theory

4149
02:37:46,603 --> 02:37:49,223
um, and there's always this exceptional event.

4150
02:37:49,223 --> 02:37:52,403
So, you know, so in probability we have these- this law of large numbers

4151
02:37:52,403 --> 02:37:55,943
um, which tells you things like if you play a casino with a

4152
02:37:55,943 --> 02:37:58,223
um, a game at a casino with a losing

4153
02:37:58,223 --> 02:38:01,123
um, expectation, over time you are guaranteed

4154
02:38:01,123 --> 02:38:05,343
or almost surely with proba- probability as close to 100% as you wish

4155
02:38:05,343 --> 02:38:06,483
you're guaranteed to lose money.

4156
02:38:06,483 --> 02:38:08,883
But there's always this exceptional outlier.

4157
02:38:08,883 --> 02:38:14,303
Like, it is mathematically possible that even in- when the game is- is the odds are not in your favor

4158
02:38:14,303 --> 02:38:17,261
you could just keep winning slightly more often than you lose.

4159
02:38:17,261 --> 02:38:17,540
..

4160
02:38:17,540 --> 02:38:19,619
. very much like how in Navier-Stokes there could be

4161
02:38:19,619 --> 02:38:20,980
you know, um, most of the time

4162
02:38:20,980 --> 02:38:22,819
um, your waves can disperse.

4163
02:38:22,819 --> 02:38:27,799
There could be just one outlier choice of initial conditions that would lead you to blow up.

4164
02:38:27,799 --> 02:38:31,340
And there could be one outlier choice of

4165
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:37,359
um, um, a special number that you stick in that shoots off to infinity while all other numbers crash to Earth

4166
02:38:37,359 --> 02:38:38,679
uh, c- crash to one.

4167
02:38:38,679 --> 02:38:39,440
Yeah.

4168
02:38:39,440 --> 02:38:42,379
Um, in fact, um, there's some mathematicians there

4169
02:38:42,379 --> 02:38:44,880
um, who've, uh, Alex Kontorovich, for instance

4170
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:47,619
who've proposed that, um, that actually, um

4171
02:38:47,619 --> 02:38:51,579
these collapse, uh, iterations are like this similar automata.

4172
02:38:51,579 --> 02:38:54,800
Um, that yeah, yeah, if you look at what happened on

4173
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:56,459
on, in binary, they do actually look a little bit like

4174
02:38:56,459 --> 02:38:58,719
like these Game of Life type patterns here.

4175
02:38:58,719 --> 02:38:59,600
Mm-hmm.

4176
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:02,560
Um, and in an a- analogy to how The Game of Life can create these

4177
02:39:02,560 --> 02:39:04,919
these massive, like, self-replicating objects and so forth

4178
02:39:04,919 --> 02:39:08,019
possibly you could create some sort of heavier than air flying machine.

4179
02:39:08,019 --> 02:39:09,479
You know, um, a number which is

4180
02:39:09,479 --> 02:39:11,720
uh, actually encoding this machine which is

4181
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:14,060
uh, just, whose job it is to encode

4182
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:15,959
is to create a, a, a version of itself which is

4183
02:39:15,959 --> 02:39:16,639
which is larger.

4184
02:39:16,639 --> 02:39:20,939
Heavier than air machine encoded in a number- Yeah.

4185
02:39:20,939 --> 02:39:20,952
.

4186
02:39:20,952 --> 02:39:20,979
..

4187
02:39:20,979 --> 02:39:22,819
that flies forever.

4188
02:39:22,819 --> 02:39:23,019
Yeah.

4189
02:39:23,019 --> 02:39:24,245
So Conway, in fact, worked on-  .

4190
02:39:24,245 --> 02:39:24,259
..

4191
02:39:24,259 --> 02:39:25,479
worked on this problem as well.

4192
02:39:25,479 --> 02:39:26,099
Oh, wow.

4193
02:39:26,099 --> 02:39:28,195
So Conway, um, so similar.

4194
02:39:28,195 --> 02:39:28,279
..

4195
02:39:28,279 --> 02:39:31,579
In fact, uh, uh, that was one of our inspirations for the Nav- Navier-Stokes project.

4196
02:39:31,579 --> 02:39:38,459
Uh, Conway studied generalizations of the collapse problem where instead of multiplying by three and adding one or dividing by two

4197
02:39:38,459 --> 02:39:40,019
you, you have more complicated branch rules.

4198
02:39:40,019 --> 02:39:41,999
But, but instead of having two cases

4199
02:39:41,999 --> 02:39:44,099
maybe you have 17 cases and then you go up and down.

4200
02:39:44,099 --> 02:39:47,739
And he showed that once your iteration gets complicated enough

4201
02:39:47,739 --> 02:39:52,239
you can actually encode Turing machines and you can actually make these problems undecidable and

4202
02:39:52,239 --> 02:39:53,099
and do things like this.

4203
02:39:53,099 --> 02:39:56,419
In fact, he invented a programming language for

4204
02:39:56,419 --> 02:39:58,959
uh, these kind of fractional linear transformations.

4205
02:39:58,959 --> 02:40:01,119
He called it FACTRAT as a play on

4206
02:40:01,119 --> 02:40:02,959
on Fortran, uh, and he showed that

4207
02:40:02,959 --> 02:40:05,759
that you could, um, you, you can program as

4208
02:40:05,759 --> 02:40:06,639
uh, Turing complete.

4209
02:40:06,639 --> 02:40:08,279
You could, you could, you could, uh

4210
02:40:08,279 --> 02:40:10,339
um, you could make a program that if

4211
02:40:10,339 --> 02:40:12,759
if your number you insert in was encoded as a prime

4212
02:40:12,759 --> 02:40:14,499
it would sink to zero, it would go down

4213
02:40:14,499 --> 02:40:16,819
otherwise it would go up, uh, and things like that.

4214
02:40:16,819 --> 02:40:19,719
Um, so the general class of problems is

4215
02:40:19,719 --> 02:40:23,199
is really, uh, as complicated as all the mathematics.

4216
02:40:23,199 --> 02:40:25,799
Some of the mystery of the cellular automata that we talked about

4217
02:40:25,799 --> 02:40:30,819
uh, s- s- having a fra- mathematical framework to say anything about cellular automata

4218
02:40:30,819 --> 02:40:34,459
maybe the same kind of framework is required- Yeah.

4219
02:40:34,459 --> 02:40:34,699
Yeah.

4220
02:40:34,699 --> 02:40:34,699
.

4221
02:40:34,699 --> 02:40:34,699
.

4222
02:40:34,699 --> 02:40:35,619
for the Collatz conjecture?

4223
02:40:35,619 --> 02:40:36,239
Yeah.

4224
02:40:36,239 --> 02:40:37,919
If you want to do it, not statistically

4225
02:40:37,919 --> 02:40:40,839
but you really want 100% all inputs to

4226
02:40:40,839 --> 02:40:41,639
to, to fall to Earth.

4227
02:40:41,639 --> 02:40:42,339
Yeah.

4228
02:40:42,339 --> 02:40:43,979
So what might be feasible is, is

4229
02:40:43,979 --> 02:40:46,939
yeah, assisting 99%, you know, going to go to one- Yeah.

4230
02:40:46,939 --> 02:40:46,945
.

4231
02:40:46,945 --> 02:40:46,959
..

4232
02:40:46,959 --> 02:40:50,539
but like everything, yeah, uh, that looks hard.

4233
02:40:50,539 --> 02:40:57,759
What would you say is out of these within reach famous problems is the hardest problem we have today?

4234
02:40:57,759 --> 02:40:58,939
Is it Riemann hypothesis?

4235
02:40:58,939 --> 02:41:00,939
Riemann is up there.

4236
02:41:00,939 --> 02:41:04,019
Um, P equals NP is, is a good one because

4237
02:41:04,019 --> 02:41:05,939
like, uh, that's a m- that's, that's a meta-problem.

4238
02:41:05,939 --> 02:41:07,599
Like, if you solve that in the

4239
02:41:07,599 --> 02:41:10,899
um, in the positive sense that you can find a P equals NP algorithm

4240
02:41:10,899 --> 02:41:13,799
then potentially this solves a lot of other problems as well.

4241
02:41:13,799 --> 02:41:16,999
And we should mention some of the conjectures we've been talking about

4242
02:41:16,999 --> 02:41:19,619
you know, a lot of stuff is built on top of them now.

4243
02:41:19,619 --> 02:41:19,739
Yeah.

4244
02:41:19,739 --> 02:41:20,859
There's ripple effects.

4245
02:41:20,859 --> 02:41:24,579
P equals NP has more ripple effects than basically any other- Right.

4246
02:41:24,579 --> 02:41:27,559
If the Riemann hypothesis is disproven, um

4247
02:41:27,559 --> 02:41:31,559
that'd be a big mental shock to number theorists.

4248
02:41:31,559 --> 02:41:34,459
Uh, but it would have follow-on effects for

4249
02:41:34,459 --> 02:41:35,899
um, cryptography.

4250
02:41:35,899 --> 02:41:36,959
Mm-hmm.

4251
02:41:36,959 --> 02:41:40,079
Um, because a lot of cryptography uses number theory

4252
02:41:40,079 --> 02:41:42,899
um, uses number theory constructions involving primes and so forth.

4253
02:41:42,899 --> 02:41:47,759
And, um, it relies very much on the intuition that number theorists have built over many

4254
02:41:47,759 --> 02:41:52,219
many years of what operations involving primes behave randomly and which ones don't.

4255
02:41:52,219 --> 02:41:55,559
Um, and in particular, our encryption, um

4256
02:41:55,559 --> 02:42:01,339
methods are designed to turn text with information on it into text which is indistinguishable from

4257
02:42:01,339 --> 02:42:04,239
um, fr- from random noise, so, um

4258
02:42:04,239 --> 02:42:07,519
and hence, b- we believe to be almost impossible to crack

4259
02:42:07,519 --> 02:42:09,959
um, at least, b- uh, mathematically.

4260
02:42:09,959 --> 02:42:15,859
Um, but, uh, if something as core to our beliefs as the Riemann hypothesis is

4261
02:42:15,859 --> 02:42:17,619
is wrong, it means that there are

4262
02:42:17,619 --> 02:42:21,059
there are actual patterns of the primes that we're not aware of.

4263
02:42:21,059 --> 02:42:22,979
And if there's one, there's probably gonna be more.

4264
02:42:22,979 --> 02:42:27,379
Um, and suddenly a lot of our crypto systems are in doubt.

4265
02:42:27,379 --> 02:42:28,339
Uh- Yeah.

4266
02:42:28,339 --> 02:42:31,639
But then how do you then say stuff about the

4267
02:42:31,639 --> 02:42:33,699
the primes ?

4268
02:42:33,699 --> 02:42:33,959
Yeah.

4269
02:42:33,959 --> 02:42:35,379
Uh- Like you're going towards the, uh

4270
02:42:35,379 --> 02:42:37,699
Collatz c- conjecture again.

4271
02:42:37,699 --> 02:42:39,779
Um, because if I, I, I.

4272
02:42:39,779 --> 02:42:39,899
..

4273
02:42:39,899 --> 02:42:41,759
Do you want it to be random, right?

4274
02:42:41,759 --> 02:42:41,879
Yes.

4275
02:42:41,879 --> 02:42:41,919
Yeah.

4276
02:42:41,919 --> 02:42:43,119
You want it to be randomly.

4277
02:42:43,119 --> 02:42:43,399
Yeah.

4278
02:42:43,399 --> 02:42:45,499
And so more broadly, I'm just looking for more tools

4279
02:42:45,499 --> 02:42:47,099
more ways to show that, that- Yeah.

4280
02:42:47,099 --> 02:42:47,112
.

4281
02:42:47,112 --> 02:42:47,139
..

4282
02:42:47,139 --> 02:42:47,879
that things are random.

4283
02:42:47,879 --> 02:42:49,579
How do you prove a conspiracy doesn't happen?

4284
02:42:49,579 --> 02:42:50,279
Right.

4285
02:42:50,279 --> 02:42:54,359
Is there any chance to you that P equals NP?

4286
02:42:54,359 --> 02:42:57,419
Is there some, can you imagine a possible universe?

4287
02:42:57,419 --> 02:42:58,239
It is possible.

4288
02:42:58,239 --> 02:42:59,959
I mean, there's, there's various, uh

4289
02:42:59,959 --> 02:43:00,539
scenarios.

4290
02:43:00,539 --> 02:43:06,239
I mean, there, there, there's one where it is technically possible but in fact it's never actually implementable.

4291
02:43:06,239 --> 02:43:09,179
The evidence is sort of slightly pushing in favor of no

4292
02:43:09,179 --> 02:43:11,099
that P, probably P is not equal to NP.

4293
02:43:11,099 --> 02:43:13,279
I mean, it seems like it's one of those cases seem

4294
02:43:13,279 --> 02:43:19,639
or similar to Riemann hypothesis that I think the evidence is le- leaning pretty heavily on the no.

4295
02:43:19,639 --> 02:43:21,399
Certainly more on the no than on the

4296
02:43:21,399 --> 02:43:21,919
on the yes.

4297
02:43:21,919 --> 02:43:26,639
The funny thing about P equals NP is that we have also a lot more obstructions than we do for almost any other problem.

4298
02:43:26,639 --> 02:43:31,999
Um, so while there's evidence, uh, we also have a lot of results ruling out many

4299
02:43:31,999 --> 02:43:33,859
many types of approaches to the problem.

4300
02:43:33,859 --> 02:43:37,239
Uh, this is the one thing that the computer scientists have actually been very good at

4301
02:43:37,239 --> 02:43:40,259
is actually saying that, that certain approaches cannot work

4302
02:43:40,259 --> 02:43:41,159
no-go theorems.

4303
02:43:41,159 --> 02:43:42,279
It could be undecidable.

4304
02:43:42,279 --> 02:43:43,299
We don't, yeah, we don't know.

4305
02:43:43,299 --> 02:43:47,259
There's a funny story I read that when you won the Fields Medal

4306
02:43:47,259 --> 02:43:51,559
somebody from the internet wrote you  and asked

4307
02:43:51,559 --> 02:43:55,410
uh, you know, "What are you gonna do now that you've won this prestigious award?

4308
02:43:55,410 --> 02:43:58,359
" And, and then you just quickly, very humbly said that

4309
02:43:58,359 --> 02:44:02,259
you know, "This shiny medal is not gonna solve any of the problems I'm currently working on

4310
02:44:02,259 --> 02:44:02,869
so I'm just.

4311
02:44:02,869 --> 02:44:02,969
..

4312
02:44:02,969 --> 02:44:03,039
"  Okay.

4313
02:44:03,039 --> 02:44:05,059
"I'm gonna keep, I'm gonna keep working on them.

4314
02:44:05,059 --> 02:44:08,699
" It's just, first of all, it's funny to me that you would answer an email in that context.

4315
02:44:08,699 --> 02:44:12,599
And second of all, it, um, it just shows your humility.

4316
02:44:12,599 --> 02:44:15,899
But anyway, uh, maybe you could speak to the Fields Medal

4317
02:44:15,899 --> 02:44:17,799
but it's another way for me to ask

4318
02:44:17,799 --> 02:44:19,493
uh, w-.

4319
02:44:19,493 --> 02:44:20,183
..

4320
02:44:20,183 --> 02:44:21,963
about, uh, Grigori Perelman.

4321
02:44:21,963 --> 02:44:26,443
What do you think about him famously declining the Fields Medal and the Millennium Prize

4322
02:44:26,443 --> 02:44:30,623
which came with a $1 million of prize money?

4323
02:44:30,623 --> 02:44:33,283
He stated that, "I'm not interested in money or fame.

4324
02:44:33,283 --> 02:44:36,504
The prize is completely irrelevant for me.

4325
02:44:36,504 --> 02:44:39,948
If the proof is correct, then no other recognition is needed.

4326
02:44:39,948 --> 02:44:40,703
" Yeah.

4327
02:44:40,703 --> 02:44:42,303
No, he's, he's somewhat of an outlier

4328
02:44:42,303 --> 02:44:45,063
um, even among mathematicians who tend to

4329
02:44:45,063 --> 02:44:47,783
uh, to have, uh, somewhat idealistic views.

4330
02:44:47,783 --> 02:44:48,983
Um, I've never met him.

4331
02:44:48,983 --> 02:44:50,803
Uh, I think I'd be interested to meet him one day

4332
02:44:50,803 --> 02:44:51,904
but I, I never had the chance.

4333
02:44:51,904 --> 02:44:53,163
I, I know people who met him.

4334
02:44:53,163 --> 02:44:55,343
He's always had strong views about certain things.

4335
02:44:55,343 --> 02:44:57,164
Um, you know, I mean, it's

4336
02:44:57,164 --> 02:44:58,544
it's not like he was completely isolated from the

4337
02:44:58,544 --> 02:44:59,123
the math community.

4338
02:44:59,123 --> 02:45:00,844
I mean, he would, he would give talks and- Mm-hmm.

4339
02:45:00,844 --> 02:45:00,877
.

4340
02:45:00,877 --> 02:45:00,943
..

4341
02:45:00,943 --> 02:45:02,003
and write papers and so forth.

4342
02:45:02,003 --> 02:45:05,443
Um, but at some point he just decided not to engage with the rest of the community.

4343
02:45:05,443 --> 02:45:07,703
He was, he was disillusioned or something.

4344
02:45:07,703 --> 02:45:09,023
Um, I don't know.

4345
02:45:09,023 --> 02:45:12,464
Um, and he decided to, to, uh

4346
02:45:12,464 --> 02:45:14,683
uh, to peace out, uh, and

4347
02:45:14,683 --> 02:45:16,504
you know, collect mushrooms in St Petersburg or something.

4348
02:45:16,504 --> 02:45:16,563
Right.

4349
02:45:16,563 --> 02:45:18,403
And, and that's, that's fine, you know.

4350
02:45:18,403 --> 02:45:19,463
You can, you can do that.

4351
02:45:19,463 --> 02:45:22,415
Um, I mean, that's another sort of flip side to.

4352
02:45:22,415 --> 02:45:22,464
..

4353
02:45:22,464 --> 02:45:23,455
I mean, we are not s-.

4354
02:45:23,455 --> 02:45:23,544
..

4355
02:45:23,544 --> 02:45:25,103
A lot of the problems that we solve

4356
02:45:25,103 --> 02:45:25,429
you know, they.

4357
02:45:25,429 --> 02:45:25,504
..

4358
02:45:25,504 --> 02:45:27,583
Some of them do have practical application and that's

4359
02:45:27,583 --> 02:45:28,104
that's great.

4360
02:45:28,104 --> 02:45:31,663
But, uh, like, if you stop thinking about a problem

4361
02:45:31,663 --> 02:45:32,168
you, you know.

4362
02:45:32,168 --> 02:45:32,203
..

4363
02:45:32,203 --> 02:45:34,544
So he's, he hasn't published since in

4364
02:45:34,544 --> 02:45:36,203
in this field but that's fine 'cause many

4365
02:45:36,203 --> 02:45:37,903
many other people have done so as well.

4366
02:45:37,903 --> 02:45:43,583
Um, yeah, so I guess one thing I didn't realize initially with the Fields Medal is that it

4367
02:45:43,583 --> 02:45:45,803
it sort of makes you part of the establishment.

4368
02:45:45,803 --> 02:45:46,583
Mm-hmm.

4369
02:45:46,583 --> 02:45:46,823
Um, you know?

4370
02:45:46,823 --> 02:45:49,303
So, you know, most mathematicians, you know

4371
02:45:49,303 --> 02:45:51,643
there's, uh, they're just career mathematicians, you know.

4372
02:45:51,643 --> 02:45:53,183
You just focus on publishing your next paper

4373
02:45:53,183 --> 02:45:54,735
maybe getting one st- step.

4374
02:45:54,735 --> 02:45:54,844
..

4375
02:45:54,844 --> 02:45:56,923
promote one, one rank, you know, and

4376
02:45:56,923 --> 02:46:00,203
and starting a few p- projects, maybe ha- taking some students or something.

4377
02:46:00,203 --> 02:46:03,923
Yeah, but then suddenly people want your opinion on things and

4378
02:46:03,923 --> 02:46:05,903
uh, you have to think a little b- about

4379
02:46:05,903 --> 02:46:09,663
uh, you know, things that you might just sort of foolishly say because you know no one's gonna listen to you .

4380
02:46:09,663 --> 02:46:11,383
Uh, it's just, it's more important now.

4381
02:46:11,383 --> 02:46:13,023
Is it constraining to you?

4382
02:46:13,023 --> 02:46:18,083
Are you able to still have fun and be a rebel and try crazy stuff and- Well

4383
02:46:18,083 --> 02:46:18,349
uh- .

4384
02:46:18,349 --> 02:46:18,363
..

4385
02:46:18,363 --> 02:46:19,123
play with ideas?

4386
02:46:19,123 --> 02:46:22,243
I have a lot less free time than I- Yeah.

4387
02:46:22,243 --> 02:46:22,256
.

4388
02:46:22,256 --> 02:46:22,283
..

4389
02:46:22,283 --> 02:46:23,303
had previously.

4390
02:46:23,303 --> 02:46:24,943
Um, I mean, mostly by choice.

4391
02:46:24,943 --> 02:46:25,913
I mean, I, I, I could.

4392
02:46:25,913 --> 02:46:26,003
..

4393
02:46:26,003 --> 02:46:27,403
Obviously I have the option to sort of

4394
02:46:27,403 --> 02:46:29,143
uh, decline, uh.

4395
02:46:29,143 --> 02:46:29,183
..

4396
02:46:29,183 --> 02:46:30,143
So I decline a- a lot of things.

4397
02:46:30,143 --> 02:46:31,643
I, I, I could, I could decline even more.

4398
02:46:31,643 --> 02:46:35,963
Um, or I could acquire a reputation for being so unreliable that people don't even ask anymore.

4399
02:46:35,963 --> 02:46:37,903
 Uh, but this is, this- I love

4400
02:46:37,903 --> 02:46:39,683
I love the different algorithms you use.

4401
02:46:39,683 --> 02:46:40,483
 This is great.

4402
02:46:40,483 --> 02:46:41,305
Uh, uh, this.

4403
02:46:41,305 --> 02:46:41,403
..

4404
02:46:41,403 --> 02:46:42,403
It's, it's, it's always an option.

4405
02:46:42,403 --> 02:46:45,863
Um, but, you know, um, there are things that are

4406
02:46:45,863 --> 02:46:46,468
you know, like.

4407
02:46:46,468 --> 02:46:46,623
..

4408
02:46:46,623 --> 02:46:48,279
I, I mean, sort of.

4409
02:46:48,279 --> 02:46:48,383
..

4410
02:46:48,383 --> 02:46:51,003
I mean, I, I, I don't spend as much time as I do as a postdoc

4411
02:46:51,003 --> 02:46:52,943
you know, just, just working on one problem at a time or

4412
02:46:52,943 --> 02:46:54,643
um, fooling around.

4413
02:46:54,643 --> 02:46:55,923
I still do that a little bit.

4414
02:46:55,923 --> 02:46:57,023
But I, yeah.

4415
02:46:57,023 --> 02:46:58,843
As you advance in your career, it's somewhat.

4416
02:46:58,843 --> 02:46:58,963
..

4417
02:46:58,963 --> 02:47:00,414
The more soft skills.

4418
02:47:00,414 --> 02:47:00,543
..

4419
02:47:00,543 --> 02:47:04,383
So math somehow front loads all the technical skills to the early stage of your career.

4420
02:47:04,383 --> 02:47:06,579
So, um, yeah, so it's, uh.

4421
02:47:06,579 --> 02:47:06,683
..

4422
02:47:06,683 --> 02:47:08,183
As a postdoc, it's publish or perish.

4423
02:47:08,183 --> 02:47:11,783
You, you, you're insent- you're, you're incentivized to basically focus on

4424
02:47:11,783 --> 02:47:14,203
on proving very technical theorems just to prove yourself

4425
02:47:14,203 --> 02:47:16,243
um, as well as prove the theorems.

4426
02:47:16,243 --> 02:47:20,683
Um, but then as, as you get more senior you have to start

4427
02:47:20,683 --> 02:47:22,363
you know, mentoring and, and, and

4428
02:47:22,363 --> 02:47:24,343
and giving interviews, uh, and, uh

4429
02:47:24,343 --> 02:47:28,343
and trying to shape, um, direction in the field both research-wise and

4430
02:47:28,343 --> 02:47:30,583
and, you know, uh, sometimes you have to

4431
02:47:30,583 --> 02:47:33,423
uh, uh, you know, do s- very s- administrative things.

4432
02:47:33,423 --> 02:47:36,803
And it's kind of a, uh, the right social contract because you

4433
02:47:36,803 --> 02:47:39,943
you need to, to work in the trenches to see what can help mathematicians.

4434
02:47:39,943 --> 02:47:41,963
The other side of the establishment, sort of the

4435
02:47:41,963 --> 02:47:44,923
the really positive thing is that, um

4436
02:47:44,923 --> 02:47:50,903
you get to be a light that's an inspiration to a lot of young mathematicians or young people that are just interested in mathematics.

4437
02:47:50,903 --> 02:47:52,643
And it's like- Yeah, yeah.

4438
02:47:52,643 --> 02:47:54,383
It's just how the human mind works.

4439
02:47:54,383 --> 02:47:56,623
This is where I would probably, uh

4440
02:47:56,623 --> 02:48:03,703
say that I like the Fields Medal, th- that it does inspire a lot of pe- young people somehow.

4441
02:48:03,703 --> 02:48:03,978
I don't.

4442
02:48:03,978 --> 02:48:04,023
..

4443
02:48:04,023 --> 02:48:05,683
This is just how human brains work.

4444
02:48:05,683 --> 02:48:06,183
Yeah.

4445
02:48:06,183 --> 02:48:14,003
At the same time I also want to give sort of respect to somebody like Grigori Perelman who is critical of awards.

4446
02:48:14,003 --> 02:48:19,123
In his mind those are his principles, and any human that's able for their principles to

4447
02:48:19,123 --> 02:48:22,683
like, do the thing that most humans would not be able to do

4448
02:48:22,683 --> 02:48:24,663
it's beautiful to see.

4449
02:48:24,663 --> 02:48:25,283
Right.

4450
02:48:25,283 --> 02:48:27,503
Some recognition is, is necessary and important

4451
02:48:27,503 --> 02:48:32,503
uh, but yeah, it's, it's also important to not let these things take over your life- Yeah.

4452
02:48:32,503 --> 02:48:32,543
.

4453
02:48:32,543 --> 02:48:32,623
..

4454
02:48:32,623 --> 02:48:34,343
um, and like only be concerned about

4455
02:48:34,343 --> 02:48:37,103
uh, getting the next big award or whatever.

4456
02:48:37,103 --> 02:48:38,859
Um, I mean, uh, if it.

4457
02:48:38,859 --> 02:48:39,003
..

4458
02:48:39,003 --> 02:48:43,243
Yeah, so ag- again you see these people try to only solve like really big math problems and

4459
02:48:43,243 --> 02:48:45,883
and not work on, on, on things that are less

4460
02:48:45,883 --> 02:48:47,863
uh, sexy if you wish- Mm-hmm.

4461
02:48:47,863 --> 02:48:47,883
.

4462
02:48:47,883 --> 02:48:47,923
..

4463
02:48:47,923 --> 02:48:50,203
but, but, but actually, uh, still interesting and

4464
02:48:50,203 --> 02:48:51,163
and ins- instructive.

4465
02:48:51,163 --> 02:48:54,323
As you say, like, the way the human mind works it's

4466
02:48:54,323 --> 02:48:54,663
um.

4467
02:48:54,663 --> 02:48:54,743
..

4468
02:48:54,743 --> 02:48:57,323
We understand things better when they're attached to humans

4469
02:48:57,323 --> 02:49:00,883
um, and also, uh, if they're attached to a small number of humans.

4470
02:49:00,883 --> 02:49:01,453
Like s- I.

4471
02:49:01,453 --> 02:49:01,583
..

4472
02:49:01,583 --> 02:49:02,537
The, this, this, this.

4473
02:49:02,537 --> 02:49:02,543
..

4474
02:49:02,543 --> 02:49:04,363
The way our humans, um, mind is

4475
02:49:04,363 --> 02:49:07,743
is wired we can comprehend the relationships between

4476
02:49:07,743 --> 02:49:09,023
you know, 10 or 20 people.

4477
02:49:09,023 --> 02:49:10,643
Uh, but once they get beyond that

4478
02:49:10,643 --> 02:49:11,783
like, 100 people, I.

4479
02:49:11,783 --> 02:49:11,863
..

4480
02:49:11,863 --> 02:49:12,883
there's, there's a, there's a limit.

4481
02:49:12,883 --> 02:49:13,903
I think there's a name for it.

4482
02:49:13,903 --> 02:49:17,023
Um, beyond which, uh, it just becomes the other.

4483
02:49:17,023 --> 02:49:17,643
Yeah.

4484
02:49:17,643 --> 02:49:19,643
Um, and, uh, so we have.

4485
02:49:19,643 --> 02:49:19,683
..

4486
02:49:19,683 --> 02:49:21,183
You have to simplify the whole mass of

4487
02:49:21,183 --> 02:49:21,843
you know, 99.

4488
02:49:21,843 --> 02:49:23,303
9% of humanity becomes the other.

4489
02:49:23,303 --> 02:49:26,523
Um, and, uh, and often  these models are

4490
02:49:26,523 --> 02:49:28,723
are, are incorrect and this causes all kinds of problems.

4491
02:49:28,723 --> 02:49:30,683
But, um, so yeah.

4492
02:49:30,683 --> 02:49:32,843
So to humanize a subject, you know

4493
02:49:32,843 --> 02:49:34,543
if you identify a small number of people and say

4494
02:49:34,543 --> 02:49:37,131
"Oh, these are representative people of a subject.

4495
02:49:37,131 --> 02:49:38,383
" You know, these are role models, uh

4496
02:49:38,383 --> 02:49:38,983
for example.

4497
02:49:38,983 --> 02:49:43,503
Um, that has some role, um, but it can also be

4498
02:49:43,503 --> 02:49:44,823
um, uh.

4499
02:49:44,823 --> 02:49:44,943
..

4500
02:49:44,943 --> 02:49:47,705
Yeah, too much of it can be harmful because it's.

4501
02:49:47,705 --> 02:49:47,803
..

4502
02:49:47,803 --> 02:49:53,243
I, I'll be the first to say that my own career traff- path is not that of a typical mathematician.

4503
02:49:53,243 --> 02:49:55,163
Um, I did a very accelerated, uh

4504
02:49:55,163 --> 02:49:55,723
education.

4505
02:49:55,723 --> 02:49:56,783
I skipped a lot of classes.

4506
02:49:56,783 --> 02:49:59,823
Um, I think I always had very fortunate mentoring

4507
02:49:59,823 --> 02:50:00,643
uh, opportunities.

4508
02:50:00,643 --> 02:50:02,923
Um, and I think I was at the right place at the right time.

4509
02:50:02,923 --> 02:50:06,403
Just because someone does- doesn't have my, um

4510
02:50:06,403 --> 02:50:08,543
trajectory, you know, it doesn't mean that they

4511
02:50:08,543 --> 02:50:09,483
they can't be good mathematicians.

4512
02:50:09,483 --> 02:50:11,843
I mean, they could be math, good mathematicians in

4513
02:50:11,843 --> 02:50:14,823
in a very different style, uh, and we need people w- with a different style.

4514
02:50:14,823 --> 02:50:18,219
Um, and, you know, even if.

4515
02:50:18,219 --> 02:50:18,323
..

4516
02:50:18,323 --> 02:50:20,363
Uh, and sometimes too much focus is given on the

4517
02:50:20,363 --> 02:50:23,303
on the person who d- does the last step to complete

4518
02:50:23,303 --> 02:50:24,017
um-.

4519
02:50:24,017 --> 02:50:24,355
..

4520
02:50:24,355 --> 02:50:26,175
a, a project in mathematics or elsewhere that's

4521
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:30,676
that's really taken, you know, centuries or decades of lots and lots of building on lots of previous work.

4522
02:50:30,676 --> 02:50:33,415
Um, but that's a s- a story that's difficult to tell

4523
02:50:33,415 --> 02:50:35,155
um, if you're not an expert because

4524
02:50:35,155 --> 02:50:38,136
you know, it- it's easier to just say one person did this one thing

4525
02:50:38,136 --> 02:50:40,015
you know, it makes for a much simpler history.

4526
02:50:40,015 --> 02:50:42,715
I think on the whole it, um

4527
02:50:42,715 --> 02:50:46,935
is a hugely positive thing to, to talk about Steve Jobs- Mm-hmm.

4528
02:50:46,935 --> 02:50:46,968
.

4529
02:50:46,968 --> 02:50:47,035
..

4530
02:50:47,035 --> 02:50:51,016
as a representative of Apple when I personally know and

4531
02:50:51,016 --> 02:50:53,955
of course, everybody knows the incredible design

4532
02:50:53,955 --> 02:50:56,121
the incredible engineering teams-  .

4533
02:50:56,121 --> 02:50:56,135
..

4534
02:50:56,135 --> 02:51:00,475
just the individual humans on those teams, they're not a team

4535
02:51:00,475 --> 02:51:04,035
they're individual humans on a team and there's a lot of brilliance there

4536
02:51:04,035 --> 02:51:07,135
but it's just a nice shorthand like a ver- like pie.

4537
02:51:07,135 --> 02:51:07,635
Yeah.

4538
02:51:07,635 --> 02:51:09,395
Steve Jobs- Yeah, yeah.

4539
02:51:09,395 --> 02:51:09,401
.

4540
02:51:09,401 --> 02:51:09,415
..

4541
02:51:09,415 --> 02:51:09,756
pie.

4542
02:51:09,756 --> 02:51:11,135
As a, as a starting point, you see

4543
02:51:11,135 --> 02:51:11,756
you know- Yeah.

4544
02:51:11,756 --> 02:51:11,796
.

4545
02:51:11,796 --> 02:51:11,876
..

4546
02:51:11,876 --> 02:51:13,195
as a fir- as a first approximation, that's- Yes.

4547
02:51:13,195 --> 02:51:13,201
.

4548
02:51:13,201 --> 02:51:13,215
..

4549
02:51:13,215 --> 02:51:13,516
that's how you put it.

4550
02:51:13,516 --> 02:51:17,196
And then read some biographies and then look into much deeper first approximation.

4551
02:51:17,196 --> 02:51:17,655
 Yeah.

4552
02:51:17,655 --> 02:51:18,536
That's right.

4553
02:51:18,536 --> 02:51:20,615
Uh, so you menti- you were at Princeton to

4554
02:51:20,615 --> 02:51:21,315
um- Mm-hmm.

4555
02:51:21,315 --> 02:51:22,775
Andrew Wiles at that time- Oh, yeah.

4556
02:51:22,775 --> 02:51:22,781
.

4557
02:51:22,781 --> 02:51:22,795
..

4558
02:51:22,795 --> 02:51:23,555
who was a professor there.

4559
02:51:23,555 --> 02:51:23,755
Mm-hmm.

4560
02:51:23,755 --> 02:51:26,695
It's a funny moment how history is just all interconnected.

4561
02:51:26,695 --> 02:51:29,695
And at that time he announced that he proved the Fermat's Last Theorem.

4562
02:51:29,695 --> 02:51:30,095
Oh, yeah.

4563
02:51:30,095 --> 02:51:36,315
What did you think, maybe looking back now with more context about that moment in

4564
02:51:36,315 --> 02:51:37,135
uh, math history?

4565
02:51:37,135 --> 02:51:39,255
Yeah, so I was a graduate student at the time.

4566
02:51:39,255 --> 02:51:41,015
I mean, I, I vaguely remember, you know

4567
02:51:41,015 --> 02:51:43,175
there was press attention and, uh, um

4568
02:51:43,175 --> 02:51:45,055
we all had the same, um, uh

4569
02:51:45,055 --> 02:51:46,755
we all had pigeonholes in the same mailroom

4570
02:51:46,755 --> 02:51:48,335
you know, so we all checked our mail and

4571
02:51:48,335 --> 02:51:52,115
and like suddenly Andrew Wiles' mailbox exploded to be overflowing

4572
02:51:52,115 --> 02:51:54,115
uh-  That's a good, that's a good metric.

4573
02:51:54,115 --> 02:51:56,735
Yeah, um, you know, so yeah

4574
02:51:56,735 --> 02:51:57,955
we all, we all talked about it at

4575
02:51:57,955 --> 02:51:58,735
at tea and so forth.

4576
02:51:58,735 --> 02:52:00,255
I mean, uh, we, we didn't understand

4577
02:52:00,255 --> 02:52:02,275
most of us still didn't understand the proof.

4578
02:52:02,275 --> 02:52:04,915
Um, we understood sort of high level details

4579
02:52:04,915 --> 02:52:08,735
um, like there's an ongoing project to formalize it in Lean that Kevin Buzzard is heading.

4580
02:52:08,735 --> 02:52:11,115
Yeah, can, can we take that small tangent?

4581
02:52:11,115 --> 02:52:12,091
Is it, is it.

4582
02:52:12,091 --> 02:52:12,235
..

4583
02:52:12,235 --> 02:52:13,395
how difficult is that?

4584
02:52:13,395 --> 02:52:15,855
'Cause as, as I understand the Fermat's Last

4585
02:52:15,855 --> 02:52:20,975
the, the proof for, uh, Fermat's Last Theorem has like super complicated objects- Yeah.

4586
02:52:20,975 --> 02:52:21,255
Yeah, the- .

4587
02:52:21,255 --> 02:52:21,255
..

4588
02:52:21,255 --> 02:52:22,575
it's really difficult to formalize, no?

4589
02:52:22,575 --> 02:52:23,715
Yeah, I guess, yeah, you're right

4590
02:52:23,715 --> 02:52:25,515
the, the objects that they use, um

4591
02:52:25,515 --> 02:52:29,035
you can define them, uh, so they've been defined in Lean

4592
02:52:29,035 --> 02:52:31,455
okay, so it's, so just defining what they are- Mm-hmm.

4593
02:52:31,455 --> 02:52:31,455
.

4594
02:52:31,455 --> 02:52:31,455
.

4595
02:52:31,455 --> 02:52:32,115
can be done.

4596
02:52:32,115 --> 02:52:34,035
Uh, that's really not trivial but it's been done

4597
02:52:34,035 --> 02:52:36,995
uh, but there's a lot of really basic facts about

4598
02:52:36,995 --> 02:52:40,555
um, these objects that have taken decades to prove and that they're

4599
02:52:40,555 --> 02:52:42,155
they're in all these different math papers.

4600
02:52:42,155 --> 02:52:44,735
And so lot- lots of these have to be formalized as well.

4601
02:52:44,735 --> 02:52:48,815
Um, Kevin's, uh, K- Kevin Buzzard's goal actually

4602
02:52:48,815 --> 02:52:52,015
he has fi- a five-year grant to formalize Fermat's Last Theorem

4603
02:52:52,015 --> 02:53:05,075
and his aim is that he doesn't think he will be able to get all the way down to the basic axioms what he wants to formalize it to the point where the only things that he needs to rely on is black boxes or things that were known by 1980 to

4604
02:53:05,075 --> 02:53:06,715
um, to number theorists at the time.

4605
02:53:06,715 --> 02:53:10,895
Um, and then some other person or some other work would have to be done to

4606
02:53:10,895 --> 02:53:12,455
to, to get from there.

4607
02:53:12,455 --> 02:53:15,935
Uh, so it's, it's a different area of mathematics than

4608
02:53:15,935 --> 02:53:17,595
um, the type of mathematics I'm used to.

4609
02:53:17,595 --> 02:53:20,935
Um, um, in analysis, which is kind of my area

4610
02:53:20,935 --> 02:53:23,815
um, the objects we study are kind of much closer to the ground.

4611
02:53:23,815 --> 02:53:26,275
We study, I study things like prime numbers and

4612
02:53:26,275 --> 02:53:31,675
and, and functions and, and things that are within the scope of a high school

4613
02:53:31,675 --> 02:53:33,875
um, uh, math education to at least

4614
02:53:33,875 --> 02:53:34,675
uh, define.

4615
02:53:34,675 --> 02:53:42,135
Um, yeah, but then there's this very advanced algebraic side of number theory where people have been building structures upon structures for quite a while

4616
02:53:42,135 --> 02:53:44,555
um, and it's, it's a very sturdy structure.

4617
02:53:44,555 --> 02:53:45,755
There's a, there's, it's, it's, it's been

4618
02:53:45,755 --> 02:53:47,875
it's been very, um, the, the

4619
02:53:47,875 --> 02:53:50,755
the at the base at least it's extremely well developed with textbooks and so forth.

4620
02:53:50,755 --> 02:53:53,795
But, um, um, it does get to the point where

4621
02:53:53,795 --> 02:53:57,995
um, if you're, if you haven't taken these years of study and you wanna ask about what

4622
02:53:57,995 --> 02:54:01,215
what is going on at, um, like level six of th- of this tower

4623
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:05,115
I, you have to spend quite a bit of time before they can even get to the point where you can see

4624
02:54:05,115 --> 02:54:06,435
you see something you recognize.

4625
02:54:06,435 --> 02:54:10,155
What, uh, inspires you about his journey that was similar

4626
02:54:10,155 --> 02:54:15,095
as we talked about seven years mostly s- working in secret?

4627
02:54:15,095 --> 02:54:17,115
Yeah, uh, it's a, that is a

4628
02:54:17,115 --> 02:54:20,195
a romantic, uh, yeah, so it kind of fits with the sort of the

4629
02:54:20,195 --> 02:54:27,275
the romantic image that I think people have of mathematicians to the extent they think of them at all as these kind of eccentric

4630
02:54:27,275 --> 02:54:29,495
uh, you know, wizards or something, um.

4631
02:54:29,495 --> 02:54:31,375
So yeah, that certainly kind of, uh

4632
02:54:31,375 --> 02:54:35,835
uh, accentuated that perspective, you know, I mean

4633
02:54:35,835 --> 02:54:37,535
it's, it is a great achievement.

4634
02:54:37,535 --> 02:54:41,335
Yeah, his style of solving problems is so different from my own 

4635
02:54:41,335 --> 02:54:43,335
um, but wh- which is great.

4636
02:54:43,335 --> 02:54:44,475
I mean, we- we need people like that.

4637
02:54:44,475 --> 02:54:44,775
Can you speak to it?

4638
02:54:44,775 --> 02:54:46,288
Like what, uh- Um- .

4639
02:54:46,288 --> 02:54:46,355
..

4640
02:54:46,355 --> 02:54:49,467
in, in terms of like the, you like the collaborative.

4641
02:54:49,467 --> 02:54:49,595
..

4642
02:54:49,595 --> 02:54:53,315
I like moving on from a problem if it's giving too much difficulty.

4643
02:54:53,315 --> 02:54:53,575
Got it.

4644
02:54:53,575 --> 02:54:55,015
Um, got it.

4645
02:54:55,015 --> 02:54:57,435
But you need the people who have the tenacity and the

4646
02:54:57,435 --> 02:54:59,155
the fearlessness, um, and I, I

4647
02:54:59,155 --> 02:55:01,775
I've collaborated with, with people like that where

4648
02:55:01,775 --> 02:55:03,255
where I want to give up, uh

4649
02:55:03,255 --> 02:55:06,355
'cause the, the first approach that we tried didn't work and the second one didn't approach.

4650
02:55:06,355 --> 02:55:10,075
They're convinced and they have third, fourth and the fifth approach works

4651
02:55:10,075 --> 02:55:12,755
um, and I'd have to eat my words

4652
02:55:12,755 --> 02:55:14,475
"Okay, I didn't think this was gonna work

4653
02:55:14,475 --> 02:55:16,092
but, uh, yes, you were right all along.

4654
02:55:16,092 --> 02:55:18,355
" And w- we should say for people who don't know

4655
02:55:18,355 --> 02:55:22,655
not only are you known for the brilliance of your work but the incredible productivity

4656
02:55:22,655 --> 02:55:26,255
just the number of papers which are all very high quality.

4657
02:55:26,255 --> 02:55:30,555
So there's something to be said about being able to jump from topic to topic.

4658
02:55:30,555 --> 02:55:32,335
Yeah, it works for me.

4659
02:55:32,335 --> 02:55:35,075
Yeah, I mean, but there are also people who are very productive and they

4660
02:55:35,075 --> 02:55:36,695
they focus very deeply on, yeah.

4661
02:55:36,695 --> 02:55:39,115
I think everyone has to find their own workflow.

4662
02:55:39,115 --> 02:55:43,083
Um, like one thing which is a shame in mathematics is that we have.

4663
02:55:43,083 --> 02:55:43,215
..

4664
02:55:43,215 --> 02:55:46,555
mathematics there's sort of a one size fits all approach to teaching

4665
02:55:46,555 --> 02:55:49,235
teaching mathematics, um, and, you know

4666
02:55:49,235 --> 02:55:50,875
so we have a certain curriculum and so forth.

4667
02:55:50,875 --> 02:55:55,135
I mean, you know, maybe like if you do math competitions or something you get a slightly different experience.

4668
02:55:55,135 --> 02:55:58,715
But, um, I think many people, um

4669
02:55:58,715 --> 02:56:01,395
they don't find their, their native math language

4670
02:56:01,395 --> 02:56:04,695
uh, until very late, uh, or usually too late so they

4671
02:56:04,695 --> 02:56:10,675
they stop doing mathematics and they have a bad experience with a teacher who's trying to teach them one way to do mathematics and they

4672
02:56:10,675 --> 02:56:11,275
they don't like it.

4673
02:56:11,275 --> 02:56:15,577
Um, my theory is that, um, humans don't come.

4674
02:56:15,577 --> 02:56:15,715
..

4675
02:56:15,715 --> 02:56:19,255
e- evolution has not given us a math center of our brain directly.

4676
02:56:19,255 --> 02:56:23,195
We have a vision center and a language center and some other centers

4677
02:56:23,195 --> 02:56:25,615
um, which have ev- evolution has honed but we

4678
02:56:25,615 --> 02:56:27,615
it doesn't, we don't have an innate sense of mathematics.

4679
02:56:27,615 --> 02:56:28,559
Um-.

4680
02:56:28,559 --> 02:56:29,031
..

4681
02:56:29,031 --> 02:56:33,251
but our other centers are sophisticated enough that different people

4682
02:56:33,251 --> 02:56:38,892
uh, uh, we, uh, we, we can repurpose other areas of our brain to do mathematics.

4683
02:56:38,892 --> 02:56:42,191
So, some people have figured out how to use the visual center to do mathematics

4684
02:56:42,191 --> 02:56:44,151
and so they think, think very visually when they do mathematics.

4685
02:56:44,151 --> 02:56:48,031
Some people have repurposed their, their language center and they think very symbolically.

4686
02:56:48,031 --> 02:56:53,451
Um, you know, um, some people like if- if they are very competitive and if they like gaming

4687
02:56:53,451 --> 02:56:56,671
there's a type, there's a part of your brain that's very good at

4688
02:56:56,671 --> 02:57:00,111
at, at, uh, uh, at solving puzzles and games and

4689
02:57:00,111 --> 02:57:02,051
and, and that can be repurposed.

4690
02:57:02,051 --> 02:57:05,052
But, um, like when I talk to other mathematicians

4691
02:57:05,052 --> 02:57:06,621
you know, they don't quite think.

4692
02:57:06,621 --> 02:57:06,732
..

4693
02:57:06,732 --> 02:57:08,671
I can tell that they're using some, uh

4694
02:57:08,671 --> 02:57:11,392
different styles of, of thinking than I am.

4695
02:57:11,392 --> 02:57:13,812
I mean, not, not disjoint, but they

4696
02:57:13,812 --> 02:57:15,511
they may prefer visual.

4697
02:57:15,511 --> 02:57:17,451
I, I'm, I- I don't actually prefer visual so much.

4698
02:57:17,451 --> 02:57:19,071
I need also visual aids myself.

4699
02:57:19,071 --> 02:57:25,311
Um, you know, mathematics provides a common language where we can still talk to each other even if we are thinking in

4700
02:57:25,311 --> 02:57:26,131
in different ways.

4701
02:57:26,131 --> 02:57:32,291
But you could tell there's a different set of subsystems being used in the thinking process.

4702
02:57:32,291 --> 02:57:33,891
Yeah, like, like they take different paths.

4703
02:57:33,891 --> 02:57:36,551
They're very quick at things that I struggle with and vice versa

4704
02:57:36,551 --> 02:57:39,091
um, and yet they still get to the same goal.

4705
02:57:39,091 --> 02:57:39,451
Yeah.

4706
02:57:39,451 --> 02:57:40,611
Um- That's beautiful.

4707
02:57:40,611 --> 02:57:40,651
.

4708
02:57:40,651 --> 02:57:40,731
..

4709
02:57:40,731 --> 02:57:43,519
and, yeah, but I mean the way we educate.

4710
02:57:43,519 --> 02:57:43,631
..

4711
02:57:43,631 --> 02:57:45,591
Un- unless you have like a personalized tutor or something

4712
02:57:45,591 --> 02:57:48,831
I mean, education sort of just by natural skill has to be mass produced.

4713
02:57:48,831 --> 02:57:50,071
You know, you have to teach to 30 kids

4714
02:57:50,071 --> 02:57:52,671
you know, they have 30 different styles.

4715
02:57:52,671 --> 02:57:54,911
You can't, you can't teach 30 different ways.

4716
02:57:54,911 --> 02:57:58,011
On that topic, what advice would you give to students

4717
02:57:58,011 --> 02:58:01,091
uh, young students, who are struggling at

4718
02:58:01,091 --> 02:58:05,271
with math, uh, but they're interested in it and would like to get better?

4719
02:58:05,271 --> 02:58:07,231
Is there something in this- Yeah.

4720
02:58:07,231 --> 02:58:07,297
Uh- .

4721
02:58:07,297 --> 02:58:07,311
..

4722
02:58:07,311 --> 02:58:10,051
in this complicated educational context, what, what would you advise?

4723
02:58:10,051 --> 02:58:11,331
Yeah, it's a tricky problem.

4724
02:58:11,331 --> 02:58:16,231
One nice thing is that there are now lots of sources for mathematical enrichment outside the classroom.

4725
02:58:16,231 --> 02:58:16,531
Mm-hmm.

4726
02:58:16,531 --> 02:58:19,811
Um, so in, in, in my day there already there were math competitions.

4727
02:58:19,811 --> 02:58:22,731
Um, and you know, there were also like popular math books in the library.

4728
02:58:22,731 --> 02:58:23,311
Mm-hmm.

4729
02:58:23,311 --> 02:58:25,451
But now you have, you know, YouTube

4730
02:58:25,451 --> 02:58:28,591
uh, there, there are forums just devoted to solving

4731
02:58:28,591 --> 02:58:32,651
you know, math puzzles and, um, and math shows up in other places.

4732
02:58:32,651 --> 02:58:33,811
You know, like, um, for example

4733
02:58:33,811 --> 02:58:36,411
there, there are hobbyists who play poker

4734
02:58:36,411 --> 02:58:37,211
uh, for fun.

4735
02:58:37,211 --> 02:58:40,071
Uh, and, um, they, they, you know

4736
02:58:40,071 --> 02:58:44,191
they're for very specific reasons are, are interested in very specific probability questions.

4737
02:58:44,191 --> 02:58:45,491
 Yes.

4738
02:58:45,491 --> 02:58:47,211
Um, and, and they, they actually.

4739
02:58:47,211 --> 02:58:47,291
..

4740
02:58:47,291 --> 02:58:50,911
There's a community of amateur probabilists in, in

4741
02:58:50,911 --> 02:58:53,951
in poker, um, in chess, in baseball.

4742
02:58:53,951 --> 02:58:55,011
I mean, there's, there's, there's, uh

4743
02:58:55,011 --> 02:58:55,551
yeah.

4744
02:58:55,551 --> 02:58:58,611
Um, there's math all over the place

4745
02:58:58,611 --> 02:59:02,131
um, and I'm, I'm hoping actually with the

4746
02:59:02,131 --> 02:59:08,931
with these new sort of tools for LEAN and so forth that actually we can incorporate the broader public into math research projects.

4747
02:59:08,931 --> 02:59:11,931
Um, like this is almost, is, uh

4748
02:59:11,931 --> 02:59:13,411
is- doesn't happen at all currently.

4749
02:59:13,411 --> 02:59:16,511
So in the sciences there is some scope for citizen science

4750
02:59:16,511 --> 02:59:18,231
like astronomers, uh, they can.

4751
02:59:18,231 --> 02:59:18,311
..

4752
02:59:18,311 --> 02:59:20,491
There are amateurs who have discovered comets, and there's biologists

4753
02:59:20,491 --> 02:59:22,871
there are people who, who identify butterflies and so forth.

4754
02:59:22,871 --> 02:59:25,019
Um, and in math, in, um.

4755
02:59:25,019 --> 02:59:25,091
..

4756
02:59:25,091 --> 02:59:27,171
There are a small number of activities where

4757
02:59:27,171 --> 02:59:30,691
um, amateur mathematicians can like discover new primes and so forth.

4758
02:59:30,691 --> 02:59:35,011
But, but previously because we have to verify every single contribution

4759
02:59:35,011 --> 02:59:41,431
um, like most mathematical research projects, it would not help to have input from the general public.

4760
02:59:41,431 --> 02:59:42,771
In fact it would probably, it would just be

4761
02:59:42,771 --> 02:59:45,891
be time-consuming because just error checking and everything.

4762
02:59:45,891 --> 02:59:51,268
Um, but you know, one thing about these formalization projects is that they are bringing together more.

4763
02:59:51,268 --> 02:59:51,371
..

4764
02:59:51,371 --> 02:59:53,031
bringing in more people.

4765
02:59:53,031 --> 02:59:56,211
So I'm sure there are high school students who have already contributed to some of these

4766
02:59:56,211 --> 02:59:58,191
these formalizing projects, who contribute to MathLib.

4767
02:59:58,191 --> 03:00:03,031
Um, you know, you don't need to be a PhD holder to just work on this one atomic thing.

4768
03:00:03,031 --> 03:00:06,131
There's something about the formalization here that also

4769
03:00:06,131 --> 03:00:11,211
uh, uh, at the very first step opens it up to the programming community too.

4770
03:00:11,211 --> 03:00:11,571
Yes.

4771
03:00:11,571 --> 03:00:13,571
The people who are already comfortable- Yes.

4772
03:00:13,571 --> 03:00:13,577
.

4773
03:00:13,577 --> 03:00:13,591
..

4774
03:00:13,591 --> 03:00:14,131
with programming.

4775
03:00:14,131 --> 03:00:17,431
It seems like programming is somehow maybe just a feeling

4776
03:00:17,431 --> 03:00:20,691
but it feels more accessible to folks than math.

4777
03:00:20,691 --> 03:00:21,471
Yeah.

4778
03:00:21,471 --> 03:00:24,831
Math is seen as this like extreme, especially modern mathematics

4779
03:00:24,831 --> 03:00:29,671
seen as this extremely difficult to enter area and programming is not.

4780
03:00:29,671 --> 03:00:31,071
So that could be just an entry point.

4781
03:00:31,071 --> 03:00:32,831
You can execute code and you can get results.

4782
03:00:32,831 --> 03:00:34,711
You know, you can print out how the world pretty quickly.

4783
03:00:34,711 --> 03:00:35,071
Yeah.

4784
03:00:35,071 --> 03:00:38,331
Um, you know, like if, uh

4785
03:00:38,331 --> 03:00:41,971
if programming was taught as an almost entirely theoretical subject

4786
03:00:41,971 --> 03:00:45,871
where you're just taught the computer science, the theory of functions and

4787
03:00:45,871 --> 03:00:48,331
and, and, and routines and so forth

4788
03:00:48,331 --> 03:00:51,331
and outside of some, some very specialized homework assignments

4789
03:00:51,331 --> 03:00:54,351
you and I could program like on the weekend for fun.

4790
03:00:54,351 --> 03:00:54,871
Yeah.

4791
03:00:54,871 --> 03:00:57,431
Or yeah, that would be as, considered as hard as math.

4792
03:00:57,431 --> 03:00:57,951
Mm-hmm.

4793
03:00:57,951 --> 03:01:07,751
Um, so as I said, there are communities of non-mathematicians where they're deploying math for some very specific purpose

4794
03:01:07,751 --> 03:01:10,231
you know, like optimizing their poker game and

4795
03:01:10,231 --> 03:01:12,651
and for them then math becomes fun for them.

4796
03:01:12,651 --> 03:01:16,471
Uh, what advice would you give in general to young people how to pick a career?

4797
03:01:16,471 --> 03:01:17,751
How to find themselves?

4798
03:01:17,751 --> 03:01:18,691
Like what would they be good at?

4799
03:01:18,691 --> 03:01:20,291
Yeah, that's a- that's a tough, tough

4800
03:01:20,291 --> 03:01:20,851
tough question.

4801
03:01:20,851 --> 03:01:23,991
Yeah, so, um, there's a lot less certainty now in the world.

4802
03:01:23,991 --> 03:01:27,251
You know, I mean, there was this period after the war where

4803
03:01:27,251 --> 03:01:29,291
uh, at least in the West, you know

4804
03:01:29,291 --> 03:01:30,931
if you came from a good demographic you

4805
03:01:30,931 --> 03:01:36,071
uh, you know, like you, there was a very stable path to a- to a good career.

4806
03:01:36,071 --> 03:01:37,891
You go to- to college, you get an education

4807
03:01:37,891 --> 03:01:41,031
you pick one profession and- and you stick to it.

4808
03:01:41,031 --> 03:01:43,131
It's becoming much more a thing of the past.

4809
03:01:43,131 --> 03:01:46,611
So I think you just have to be adaptable and flexible.

4810
03:01:46,611 --> 03:01:49,571
I think people have to get skills that are transferrable.

4811
03:01:49,571 --> 03:01:53,491
You know, like, like learning one specific programming language or one specific subject

4812
03:01:53,491 --> 03:01:55,076
mathematics or something, it's- it's- it's.

4813
03:01:55,076 --> 03:01:55,111
..

4814
03:01:55,111 --> 03:01:57,811
That itself is not a super transferrable skill

4815
03:01:57,811 --> 03:02:00,471
but sort of knowing how to, um

4816
03:02:00,471 --> 03:02:06,111
reason with, with abstract concepts or how to problem solve when things go wrong.

4817
03:02:06,111 --> 03:02:13,731
These are things which I think we will still need even as our tools get- get better and we know- you'll- you'll be working with AIs more and so forth.

4818
03:02:13,731 --> 03:02:15,691
But actually you're an interesting case study.

4819
03:02:15,691 --> 03:02:21,031
I mean, you're like a- one of the great living mathematicians

4820
03:02:21,031 --> 03:02:22,611
right?

4821
03:02:22,611 --> 03:02:26,840
And then you had a way of doing things and then all of a sudden you start learning.

4822
03:02:26,840 --> 03:02:26,931
..

4823
03:02:26,931 --> 03:02:30,051
First of all, you kept learning new fields.

4824
03:02:30,051 --> 03:02:30,291
Yeah.

4825
03:02:30,291 --> 03:02:31,831
But you learned LEAN.

4826
03:02:31,831 --> 03:02:34,211
That's not- that's a non-trivial thing to learn.

4827
03:02:34,211 --> 03:02:35,931
Like that's a- Yeah.

4828
03:02:35,931 --> 03:02:36,321
That's a.

4829
03:02:36,321 --> 03:02:36,471
..

4830
03:02:36,471 --> 03:02:39,931
For- for a lot of people, that's an extremely uncomfortable leap to take

4831
03:02:39,931 --> 03:02:40,231
right?

4832
03:02:40,231 --> 03:02:40,831
Yeah.

4833
03:02:40,831 --> 03:02:42,368
A lot of mathematicians.

4834
03:02:42,368 --> 03:02:45,547
First of all, I- I've always been interested in new ways to do mathematics.

4835
03:02:45,547 --> 03:02:50,087
I- I- I feel like a lot of the ways we do things right now are inefficient.

4836
03:02:50,087 --> 03:02:52,507
Um, like I- I- I spend, uh

4837
03:02:52,507 --> 03:02:59,027
me and my colleagues, we spend a lot of time doing very routine computations or doing things that other mathematicians would instantly know how to do

4838
03:02:59,027 --> 03:03:00,007
and we don't know how to do them

4839
03:03:00,007 --> 03:03:03,387
uh, and why can't we search and get a quick response and so forth.

4840
03:03:03,387 --> 03:03:05,267
So, that's why I've always been, uh

4841
03:03:05,267 --> 03:03:08,088
interested in exploring new workflows.

4842
03:03:08,088 --> 03:03:15,367
About four or five years ago, I was on a committee where we had to ask for ideas for interesting workshops to run at a math institute

4843
03:03:15,367 --> 03:03:17,648
and at the time, Peter Shortser had just

4844
03:03:17,648 --> 03:03:19,607
uh, formalized one of his- his, um

4845
03:03:19,607 --> 03:03:26,447
new theorems, and there were some other developments in computer-assisted proof that looked quite interesting and I said

4846
03:03:26,447 --> 03:03:28,267
"Oh, we should- we should, uh, um

4847
03:03:28,267 --> 03:03:29,567
we should run a workshop on this.

4848
03:03:29,567 --> 03:03:30,390
This would be a good idea.

4849
03:03:30,390 --> 03:03:34,028
" Um, and then I- I was a bit too enthusiastic about this idea

4850
03:03:34,028 --> 03:03:36,867
so I- I got volun- voluntold to actually run it

4851
03:03:36,867 --> 03:03:39,167
um, so I did with a bunch of other people

4852
03:03:39,167 --> 03:03:41,767
Kevin Buzzard and Jordan Ellenberg and- and, uh

4853
03:03:41,767 --> 03:03:42,847
a bunch of other people.

4854
03:03:42,847 --> 03:03:45,007
Um, and it was- it was, uh

4855
03:03:45,007 --> 03:03:46,447
a- a- a nice success.

4856
03:03:46,447 --> 03:03:52,007
We brought together a bunch of mathematicians and computer scientists and other people and- and we got up to speed on state of the art

4857
03:03:52,007 --> 03:03:54,487
um, and there was really interesting, um

4858
03:03:54,487 --> 03:03:58,287
developments that- that most mathematicians didn't know was going on.

4859
03:03:58,287 --> 03:04:00,887
Um, there were lots of nice proofs of concept.

4860
03:04:00,887 --> 03:04:03,087
You know, just little hints of- of what was going to happen.

4861
03:04:03,087 --> 03:04:05,387
This is just before ChatGPT, but there was

4862
03:04:05,387 --> 03:04:08,007
even then, there was one talk about language models and the potential

4863
03:04:08,007 --> 03:04:10,047
uh, capability of- of those in the future.

4864
03:04:10,047 --> 03:04:13,227
So, that got me excited about the subject

4865
03:04:13,227 --> 03:04:17,887
so I started giving talks, um, about this is something we should- more of us should start looking at

4866
03:04:17,887 --> 03:04:20,947
um, now that I- I'd arranged to run this conference

4867
03:04:20,947 --> 03:04:23,547
and then ChatGPT came out, and like suddenly

4868
03:04:23,547 --> 03:04:24,387
AI was everywhere.

4869
03:04:24,387 --> 03:04:26,787
And so, uh, I got interviewed a lot

4870
03:04:26,787 --> 03:04:30,547
um, about- about this topic, um, and in particular

4871
03:04:30,547 --> 03:04:33,807
um, the interaction between AI and- and formal proof assistants

4872
03:04:33,807 --> 03:04:35,247
and I said, "Yeah, they should be combined.

4873
03:04:35,247 --> 03:04:38,873
This- this is- this is, um, there's perfect synergy to happen here.

4874
03:04:38,873 --> 03:04:41,267
" And at some point I realized that I have to actually do

4875
03:04:41,267 --> 03:04:42,967
not just talk the talk, but walk the walk

4876
03:04:42,967 --> 03:04:43,207
you know?

4877
03:04:43,207 --> 03:04:43,307
Mm-hmm.

4878
03:04:43,307 --> 03:04:45,227
Like, you know, I don't work in machine learning

4879
03:04:45,227 --> 03:04:50,267
I- and I don't work in proof formalization and there's a limit to how much I can just rely on authority and say

4880
03:04:50,267 --> 03:04:52,307
"Oh, I- I- I'm a world-known mathematician.

4881
03:04:52,307 --> 03:04:57,367
Just trust me, you know, when I say that this is going to change mathematics and I'm not doing it any- when I don't do any of it myself.

4882
03:04:57,367 --> 03:05:00,067
" So, I felt like I had to actually

4883
03:05:00,067 --> 03:05:02,467
uh- uh, justify it.

4884
03:05:02,467 --> 03:05:03,495
You know, there's.

4885
03:05:03,495 --> 03:05:03,547
..

4886
03:05:03,547 --> 03:05:05,087
A lot of what I get into, actually

4887
03:05:05,087 --> 03:05:09,147
um, I don't quite see in advance as to how much time I'm gonna spend on it

4888
03:05:09,147 --> 03:05:14,427
and it's only after I'm sort of waist-deep in- in- in- in a project that I- I realize.

4889
03:05:14,427 --> 03:05:15,447
By that point, I'm committed.

4890
03:05:15,447 --> 03:05:18,447
Well, that's deeply admirable that you're willing to go into the fray

4891
03:05:18,447 --> 03:05:22,167
be in some small way a beginner, right?

4892
03:05:22,167 --> 03:05:23,027
Mm-hmm.

4893
03:05:23,027 --> 03:05:26,907
Or have some of the sort of challenges that a beginner would

4894
03:05:26,907 --> 03:05:27,267
right?

4895
03:05:27,267 --> 03:05:27,847
So new- Yeah.

4896
03:05:27,847 --> 03:05:27,893
.

4897
03:05:27,893 --> 03:05:27,987
..

4898
03:05:27,987 --> 03:05:29,887
new concepts, new ways of thinking.

4899
03:05:29,887 --> 03:05:33,982
Also, you know, sucking at a thing that others.

4900
03:05:33,982 --> 03:05:34,147
..

4901
03:05:34,147 --> 03:05:36,767
 I think in that talk, you know

4902
03:05:36,767 --> 03:05:42,047
you could be a Fields Me- Medal-winning mathematician and an undergrad and know something better than you.

4903
03:05:42,047 --> 03:05:45,334
 Yeah, um, I think mathematics inherently.

4904
03:05:45,334 --> 03:05:45,467
..

4905
03:05:45,467 --> 03:05:49,507
I mean, mathematics is so huge these days that nobody knows all of modern mathematics

4906
03:05:49,507 --> 03:05:52,907
um, and inevitably we make mistakes and

4907
03:05:52,907 --> 03:05:58,447
um, you know, uh, you can't cover up your mistakes with just sort of bravado and- and

4908
03:05:58,447 --> 03:05:58,807
uh- Yeah.

4909
03:05:58,807 --> 03:05:58,873
.

4910
03:05:58,873 --> 03:05:59,007
..

4911
03:05:59,007 --> 03:06:00,867
I mean, because people will ask for your proofs

4912
03:06:00,867 --> 03:06:02,447
and if you don't have the proofs, you don't have the proofs

4913
03:06:02,447 --> 03:06:02,771
um.

4914
03:06:02,771 --> 03:06:02,907
..

4915
03:06:02,907 --> 03:06:04,007
Gotta love that.

4916
03:06:04,007 --> 03:06:04,627
 Yeah.

4917
03:06:04,627 --> 03:06:06,887
So it does keep us honest.

4918
03:06:06,887 --> 03:06:07,467
I mean, not- not.

4919
03:06:07,467 --> 03:06:07,527
..

4920
03:06:07,527 --> 03:06:08,382
I mean, you can still.

4921
03:06:08,382 --> 03:06:08,507
..

4922
03:06:08,507 --> 03:06:11,047
I- it's not a perfect panacea, but I think

4923
03:06:11,047 --> 03:06:15,761
uh, we do have more of a culture of admitting error than.

4924
03:06:15,761 --> 03:06:15,847
..

4925
03:06:15,847 --> 03:06:17,287
Because we're forced to all the time.

4926
03:06:17,287 --> 03:06:20,627
Big ridiculous question, I'm sorry for it once again.

4927
03:06:20,627 --> 03:06:24,467
Who is the greatest mathematician of all time?

4928
03:06:24,467 --> 03:06:26,907
 Maybe one who's no longer with us.

4929
03:06:26,907 --> 03:06:28,847
Uh, who are the candidates?

4930
03:06:28,847 --> 03:06:32,647
Euler, Gauss, Newton, Ramanujan, Hilbert?

4931
03:06:32,647 --> 03:06:34,607
Uh, so first of all, it's- it's as mentioned before

4932
03:06:34,607 --> 03:06:36,087
like there's- there's some time dependence.

4933
03:06:36,087 --> 03:06:37,847
  On the day.

4934
03:06:37,847 --> 03:06:41,247
Yeah, uh, like- like if- if you- if you plot cumulatively over time

4935
03:06:41,247 --> 03:06:43,227
for example, Euclid, like- like sort of like- Yeah.

4936
03:06:43,227 --> 03:06:43,293
.

4937
03:06:43,293 --> 03:06:43,427
..

4938
03:06:43,427 --> 03:06:44,887
is- is- is one of the contenders.

4939
03:06:44,887 --> 03:06:48,927
Um, and then maybe some unnamed, a- a- anonymous mathematicians before that.

4940
03:06:48,927 --> 03:06:51,847
Um, you know, the, whoever came up with the concept of odd numbers

4941
03:06:51,847 --> 03:06:52,107
you know?

4942
03:06:52,107 --> 03:06:56,827
 You know, um- Do mathematicians today still feel the impact of Hilbert

4943
03:06:56,827 --> 03:06:58,007
just- Oh, yeah.

4944
03:06:58,007 --> 03:06:58,073
.

4945
03:06:58,073 --> 03:06:58,207
..

4946
03:06:58,207 --> 03:07:00,667
directly of what, everything that's happened in the 20th century?

4947
03:07:00,667 --> 03:07:01,267
Yeah, yeah.

4948
03:07:01,267 --> 03:07:01,907
Hilbert spaces.

4949
03:07:01,907 --> 03:07:03,467
We have lots of things that are named after him

4950
03:07:03,467 --> 03:07:04,467
uh, of course.

4951
03:07:04,467 --> 03:07:08,447
Just the arrangement of mathematics and just the introduction of c- certain concepts.

4952
03:07:08,447 --> 03:07:11,247
I mean, 23 problems have been extremely influential.

4953
03:07:11,247 --> 03:07:16,247
There's some strange power to the declaring which problems- Yeah.

4954
03:07:16,247 --> 03:07:16,320
.

4955
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:16,467
..

4956
03:07:16,467 --> 03:07:17,367
are hard to solve.

4957
03:07:17,367 --> 03:07:17,387
Yeah.

4958
03:07:17,387 --> 03:07:19,187
The statement of the open problems.

4959
03:07:19,187 --> 03:07:23,347
Yeah, I- I mean, you know, there's this bystander effect in- in everywhere

4960
03:07:23,347 --> 03:07:23,627
right?

4961
03:07:23,627 --> 03:07:25,647
Like if- if no one says, "You should do X

4962
03:07:25,647 --> 03:07:28,387
" everyone just sort of mills around waiting for somebody else to- to

4963
03:07:28,387 --> 03:07:30,567
uh, to do something and- and like nothing gets done.

4964
03:07:30,567 --> 03:07:34,464
Um, so, and- and like- like it's.

4965
03:07:34,464 --> 03:07:34,607
..

4966
03:07:34,607 --> 03:07:36,107
The one- one thing that actually, uh

4967
03:07:36,107 --> 03:07:39,867
you have to teach undergraduates in mathematics is that you should always try something.

4968
03:07:39,867 --> 03:07:43,247
So, um, you see a lot of paralysis

4969
03:07:43,247 --> 03:07:45,967
um, in an undergraduate trying a math problem.

4970
03:07:45,967 --> 03:07:49,767
If they recognize that there's a certain technique that- that can be applied

4971
03:07:49,767 --> 03:07:50,367
they will try it.

4972
03:07:50,367 --> 03:07:57,507
But there are problems for which they see none of their standard techniques obviously applies and the common reaction is then just paralysis.

4973
03:07:57,507 --> 03:07:59,407
"I don't know what to do.

4974
03:07:59,407 --> 03:08:01,347
" Uh, or, um, what was it?

4975
03:08:01,347 --> 03:08:02,507
I think there's a quote from The Simpsons

4976
03:08:02,507 --> 03:08:03,984
"I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas.

4977
03:08:03,984 --> 03:08:09,647
"  Um, so, you know, like the next step then is to try anything

4978
03:08:09,647 --> 03:08:11,627
like no matter how stupid, um, and in fact

4979
03:08:11,627 --> 03:08:12,967
how, almost the stupider the better.

4980
03:08:12,967 --> 03:08:15,307
Um, which, you know, and one

4981
03:08:15,307 --> 03:08:16,967
a technique which is almost guaranteed to fail

4982
03:08:16,967 --> 03:08:19,547
but the way it fails is going to be instructive.

4983
03:08:19,547 --> 03:08:23,647
Um, like it fails because you're- you're not at all taking into account this hypothesis.

4984
03:08:23,647 --> 03:08:25,287
Oh, this hypothesis must be useful.

4985
03:08:25,287 --> 03:08:26,047
That's a clue.

4986
03:08:26,047 --> 03:08:31,567
I think you also suggested somewhere this- this fascinating approach which  really stuck with me.

4987
03:08:31,567 --> 03:08:33,347
I started using it and it really works.

4988
03:08:33,347 --> 03:08:36,347
I think you said it's called structured procrastination?

4989
03:08:36,347 --> 03:08:37,027
No, yes, yeah.

4990
03:08:37,027 --> 03:08:42,295
 It's when you really don't want to do a thing then you imagine a thing you don't want to do more.

4991
03:08:42,295 --> 03:08:42,467
..

4992
03:08:42,467 --> 03:08:42,847
Yes, yes.

4993
03:08:42,847 --> 03:08:42,853
.

4994
03:08:42,853 --> 03:08:42,867
..

4995
03:08:42,867 --> 03:08:48,347
that's worse than that and then in that way you procrastinate by not doing the thing that's worse.

4996
03:08:48,347 --> 03:08:49,067
Yeah, yeah.

4997
03:08:49,067 --> 03:08:50,627
It's a nice, it's a nice hack.

4998
03:08:50,627 --> 03:08:51,367
It actually works.

4999
03:08:51,367 --> 03:08:52,527
 Yeah, yeah.

5000
03:08:52,527 --> 03:08:55,087
Um, I mean, with anything that I

5001
03:08:55,087 --> 03:08:56,667
you know, I mean like if, um.

5002
03:08:56,667 --> 03:08:56,908
..

5003
03:08:56,908 --> 03:08:58,811
Psychology is really important.

5004
03:08:58,811 --> 03:09:02,011
Like, you- you- you talk to athletes like marathon runners and so forth and

5005
03:09:02,011 --> 03:09:04,491
uh, and they talk about what's the most important thing

5006
03:09:04,491 --> 03:09:06,112
is it their training regimen or their diet?

5007
03:09:06,112 --> 03:09:08,431
And so so much of it is actually psychology.

5008
03:09:08,431 --> 03:09:12,991
Um, you know, just- just tricking yourself to- to think in the form that's feasible

5009
03:09:12,991 --> 03:09:15,391
um, so that you can- you're motivated to do it.

5010
03:09:15,391 --> 03:09:19,691
Is there something our human mind will never be able to comprehend?

5011
03:09:19,691 --> 03:09:21,763
 Well, a sort of.

5012
03:09:21,763 --> 03:09:21,891
..

5013
03:09:21,891 --> 03:09:23,192
Like as a mathematician, I mean, you know

5014
03:09:23,192 --> 03:09:25,740
like I g- by induction, I- I- it's a sufficiently.

5015
03:09:25,740 --> 03:09:25,791
..

5016
03:09:25,791 --> 03:09:27,912
There must be some sufficiently large number that you can't- .

5017
03:09:27,912 --> 03:09:27,918
.

5018
03:09:27,918 --> 03:09:27,932
..

5019
03:09:27,932 --> 03:09:28,911
not understand.

5020
03:09:28,911 --> 03:09:30,911
Uh, that was the first thing that came to mind.

5021
03:09:30,911 --> 03:09:33,761
So that, but even broadly, is there.

5022
03:09:33,761 --> 03:09:33,871
..

5023
03:09:33,871 --> 03:09:38,551
Are we lim- is there something about our mind that's- we're going to be limited

5024
03:09:38,551 --> 03:09:41,531
even with the help of mathematics?

5025
03:09:41,531 --> 03:09:42,492
Well, okay.

5026
03:09:42,492 --> 03:09:44,863
I mean, it's like how much augmentation are you willing.

5027
03:09:44,863 --> 03:09:44,931
..

5028
03:09:44,931 --> 03:09:47,151
Like if- like, for example, if I didn't even have pen and paper

5029
03:09:47,151 --> 03:09:50,411
um, like if I had no technology whatsoever

5030
03:09:50,411 --> 03:09:52,852
okay, so I'm not allowed blackboard, pen and paper- Right.

5031
03:09:52,852 --> 03:09:55,932
You're already much more limited than you would be.

5032
03:09:55,932 --> 03:09:56,711
Incredibly limited.

5033
03:09:56,711 --> 03:09:59,511
Even language, uh, the English language is a technology.

5034
03:09:59,511 --> 03:10:03,091
Uh, it's, uh, it's one that's been very internalized.

5035
03:10:03,091 --> 03:10:04,539
So you're right, there really.

5036
03:10:04,539 --> 03:10:04,651
..

5037
03:10:04,651 --> 03:10:09,271
The- the formulation of the problem is incorrect 'cause there really is no longer a

5038
03:10:09,271 --> 03:10:11,271
just a solo human.

5039
03:10:11,271 --> 03:10:17,371
We're already augmented in extremely complicated intricate ways

5040
03:10:17,371 --> 03:10:17,492
right?

5041
03:10:17,492 --> 03:10:17,651
Yeah.

5042
03:10:17,651 --> 03:10:18,112
Yeah, yeah.

5043
03:10:18,112 --> 03:10:20,271
So we're already like a collective intelligence.

5044
03:10:20,271 --> 03:10:21,192
Yes, yeah.

5045
03:10:21,192 --> 03:10:21,772
I guess.

5046
03:10:21,772 --> 03:10:25,492
Uh, so- so humanity plural has much more intelligence in principle

5047
03:10:25,492 --> 03:10:27,131
on its good days-  .

5048
03:10:27,131 --> 03:10:27,131
..

5049
03:10:27,131 --> 03:10:29,531
than- than- than the individual humans put together.

5050
03:10:29,531 --> 03:10:31,031
Uh, it can also have less, okay?

5051
03:10:31,031 --> 03:10:33,791
But, uh, um, yeah, so yeah

5052
03:10:33,791 --> 03:10:38,191
mathemat- method- the mathematical community plural is- is- is incredibly super intelligent

5053
03:10:38,191 --> 03:10:45,432
uh, entity, um, that, uh, no single human mathematician can- can come close to- to- to replicating.

5054
03:10:45,432 --> 03:10:48,131
You see it a little bit on these like question analysis sites

5055
03:10:48,131 --> 03:10:51,191
um, uh, so this MathOverflow which is the math version of StackOverflow.

5056
03:10:51,191 --> 03:10:51,452
Mm-hmm.

5057
03:10:51,452 --> 03:10:56,691
And like, sometimes you get like this very quick responses to very difficult questions from the community

5058
03:10:56,691 --> 03:10:59,411
um, and it's- it's- it's a pleasure to watch actually

5059
03:10:59,411 --> 03:11:00,931
as- as- as an expert.

5060
03:11:00,931 --> 03:11:05,131
I'm a fan-spectator of that, uh,  of that site

5061
03:11:05,131 --> 03:11:07,512
just seeing the brilliance of the different people there.

5062
03:11:07,512 --> 03:11:17,211
Um, the depth of knowledge that people have and the- the willingness to engage in the- in the rigor and the nuance over the particular question is pretty cool to watch.

5063
03:11:17,211 --> 03:11:19,271
It's fun, it's almost like just fun to watch.

5064
03:11:19,271 --> 03:11:19,391
Yeah.

5065
03:11:19,391 --> 03:11:24,412
Uh, what gives you hope about this whole thing we have going on with human civilization?

5066
03:11:24,412 --> 03:11:26,871
I think, uh, yeah, the, uh

5067
03:11:26,871 --> 03:11:31,291
the younger generation is always like- like really creative and enthusiastic and- and inventive.

5068
03:11:31,291 --> 03:11:34,072
Um, I- it's a pleasure working with- with- with

5069
03:11:34,072 --> 03:11:36,791
uh, with, uh, with young students.

5070
03:11:36,791 --> 03:11:45,931
Um, you know, the, uh, the progress of science tells us that the problems that used to be really difficult can become extremely

5071
03:11:45,931 --> 03:11:48,311
you know, can become like trivial to solve.

5072
03:11:48,311 --> 03:11:48,811
You know?

5073
03:11:48,811 --> 03:11:52,231
Um, I mean like it was s- like navigation

5074
03:11:52,231 --> 03:11:56,331
you know, just- just knowing where you were o- on the planet was this horrendous problem

5075
03:11:56,331 --> 03:11:59,011
peop- people died, um, you know, uh

5076
03:11:59,011 --> 03:12:01,311
or- or lost fortunes because they couldn't navigate

5077
03:12:01,311 --> 03:12:01,491
you know.

5078
03:12:01,491 --> 03:12:03,911
And we have devices in our pockets that do it automatically for us

5079
03:12:03,911 --> 03:12:05,591
like as a completely solved problem.

5080
03:12:05,591 --> 03:12:12,111
And also things that are- seem unfeasible for us now could be maybe just homework exercises for them .

5081
03:12:12,111 --> 03:12:20,391
 Yeah, one of the things I find really sad about the finiteness of life is that I won't get to see all the cool things we create as a civilization

5082
03:12:20,391 --> 03:12:20,691
you know?

5083
03:12:20,691 --> 03:12:22,951
That, 'cause it, in the next 100 years

5084
03:12:22,951 --> 03:12:26,851
200 years just imagine showing- showing up in 200 years.

5085
03:12:26,851 --> 03:12:28,671
Yeah, well already plenty has happened, you know

5086
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:32,711
like if- if you could go back in time and- and talk to your- your teenage self or something

5087
03:12:32,711 --> 03:12:33,131
you know what I mean?

5088
03:12:33,131 --> 03:12:34,311
Just- Yeah.

5089
03:12:34,311 --> 03:12:36,231
Just the internet and- and- and now AI

5090
03:12:36,231 --> 03:12:40,811
I mean that, uh, again they've- they've been in- they're beginning to internalize and say

5091
03:12:40,811 --> 03:12:44,731
"Yeah, of course, uh, an AI can understand our voice and- and give reasonable

5092
03:12:44,731 --> 03:12:47,723
uh, you know, slightly incorrect answers to- to any question.

5093
03:12:47,723 --> 03:12:50,431
" But yeah, like this- this was mind-blowing even two years ago.

5094
03:12:50,431 --> 03:12:53,831
And in the moment it's hilarious to watch on the internet and so on

5095
03:12:53,831 --> 03:13:01,751
the- the drama, uh, people take everything for granted very quickly and then they- we humans seem to entertain ourselves with drama.

5096
03:13:01,751 --> 03:13:09,111
Out of anything that's created, somebody needs to take one opinion and another person needs to take an opposite opinion and argue with each other about it.

5097
03:13:09,111 --> 03:13:11,151
But when you look at the arc of things

5098
03:13:11,151 --> 03:13:14,051
I mean, just even in re- progress of robotics- Yeah.

5099
03:13:14,051 --> 03:13:14,117
.

5100
03:13:14,117 --> 03:13:14,251
..

5101
03:13:14,251 --> 03:13:16,551
just to take a step back and be like

5102
03:13:16,551 --> 03:13:19,494
"Wow, this is beautiful that we humans are able to create this.

5103
03:13:19,494 --> 03:13:22,451
" Yeah, when the infrastructure and- and the culture is- is healthy

5104
03:13:22,451 --> 03:13:30,651
yeah, the community of humans can be so much more intelligent and mature and- and rational than the individuals within it.

5105
03:13:30,651 --> 03:13:35,571
Well, one place I can always count on rationality is the comments section of your blog

5106
03:13:35,571 --> 03:13:36,911
which I'm, uh,  a fan of.

5107
03:13:36,911 --> 03:13:38,711
There's a lot of really smart people there.

5108
03:13:38,711 --> 03:13:41,291
And thank you, uh, of course for- uh

5109
03:13:41,291 --> 03:13:43,831
for putting those ideas out on the blog.

5110
03:13:43,831 --> 03:13:47,691
And it's- I can't tell you how, uh

5111
03:13:47,691 --> 03:13:50,631
honored I am that you would spend your time with me today.

5112
03:13:50,631 --> 03:13:53,311
I was, uh, looking forward to this for a long time

5113
03:13:53,311 --> 03:13:54,551
Terence, I'm a huge fan.

5114
03:13:54,551 --> 03:13:57,891
Um, you inspire me, you inspire millions of people.

5115
03:13:57,891 --> 03:13:59,011
Thank you so much for Oh, thank you

5116
03:13:59,011 --> 03:13:59,531
it was a pleasure.

5117
03:13:59,531 --> 03:14:03,011

And now, let me leave you with some words from Galileo Galilei

5121
03:14:14,011 --> 03:14:20,579
"Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe.

5122
03:14:20,579 --> 03:14:25,111
" Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
