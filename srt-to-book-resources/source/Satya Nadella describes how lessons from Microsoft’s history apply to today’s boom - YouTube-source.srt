1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,410
Bill was always obsessed.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,170
I remember him distinctly saying this in the '90s,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,120
he said, "There's only one category in software.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,710
It's called information management.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,090
You got to schematize people,

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,770
places and things, and that's it."

7
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,990
The problem is people are messy.

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,340
Do people have loyalty to a model

9
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,050
or do they have loyalty to an AI brand?

10
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,360
You want an ensemble of models.

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,110
You have agents intermediating that ensemble

12
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,760
so that it meets your needs.

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,593
Will everyone's preference

14
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:25,890
not just be for more intelligence?

15
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,180
Like, I'll go into the picker

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,920
and manually select o3

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,503
for like, "Where should I go get ice cream," query?

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,520
It's like a rite of passage for certain software companies

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,170
to try to take on Excel.

20
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,190
Why is it so durable?

21
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,870
We sort of don't give it enough credit.

22
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,243
It's like, "I can make it

23
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:42,076
do anything." I think the world's

24
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,740
most approachable programming environment.

25
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,573
100%.

26
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:46,260
And Pieter here is who?

27
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,400
Pieter is Pieter Levels.

28
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,233
He's like an indie— Oh, yes, I know him.

29
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,320
Yeah, you know Pieter Levels.

30
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,250
I know him, yeah. Course yes.

31
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,090
You're so online.

32
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,130
See, Satya knows who Pieter Levels is.

33
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,984
This is why Microsoft is like an $14 trillion company.

34
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,783
Was there anything good to see at the data center?

35
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:03,121
Or is like— There's always—

36
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:03,954
"That's a lot of racks."

37
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:05,610
It's the most fun place to go, man.

38
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,020
Yeah.

39
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,320
Satya Nadella took over as Microsoft CEO in 2014,

40
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,430
but he's been with the company

41
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,890
for more than 30 years and has seen a lot.

42
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,300
Microsoft has grown by 10X

43
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,220
in the time that Satya has been running it.

44
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,140
And he's credited with Microsoft's success

45
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,870
first in cloud and now in the AI boom.

46
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,223
Cheers, John. This is great.

47
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,292
So what should people be excited about at Ignite?

48
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:31,410
The Ignite Conference for us, more than anything else,

49
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,730
is about making sure that AI is getting diffused

50
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,026
inside of the enterprise, right?

51
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:38,880
I mean, if there is one thing,

52
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,610
it's more about, hey, what does it mean

53
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,540
not to just admire somebody else's AI factory or AI agent,

54
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,520
but how to build your own AI factory.

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,560
So organizing the data layer

56
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,320
turns out to be probably the most complicated thing,

57
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,060
which spans the enterprise

58
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,610
such that it can meet the intelligence.

59
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,600
And so that's the stuff

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,430
that I think we'll probably do a lot of.

61
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,810
We still don't really have Deep Research

62
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,220
in a corporate context.

63
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,230
We do, that's what Copilot is about.

64
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,840
But most people day-to-day do not have this.

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,430
So are they just underusing AI that exists?

66
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,980
Yes, and in fact, it's interesting you brought that up

67
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,410
because to me that is the killer feature, right?

68
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,190
So the biggest thing we did was we took this graph

69
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,900
that is underneath what is what I think

70
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,120
is the most important database in any company, right,

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,190
which is underneath your email,

72
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,370
your documents, your Teams calls, what have you.

73
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,560
It's the relationships that...

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,010
By the way, people are not working in an ad hoc fashion

75
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,290
in an unstructured way, but you know,

76
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,080
they're all doing it in relation of some business event.

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,913
Yes.

78
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,750
That semantic connection

79
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,030
is in people's heads and it's lost.

80
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,040
And for the first time,

81
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,230
there's much better recall of that.

82
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,670
Why do you think this is underpenetrated

83
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,503
than the enterprise?

84
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:57,930
Because I feel like people are using lots of, you know,

85
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,280
LLM tools.

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,250
They are uploading individual documents maybe,

87
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,930
but I don't think most companies

88
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,300
have the all singing, all dancing,

89
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,160
all of the company's context

90
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,260
is plugged into their everyday AI.

91
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,793
Yeah, in fact, I would say there are two sets of things.

92
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:13,170
One, it's starting, right?

93
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,330
I mean, you know, what I always say,

94
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,520
at least compared to anything we have done

95
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,460
in terms of all the office suites over our history,

96
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,130
this is the fastest in that sense,

97
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,690
because it's change management, right?

98
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,520
At the end of the day, you've got to get it in,

99
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,720
people have to use it.

100
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,060
Oh, by the way, in the enterprise setting,

101
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,510
it has got to mean all the discovery has to work.

102
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,450
All of the data governance has to work.

103
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,060
We have had to plumb this purview into Copilot

104
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,340
such that anytime I'm trying to retrieve something

105
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,920
that's confidential, it's labeled confidential,

106
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,420
it's IRM'd and so on.

107
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,670
So there's been significant amount of work,

108
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,940
and that I think is where we're starting to see the uplift.

109
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,959
The other thing I'd say is,

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,630
you know, it's one thing to have it work

111
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,390
across the Microsoft 365 graph, right?

112
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,750
But then the next thing is, oh, what about your ERP system?

113
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,940
The connectors kind of work,

114
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,050
but they don't really

115
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,030
because they're two thin straws, right?

116
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,510
You just need a much better data architecture

117
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,080
where you have to essentially semantically embed

118
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,060
all of these into one layer.

119
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,893
Okay.

120
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:20,310
There's been a vision for decades

121
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,370
of your company's data at your fingertips.

122
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,390
My favorite example of this

123
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,550
is I read like the book "Softwar" on, you know,

124
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,690
the history of Oracle,

125
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,300
and it talks about Larry Ellison doing EBCs,

126
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,330
I think they're talking about one in Japan, in the 1990s.

127
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,740
So it's the late 1990s.

128
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,270
And he is pitching executives

129
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,700
on all your company's data in one place.

130
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,610
Part of the reason this is an evergreen pitch

131
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,200
is because companies don't actually

132
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,550
have all their data at their fingertips.

133
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,970
Companies do not eat their data infrastructure vegetables.

134
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,477
And, you know, the pitch to executives is always,

135
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:51,690
"You can go answer your questions yourself

136
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,890
at the touch of a button,"

137
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,260
as opposed to sending a request to an analyst

138
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,330
who goes and does an investigation for you.

139
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,140
Will we finally this time eat our data plumbing?

140
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,520
You can push back on the premise, but that's my question.

141
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,400
No, I think that, in fact, I think, if I'm not mistaken,

142
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,060
Bill coined this term, information at your fingertips,

143
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,793
at a COMDEX speech, I think in the '90s.

144
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,180
I think that's right, yeah.

145
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,460
And that is kind of where it, you know,

146
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,130
and for the longest time, Bill was always obsessed

147
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,810
about, like, he felt, in fact,

148
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,600
I remember him distinctly saying this in the '90s,

149
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,730
which I picked up in one of the reviews I was in

150
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,230
as a junior guy sitting around,

151
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,300
and he said, "There's only one category in software.

152
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,890
It's called information management.

153
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,260
You got to schematize people, places and things,

154
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,210
and that's it.

155
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,043
You don't have to do anything anymore

156
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:33,930
because all software..."

157
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,820
And that was the dream Bill always had,

158
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,850
which is he wanted, like for example, he hated file systems

159
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,260
because they were unstructured.

160
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,230
He would've loved it if everything was a SQL database

161
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,970
and he could just do SQL queries

162
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,830
and program against all information.

163
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,530
Like, that to him was like a elegant solution

164
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,120
to information at your fingertips.

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,343
The problem is people are messy,

166
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,850
and even if data is structured,

167
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,720
it sort of is not truly available in one index, right,

168
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,800
or one SQL query that I can run against all of that.

169
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,740
So that has been the fundamental challenge

170
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,660
of the old world, I would say.

171
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,820
I would've not thought, none of us thought

172
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,250
that somehow this AI thing

173
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,090
and a deep neural network at some scaling

174
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,770
will suddenly become the thing

175
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,990
that figures out the patterns, right?

176
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,210
Not some schematized data model, right?

177
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,450
In fact, for the longest time

178
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,040
we used to always obsess about, oh, how complex

179
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,280
do the relationships have to be,

180
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,850
or the data model needs to be

181
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,060
to capture the essence of an enterprise, right?

182
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,430
And it turns out it's lots of parameters

183
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,370
in a neural network with a lot of compute power.

184
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,340
Dwarkesh talks about this really smart remote employee

185
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,080
who started five minutes ago, getting at the point

186
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,660
that the models can be arbitrarily smart

187
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,490
and they can do RAG and they can have access

188
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,020
to everything in your enterprise,

189
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,460
but it's not quite the same

190
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,810
as the model actually knowing something as a model.

191
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,450
And so the models, unless you train custom models

192
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,550
inside your company, cannot actually get smarter

193
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,370
at what it is that you do and, you know,

194
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,580
the thousandth query is not any smarter than the first.

195
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,540
Where do you think that goes?

196
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,620
I think there're two things there,

197
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,950
I mean, I think if I understand his thing,

198
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,480
it's all about in context learning

199
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,313
or continual learning, right?

200
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:19,530
I mean, that's sort of the ultimate thing.

201
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,420
And it sort of speaks to the thing I was saying,

202
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,620
which is if you kind of have the models cognitive core

203
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,910
separated from its knowledge,

204
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,910
then you have essentially the continual learning, you know,

205
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,520
formula, so to speak, or the algorithm,

206
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,680
and then you just unleash it.

207
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,120
At least there are three things to me

208
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,060
that are outside of the model at runtime

209
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,910
that I think you kind of have to crack, right?

210
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,150
One is memory, and all forms of memory, right?

211
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,490
Short, long, right?

212
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,710
Even like these big challenges of, you know,

213
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,410
humans are great at long-term credit assignment, right?

214
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,807
Which is how does intuitively, like somebody said to me,

215
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,660
"Hey, the day, you know,

216
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,830
AI models can both reward and remember

217
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,560
that you, you know, how to punish

218
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,600
for some mistake because they have the ability

219
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,920
to do long-term credit assignment,

220
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,600
that's when you'll know that you have real memory."

221
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,340
But in any case, memory is one.

222
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,470
The second one is entitlements, right?

223
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,610
So, which is they have to really respect

224
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,550
all of the permissioning system at runtime, right?

225
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,320
Because this is where we put their roles,

226
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,570
what access do I have,

227
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,400
and so the model needs to meet that.

228
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,790
And then the action space all has to work.

229
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,290
So if you bring those three things,

230
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,970
because after all, that's the environment.

231
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,070
So if I have actions, entitlements, and memory

232
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,890
with these models, and they by definition

233
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,630
have to be outside of the model,

234
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,130
but be built into the model.

235
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,080
And so for example,

236
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,570
in Copilot today, you use OpenAI models,

237
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,160
you use even Claude, right?

238
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,470
I need the system to work across both of those.

239
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,043
And that I think is where the frontier has to move to.

240
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:53,940
Yes, yes.

241
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,110
I have many more AI questions,

242
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,160
but I want to ask you some questions

243
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,250
about your way of working.

244
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,370
So, what does your day-to-day look like?

245
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,610
And in particular, how are you managing by walking around?

246
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,450
What virtual corridors are you wandering,

247
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,150
to just get a sense for what's going on in Microsoft?

248
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,040
What do your customer engagements actually look like?

249
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,080
Just for a normal day, not earnings

250
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,940
or not a board meeting or something.

251
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,123
Interestingly enough, my normal day,

252
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:23,160
it's the two ends of it, right?

253
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,260
Which is the customer stuff,

254
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,190
so there's not a day that I would say I'm not having...

255
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,270
Many of them are remote.

256
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,543
I mean, there's Teams calls for me most of the day,

257
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:34,980
at least two or three of them with some customer.

258
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,750
It's sort of the most helpful way

259
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,890
for me to stay most grounded, I would say.

260
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,130
So I have at least one or two of those each day.

261
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,750
And then I would say

262
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,803
there is a lot of meeting time.

263
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:55,200
You know, as a CEO, one of the things I've recognized

264
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,910
is there are two types of meetings, right?

265
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,550
One meeting is where I'm just supposed to convene

266
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,590
and, you know, keep my mouth shut

267
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,790
because convening was the real thing, right?

268
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,450
It is like, don't over perform and just sit,

269
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,150
because all the work would've either happened

270
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,950
or will happen after.

271
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,090
So that's kind of one.

272
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,850
And then the other meeting, which are the important meetings

273
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,370
where I do need to learn or I need to make a decision

274
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,540
or communicate something.

275
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,433
So meetings is another spot.

276
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,390
Then I must say, it's kind of like all over for me,

277
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,590
Teams channels, right?

278
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,070
I am lingering around Teams channels

279
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,480
and they're most helpful.

280
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,870
In fact, if anything, I learn the most there,

281
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,520
I meet most people that...

282
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,110
So wandering the halls,

283
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,240
I wish I could tell you that, you know,

284
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,590
that is the form.

285
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,820
No, but I think Teams

286
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,430
is the new wandering the halls, right, you know,

287
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,390
lurking around those channels.

288
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,237
100%, and then I meet...

289
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:48,600
So the most beautiful thing

290
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,980
is for me to be able to...

291
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,020
That's where I make the most connections, right?

292
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,490
I get to know, wow, here's the person

293
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,080
working on Excel agent,

294
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,333
or that's the eval that they're looking...

295
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,190
I mean, I learn so much out of it

296
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,930
than anything else I've done.

297
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,490
So are Teams at Microsoft

298
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,720
just working away on their product

299
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,370
and then Satya pops up and, you know,

300
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,300
has a question on their product?

301
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,590
Some of it, like, I wish—

302
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,653
They give a little yelp. I wish—

303
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:10,500
Yeah, well, I wish, you know,

304
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
sometimes I feel like we are way too permissioned too.

305
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,240
You know, I wish I had more access sometimes.

306
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,440
In fact, my biggest complaint

307
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,690
is that I can't drop in everywhere I want to.

308
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,260
But, yes, it's fun to be able to just go in there

309
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,310
and it sort of normalizes it.

310
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,250
And then people are also, like today's workforce

311
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,160
is not shy of sharing their opinion with you.

312
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,150
I've noticed, yeah.

313
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,100
You are famous, at least in small corners of the valley,

314
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,520
speaking of being methodical, for staying very connected

315
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,460
to what's going on in tech here.

316
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,970
And I remember you came and visited the Stripe office.

317
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,140
Remember that one in the Mission, yeah,

318
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,640
when we were a pip-squeak company.

319
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,410
I mean, it was probably

320
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,560
right after you took over as CEO, I'm guessing.

321
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,590
But Stripe was very small and Microsoft was very big.

322
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,423
Actually before,

323
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:01,110
I think the first time I came to your offices

324
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,820
was when I was running Azure first.

325
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,669
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

326
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:04,710
Okay, so it was even before that.

327
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,710
So that would've been very early in Stripe's journey.

328
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,130
Why do you think you do this much more than most other CEOs?

329
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,820
Because other CEOs should want to meet all the startups too.

330
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,130
I've always grown up, in some sense, I grew up,

331
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,990
even in a Microsoft, which had...

332
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,320
I have that developer relations evangelism

333
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,400
sort of gene in me, I kind of approach,

334
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,360
I think a lot of it

335
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,280
as, hey, if you don't follow developers...

336
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,770
There are two sort of things that are ingrained in me.

337
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,980
One is if you don't follow where developers are going,

338
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,340
it's hard to sort of be relevant in terms of tech platforms.

339
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,430
And then you really need to understand the new workload

340
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,870
in order to build a tech platform.

341
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,600
Those are the two things that at least I've kept.

342
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,550
And so therefore, the only way,

343
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,280
if you're not following startups, it's very hard

344
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,770
to know what is either the platform or the workload.

345
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,710
So that's sort of a thing that I've indexed towards.

346
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,150
The other thing is it's just, you know,

347
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,550
I derive so much energy out of it, right?

348
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,960
I mean, I've always thought

349
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,460
founders are just magical people

350
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,050
who create something from nothing.

351
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,820
I mean, it's just sort of feels like a magic trick.

352
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,100
So I always like, "How the heck does one do that?"

353
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,720
Yeah, no, it is funny you say that

354
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,600
about following what the startups are doing.

355
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,130
We always conceived of what Stripe was building

356
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,140
as it was important to build for startups

357
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,420
both because today's small startups

358
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,830
are tomorrow's public companies.

359
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,660
And we've seen that again and again on Stripe.

360
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,520
But we just felt at an intuitive level

361
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,110
and we felt this before we could prove it,

362
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,590
that what the startups were interested in

363
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,660
were often better product experiences.

364
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,360
And so if the startups want stablecoins

365
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,560
or usage based billing or what have you,

366
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,060
we should build for those needs.

367
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,490
Not just 'cause we'll have a good startup business,

368
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,440
but the enterprises will come around.

369
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,760
And it took us, I would say, many years

370
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
to kind of prove out that model.

371
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,210
But now we're really seeing—

372
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,357
Yeah, in fact, I think you guys

373
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:54,420
are a bit of a gold standard on that.

374
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,490
In fact, one of the things that I learned from you guys

375
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,733
was rediscovering at some level

376
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,620
what Microsoft was very good at,

377
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,880
which is following the developer,

378
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,920
being where the startups are.

379
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,130
And so that's what sort of led me even to GitHub

380
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,440
and NAT and all of the rest,

381
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,770
which is to some degree the GitHub asset, right?

382
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,060
Obviously it is a great asset.

383
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,920
We needed to, one, be good stewards

384
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,170
of an open source ecosystem.

385
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,060
But it also the place where every startup,

386
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,130
like the one thing that everybody does have

387
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,450
is their repos in GitHub.

388
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,620
And I felt like, hey, being in that loop

389
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,810
was important for us.

390
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,360
Not just "oh it's strategically great

391
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,050
to have some position there," to learn simply

392
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,750
and to build better product, I think, is sort of well said.

393
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,140
Because you lose sometimes the aesthetic

394
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,370
of what is required,

395
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,290
what's that friction-free way to deliver

396
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,110
because the least amount of patience is there

397
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,620
and the time to value, for example, has to be maximized.

398
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,920
Is Microsoft thinking about generated UIs

399
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,210
that are personalized to...

400
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,380
Like, when you think about it,

401
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,410
software is stuck in the old paradigm of, you know,

402
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,480
we write a bunch of software and it goes to Gold Master

403
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,280
and as you know, goes out on discs

404
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,570
and now that same kind of software,

405
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,860
it's delivered in the cloud,

406
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,650
but the UI you want is probably, you know,

407
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,770
we can render that exact UI in real time.

408
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,090
Is that a direction you guys are going?

409
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,370
I think that, for sure, like at some level

410
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,820
what's happening is on one side our ability to generate.

411
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,340
I mean, if you sort of say you can generate all code,

412
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,430
so therefore you can generate some UX scaffolding

413
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,790
around anything that's a lot more custom, right?

414
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,370
So especially, in fact for the longest time,

415
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,050
one of the things at Microsoft

416
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,680
was what's the difference between a document,

417
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,040
a website and an application, really?

418
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,740
And so, to some degree, yeah, exactly.

419
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,440
So you can generate any one of those

420
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,890
at any time depending on what format you want to present it.

421
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,920
But, interestingly enough for all the talk

422
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,080
of, hey, all these apps go.

423
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,063
Take even our good old IDEs,

424
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,440
in some sense IDEs are back, right?

425
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,520
Whether it's Excel or VS Code.

426
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,720
Because the reality is AI generates output,

427
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,970
I need to make sense of that output.

428
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,240
In fact, I need a fantastic editor

429
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,240
that lets me do diffs and iterations on it with AI.

430
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,980
So I think the IDE, I think in fact

431
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,330
one of the most exciting things

432
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,780
is new classes of highly refined IDEs

433
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,270
that have even a sort of a telemetry loop

434
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,640
with the intelligence layer, but also

435
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,083
they kind of act more like heads up displays, right?

436
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,260
I have thousands of agents going off.

437
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,000
How am I going to make sense

438
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,170
of the micro steering of thousands of agents.

439
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,230
And that is what IDEs/inboxes

440
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,880
and messaging tools will be, right?

441
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,580
Which is, I'm not messaging one, you know,

442
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,160
or dealing with triage the way I deal with it today,

443
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,510
but it's going to be different.

444
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,343
Okay, interesting.

445
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:56,880
So you think right now

446
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
programmers spend all their time in an IDE,

447
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,860
but they're one of the few professions that does that.

448
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,780
And your vision is the accountant IDE,

449
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,310
the lawyer IDE, and—

450
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,300
What is the metaphor

451
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,190
of how I will work with agents, right?

452
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,339
So it's kind of like massive macro delegation, right?

453
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,900
So there's lots of agents

454
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,810
I go give a bunch of instructions to and they go off

455
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,329
and work sometimes for hours, days, let's say, you know,

456
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,660
as the models get better, but they are checking in

457
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,480
and so it's macro delegation, micro steering.

458
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,190
So if you take that,

459
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,680
how does one do micro steering with context, right?

460
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,090
It can't come back like my...

461
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,610
It can't be in the next notification hell, right?

462
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,140
Which is, it sort of notifies me.

463
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,250
It has like five words.

464
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,430
I don't know exactly what the real context is

465
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,720
or what have you.

466
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,730
That I think is where,

467
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,460
and that has to be multi app like, right?

468
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,710
So that's where I feel like all software finally,

469
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,330
when it grows up, it looks like an inbox

470
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,280
and a messaging tool

471
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,900
and a canvas with a blinking screen.

472
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,330
Except this time around a lot of work got, you know,

473
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,710
went and happened.

474
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,890
Is that one app, is that 10 different apps?

475
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,180
Like, it's kind of interesting

476
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,030
if you think about the productivity speech that emerged,

477
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,800
there was, you know,

478
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,780
three big apps in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

479
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,190
But it's interesting that that number

480
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,490
was not 1 and was not 40, it was 3.

481
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,411
And so how do you think about this in the—

482
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:17,244
I think that that's right.

483
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:21,570
I mean, to me, it will be a few, I think.

484
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,450
And in fact, the reductionist, you know,

485
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,400
in me, it says, "Man, they'll be the same things."

486
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,130
Except the job they do is going to be different

487
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,330
because I think, you know,

488
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,930
a table, at least at the human level, right?

489
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,370
Because we can all talk about,

490
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,050
like what tools will agents use

491
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,670
to communicate with each other, right?

492
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,530
That's a different thing, right?

493
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,020
Right now for the RL loop,

494
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,960
they are simulating our production environment,

495
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,120
but they will ultimately be more efficient

496
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,160
in creating their own production environments

497
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,500
to kind of RL themselves, so...

498
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,940
But let's just leave that aside.

499
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,310
But in order to communicate with us,

500
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,650
I feel like we have discovered

501
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,450
some good things that we like.

502
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,850
We like spreadsheets and tables

503
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,260
and we like documents in sort of linear form.

504
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,750
We like inboxes or messaging tools.

505
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,720
So these are like reasonable UIs,

506
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,610
except the question I think you asked

507
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,970
is how does this thing have, when it shows up

508
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,300
in an IDE with like a set of changes,

509
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,120
you have to help me more than just say, "Okay,

510
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,250
now here is a file, go to that file."

511
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,030
Like, that directed plan, not just to execute,

512
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,580
but for me to do my workflow.

513
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,413
And like, one of the things

514
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:34,950
that we are experimenting with

515
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,770
is mission control and GitHub Copilot is that.

516
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,770
The idea is you go have five, six different branches

517
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,710
in which you fire off all these autonomous agents.

518
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,020
They all do their work, they come back

519
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,680
and then your ability to do PR triage

520
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,080
is where I think the next IDE is born.

521
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,790
I'm struck by in technology

522
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,530
how frequently you see the pattern of excitement for,

523
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,970
and a vision around a technology being so much earlier

524
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,010
than the technology actually being ready.

525
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,960
Like the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey,"

526
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,100
which is in the '60s,

527
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,020
like that was a voice activated AI

528
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,510
with tool use, you know, capabilities.

529
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,760
It's true. And, you know,

530
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,390
it just took 50 years

531
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,030
and then, you know, people were excited about the idea

532
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,100
that you could speak to your computer and, you know,

533
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,690
text to speech, speech to text.

534
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,580
People were excited about that in the '80s.

535
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,790
And like only now, I don't know if you use superwhisper

536
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,630
or anything like that, but it's finally really good.

537
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,910
But like it wasn't good three years ago, you know,

538
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,080
40 years after the vision.

539
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,280
Yeah, it's crazy that you bring that up.

540
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,440
In fact, I used to have an apartment

541
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,440
right next to the Microsoft campus, that old campus,

542
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,270
and I was working on Interactive Television.

543
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,297
This was in '94.

544
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:45,870
The information superhighway.

545
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,136
That's right.

546
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:50,100
You know, and there were multiple things that were stunning.

547
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,030
My management chain was Rick Rashid and, you know,

548
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,290
who reported to Craig Mundie,

549
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,270
who reported to Nathan Myhrvold

550
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,140
and there was Bill Gates

551
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,807
and I was saying, "Man, that's a lot of IQ .

552
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:02,730
And of course we all missed the internet.

553
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,037
That was the only thing that happened.

554
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:07,740
But I had interactive television,

555
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,610
switched ATM, I think, to my home in my apartment.

556
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,890
So I remember doing this demo,

557
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,930
one of the high stakes things I did

558
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,880
as a young guy at Microsoft

559
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,450
was a demo of our first redundant file system,

560
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,100
which was a video server

561
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,530
where John Malone was the one who came

562
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,697
and Bill was sort of saying,

563
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:29,970
"Hey, here's the future of interactive television."

564
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,803
And guess what?

565
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:33,750
It's even great because the disc can go, you know,

566
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,280
haywire and still stream.

567
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,470
And so my job was to remove the disc drive

568
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,690
and have the stream continue.

569
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,690
But we built essentially a distributed file system

570
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,430
and a streaming server

571
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,160
and had an ATM switch network to the house.

572
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,080
And I had like five movies I could watch.

573
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,940
And I watched them all multiple times.

574
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,773
Okay, so I want to ask you about this,

575
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:53,640
'cause I've thought a lot about this

576
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,920
and you're the perfect person to ask,

577
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,920
which is, Microsoft saw the internet future

578
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,110
that was coming in the '90s,

579
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,940
and in particular the famous Bill Gates

580
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,620
Internet Tidal Wave memo

581
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,350
said, "The internet is the one big thing

582
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,670
Microsoft needs to focus on."

583
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,200
It wasn't like, "We're not thinking about the internet."

584
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,990
It wasn't that it was priority number 7 of 15.

585
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,760
It was like, "Hey, guys, listen up.

586
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,950
The only thing Microsoft should be thinking about

587
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,190
is the internet."

588
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,727
But the vision for the internet at the time

589
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,260
was this information superhighway,

590
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,090
which was subtly different from the internet

591
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,520
because the thinking was, and it was very sensible thinking,

592
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,980
no one has internet to the computer in their home.

593
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,690
Like, a lot of people don't have a computer in their home.

594
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,280
So what people do have is a TV

595
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,240
and what they have is cable,

596
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,920
which is a high bandwidth connection.

597
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,880
And so we're going to do these set top boxes on the TV

598
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,800
and that is how people will use the internet.

599
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,940
Like, paying a huge amount of attention to this coming wave.

600
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,610
Pretty sensible, well thought out solution,

601
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,620
and yet not the right approach.

602
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,453
And so obviously bring that up

603
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:55,050
in the context of the giant AI.

604
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,176
Like, what should one take away from that?

605
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,009
It's great one.

606
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,330
See, if I look at even my interpretation,

607
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,200
it'll be actually interesting.

608
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,203
I've not spent as much time talking to Bill about that era.

609
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:06,630
But I felt there were at least...

610
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,840
As someone, as a sort of an entry level employee

611
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,310
at that time even,

612
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,110
my reading of history

613
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,520
was that we kind of got the internet,

614
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,200
but we didn't.

615
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Because we wanted to deliver, remember the quality...

616
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,740
Like, I don't think we believed that TCP/IP would work.

617
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,160
I mean, at some level the information highway,

618
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,260
when I look at what we were trying to do

619
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,960
was, man, this quality of service is a thing.

620
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,470
This TCP/IP just is not going to work.

621
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,730
And so therefore we were competing against AOL, on dial up

622
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,500
and even that sort of...

623
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,650
You remember like MSN was an X.25 network.

624
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,210
Yes, yes. The first version of it.

625
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,710
Yes. And so then...

626
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,800
But that's when Bill like pivoted, right?

627
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,800
So the thing that Bill did was in '95, I guess...

628
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,680
In fact, it's funny that, right,

629
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,720
Windows 95 was launching,

630
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,670
and then he says, "You know what?"

631
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,200
It's all going to change."

632
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,570
So I feel between '92,

633
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,010
which is when I think all of us,

634
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,900
maybe who'd got our first demo,

635
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,480
right, '93, November is when Mosaic...

636
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,313
Right? Yeah, that's right.

637
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:14,146
I think something like that.

638
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:15,060
And so we all, you know,

639
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,100
were kind of dancing around it.

640
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,050
So from '93 to '95,

641
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:24,000
there was that two year period where it was unclear

642
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,380
whether this was going to be the protocol

643
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,040
and the stack emerged.

644
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,103
And by '95 it was clear, and then we pivoted.

645
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,900
Interesting.

646
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,450
Okay, so just at that time it wasn't actually clear

647
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,620
that the open internet would win.

648
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,210
Yes.

649
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,177
And in fact, there's one more lesson that...

650
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:42,750
You know, the interesting thing that I've always watched,

651
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,550
and because I think we can parlay this into AI,

652
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,610
one is to get the paradigm right.

653
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,090
Then, it's not clear, even if you get the paradigm right,

654
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,180
that you may not get what is the killer app

655
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,310
or even the business model,

656
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,780
like, that's always been the case, right?

657
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,390
Which is, you know, with the internet,

658
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,040
who would've thought that, you know,

659
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,010
for the open web, an organizing layer

660
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,300
would be one proprietor

661
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,150
or one network effect search engine, right?

662
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,660
Because the organizing layer of the web,

663
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,310
you know, I always say like, "There's no such thing

664
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,070
as the open web, there's the Google web."

665
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,950
And just because they just dominated it.

666
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,870
Should one reflect on the fact

667
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,770
that maybe there was some motivated thinking

668
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,500
around our proprietary solution, you know,

669
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,440
the Liberty Media, Microsoft joint venture will win?

670
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,040
Whereas the open web is what won

671
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,640
and you should maybe caution organizations

672
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,640
where if they're following two possibilities, you know,

673
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,280
our information superhighway proprietary system

674
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,240
or the open web, companies will somehow

675
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,800
have happy thinking towards the proprietary solution.

676
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,870
It's an interesting one, I think the way, you know,

677
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,060
when I look back again, it's interesting, right?

678
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,850
So AOL and MSN kind of, you know,

679
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,210
lost out, let's call it, to the open web,

680
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,210
except they were replaced by new forms of AOL and MSN.

681
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,680
They're called search engines.

682
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,940
They're called app stores.

683
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,010
Like, the mobile web in fact is fascinating.

684
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,660
Yeah, the open web was a moment in history.

685
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,173
A moment in history, and then...

686
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:23,550
And so the thing that, maybe the meta thing for me

687
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,300
is organizing layers will always emerge

688
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,670
even in an open ecosystem

689
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,340
and a lot of the category power

690
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,050
moves to that organizing layer.

691
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,120
And it's always unclear, like the last paradigm

692
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,220
or this last time it was search engines,

693
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,170
today it's chat bots.

694
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,390
How long lasting is that?

695
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,040
No one knows, but it's definitely,

696
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,400
today, I mean, ChatGPT's success cannot be denied

697
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,810
in terms of what it means as an aggregation point.

698
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,990
Marketplaces/app stores have been a thing.

699
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,000
What comes next, you know?

700
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,740
What happens to e-commerce

701
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,530
in an agentic marketplace or an agent e-commerce?

702
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,480
I think these are the interesting things

703
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,980
that need to be litigated.

704
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,813
Well, I want to talk about that

705
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:07,200
and I want to talk about commerce, but actually first,

706
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,260
while we're on the topic of, while we're still in the '90s,

707
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,910
everyone is making comparisons

708
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,760
to the dot-com bubble right now, it's almost a cliche.

709
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,700
And I think it's actually a reasonable comparison.

710
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,140
You know, it's a cliche for a reason,

711
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,140
which is, it is a very CapEx intensive build out

712
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,810
for a new paradigm that is in fact a big deal

713
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,120
and yet there's an awful lot of CapEx.

714
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,120
You were there at Microsoft during the 2000 dot-com bubble

715
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,960
and it really was, you know,

716
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,250
Microsoft's share price peaked

717
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,840
in the late '90s, early 2000s,

718
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,683
and then didn't surpass it until 2016, I want to say.

719
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,950
What did it feel like in 1999?

720
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,680
In particular, did you know you were in a bubble?

721
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,550
Or was it like, "Oh, this time it's different."

722
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,020
It's interesting. Yeah.

723
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,790
Yeah, in fact, I remember, I think, you know,

724
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,750
we probably became the largest market cap company in 2000,

725
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,403
we crossed GE, I remember that.

726
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:05,550
Yeah, we were capital-light, let's say, right?

727
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,320
That time around, it was like...

728
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,240
I guess I was more like Sam at that time,

729
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,690
which is somebody else's capital was being spent.

730
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,110
It is, quite honestly, when I look back at it,

731
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,110
at that time too, the financial cycle aside,

732
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,440
it was clear, the secular trend was clear

733
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,480
that this is going to.

734
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,760
Because even by then,

735
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,010
the business models were also emerging.

736
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,040
Even for Microsoft, the biggest lesson at that time

737
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,900
was, oh, my God, like even our first order play,

738
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,280
or, oh, we got to build a browser,

739
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,230
we got to build a web server.

740
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,593
We've got to, you know, have internet protocols everywhere.

741
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,590
You know, we had a website builder

742
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,090
inside of office with front page.

743
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,640
We did all the obvious things,

744
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,830
but we realized that just doing the obvious things

745
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,730
didn't make sense.

746
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,130
We needed to reinvent what we were doing,

747
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,950
plus what are the new business models, was clear.

748
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,600
So in an interesting way,

749
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,250
that cycle kind of came out of nowhere.

750
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,190
I mean, it came out of, you know, what was just, you know,

751
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,230
whatever rational exuberance or what have you,

752
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,920
but the correction in some sense

753
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,220
washed away a bunch of stuff.

754
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,260
But I would say the ideas persisted.

755
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,190
Totally. Right?

756
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,340
And so, to me, I think about what's happening here.

757
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,300
I mean, there are two things, right?

758
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,700
The infrastructure itself that's getting laid out,

759
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,304
I think it's got a lot more immediate.

760
00:29:34,304 --> 00:29:37,200
Like, it's not like even the, you know, the gestation period

761
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,140
of okay, I built up, you know, dark fiber,

762
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,050
and you know, some internet company will first scale

763
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,240
to a billion users and use.

764
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,073
This time— There are lines

765
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:46,906
out the door to buy this stuff.

766
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:48,390
Exactly, and so this time around,

767
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,733
quite frankly, we are behind, right?

768
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:54,300
Like when I look at our infrastructure build, right,

769
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,800
and demand today.

770
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,150
That's the thing that when people say

771
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,380
it's all a, you know, there's a bubble.

772
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,810
Like, when I look at my earnings, I can have...

773
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,880
Like, I mean, that was the last time

774
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,940
I was so supply constrained on PowerShells.

775
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,560
I haven't heard that comparison before,

776
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,490
which is, let's not forget that the dot-com bubble,

777
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,780
which again was a telecoms bubble,

778
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,390
it was a fiber bubble in a big way.

779
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,360
Like, it was dark fiber, the clue's in the name,

780
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,400
it was dark, it was not lit up yet.

781
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,680
And this is anything but dark fiber.

782
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,690
Yeah, it's not like any one of us is sitting there

783
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,840
and saying, "Hey, I have all the GPUs wired up

784
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,100
and nobody's using them."

785
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,110
I don't have a utilization problem.

786
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,910
I may have a PUE, like, I mean,

787
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,800
I want higher utilization

788
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,780
because it's mostly because it's memory bottleneck

789
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,760
or what have you, but that is a different...

790
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,380
But like there is not a thing

791
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,940
that I have that's not sold out.

792
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,060
In fact, my problem is I got to bring more supply.

793
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,210
And in that, will we perfectly get it?

794
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,043
No one does, right?

795
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:51,300
There's no supply chain operation

796
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,150
that perfectly matches demand and supply.

797
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,810
But this time around the build out, you know,

798
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,400
given the long lead, like for example,

799
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,620
one of the things we study a lot is,

800
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,420
even when we talk about our capital,

801
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,730
we try to describe it even to the Street.

802
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,260
Hey, you got to remember these assets.

803
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,033
Some of these assets are 20 years.

804
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,260
Some of these things are four years or five years.

805
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,200
And in fact you kind of have to make the decisions

806
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,330
on those things differently, right?

807
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:23,330
Having a cold shell that's unused is nothing, right?

808
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,580
Yeah. it's kind of like having a campus with five buildings.

809
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,200
It's not sort of going to be a problem

810
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,850
on Microsoft's balance sheet.

811
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,890
What is a real problem would be,

812
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,120
hey, not having warm shells

813
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,170
that we can kind of light up.

814
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,180
Where is the bottleneck these days?

815
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,854
Like, is it electricians, is it shells?

816
00:31:41,854 --> 00:31:43,480
Is it turbines. Yeah, I mean, so...

817
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,080
Yeah, the product that is the bottleneck

818
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,490
is just a bunch of powered up shells.

819
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,570
So if I don't have enough shells that are powered,

820
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,330
that I can then roll in my racks

821
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,460
and then make them operational.

822
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,960
And that's the long lead part, right?

823
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,140
Which is you kind of have to have the land permits,

824
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,130
the power permits, get all that done in time.

825
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,930
And by the way, location, right?

826
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,690
So I think one of the things that's glossed over,

827
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,020
of course stateside, United States, we are building a lot,

828
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,033
but we have to build all over the world.

829
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,970
And there are data regulations, in fact, more every day.

830
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,570
People care about sovereignty in a major, major way.

831
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,790
And so therefore for us, we have to make sure

832
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,130
that the fleet is a global fleet,

833
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,570
a fleet that kind of can deal with all types of workloads,

834
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,210
training to DataGen, to inference.

835
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,570
And so it's sort of a complex, multi-variable thing.

836
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,670
Who should care about data sovereignty?

837
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:49,110
Where, you know, Ireland has a bunch of data centers

838
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,960
but is not particularly wound up on the idea that, you know,

839
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,760
data should only be in Ireland.

840
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,800
And I don't think it should be super wound up

841
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,630
about that fact, but, well, I guess,

842
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,480
do you guys just go with whatever the country wants

843
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,860
or do you try to advise

844
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,230
on whether you should want data sovereignty or not,

845
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,063
and who should?

846
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:09,150
Yeah, so I think it's obviously a topic that's top of mind

847
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,530
for pretty much every country,

848
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,480
every policy maker, and they care.

849
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,060
And there's obviously real legitimate reasons.

850
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,490
The thing that I would say, in the AI age,

851
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,410
I'm now thinking a little bit differently

852
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,340
even about sovereignty.

853
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,700
What I mean by that is the ultimate sovereignty question

854
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,120
is more of what's the future of a corporation, right?

855
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,567
Like, I mean, if you sort of start by, you know,

856
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:32,610
if you go to the core of the Coase theorem,

857
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,470
you say, "Wow, what the heck?

858
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,550
You know, if the model is the thing that knows everything,

859
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,570
why do I even...

860
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,820
Like, I'm supposed to have some tacit knowledge

861
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,360
that makes the transactional costs inside my organization

862
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,390
lower than just being in the marketplace."

863
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,130
So that's a mind bender.

864
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,050
So in fact, one of the ways I think

865
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,940
is the sovereignty that matters

866
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,590
is your company's sovereignty

867
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,870
in a age where there are continual learning,

868
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,030
increasing returns to a model.

869
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,810
So I'm increasingly thinking that hey, company's ability

870
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,350
to have that intelligence layer that's a scaffold

871
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,260
or even weights embedded in the model.

872
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,020
Like, so it's not somebody else's foundation model.

873
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,130
It's about do you have sovereignty in your foundation model?

874
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,560
So my new concept is the future of a company

875
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,770
is that company has its own foundation model

876
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,679
that captures essentially that passive knowledge

877
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,260
that makes the transactional costs

878
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,290
of how knowledge gets accrued and diffused

879
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,270
inside the organization faster.

880
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,630
So that's sort of a long speech on sovereignty.

881
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,940
Well, there's two versions of...

882
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,560
That's very interesting, the idea that AI

883
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,139
maybe just changes the nature of companies.

884
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:49,710
And you are saying that if companies,

885
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,989
some companies are already collections of IP, right?

886
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,570
You know, Disney, we just had Dave Ricks

887
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:59,570
from Eli Lilly here, that is an IP company in a big way.

888
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,570
And some companies are already collections of IP.

889
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,140
But right now that IP is in all the emails and documents

890
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,270
and people's heads most importantly.

891
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:14,270
Whereas maybe the IP could be in a single model over time.

892
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,180
Where I thought you were going to go with that

893
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,800
is just maybe the, you know, people point out a lot

894
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,350
that current companies are modeled after, you know,

895
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:30,000
manufacturing companies and Alfred Sloan type stuff,

896
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,140
despite the fact that, you know,

897
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,130
we're doing knowledge work today

898
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,170
and not running a little manufacturing line.

899
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,410
And do you get more just weird looking companies,

900
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,180
do you get the, you know, the famous,

901
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,040
really tiny billion dollar company?

902
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,647
Do you get more highly distributed internet companies?

903
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:44,340
Do you get some DAOs?

904
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,207
I thought that's where you're going to go with that.

905
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,760
I think that those are also possibilities.

906
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,070
So the structure itself could change

907
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,350
and it's going to be more possible for, you know,

908
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,730
whatever the few, you know,

909
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,717
the one person billion dollar company, what have you, right?

910
00:35:55,717 --> 00:35:59,070
Make that happen or DAOs could happen.

911
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,700
But the interesting question, at least for me is,

912
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,900
where does tacit knowledge reside, right?

913
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,480
Clearly it resides in people's heads

914
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,480
and it's the classic knowhow that accrues in compounds.

915
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,400
I think it will also reside

916
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,020
and compound as weights in some LoRA layer

917
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,017
that is unique to your company.

918
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:25,290
So that's kind of my...

919
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,273
So in fact, I feel like, hey, you know,

920
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,610
the new intellectual property at Eli Lilly or at Microsoft

921
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,100
or at Stripe at some point

922
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,580
can be also be besides all the humans,

923
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,803
besides all the other artifacts we have,

924
00:36:40,803 --> 00:36:44,370
I think we'll also say, "Oh, they are in some embedding."

925
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,390
Yes. Well, okay.

926
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,720
It's funny you say this because Stripe,

927
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,670
Stripe is interesting 'cause it does not really

928
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,610
have strong network effects as a company.

929
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,740
You know, when we started building up Stripe,

930
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,980
it was very much a single player API experience

931
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,410
and we make it easy to start using Stripe,

932
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,880
but ultimately you'd never know

933
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,350
that anyone else was using Stripe.

934
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,760
What's happened as we've scaled up

935
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,820
is we now just have a trust network

936
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,520
where we can prevent fraud by virtue of the fact

937
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,370
that we've seen most internet users.

938
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,370
And so we have a knowledge for what good and bad looks like.

939
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,940
And even the fact that we haven't seen you before

940
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,620
is inherently a little bit suspicious

941
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,750
because we've seen most people

942
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,430
and so it becomes a reputation network,

943
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,290
kind like reCAPTCHA for Google

944
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,300
simply became kind of a reputation network.

945
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,160
Anyway, what we're now doing

946
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,320
is training a payments foundation model

947
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,970
where we're using all the data that we have

948
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,930
in the Stripe network

949
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,420
and you have a much larger, more capable model

950
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,253
taking into account...

951
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:42,616
So anyway, we are trying to do exactly what you're saying.

952
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:44,853
And so one of the questions for all of us,

953
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:47,040
then how do you protect that

954
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,830
from sort of essentially leaking over

955
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,560
to the base foundation model?

956
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,020
Is it just like one capability hop away

957
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,200
because it learned how to even do fraud detection?

958
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,230
Is it just some other multidimensional or not?

959
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,820
And that I think is the key question, right?

960
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,720
To me, I think, there are two arguments, right?

961
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,280
One argument is it's that, you know,

962
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,550
argument that, hey, the models are going to eat the world.

963
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,470
You can kind of easily see, oh yeah,

964
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,390
after all, everything is just a pattern

965
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,280
and I'll learn it all and what have you, so.

966
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,530
But then the thing though is,

967
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,600
you could, to your point about Stripe

968
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,940
can take multiple models,

969
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,540
build this unbelievable sort of, I'll call it

970
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,540
fraud detection layer that is, you know, model forward.

971
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,080
And then there is this memory and tools use

972
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,440
and action space that's all unique to Stripe.

973
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,690
That to me is the future of a corporation.

974
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,090
Whether it's a pharma company, a payments company,

975
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,290
or a software company.

976
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,860
That I think is the work that we all are doing

977
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,930
and will do, and I think that that's, to me,

978
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,373
that is sovereignty, right?

979
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,013
Alright.

980
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,660
Oh, man.

981
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,620
Alright.

982
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,120
Woo. Wow.

983
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,590
Okay, this could be a new high score.

984
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,420
And 4, 74.

985
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,163
So, new high score. There you go.

986
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,700
I'm still thinking about this discussion

987
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,700
we're having about

988
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,910
the IDE for people who aren't software engineers.

989
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,040
And again, I feel like there could be a product

990
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,830
in the next 10 years for finance people

991
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,310
where, in hindsight, it is obviously the correct UI,

992
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,750
but just like the spreadsheet

993
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,510
kind of came out of nowhere as a UI,

994
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,213
it may feel like it came out of nowhere at that time.

995
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:38,370
I'm really struck by that.

996
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,870
Speaking of the spreadsheet,

997
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,690
it's like a rite of passage for certain software companies

998
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,310
to try to take on Excel

999
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:48,180
and it's seems to be doing pretty well

1000
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,970
40 years in or what have you.

1001
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,140
Why is it so durable?

1002
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, it's unbelievable, right?

1003
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,713
I mean, at some level, you know,

1004
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,053
the idea that a tabular for...

1005
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:07,620
I mean, I think it's the power of lists and tables.

1006
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,850
It's just a perfect,

1007
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,820
and the malleability of software, right?

1008
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,590
That was I think the combination.

1009
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,680
So I think that's where the, what's the durability of a,

1010
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,750
that's why a blinking canvas, right?

1011
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,630
It's sort of like it's always going to be there.

1012
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,073
We may add lots of bells and whistles to it.

1013
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,380
And the same thing with spreadsheets.

1014
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,270
The other thing about the spreadsheet is,

1015
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,830
it's Turing complete, right?

1016
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,420
I mean, that's the other, you know,

1017
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,540
Yeah, We sort of don't give it enough credit.

1018
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,769
It's like I can make it

1019
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:35,670
do everything. I think it's the world's

1020
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,440
most approachable programming environment.

1021
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,390
100%, I mean, it's kind of like, you know,

1022
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:42,630
and you get into it without even thinking your programming.

1023
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,130
And that is the other beauty, right?

1024
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,850
Which is like, you know, like AI still, we're mystified it.

1025
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,230
You and I talked about, oh, my God,

1026
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,430
we need change management.

1027
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,840
When spreadsheets came,

1028
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,490
nobody talked about change management.

1029
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,560
They were just using it.

1030
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,156
And that to me is the other thing which is...

1031
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,790
You know, like somebody was describing to me,

1032
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,670
I was meeting the CEO of Generality,

1033
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,910
he joined Generality during the fax machine era

1034
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,330
and he was managing all their insurance agents

1035
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,920
and he said to me like, "Look,

1036
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,770
I still remember the day when emails showed up,

1037
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,310
Excel showed up and the entire workflow

1038
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:21,690
of how things happen completely were upended

1039
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,870
and evolved and changed ground up."

1040
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,120
And so to me, I think that that's, to your point,

1041
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,320
what are those things of this era that will discover,

1042
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,800
that'll allow the ground up relitigation of the work,

1043
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,630
the work artifact and the workflow.

1044
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,730
It's such an interesting time to be in software.

1045
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,380
I mean, compared to, you must feel this,

1046
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,930
like, it's just a much more interesting time now

1047
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,130
than 5 or 10 years ago.

1048
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,720
You know, it is interesting, right?

1049
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,440
Which is what happened was we were like, you know,

1050
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,760
Cloud, Cloud, Cloud.

1051
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,620
And, you know, if you had to ask me

1052
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,760
what is the hottest thing in, you know, 2019,

1053
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,580
we had built this fantastic multi region

1054
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,440
or regionless database that was multi-format, right

1055
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,130
Cosmos DB, which was like, ah, we had, you know,

1056
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,770
basically a JSON database.

1057
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,049
We had a SQL in there,

1058
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:15,450
it was the everything database and we were thinking,

1059
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,220
oh, and it's regionless and blah, blah, blah.

1060
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,240
And then the pandemic happened

1061
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,280
and then Cloud went into another hyper drive.

1062
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,233
I mean, Teams, thank God, just became like the thing.

1063
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,380
So that was the exciting thing,

1064
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,600
and lo and behold, you come out of it

1065
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,840
and you sort of say, "Oh, I thought, oh, after the pandemic

1066
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,360
we're going to get to some stable state."

1067
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,990
In fact, I remember a forecast of the Cloud, you know,

1068
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,640
we were saying, "What do we do?

1069
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,220
We overbuilt during the pandemic,"

1070
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,500
and there was a good eight months

1071
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,910
where we were, "Oh, what..."

1072
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,940
And then this thing now has come to.

1073
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,054
There's a lot of charts of the shape at Stripe.

1074
00:42:56,054 --> 00:42:57,780
I don't know if it was this way at Microsoft,

1075
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,670
where obviously March 2020

1076
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,530
you saw this discontinuity, right?

1077
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,330
Much more eCommerce activity happening

1078
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,300
and we saw the rate of online business creation.

1079
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,070
'Cause, you know, you had businesses that were offline only

1080
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,710
saying, "Oh, you know, we got to switch to selling online."

1081
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,570
And it just stayed at that elevated level forever

1082
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,477
obviously since, it's gone up from there.

1083
00:43:13,477 --> 00:43:17,100
But there was no matching decline

1084
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,230
as people went back to, you know,

1085
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,450
into physical offices and things like that.

1086
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,880
It was just a step change

1087
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,620
and then it stayed at the elevated level forever.

1088
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,760
I'm sure you saw some of the things

1089
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,100
in Azure and things like that. Yeah, 100%.

1090
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,460
It never came down.

1091
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,810
We're talking about commerce, so we might as well

1092
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,490
talk about what we're working on together.

1093
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,170
So we are very excited about it.

1094
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:39,170
I mean, I think the idea that has always been there is,

1095
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,430
which is what's the best way

1096
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,310
for a merchant friendly set of rails

1097
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,980
and what is a customer friendly set of rails, right?

1098
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,080
Is there a perfect matching?

1099
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,150
Conversational sort of commerce

1100
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,730
is a thing that people have talked about.

1101
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,490
And now I think with the work that you all have done

1102
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,570
and others have done,

1103
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,680
we kind of can really bring the merchant and the end user

1104
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,810
and have this agentic sort of experience.

1105
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,200
So it's early days, it has to be tastefully done,

1106
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,590
it has to be done in a way that you earn the user's trust.

1107
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,450
And so I'm very excited about it.

1108
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:18,810
Yeah, we see two differences here

1109
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:21,150
because there have been previous attempts as, you know,

1110
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,653
buying on Twitter, buying on Instagram

1111
00:44:22,653 --> 00:44:24,540
and, you know, these kinds of things.

1112
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:28,020
But what's different here is one, you have AI,

1113
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,420
so all the integrations for the merchant are much easier.

1114
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,720
It's much less of a lift than previous times

1115
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,950
when things like that just have been tried.

1116
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,570
But then secondly, I just think the experience

1117
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,610
is so compelling as an end user.

1118
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,380
We're already seeing this in the early data

1119
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,037
from the super early customers that we have.

1120
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:52,230
You know, we launched a few weeks back in ChatGPT as well

1121
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,260
that just, it has to work.

1122
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,030
And again, the data's already bearing that out,

1123
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,103
because it's so much easier as an end customer.

1124
00:44:59,103 --> 00:45:00,325
Yeah, I've been talking about it like, you know,

1125
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:02,880
I'm a bit of a cricket nut so I kind of,

1126
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,790
I'm always searching for something and, you know,

1127
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:06,990
the problem is, you know,

1128
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,360
whether it's Amazon or Walmart or what have you,

1129
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,930
the search experience sometimes is hard on the site.

1130
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,040
So interestingly enough,

1131
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,580
these chat experiences first are fantastic, right?

1132
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,920
And the fact that they point back to the catalog,

1133
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,080
I mean, the catalog is still king.

1134
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,590
But now if I can marry the checkout and the catalog

1135
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,560
and that to me is where I think the seamlessness.

1136
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,030
Well, and do you have any experiences,

1137
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:30,960
I've found versions of this,

1138
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,250
I'm curious if you've had experiences

1139
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,590
where for product research,

1140
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,500
using an AI app is so much better

1141
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,330
than, you know, keyword based search.

1142
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,490
It's amazing that up to last year

1143
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,100
we thought keyword based search was an acceptable way

1144
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,380
to hunt for anything. Yeah, in fact, that's...

1145
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,690
Yeah, and the seller, like the bottom line

1146
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,190
is it's kind of like it is creating

1147
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,089
a custom catalog for you, right?

1148
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:56,820
I mean, the response is not like a SERP, right?

1149
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,930
No, we were buying furniture in our house

1150
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,280
and we were just saying, "Oh, yeah,

1151
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,430
we have this much space available in this spot.

1152
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,520
What do you think is a good, you know, piece

1153
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,260
that would look good in that spot

1154
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,390
that meets these dimensions," and things like that.

1155
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,220
But it's crazy that we weren't doing that

1156
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,180
previously, you know what I mean?

1157
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,220
And so all this kind of customization,

1158
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,137
being able to give vibes, general aesthetics,

1159
00:46:20,137 --> 00:46:22,200
"I'm looking for like something slightly higher end

1160
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,430
but not super fancy."

1161
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,012
You know, it's crazy that you weren't able to...

1162
00:46:26,012 --> 00:46:28,127
By the way, that's just the other crazy, crazy thing.

1163
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:30,900
I know my wife's who's an architect

1164
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,140
and so she sort of has this notebook, you know,

1165
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,850
Copilot notebook in which she has all these

1166
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,560
architectural pictures and so on.

1167
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,040
And you can ask it quite high level reasoning questions

1168
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,870
on what I should put in there.

1169
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,270
It's able to take an architectural sketch,

1170
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:49,050
a drawing, and then take a public catalog of furniture

1171
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,837
and put those things together and reason about it.

1172
00:46:51,837 --> 00:46:54,000
And that type of stuff is pretty magical.

1173
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,550
Like, our view on this, we are, as you know,

1174
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:00,930
really AI pilled when it comes to commerce at Stripe.

1175
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,460
And we think a huge amount will move here.

1176
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,160
And all the merchant conversations we're having

1177
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,510
are bearing that out.

1178
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,620
And the way I think about it

1179
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,247
is that if you are doing open-ended discovery,

1180
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:15,780
"Oh, I'm interested in an outfit to buy for this occasion,

1181
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,640
don't know exactly what I want,"

1182
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,400
AI will be so much better at helping you with that

1183
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,710
than the current experiences where, you know,

1184
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,210
you're clicking through a list of search results

1185
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,680
or something like that.

1186
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,990
And then if you're doing targeted search

1187
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,910
where I'm looking for a specific object

1188
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:30,743
that meets these needs,

1189
00:47:30,743 --> 00:47:32,730
"I want this component for my bike."

1190
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,400
Then also being able to specify with AI

1191
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,050
the exact parameters of the search you have,

1192
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,010
will be much better.

1193
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,040
You're like, "Wait, if you're taking

1194
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,710
all of the undirected discovery

1195
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,733
and if you're also taking all of the highly directed search,

1196
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:47,640
isn't that just like all the commerce

1197
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,736
that happens on the internet?"

1198
00:47:48,736 --> 00:47:49,860
I think the only thing that's left

1199
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,777
that's out of that is like recurring staples.

1200
00:47:52,777 --> 00:47:54,390
"I need to order more pet food."

1201
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,420
That feels to me like the least affected.

1202
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,710
Though, of course you have to discover the brand

1203
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,900
of pet food at some point originally.

1204
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,210
But yeah, that's kind of how we're thinking about it.

1205
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,300
And again, Etsy has been an awesome first partner

1206
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,250
because all the products are custom, right?

1207
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,120
There's no...

1208
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,890
Yeah, that makes a ton of sense to me.

1209
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,070
I mean, the discovery part,

1210
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,420
which obviously people like Instagram

1211
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,280
and others have done a great job.

1212
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,073
So the question is what's the discovery layer.

1213
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,760
We have, like, that's one of the, you know,

1214
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,360
obviously personalized discovery layer inspiration

1215
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,193
for a product, you know,

1216
00:48:28,193 --> 00:48:29,910
what Pinterest has done is interesting.

1217
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,710
So some layer like that

1218
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,220
married with this conversational interface.

1219
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,840
Well, and of course it'll be a rising tide

1220
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,860
that lifts all boats

1221
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,140
where part of what we're doing with this

1222
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:45,140
is making merchant's product catalogs remotely discoverable

1223
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,360
and inventory and everything like that.

1224
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,400
And then remotely purchasable

1225
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,240
where you don't necessarily

1226
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,890
have to go through the whole flow on their side

1227
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:53,820
and everything like that.

1228
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,120
You can just do it inside the magic wand Copilot experience.

1229
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,850
And so that is at like the raw nuts and bolts level

1230
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,830
what we are doing and what we're wiring up.

1231
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,810
I think then what's exciting is that, again,

1232
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,080
Pinterest played with commerce quite a few years back,

1233
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,340
maybe 10 years back.

1234
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,470
It hasn't taken off as a huge thing.

1235
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:12,750
But now if you have all the merchants

1236
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,450
who are offering their product catalogs

1237
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,730
as part of this protocol, then social sites like, you know,

1238
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,300
Pinterest and Instagram and Twitter

1239
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,780
get another run at this kind of commerce experience

1240
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,398
because you've way more merchant support and adoption for it

1241
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:28,380
than you had the first time around.

1242
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,297
Yeah, and we have a project called the NLWeb

1243
00:49:30,297 --> 00:49:31,620
and the idea is that,

1244
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,310
and which is to really take every catalog of every merchant

1245
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:38,550
and give it like essentially a website,

1246
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:41,640
an NLWeb interface,

1247
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,780
that then an agent can talk to, to be able to interrogate

1248
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,330
and get the deep search, so to speak.

1249
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,280
Yes, yes, yes. Because today in some sense,

1250
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,490
one of the biggest challenges is the quality of the catalog

1251
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,360
and the ability to use reasoning to do a deep search.

1252
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,550
And if you can solve that, then to your point,

1253
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,220
every product will find its query.

1254
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:07,050
Yes, so we're building out this platform

1255
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,870
in agentic commerce where we have, you know,

1256
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:10,980
some open source protocols

1257
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,420
like our agentic commerce protocol.

1258
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,700
We obviously have the regular Stripe products, you know,

1259
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,399
people are using us for, you know,

1260
00:50:16,399 --> 00:50:18,450
and it's particularly kind of tricky

1261
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,440
from a payments point of view

1262
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,650
because you're looking to have an AI app

1263
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,170
do payments on behalf of other people

1264
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,030
across all these different sites on the web

1265
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,040
without probably sharing all your payment details

1266
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,873
like all across the web.

1267
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:31,530
It's interesting payment things that we're doing.

1268
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,230
Anyway, we're looking to build a platform business

1269
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,820
in agentic commerce.

1270
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,920
You guys seem to know a thing or two.

1271
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,200
What advice would you have for us

1272
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,650
as we build in this very nascent space,

1273
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:44,910
but when there clearly is product market fit?

1274
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:45,743
I mean, I think...

1275
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:47,970
I mean, you have done that, right?

1276
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:48,990
Which is one of the things

1277
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,630
that I would think is what does it mean

1278
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,270
to participate in this agentic workflow, right?

1279
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,530
For every merchant, right?

1280
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,910
Like, so every merchant now

1281
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,430
will have to sort of come to someone like Stripe

1282
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:03,480
and say, "Hey, I have a catalog, I have a checkout,

1283
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,470
please get me to meet agents,"

1284
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,120
in the most friction-free way.

1285
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,040
And that's done tastefully is why

1286
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,110
I would think I would hire Stripe for.

1287
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,870
And I think the merchant onboarding,

1288
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:19,080
because I'm assuming the long tail of merchants

1289
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,210
being able to click and say, "Hey,

1290
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,370
enable me for agentic commerce,"

1291
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,380
is going to be the thing that's going to drive.

1292
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,120
Because the good news here is there is going to be multiple,

1293
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,700
I mean, obviously ChatGPT is the big one,

1294
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,170
but there's going to be, I mean, you know,

1295
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,820
Google's going to be there, we're going to be there,

1296
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,830
Meta will be there, Perplexity,

1297
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,840
there's going to be a lot of competition.

1298
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,690
There's going to be a lot of front doors

1299
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,950
as aggregators. Yes.

1300
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,860
But the more interesting thing is they themselves,

1301
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,100
will on their website or on their mobile app,

1302
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,163
will want to support natural language queries.

1303
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,750
And so all of that being enabled for,

1304
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,480
or my own agents will go interrogate those things.

1305
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,470
So I think that that's the key thing

1306
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:01,410
to be challenged, you know, or rather really solve well.

1307
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,880
Because going to a small merchant

1308
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,040
and saying, "Hey, you go stand up an MCP server,

1309
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,920
do this protocol, that protocol," what's the easy button?

1310
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,424
I think the other thing that's we're going to see is,

1311
00:52:11,424 --> 00:52:12,390
and you're probably seeing this already,

1312
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,790
a merging of a bunch of the agentic experiences.

1313
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,130
So we're talking about agentic commerce here.

1314
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,503
And we had Des Traynor from Intercom,

1315
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,840
they're now doing customer service AI mediated

1316
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,460
and just like replacing humans,

1317
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,020
doing customer service with AI.

1318
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,980
But what they're seeing obviously

1319
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,600
is a huge amount of induced demand

1320
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,420
where people initially come for the help desk type queries

1321
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,580
and it's like, "Wow, this is honestly a much better way

1322
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,870
to navigate the website."

1323
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,550
And it's almost like a command line for...

1324
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,430
Anyway, it can't quite take as much actions now

1325
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:41,700
as it will be able to.

1326
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,780
But I also wonder how much all these experiences merge

1327
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,940
where like, we're doing the buying stuff over here

1328
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,160
that is growing and expanding and, you know,

1329
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,870
maybe there's some discovery and things like that.

1330
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,730
They're doing the customer service stuff over there.

1331
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:54,563
It's universal.

1332
00:52:54,563 --> 00:52:55,397
Yeah, that's a good point.

1333
00:52:55,397 --> 00:52:57,600
When does it become a command-line application?

1334
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,770
Like, again, my example of this

1335
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,460
is I find the fashion space interesting

1336
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,880
where, how incredibly poor the tech is

1337
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,210
with a lot of websites out there where people are trying

1338
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,977
to do this very aesthetic vibe space.

1339
00:53:11,977 --> 00:53:13,500
"I'm looking for something like that,

1340
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,620
but like a little more fancy," you know, whatever.

1341
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,270
And it's all keyword based search

1342
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:20,520
and manual tagging and things like that.

1343
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,160
And things like that feel to me perfectly set up

1344
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,150
for having an interactive AI based experience where, again,

1345
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,140
like your Midjourney prompts,

1346
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,700
you're like, "No, the image wasn't quite right.

1347
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,720
Change it in this way."

1348
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,250
Just doing that with commerce, I think,

1349
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,083
will be really interesting. Makes sense.

1350
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,700
And I also think intuitively like, I mean, all of us

1351
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,880
our inside sales is also, or rather customer service

1352
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,900
is also inside sales.

1353
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,860
Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

1354
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,680
And so intuitively that makes sense, you know,

1355
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,900
and definitely in the agentic world,

1356
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,850
you can stitch these things together

1357
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,000
so that the seams are not like to what they are today.

1358
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,170
Maybe what we're describing

1359
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,150
is a bunch of swim lanes have been established

1360
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,420
by random accidents of software and org charts

1361
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,470
and everything like that.

1362
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,840
You do customer service, when people come with a query

1363
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,510
is of a non-commercial nature, you are an SDR.

1364
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:10,890
That's right. You know, you do whatever.

1365
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,330
And all those distinctions

1366
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,860
are probably going to get thrown away.

1367
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,530
We're talking lot about kind of the AI apps that people use

1368
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,690
and Copilot and ChatGPT and Gemini

1369
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:19,950
and all these kind of things.

1370
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:24,330
There's a debate about how much model quality matters

1371
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:27,780
and is it the case that people pick a brand and, you know,

1372
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,420
they've been drinking, you know, Coke for the longest time

1373
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,220
and even if Coke's, I mean, Coke's a bad example,

1374
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,900
because there was a revolt about the change in the formula.

1375
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,090
But, you know, even if they change the formula, you know,

1376
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,130
people, they still have a preferred brand.

1377
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,906
You know, I use o3, my wife uses GPT-5.

1378
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:42,187
I'm always horrified 'cause I'm like, you know,

1379
00:54:42,187 --> 00:54:43,870
"You deserve more intelligence than that."

1380
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,190
And, you know, you can take o3 from my cold, dead hands.

1381
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,540
Where do you stand on the debate

1382
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,010
of do people have loyalty to it?

1383
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:50,940
And there was also the revolt

1384
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:51,870
when they tried to take away

1385
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,580
4.0, was it? Yeah, that's right.

1386
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,920
And people were really attached to that model.

1387
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,270
Do people have loyalty to a model

1388
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,040
or do they have loyalty to an AI brand?

1389
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,840
And how does this affect your business strategy?

1390
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,500
I think that in the consumer products,

1391
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,570
this was the first time we saw that, right?

1392
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:11,477
When you changed models, they're not sort of uniform changes

1393
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,150
and they impact people differently, right?

1394
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,180
And personality is one such thing

1395
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,950
or style or what have you.

1396
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,290
And so it just sort of is a new dimension.

1397
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,050
So in other words, it's also an argument

1398
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:28,680
that, "Oh, wow, this is a new dimension

1399
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,380
of perhaps differentiation," right?

1400
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,610
People will, you know,

1401
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,890
it's sort of, there's the IQ side of it,

1402
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,320
there's the EQ side of it,

1403
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,780
and then there is all these style points.

1404
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,460
And maybe that's kind of one of the things

1405
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,860
that people will steer things towards.

1406
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,410
But long term, for me,

1407
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:49,470
I think you have to kind of make sure

1408
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,390
that the models are most capable

1409
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,510
for the hardest high value tasks.

1410
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:58,290
And then you continuously optimize,

1411
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,450
after you have access to that,

1412
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,640
for what the task had had is, right?

1413
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,580
So as a product builder for us,

1414
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,590
and my thing is have the model drop

1415
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,330
which is the most capable,

1416
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:13,860
but then what's in production is multiple models.

1417
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,430
And my favorite, like, new thing in GitHub for example,

1418
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,700
is auto, which is I want to keep, you know,

1419
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,830
people still obviously love sonnet whatever,

1420
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,090
they want to use it.

1421
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:27,030
But at the end of the day, I really want the model picker

1422
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,927
and it just can't be a dumb model router, right?

1423
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:33,780
It has to basically have the intelligence

1424
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,860
to know that this task deserves this kind of cogs

1425
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,777
or this type of intelligence

1426
00:56:39,777 --> 00:56:43,860
and this is my complexity of my repo or my PR task.

1427
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,950
That ultimately is where, you know,

1428
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,200
the future of agents would be, right?

1429
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,330
And so therefore you want the model,

1430
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:54,450
in fact, you want an ensemble of models

1431
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:57,090
that then, you know, you have agents

1432
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:02,070
intermediating that ensemble so that it meets your needs.

1433
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:03,720
And then you'll have preferences.

1434
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,553
Will everyone's preference

1435
00:57:04,553 --> 00:57:05,880
not just be for more intelligence?

1436
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,880
Like, I'll go into the picker and manually select o3

1437
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,310
for like, "where should I go get ice cream" query?

1438
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,290
Like I always want the most—

1439
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:14,550
That's habit, don't you think?

1440
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,710
But that is, you know— Maybe.

1441
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,060
But it's also an important considered decision.

1442
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,753
But it is true.

1443
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:23,490
I mean, like, it's very hard for any of us

1444
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,860
to take our, that's why defaults matter

1445
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,090
and we love our defaults.

1446
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:29,280
We don't love the cheese to be moved.

1447
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,053
You know, even the model selection stuff, you know,

1448
00:57:31,053 --> 00:57:32,340
it's kind of like, wow,

1449
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,743
if you now took away the model selection, you know,

1450
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,410
it's a problem and so therefore you got to be careful.

1451
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:40,650
But I do think in the long run, if I can trust,

1452
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,520
that's another one, right?

1453
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,280
Which is if I can trust something

1454
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,390
to always do something for me while it's making a selection

1455
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:50,430
that somehow is delightful,

1456
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,530
then that's when I'll hand off.

1457
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:55,080
Okay, and so you think that's what you need to get to,

1458
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,620
is me trusting that you'll pick an appropriate model?

1459
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,030
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

1460
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:02,160
And then, I mean, my mental model of Microsoft

1461
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,790
is that you just play at every part of the stack

1462
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:07,770
in that there's the, you know,

1463
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:10,260
you have Copilot, you have your stake in OpenAI,

1464
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,625
you have, well, we can get to vertical applications in AI.

1465
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,620
You have the Azure layer, you have chips, everything.

1466
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,480
I leaving out a whole bunch of stuff.

1467
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,160
Are some more important to you than others?

1468
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,390
What is the must win?

1469
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:22,770
Will you do verticals?

1470
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,420
Yeah, I mean, at some level— What's the nuance to that?

1471
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,343
Yeah, well, at the core,

1472
00:58:25,343 --> 00:58:27,120
the way I kind of conceptualize it

1473
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,680
is our infrastructure business.

1474
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,540
We have to be fantastic at building

1475
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,393
what I'll call the token factory, right?

1476
00:58:32,393 --> 00:58:35,490
This is the tokens per dollar per watt.

1477
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,130
Really being super efficient in that.

1478
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:41,520
Then I'll say we have another layer of it,

1479
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,230
which is the agent factory.

1480
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,090
And the difference between the token factory

1481
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:49,530
and the agent factory is use the tokens most efficiently

1482
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,660
to drive a business outcome,

1483
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,287
or a consumer preference outcome, which is about—

1484
00:58:54,287 --> 00:58:56,160
That's the value per token or something?

1485
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,180
Yeah, the value per token.

1486
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,480
And as evaled by sort of the specific domain

1487
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,313
that people care about.

1488
00:59:01,313 --> 00:59:04,440
And that is, to your point, it has tooling around it.

1489
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,090
It has a whole host.

1490
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:08,160
It's kind of the new app tier

1491
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,480
or the app server, right?

1492
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,460
Every new platform has always had,

1493
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,170
there was the web and there was a web server.

1494
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:16,650
This is the AI server in some sense, or the AI cloud.

1495
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:19,590
Then we will definitely want to build our own,

1496
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:23,010
I'll call it systems of intelligence or AI systems,

1497
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,020
that is the family of Copilot, right?

1498
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,580
Whether it's for information work,

1499
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,630
that's kind of what we have done.

1500
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,730
For coding or software development,

1501
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:31,200
that's the GitHub Copilot.

1502
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,730
Security's another domain

1503
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,790
where we are absolutely going to be a primary.

1504
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,250
Those would be the three horizontal.

1505
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,563
We will also have business applications.

1506
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,470
The other one that is,

1507
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:46,410
we're doing a lot in health and science.

1508
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,170
So in health the, you know, we had bought nuance

1509
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,940
and now we have something called DAX Copilot

1510
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,940
and this is the notetaking diarization

1511
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,960
for physicians, right.

1512
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,960
So the ability to be able to have a doctor

1513
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,820
spend more time with their patients

1514
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,680
and then the AI do everything else

1515
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,620
in terms of everything from coding to taking the notes.

1516
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,690
So that's one place we are, you know,

1517
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,000
have a great close partnership with Epic.

1518
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,530
It's embedded part of Epic.

1519
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:12,390
So that's kind of what we are doing in health.

1520
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:16,470
And then we are also doing stuff in Copilot

1521
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:18,690
for consumer health that sort of docks to it.

1522
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,400
But the other one is science.

1523
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,030
And the science, it turns out it's a big domain

1524
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:27,120
for what I'll call the outer loop orchestration, right?

1525
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,630
Which is the scientific method in some sense

1526
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:33,810
requires you to create the hypothesis,

1527
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:38,810
then run these multiple experiments in silico,

1528
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,620
come back, refine and so on.

1529
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:43,140
So that to me is another tool chain.

1530
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,620
It's kind of like we're trying to discover some combination

1531
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:49,420
of the GitHub Copilot meets

1532
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,820
Microsoft 365 Knowledge work,

1533
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,010
if you will, for the scientist

1534
01:00:56,010 --> 01:01:00,510
where they have the authoritative sources of knowledge.

1535
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:02,700
They have even the interfaces tools used

1536
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,800
could even be, hey, the MCP server

1537
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,960
for the wet labs, so to speak.

1538
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,340
Can I interface with it?

1539
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,680
And then how do you orchestrate all of this

1540
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,170
such that the scientific loop can go faster.

1541
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:18,090
As a platform company, you always have decisions

1542
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:22,290
around when should you try and bundle products together,

1543
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:23,550
when should you try and staple them

1544
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:27,514
and mandate they be used together and when should you not.

1545
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:28,590
And, you know, I think the classic example

1546
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:31,770
for some reason that everyone talks about,

1547
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:32,910
despite it being quite minor,

1548
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:36,390
is the fact that Apple originally

1549
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:39,510
only let you use an iPod with a Mac

1550
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,310
and try to use it to drive Mac sales

1551
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,540
and then gave up and, you know,

1552
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,440
shipped iTunes for Windows.

1553
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,240
And my understanding reading the "Apple in China" book

1554
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,740
is it was like a totally random decision

1555
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,600
that someone just made it, you know, one day.

1556
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,910
But it's often held up as one of these examples.

1557
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,980
Obviously Microsoft, the entire history

1558
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,720
is full of these interesting examples.

1559
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,670
I don't think people realize how open Microsoft was

1560
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:03,420
in the early days where in 1985

1561
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,380
most of Microsoft's revenue was from Macintosh applications.

1562
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,350
And then for the Microsoft operating systems,

1563
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:12,990
most of the applications were third party, you know,

1564
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,870
like Lotus 1-2-3 and things like this.

1565
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,380
And so it was like a fully open strategy.

1566
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:20,400
And then you had the Windows era of the tight coupling

1567
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,250
between Office and Windows

1568
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:25,680
and those kind of mutually reinforcing each other.

1569
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,750
Then early on, I get the sense

1570
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,730
Azure and Cloud was, you know,

1571
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,440
oh, it's a place you can run your SQL server.

1572
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,970
And then fully embracing Linux later on

1573
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:33,990
and things like that.

1574
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,180
I'm curious just to, 'cause again,

1575
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,160
we think about this as a platform company

1576
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,650
and we've been of late embracing much more modularity

1577
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,000
where Stripe Radar, you can use it

1578
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,350
even if you're not using Stripe for payments

1579
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:44,220
and things like that.

1580
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,370
How do you in general think about your framework

1581
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:49,590
for when products should be coupled

1582
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,420
versus when you sell them independently?

1583
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,860
That's a great point. And then, I have

1584
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,527
AI specific versions of that question.

1585
01:02:54,527 --> 01:02:57,473
So the way I reason about it is,

1586
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,940
I think we overstate many times

1587
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:05,100
how many of these battles are quote, unquote, "zero sum."

1588
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,130
So at some level, one of the pieces of analysis

1589
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,820
that I think that you want us to be sharp at is,

1590
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,100
what are by definition going to be multiplayer.

1591
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,140
Like Cloud is a classic example, right?

1592
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,450
Which is, I remember even back in the day

1593
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:19,980
when I got started, and obviously

1594
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,440
Azure got started much later than AWS,

1595
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,440
people would tell me, "Oh, God, isn't AWS so far ahead?"

1596
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,390
Whereas is there a room for a second Cloud?

1597
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:29,700
And having competed against Oracle and IBM

1598
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,610
on all the middle tier servers and so on,

1599
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,740
I felt like, no, this enterprise customer

1600
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,630
and commercial customers by and large

1601
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,423
are going to demand sort of a multiple.

1602
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:44,070
And so that was the structural understanding

1603
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,150
that drove us to even just be at it.

1604
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,420
And the rest is history.

1605
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,710
So a little bit of, to me, if you over package things,

1606
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,683
you might in fact sort of reduce your TAM,

1607
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,560
and not compete.

1608
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,120
Like for example, if we built Azure,

1609
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,620
in fact Azure's, you know,

1610
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,540
we just called Windows Azure, right?

1611
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,620
Oh, well, that's a problem.

1612
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,110
Because Azure makes no sense just for Windows.

1613
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,420
It's sort of got to support Linux as first class.

1614
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:13,167
It's got to support MySQL and Postgres as first class.

1615
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:16,830
And so that's what sort of allowed us to make sure

1616
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,960
that you have to actually

1617
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,790
have to do a great job with SQL Server.

1618
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:24,270
But you got to do as bang of a job as like, you know,

1619
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:26,217
Amazon would do with Postgres or MySQL.

1620
01:04:26,217 --> 01:04:30,090
And so it was driven primarily by, hey, that's the TAM.

1621
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:31,740
That's what customers expect us.

1622
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,570
And we are going to have tough competition.

1623
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,790
But, so to me that's kind of

1624
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,100
how I define my modularity, right?

1625
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,000
What's the thing

1626
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
that maximizes my stack's market opportunity,

1627
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,440
then yes, we are a firm,

1628
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,200
and the reason we we're not a conglomerate.

1629
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,120
And so therefore there should be a theory

1630
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,730
of some integration benefits

1631
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,860
and platform effects.

1632
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,447
And so therefore, what is that

1633
01:04:57,447 --> 01:04:59,250
and how do we do a great job of it?

1634
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,990
But each layer of the stack,

1635
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:03,690
right, even in, let's say in Azure, the token factory,

1636
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:04,770
somebody should be able to come

1637
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,030
and say, "I just want to use Azure

1638
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,890
for its bare metal services.

1639
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:11,190
I just need Kubernetes, you know, clustered all over,

1640
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,770
but I just need to you to do the management part

1641
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,150
and I'll bring all my software."

1642
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:17,190
No problem, we got to win that workload.

1643
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:19,950
Maybe then after that we'll at least have a shot someday

1644
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,510
when it becomes a real pain

1645
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:24,480
to manage sort of your multi-region database on your own

1646
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,000
that you'll say, "Oh, let me just use Cosmos."

1647
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,710
But it's a separate decision.

1648
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,600
But isn't there always a debate

1649
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:35,600
between if we have Linux and Azure, we'll sell more Azure.

1650
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,960
But then the Windows people say, "Yeah,

1651
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,240
but you're a hamstringing, you know, Windows server."

1652
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,700
And there are some places like you're describing

1653
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,180
where Microsoft's open, there are other places, you know,

1654
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:46,740
Microsoft Flight Simulator is not available

1655
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,930
on the PlayStation, it's available on the Xbox.

1656
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,730
And that makes sense, you know, it feels kind of natural

1657
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:51,990
to be integrated that way.

1658
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,610
I know this might be a bit of a stretch, but, you know,

1659
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,890
Teams Chat and Teams Video are not sold separately.

1660
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:57,750
They're just part of one thing, and that makes sense.

1661
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,100
It makes the bundle more compelling.

1662
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,030
And so don't you always end up in these debates

1663
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:05,610
as to does the bundling cost outweigh the bundling benefits?

1664
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:07,770
Yeah, and I think some of those, like for example,

1665
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:09,210
Teams thing is, it's a classic one,

1666
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:12,690
which is Teams was born as a product

1667
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,820
that brought those four things, like Outlook, right?

1668
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:18,690
Outlook was brought, you know, there was a PIM before,

1669
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,370
there was an email client

1670
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,230
and calendaring was separate.

1671
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:24,150
And Outlook was the first scaffolding

1672
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,130
that said, "Hey, we bring these three things

1673
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,360
to get a job done," right?

1674
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,000
So that was, and same thing with Teams, right?

1675
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,730
We brought chat and channels and video

1676
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,290
and what have you into one.

1677
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,320
So the bundling was the product to some degree, right?

1678
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,230
That was the product scaffolding.

1679
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,690
And so then of course you can then say, "Hey,

1680
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:45,000
that needs to have an open marketplace

1681
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,560
and it needs to integrate with other things,"

1682
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,430
or what have you.

1683
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:49,470
So the modularity has to be thought through

1684
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:53,970
in ways that make sense at the atomic level.

1685
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:58,050
Then you don't want to overthink about the synergies

1686
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,150
or sort of integration effects

1687
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,010
and you're not competitive, right?

1688
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,330
A classic thing would be

1689
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,880
if you built an unbelievable public cloud,

1690
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,240
except it only ran Windows workloads or SQL workloads,

1691
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,410
that'll be essentially a very small sliver of the market.

1692
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:15,480
So it was in our sort of interest

1693
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,470
and definitely in the interest

1694
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,480
of meeting the customer needs.

1695
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,540
And so being able to sort of really click in the AI stack,

1696
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,800
that's kind of how I look at it, right?

1697
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,860
We have an infra business, we have an app server business,

1698
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,570
and we have an apps business.

1699
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:28,920
It's just simplifying.

1700
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,950
I want those three things to stand

1701
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:32,783
for them

1702
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:35,640
on their own merits.

1703
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,220
We ourselves of course want to have the feedback loop

1704
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,690
across these three layers,

1705
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,130
but customers and partners will choose

1706
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,460
which door they enter through.

1707
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,200
This impression I have

1708
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,270
is that when you took over Microsoft,

1709
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:51,900
you shifted the culture from a highly bundled,

1710
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,600
you'll buy your Windows machines

1711
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,940
and they're running Microsoft Access

1712
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,950
and you know, they're a SQL server

1713
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:00,930
and everything is like neatly packaged together

1714
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:03,660
in this Microsoft life to moving towards

1715
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:06,570
more of an open and interoperable strategy.

1716
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:07,890
I think that the way I would say

1717
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:10,620
is my thing was to go back even

1718
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:14,040
to the Microsoft of the '80s perhaps, right?

1719
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,700
Because most of what happened was really in the '90s

1720
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,630
there was Microsoft.

1721
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,880
and there was pretty much nothing else.

1722
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,399
And so there was sort of a lot more

1723
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,960
of our things coming together,

1724
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,180
whether it was on the client or on the server.

1725
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,370
The '80s were like to your point, right?

1726
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:32,550
You know, we built Office on the Mac.

1727
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:33,600
Windows came later.

1728
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,029
In fact, the concept that Bill had

1729
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:39,000
when he started Microsoft was it's a software factory.

1730
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,830
I'm not in love with any one category.

1731
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,080
I'm just like going to build the best software factory

1732
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,939
and it's going to churn out whatever,

1733
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:45,779
flight sim— Interpreters.

1734
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:46,800
Flight sim, you want, you know,

1735
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,540
a basic interpreter.

1736
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,859
No problem, we have one.

1737
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,720
You want an operating system, we have one too.

1738
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,390
So in some sense that was the idea.

1739
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,910
And at what point we got into a lock

1740
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:59,939
between four or five parts of that, that became the Windows

1741
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:02,910
and Windows NT and client server and what have you.

1742
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:06,689
And so I sort of realized that when, you know, I became CEO

1743
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:09,359
and even when I was running our Cloud business,

1744
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,490
that, hey, this is a time where, you know,

1745
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:14,279
the market's going to be a lot bigger and a lot different.

1746
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,380
And we didn't, like, we didn't have the mobile platform

1747
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,590
at that time and so therefore we really needed to make sure

1748
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,620
we would stay relevant in the largest markets

1749
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,210
that we could address

1750
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:26,850
by bringing our products together in configurations

1751
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:27,930
that made sense.

1752
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,910
So it is actually a lot more less dog...

1753
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:31,080
There was not that much dog...

1754
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,700
In fact, I would say, you know,

1755
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,970
if it was not in the core DNA of the company,

1756
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,607
I don't think just because I showed up as a CEO

1757
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:41,310
and I said, "I want to do this," we would've executed well.

1758
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,710
It was in the core DNA of the company

1759
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:46,470
that we can in fact take our software to every platform.

1760
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:47,933
Yes, speaking of the core DNA of the company,

1761
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,670
there's the famous cartoon of, you know,

1762
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:53,760
Microsoft with all the guns pointing at each other.

1763
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:58,760
How much cultural tweaking did you have to do?

1764
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,540
And how do you actually do that

1765
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:04,830
when you get down to brass tacks?

1766
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:05,820
'Cause you can see all the nice things,

1767
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,290
the all hands and things like that,

1768
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,213
but ultimately culture comes down to

1769
01:10:09,213 --> 01:10:10,620
what you will and won't tolerate

1770
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,450
and how decisions are made and things like that.

1771
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:13,890
Yeah, I mean, I'd say there are two things

1772
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,810
that I learned from that entire episode

1773
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:16,740
because I always say, look,

1774
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,330
I'm a consummate insider, right?

1775
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:19,310
Anything good and bad about Microsoft

1776
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,300
of the last 35 years,

1777
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,670
I lived through them all and I'm part of it, right?

1778
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:25,740
So I can't deny any of it.

1779
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:29,460
The thing that I felt was, a little bit of that

1780
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,540
was just we lost our own belief

1781
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,280
because we lost the narrative.

1782
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,210
That cartoon is a great example of someone else

1783
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:43,030
defining what became the cultural narrative

1784
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:46,410
more so than reality, right?

1785
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,210
The people started to identify with the cartoon.

1786
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,320
That's right, I mean, that's kind of one of the...

1787
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,090
I think that one of the fundamental issues

1788
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:53,820
of today's social media and the zeitgeist

1789
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:56,490
is you can absolutely lose narrative.

1790
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:57,630
It's reflexive Yeah,

1791
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,310
it's completely reflexive.

1792
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:01,500
Like, so one of the interesting things is,

1793
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,900
of course all of these things have signal, right?

1794
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,350
So this doesn't mean, oh, wow, we were all perfect divisions

1795
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:09,660
and we were all sort of, you know, in greater harmony.

1796
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:10,950
That is not the case.

1797
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:11,970
But you know, in some sense,

1798
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,640
some of these divisional tensions are real issues

1799
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,907
that need to have tension, right?

1800
01:11:15,907 --> 01:11:17,640
You can't have...

1801
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,553
Like, social cohesion is not a goal,

1802
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:24,720
Winning in the marketplace is a goal,

1803
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,140
but at some level you have to orchestrate

1804
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,790
these large organizations.

1805
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:32,700
In fact, you may even have two competing teams

1806
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,230
by design.

1807
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:36,120
And just because somebody sort of said, "Hey,

1808
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,290
I'm going to read the New Yorker

1809
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:38,460
and there's going to be a cartoon,"

1810
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,890
like, that's the type of stuff

1811
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:42,720
that I think leaders,

1812
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,180
and how to communicate in today's world

1813
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,930
where your employees read about you outside

1814
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,730
and form opinions about you

1815
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:53,613
is one of the toughest leadership challenges, I think.

1816
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,420
Which is how do you earn the trust?

1817
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,340
How do you really make sure

1818
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:04,290
that they can in fact feel the reality, shape the reality?

1819
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:07,860
Like the other thing is everybody thinks it's the system.

1820
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,220
It's that guy at the top or, you know, my VP

1821
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,770
and they have all the power and I have none.

1822
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,530
The reality is the power is a lot more diffused

1823
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:19,350
and distributed and so therefore

1824
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,860
how do you really help people

1825
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:26,640
especially get hold of that and reshape.

1826
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,200
Like, you know, one of the other famous things

1827
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,270
people say is, "Hey, I never leave companies,

1828
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:31,740
I leave managers."

1829
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,990
And, you know, I believe that, right?

1830
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:38,820
And so it's kind of micro cultures and they can be shaped.

1831
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,490
In fact, when I look back at my Microsoft career,

1832
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,980
I was lucky to fall into these people

1833
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,350
who created these unbelievable environments

1834
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,337
in the company, right?

1835
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:48,840
And that's kind of why I stayed

1836
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,370
and that's how I thrived.

1837
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:52,950
And so to some degree, you know,

1838
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:55,800
I feel that the more culture...

1839
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,290
You need at the top, a narrative

1840
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,898
that you have to live and be consistent, right?

1841
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:02,550
So that's where this growth mindset

1842
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,220
or learn-it-all versus know-it-all

1843
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:08,400
has been super helpful for us as just a frame

1844
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,950
because nobody thinks of it as my dogma, right?

1845
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,510
Thank God it's not, you know,

1846
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,600
it's a well understood child psychology thing

1847
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,320
that appeals to people outside of work.

1848
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,890
And so cracking something like that and then living it,

1849
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,230
but also somehow I would say the challenge

1850
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,120
for all of us in today's world is,

1851
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:31,200
let the social media memes not define us.

1852
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,670
What's that inner strength that is there in an organization

1853
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:39,123
that can in fact resist the social meme?

1854
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,250
That I think is the key.

1855
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,630
How many people is Microsoft?

1856
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:43,860
I think around 200,000.

1857
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,540
Okay, so rough number is, you know,

1858
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:50,520
Microsoft is 200,000 people, Stripe is 10,000 people.

1859
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,350
Maybe there's someone who's listening to this

1860
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:55,170
who runs a company that's 500 people or something like that.

1861
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:57,150
A lot of the things that we do

1862
01:13:57,150 --> 01:14:00,090
are probably fairly scale independent

1863
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,320
where you're trying to make sure

1864
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,640
that you're talking to customers,

1865
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,230
you're holding a leadership offsite.

1866
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:05,970
We're looking at the numbers for '26.

1867
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:07,140
We want the revenues to be a bit higher

1868
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,220
and the cost to be a bit lower.

1869
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,170
You know, there's a lot of activities in companies

1870
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:14,310
that are kind of the same regardless of the size.

1871
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,170
That said, there's also probably things

1872
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:20,700
that only show up at the, you know, 200,000 person,

1873
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:25,260
you know, city state size

1874
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,460
that, you know, I wouldn't be aware of

1875
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,590
at the 10,000 person size.

1876
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:31,740
What effects only show up when you're that big?

1877
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,663
There are two things I would say.

1878
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:37,470
Quite honestly, having only worked at Microsoft,

1879
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:39,150
it's not that I'm like an expert.

1880
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:42,603
But the one thing I would say, taking over for a founder,

1881
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:46,470
you know, Steve and Bill built the company,

1882
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:48,600
I mean, Paul and Bill started

1883
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,640
and Steve and Bill scaled it

1884
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,357
and I was the sort of the first, quote unquote,

1885
01:14:52,357 --> 01:14:54,870
"non-founder person."

1886
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:58,440
The thing I realized quickly, or in fact I got into the job

1887
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,203
and I realized that I need a team.

1888
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:06,813
And just to have the ability to manage the scope.

1889
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,643
But then, you know, that A.G. Lafley thing

1890
01:15:11,643 --> 01:15:13,800
that we put out there, which I think is a great one.

1891
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,290
Like what is this, being clear about

1892
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:19,470
what does the CEO clearly need to do though in that, right?

1893
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:20,610
Which businesses are you in?

1894
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:24,060
Which businesses are you out synthesizing the outside,

1895
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,990
having the standards, setting the standards for culture,

1896
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,760
and then the ability to your point

1897
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,770
about having that performance culture

1898
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:34,140
that you can't say, "Hey, I'm only about the long term,

1899
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,430
or I'm only about the short term."

1900
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,783
You've got to deliver both.

1901
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:41,790
Getting a real grip of the four or five things

1902
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,890
that only you can do.

1903
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:46,953
And then building the team, building the team.

1904
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:50,760
You'd say, "Even at a 500 person, that's what you do."

1905
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,600
But quite frankly,

1906
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,430
you can keep in your working memory, right,

1907
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:54,690
growing up as a developer, right?

1908
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,550
There was a set of things everybody would talk about.

1909
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:00,030
How many lines of code do you know, right, personally?

1910
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:02,490
At some point you sort of say, "Oh, that's the person

1911
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:05,100
who knows that module or that library."

1912
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,750
That becomes more, like,

1913
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:09,750
and everybody starts where they know every line of code.

1914
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:12,060
At some level then you have to get to the person

1915
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,060
who knows, "Oh, I know the person who wrote that."

1916
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,630
And I think that that modularity

1917
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:19,710
and team building

1918
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,500
and the cohesiveness is, I think they most important.

1919
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,950
So am I understanding you correctly

1920
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:25,110
that maybe at the Stripe scale

1921
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:26,610
or at a smaller scale,

1922
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:28,527
you can still reason about the product as a product

1923
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:30,450
and know everything

1924
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:31,636
that you're shipping and everything like that—

1925
01:16:31,636 --> 01:16:33,180
But I also think founders are unique in that sense.

1926
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:36,750
because the founders are, you know,

1927
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,850
that's kind of what is singular about them, right?

1928
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:42,930
Because they've grown up with it from day one.

1929
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:44,760
See, it's kind of hard

1930
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,550
to take the working memory of a founder

1931
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:50,877
and say, "Oh, let me take it and imprint it."

1932
01:16:52,427 --> 01:16:54,510
Sort of a professional CEO.

1933
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:55,660
It just doesn't work

1934
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:57,532
because the...

1935
01:16:57,532 --> 01:16:58,365
You know, even for me,

1936
01:16:58,365 --> 01:17:00,570
I joined the company in '92,

1937
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:04,110
I was not there in the early '80s, right, you know?

1938
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:07,630
And so to some degree it was a continuous scale

1939
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,760
that only the, quote unquote, "the founder, CEO"

1940
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,050
or the founders see it.

1941
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:15,510
And so that's why I think having respect

1942
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:17,880
for what founders can do uniquely

1943
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,720
and founders having respect for whoever comes next,

1944
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,510
that they can't be like we're doing exactly

1945
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:26,090
the same thing that they did, right?

1946
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:27,810
So that's why I think this founder mode thing

1947
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,870
is interesting, which is that clearly there is, you know,

1948
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:33,147
the culture personality of a founder is unbelievable, right?

1949
01:17:33,147 --> 01:17:35,730
And you use it, maximize it.

1950
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:38,100
Then mere mortal CEOs like us

1951
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,050
have to sort of also be, you know,

1952
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:42,210
you can sort of be in the refounder mode

1953
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:44,070
but don't think you are a founder.

1954
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:47,970
And that nuance I think is an important one.

1955
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:51,063
Last question, because we're running up against time,

1956
01:17:52,683 --> 01:17:56,850
as we talk about cultures and building them,

1957
01:17:56,850 --> 01:18:00,690
what's going on in the water in Hyderabad where, you know,

1958
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:02,013
the school that you went,

1959
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:07,500
also Shantanu went there, Ajay Banga went there.

1960
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:11,430
A bunch of good chess players are similarly from there

1961
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:13,887
and southern India more broadly and things like that.

1962
01:18:13,887 --> 01:18:17,760
But do you have any theory on the local outperformance?

1963
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,780
Yeah, the high school we went to in fact, yeah.

1964
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,270
Until I would say NVIDIA and Jensen,

1965
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:28,560
because Jensen has it now covered for all of us.

1966
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,950
Yeah, between me and Ajay and Shantanu.

1967
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,680
In fact the CEO of Procter & Gamble today

1968
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,970
is also from my high school.

1969
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:37,173
See, it's cabal.

1970
01:18:37,173 --> 01:18:38,793
It's kind of a cabal.

1971
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:41,970
I would say one of the fascinating things

1972
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:44,430
growing up in Hyderabad and going to that school

1973
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:46,740
in the middle of nowhere at that time in the late '70s

1974
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,690
and the early '80s, I would say,

1975
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,720
I think it gave us a lot more space.

1976
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,240
If you look at even each of us, right?

1977
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,380
Academics was a thing,

1978
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,660
but quite frankly, we, mostly all of us

1979
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,730
had things which we excelled at

1980
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:02,280
a lot of other things beyond academics in fact.

1981
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:06,663
That was a pretty rare thing at that time in that country.

1982
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,220
And so I attribute it a lot to my high school

1983
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:13,020
because I feel that it is a place

1984
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:17,560
where it gave us a lot more space and room

1985
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:23,070
to follow what really became your passion.

1986
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:25,667
But you were able to take your time to discover it

1987
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:27,780
versus sort of feeling that, "Hey,

1988
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,850
I had to join some kind of a race."

1989
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,380
It wasn't as tracked. That's right.

1990
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,213
Yeah. That's right.

1991
01:19:32,213 --> 01:19:33,600
What was your passion in high school?

1992
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,433
Cricket.

1993
01:19:34,433 --> 01:19:36,930
In fact, this, by the way, the Samuel Beckett.

1994
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:38,447
Yeah, so I want to know the story.

1995
01:19:38,447 --> 01:19:39,580
Sure, you know who...

1996
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,190
So if you asked the question,

1997
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,900
who is the one sports person

1998
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,120
who played actually professionally?

1999
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,160
I guess he played one or two matches

2000
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,710
for I guess the Dublin University

2001
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:51,480
and he played first class cricket.

2002
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:54,960
And so he's the only person who played professional cricket

2003
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,970
and won a Nobel Prize.

2004
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:57,803
Really?

2005
01:19:57,803 --> 01:19:59,190
That's really funny.

2006
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:00,424
So you can have it all is the—

2007
01:20:00,424 --> 01:20:01,257
There you go.

2008
01:20:01,257 --> 01:20:03,923
The chess, boxing of its day or something, you know,

2009
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:05,603
merging the— A Nobel Prize winner

2010
01:20:05,603 --> 01:20:07,170
and he's a professional cricketer.

2011
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,003
That's awesome.

2012
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:11,340
Well, you know, you, you came close

2013
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:14,370
but in another life, you know, that could have been you.

2014
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:15,242
Alright. Thank you so much.

2015
01:20:15,242 --> 01:20:18,492
Thanks, Satya. It's such a pleasure.
