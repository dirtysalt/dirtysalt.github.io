1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,001
Do you mind if I start with a couple of questions?

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:05,005
I mean, sure.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,589
Cheeky means what exactly?

4
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,300
Okay, in the context of a cheeky pint,

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,302
it is a pint you're not really meant to be having.

6
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,929
And when it becomes established,

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,514
it starts to attract establishment people.

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,140
The Social Network problem. Right. Exactly.

9
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,934
And in that sense, the downturns

10
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,561
as much of a pain in the butt as they are,

11
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,687
are probably helpful. Are good, because

12
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,856
you go back to banking, you go back to consulting.

13
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,690
Yes. I'm sorry, why is there

14
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,733
more of a risk-taking on the West Coast

15
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,859
versus the East Coast, because like...?

16
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,736
Ah, the fontier.

17
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,238
because FOMO leads to high trust.

18
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,198
That has a cynical truth to it.

19
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,409
Category-two errors are much, much worse.

20
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,494
By the way, they torture you for fucking decades,

21
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,912
because you read about

22
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,290
the success cases that you've screwed up all the way up,

23
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,167
and so, you just learn the hard way,

24
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,044
you have to be extremely open-minded.

25
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,378
I have found people willing to tolerate

26
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,213
any level of chronic pain in order

27
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,674
to avoid acute pain. Avoid acute pain.

28
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,594
People would much rather lose slowly over five years

29
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,720
than have the conversation

30
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,847
that involves a dramatic change to stop losing.

31
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:56,973
All right, there we go. Ha.

32
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,224
All right, very good.

33
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,350
Anyone need anything else?

34
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,186
Finally, a legitimately Irish bartender.

35
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,813
I have a scheduling issue with these,

36
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,525
because 5:00 pm clearly after-work pints, acceptable.

37
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,611
4:00 pm, I don't know, after work,

38
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,071
if you're a banker or whatever.

39
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,655
3:30 pm, like now you're just drinking

40
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,948
at the office, you know?

41
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,408
Marc Andreessen has been around the internet

42
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,618
since the very beginning, really.

43
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,620
He co-founded Netscape. He invented the image tag.

44
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,038
He was there at the beginning,

45
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,332
and later, he co-founded the venture capital giant

46
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,501
Andreessen Horowitz, so I'll be speaking to him,

47
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,711
along with our mutual friend Charlie Songhurst.

48
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,837
Cheers. Cheers.

49
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,838
Good to see you guys.

50
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,093
Do you mind if I start with a couple of questions?

51
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,136
I mean, sure.

52
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,847
Well, there's just a couple of things.

53
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,307
As a Midwestern-American boy,

54
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,391
there's just a couple of things that,

55
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,018
this is not my natural habitat.

56
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,937
Okay. Cheeky means what exactly?

57
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,313
Okay, in the

58
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,523
context of a cheeky pint,

59
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,568
it is a pint you're not really meant to be having,

60
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,529
and so, if you were meant

61
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,447
to be going home right after work,

62
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,827
and instead you stole away with a few coworkers,

63
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,163
just off the books, aren't meant to be at the pub right now,

64
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:02,997
that would be a cheeky pint.

65
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,875
And then the thing about pint that's just really puzzling

66
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,169
is that everything else in Europe is like,

67
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:10,797
it should be the cheeky deciliter.

68
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,881
I see. Right?

69
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,634
And so, why is pint used with reference to alcohol,

70
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,886
but not with actual measurement?

71
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:21,057
Because, Guinness and alcohol generally,

72
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,767
is part of a rich tradition.

73
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,227
Guinness dates from the 1700s.

74
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,564
It's the reason we have the canal system in Ireland.

75
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,400
It was the largest company in Ireland at one point.

76
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,779
Often, the longest-tenured institutions

77
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,407
are universities and breweries,

78
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,117
and you look at the Belgians and things like that,

79
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,579
and so, I think tradition survives better in alcohol

80
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,872
than it does in real sense.

81
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,956
Okay, I have several more questions,

82
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,749
but I will suspend them for the

83
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,001
purpose of this conversation.

84
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,002
Okay, I like this new format

85
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,836
that we're inventing.

86
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,463
So, where I want to start is we have here

87
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,383
various bits of Marc Andreessen memorabilia

88
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,635
and a still from one of my favorite pieces

89
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,304
of Marc Andreessen content,

90
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,263
your Miller Lite commercial.

91
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,098
Oh, that was so much fun. And it was only in a rewatch

92
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,225
that I realized it was with Norm McDonald.

93
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,059
Norm McDonald.

94
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,977
What was it like meeting him?

95
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,020
The one and only.

96
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,313
My experience, comedians are always

97
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,397
a little bit interesting to meet,

98
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,566
because they're professionally funny,

99
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,901
and so, they're interested in being

100
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,195
interpersonally funny is not that high.

101
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,654
Oh. Ah.

102
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,364
Yeah, yeah. because it's a lot of stress

103
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,324
and pressure, I think.

104
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,116
I see. I mean,

105
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,284
he was very naturally funny.

106
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,118
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,536
But— But he wasn't always on.

108
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,370
He was not always on,

109
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,830
and I will tell you in context,

110
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,415
you will see in the commercial, I just say in context

111
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,792
it looks like we were in the coolest nightclub in the world.

112
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,045
I will tell you it was in the middle of the day

113
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:37,008
in what they call the Inland Empire in LA in some warehouse,

114
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,177
and was— It was not as cool

115
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,720
as it looks. It was like

116
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,015
110 degrees outside, it was like 130 degrees inside,

117
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,058
there was no air conditioning,

118
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,976
because it would screw up the sound,

119
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,812
and then to create the smoky-nightclub effect,

120
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,856
they spray vegetable oil.

121
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,690
Ooh.

122
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,317
Not water, vegetable oil. Not water, vegetable oil,

123
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,985
because it has to—

124
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,403
Oh, it has to actually create a—

125
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,238
It has to linger. Yeah.

126
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,072
It has to linger.

127
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,907
The director was great, and he was tremendously tolerant

128
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,243
of me with no actual experience doing anything like that,

129
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,077
but I think he did think

130
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,954
he was Stanley Kubrick,

131
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,665
because we did like 150 takes.

132
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,499
He was really into his Miller Lite ad.

133
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,626
Yeah, and so, like hour six

134
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,378
of nearly passing out from the heat

135
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,213
and choking on vegetable oil was not—

136
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,130
I see. The most...

137
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,218
Oh, and then the other kind great claim to fame is,

138
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,012
it was a week later, Miller fired their ad agency,

139
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,556
which I would like

140
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,849
to think that I—

141
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,684
Was causal.

142
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,644
I bear some responsibility for

143
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,979
having no acting ability, yes.

144
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,525
Okay, so, the thing I want to get into you guys about,

145
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,486
or spend a lot of time on, is the history of the valley.

146
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,863
One interesting place to start might be

147
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,365
can you tell when you're in a bubble?

148
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,617
So, my experience is no,

149
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,037
and the nuance that I would put on that,

150
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,247
I'll describe two reasons.

151
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,873
Number one is there's an old line

152
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,791
with respect to economists,

153
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,127
that also applies, I think, to investors and entrepreneurs,

154
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,336
which is economists have predicted

155
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,171
nine of the last two bubbles,

156
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,840
or nine of the last two crashes,

157
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,009
and so, it is extremely common.

158
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,968
It's a difficult question,

159
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,802
because it's extremely common for people

160
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,429
to call it a bubble.

161
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,015
When they're correct, they will then go around for years

162
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,182
claiming that they're the one who called it.

163
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,476
What you find with those people generally,

164
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,686
is they were calling it continuously

165
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,479
for the 20 years earlier.

166
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,523
Peter Singer. Peter, for example,

167
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,277
or earlier, there's a famous Barron's.

168
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,486
Barron's it's still around,

169
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,448
but it used to be extremely important investing publication.

170
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,450
There was a columnist for Barron's,

171
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,826
something Abelson, Alan Abelson,

172
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,038
and literally, he wrote the same column for 40 years.

173
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,956
"The end is here." "It's all going to crash."

174
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:32,915
"It's all a giant bubble,"

175
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,792
and he wrote that, I think continuously,

176
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,586
from, I forget the exact years,

177
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,839
but from like 1975 to like 2015,

178
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,343
and so, you have this kind of Cassandra thing,

179
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,677
where they kind of dine out on it,

180
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,096
and so, I find generally, that those kinds of people

181
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,097
don't have predictive ability.

182
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,725
And then I will tell you, look, the most sophisticated

183
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,185
hedge fund managers in the world, generally,

184
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,103
if you look in their backgrounds, at some point,

185
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,606
if they thought they were in the macro business,

186
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,399
they will have tried to make the trade

187
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,276
based on what they view as obviously, a bubble,

188
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,070
and there were extremely sophisticated

189
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,987
hedge fund investors.

190
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,697
They went short tech stocks in the fall of '99

191
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,199
and then realized they were wrong

192
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,242
and then went long tech stocks in Q1 of 2000.

193
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,620
Druck has talked about it publicly.

194
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,913
He's talked about it, but there are many others.

195
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,082
Well, there's another guy who I won't name,

196
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,500
who's very active today, who's very smart,

197
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,126
and I was talking to him on the phone about stuff,

198
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,544
and he just started laughing

199
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,588
and he said, he's like, "All I know is whenever I think

200
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,923
the stock market's going to go up, it goes down

201
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,757
and vice versa."

202
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,343
And this is a guy who's an investing legend.

203
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,177
It's something— Was it obvious

204
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,346
when the bubbles started to burst?

205
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,847
When was it obvious, in retrospect,

206
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,099
that that was a bubble? No. No, no, no, no.

207
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,351
So the— So, is it 2000, 2001?

208
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,437
Is it only 2004 when you look back? When does...?

209
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,232
No, so the sort of cliche, which is correct,

210
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,025
is the market climbs a wall of worry, right?

211
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,237
So, what happens is, when the market is rising,

212
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,197
every step of the way, there's some panic attack

213
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,784
going on about it's immediately going to collapse,

214
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,411
and then what happens is there are drawdowns-

215
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,829
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm sure you guys have seen.

216
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,580
The drawdown charts are really

217
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,456
fascinating to see. Yeah.

218
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,874
because you— There's a big one in 1998

219
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,750
with the Asian crisis.

220
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,168
So, we all thought that was it.

221
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,378
This is exactly where I was headed,

222
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,088
so yes, there was a blow up in '98,

223
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,215
there was a international crisis,

224
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,716
and then there was a collapse

225
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,218
of a big hedge fund at the time called—

226
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,678
LTCM. Yeah Long-Term

227
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,887
Capital Management. I read that book recently.

228
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,222
It was really good. It's a fantastic book.

229
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,056
Yeah.

230
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,476
It's a great lesson in

231
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,562
do not name your hedge fund long term.

232
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,522
I thought the lesson was don't run 30-times leverage

233
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,356
on the one trade.

234
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,190
Oh, there is that,

235
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,318
and also assume that academic superstars

236
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,445
necessarily have a feel.

237
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,654
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

238
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,199
But yeah, that was it, that's it for IPOs,

239
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,743
it's over, that's it, the whole thing is going to cave in.

240
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,578
So, every step of the way,

241
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,663
and then conversely, we all got so used to it rising

242
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,040
that there was a lot of speculation.

243
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,876
I would say the median view among smart people,

244
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,544
and when the Nasdaq first cracked

245
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,671
in around March of 2000,

246
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,465
was, oh, it's just another one of these momentary blips,

247
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,340
and then the way I remember it,

248
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,175
we'd have to look at the chart,

249
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,468
but the way I remember it is, fundamentally,

250
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,345
that from 2000 to 2005, there were five discrete moments

251
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,472
where it fell apart.

252
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,140
It kept cascading down,

253
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,683
and my favorite version of the story is

254
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,644
we took our company LoudCloud public in September of 2000,

255
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,229
and while we were on the road,

256
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,189
we were on the road for three weeks,

257
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,106
and while we were on the road,

258
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,566
the Nasdaq fell in half,

259
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,526
but that was just one of those things,

260
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,654
and so, the answer to your question is,

261
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,240
I'll put it this way, by 2003, 2004,

262
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,242
you knew that it was really bad,

263
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,495
and then what are the indicators?

264
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,538
The indicator that everybody really knows it,

265
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,915
is the longs all get fired.

266
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,083
Yep. They lose their money

267
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,544
and then the PMs actually get terminated,

268
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,505
and until that happens, there's still, I would say,

269
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,508
tremendous amounts of either uncertainty

270
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,509
or you could say, denial.

271
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,552
One of the great years for owning internet stocks

272
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,804
was 2003, because you get the bottom

273
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,765
and then you get this huge uplift, I think in eBay,

274
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,933
Yahoo, maybe it's 2004. Sure.

275
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:38,768
But VC wasn't good through that entire period, up until

276
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,602
like '07.

277
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,483
Why is it that public markets is good in '03 and '04,

278
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,277
but VC just has almost like a lost seven years

279
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,571
ex Google between 2000 and 2007?

280
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,698
You could maybe say this,

281
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,033
you could say the entrepreneurial ecosystem

282
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,493
got completely flattened.

283
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,078
Got it.

284
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,997
By '03, '04, the idea of starting a company was ludicrous.

285
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:00,873
Got it.

286
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,333
And so— So, it maybe created

287
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,876
too much fear in potential entrepreneurs.

288
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,710
Yeah, that's right.

289
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,588
And then, look, the VCs panic.

290
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,258
They say that's one of the cardinal sins

291
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,259
you can get into in venture is

292
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,093
you're actually paying attention

293
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,010
to what they're saying on TV.

294
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,262
Yeah. And particularly,

295
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,221
on the financial news,

296
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,931
and so, if the Nasdaq cracks,

297
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,101
it's very hard to keep yourself out of that psychology

298
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,894
and to be enthusiastic about make an investment,

299
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,480
but of course, the rational thing to do if you're a VC

300
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,356
is to keep...

301
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,149
So, Fred Wilson's the guy who kind of really

302
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:27,984
walked me through this originally,

303
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,360
and his version of this would be,

304
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,320
yeah, bubbles bust, it's all random and crazy

305
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,822
and we never know what's going on in the whole thing,

306
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,990
and you get wrapped up in the psychology,

307
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,075
and so, his rule of thumb always was

308
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,327
you have a disciplined mechanical process

309
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,161
for the pace of investment

310
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,373
and then also for the pace of exits,

311
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,624
and you don't deviate from it,

312
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,835
and a lot of that justification would be precisely so

313
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,379
that you keep investing at the bottom.

314
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,256
It's so funny, you see this in the stock market,

315
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:55,261
everybody says, "Oh, buy low, sell high."

316
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,013
Everybody's an expert in bubbles.

317
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,764
Everybody's read the books, the whole thing,

318
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,768
but when the market has caved in,

319
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,146
it is just, well, it's actually really funny,

320
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,106
because it's negativity.

321
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,192
It's just overwhelmingly, "You people are idiots,"

322
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,569
like, "This whole thing is stupid,"

323
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,695
"It's never going to recover."

324
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,822
There's 18 macro explanations for it not to recover,

325
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,282
and then actually, at the real bottom,

326
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,116
the other thing I found

327
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,451
is people just completely stop talking about it.

328
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,077
Yes.

329
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,621
The idea of startups—

330
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,247
Crypto markets are a case study in

331
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,165
over the three cycles. It's just like

332
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,416
it never even existed.

333
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,835
It's the thing you would never bring up at a dinner party,

334
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,961
and maybe to your point, that's what happened

335
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,297
with the internet startups in 2003, 2004,

336
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,132
which is, you would not talk about it,

337
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,050
if you could possibly avoid it.

338
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,802
So, in some ways, the social status of internet startups

339
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,764
in '03 is similar to crypto in 2020.

340
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,808
Yeah, so, the great joke of that time

341
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:47,063
was, the two great VC trends, startup trends,

342
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,440
of the late 90s were so-called internet companies,

343
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,733
but B2C— Yeah.

344
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,777
Business to consumer, and then B2B, business to business,

345
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,696
by 2003, the line was B2B meant back to banking,

346
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,530
and B2C meant

347
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,574
back to consulting, and so, oh, and then,

348
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,744
this in turn is why, you'll enjoy this a great deal,

349
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,539
this in turn is why the employment decisions

350
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,125
of graduating Harvard and Stanford Business School students

351
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,293
are such a great indicator.

352
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,461
Yes. They're possibly the best

353
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,213
indicator of all, of what's happening in the market,

354
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:17,218
because if they go into tech, the market's overblown

355
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,886
and if they go into banking consulting,

356
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,221
it's a great time to make VC investments,

357
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,473
and that maybe been the best indicator

358
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,349
I've seen the whole time,

359
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,558
because of the social status aspect.

360
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,393
Yes. Right.

361
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,310
I think what you're describing is

362
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,229
you don't think you're capable of making macro calls,

363
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,023
so you just have to decide what are sensible areas

364
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,402
to be investing in over multi-decade time horizons,

365
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,697
tech startups generally, crypto, American dynamism

366
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,990
and pick your lane, and then you dollar-cost average

367
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,618
it to them, and then sometimes there'll be bubbles,

368
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,495
there'll be crypto 2021 moments,

369
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,164
but that's fine, because if you put the same dollars

370
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,166
into these areas, I mean rough numbers,

371
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,169
but consistently put dollars into these areas each year,

372
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,671
the winners will more than make up for the years

373
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,464
where everything was hopelessly undervalued.

374
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,424
Is that basically your framework?

375
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,759
I would say that's mostly true.

376
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,635
What I would modify that is

377
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,637
it's actually not dollar-cost averaging.

378
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,555
If you're doing it in the stock market,

379
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,389
it's dollar-cost averaging.

380
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,223
If you're doing it in ventures,

381
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,266
it's not dollar-cost averaging.

382
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,392
The reason is because if you make

383
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,268
the right venture investment,

384
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,561
it doesn't matter how much money you put in.

385
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,062
Yep. The upside is so great.

386
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,439
Yep. And if you make the wrong

387
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,690
venture investment, you lose all the money.

388
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,983
Well, I think-

389
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,817
But is that actually true? I think Andy Bechtolsheim's-

390
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,651
Depends how much money

391
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,736
you put in, so... Andy Bechtolsheim's 100K,

392
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,113
I think would be 30,000x.

393
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:19,947
What's that, sorry?

394
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,575
Andy Bechtolsheim's 100K. Bechtolsheim.

395
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,702
Bechtolsheim's 100k into Google would've been 30,000x—

396
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,704
Yeah. That pays for a lot

397
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,705
of other investors.

398
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,000
In venture capital, it just turns out

399
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,376
that the amount of money invested

400
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,627
has almost nothing to do with anything,

401
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,712
and you're not trying...

402
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,130
Well, here's another thing, you never in venture

403
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,131
run a bargain shop.

404
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,008
Ever, ever, ever. No, I agree with that,

405
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,926
and you— What you need to do,

406
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,470
so, I guess the way I would just modify what you said

407
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,013
is it's just you need to keep investing.

408
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:44,847
Yes. Yeah.

409
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,433
The danger is not investing too cheap or too dear.

410
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,143
The danger is literally stopping.

411
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,644
Sure, but sorry, when I was saying dollar-cost averaging,

412
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,438
it was the fixed amount of money—

413
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,314
Per year. That could deploy,

414
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,774
because I think the way people get into trouble

415
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,568
is 2021 comes along, and they raise some giant fund,

416
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,069
and that one has very poor returns,

417
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:03,240
but if you invest 100 million each year,

418
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,241
then you'll do pretty well.

419
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,660
And you could also say this, the smartest LPs,

420
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,913
so David Swensen who was considered to be the smartest

421
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,457
portfolio manager for liquid portfolios,

422
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,042
wrote a book where he goes through the following,

423
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,210
and he talked about this a lot,

424
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,545
which basically, is for something like venture,

425
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,630
you really got to look on it.

426
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,299
You cannot rationally evaluate venture

427
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,218
based on a single moment in time, a single fund,

428
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,844
a single sector, any of that stuff.

429
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,804
You have to basically, look at it

430
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,930
over a long enough period of time

431
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,974
where you wash out the specific effects of what—

432
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:33,687
Well to prove that is the inter-vintage volatility

433
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,189
in any given VC is incredible.

434
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,148
Right. That's right.

435
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,734
Which shows so much of it is just—

436
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,902
Yeah, a top VC firm— Structural time.

437
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,446
Will have some 15x funds—

438
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,280
Yeah. And some—

439
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,323
But it's incredibly stochastic

440
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,408
because Google's founded in '99,

441
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,743
so, at the height of a bubble.

442
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,371
Meta's founded 2004, at the bottom.

443
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,205
Right. That's right.

444
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,666
There's no pattern that ties to macro.

445
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,125
It appears to be almost stochastic.

446
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,002
You just can't predict. You've just got to keep doing it.

447
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,170
Yeah, that's exactly right,

448
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,380
and that's the, I would say,

449
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,006
that's the core fundamental truth of venture,

450
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,092
which is really, it's something for people

451
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,261
with a 20, 30, 40, 50-year time horizon.

452
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,514
You have to get all the way across the cycles.

453
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,932
Because what happens otherwise, if you're in LP,

454
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,016
what happens otherwise is,

455
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,352
the minute you have a fund that's terrible, you pull out,

456
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,021
and that's precisely when you should have been going in.

457
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,940
It's the same behavior on the LP side

458
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,149
that you see on the VC side,

459
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,360
and so the smart LPs, what they all have in common is

460
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,862
when they're making a decision to invest in a venture fund,

461
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,697
they're making a decision to invest in that fund for the

462
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,614
next five or six months. So how much of an advantage

463
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,992
for VC is having good LPs?

464
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,952
Extremely. Extremely, extremely, extremely.

465
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,663
And again, this is very predictable.

466
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,915
What happens is, every time the market is hot,

467
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,667
new LPs show up and pile in,

468
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,919
and then when the market declines, they back out,

469
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,422
and so the firms that have the VCs

470
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,715
who understand the Switzer model

471
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,425
are able to sustain over time,

472
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,802
and able to continue to invest in the downturn.

473
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,471
Many new VC funds are raised

474
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,141
in every bull market, from basically, tourist LPs.

475
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,769
Those tourist LPs are extremely reliably prone to pull out.

476
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,104
So obviously, that leads to the big question,

477
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,065
which is how causal are the VCs themselves

478
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,817
to the outcomes of the companies?

479
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,152
Like it's the big, big question.

480
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,196
I have an indirect theory on it,

481
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:10,910
but I'll... I definitely should not let the entrepreneur

482
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,744
answer this question, but...

483
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,329
I just made an incredible

484
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,497
strategic mistake.

485
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,124
This is where it all went south for Andreessen.

486
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,418
I mean— You can see the look

487
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,461
on his face already.

488
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:25,424
One, presumably VC itself, is very impactful

489
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,219
because Stripe was just, as a practical matter,

490
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,263
not profitable for quite a few years,

491
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,265
and I think that was the correct way to build Stripe,

492
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,143
and so, like so many companies, you build a bunch of tech

493
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,354
and Stripe in particular, you build a bunch of tech

494
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,439
and businesses start adopting it and they start growing,

495
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,107
so you've two lagged curves.

496
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,150
One is you have to build all this stuff

497
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,401
and then businesses start using it,

498
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,112
and then those businesses grow themselves,

499
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,616
and we just had Tobi from Shopify here,

500
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,577
Shopify is now a massive business on Stripe,

501
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,536
but they weren't when they started

502
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,038
working with us in 2012,

503
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,041
and so, it's just the classic R&D thing of you

504
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,210
do work now for economic payoff later,

505
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,545
and I think that tends to work well in tech.

506
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,631
And then with specific VCs,

507
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,593
I want to talk about the Silicon Valley high trust thing.

508
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,847
VCs act as a very efficient matching algorithm

509
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,101
between neophyte founders, such as myself,

510
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,103
and experienced executives,

511
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,647
and so you have this incredible talent engine,

512
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,148
and I think in a weird way,

513
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,860
it's not about the money, at some level.

514
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,447
People miss that it's about putting together a team

515
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,158
in a very short order, to go do this hard thing,

516
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,412
and I think VCs are actually pretty instrumental in that.

517
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,122
I'll back in from the angel perspective.

518
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,166
The single strongest correlation of

519
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,086
how a company will perform is

520
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,172
how high status the VC who does the Series A,

521
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,425
is, within the stack ranking of VCs.

522
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,844
It is far more predictive, sadly, than

523
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,847
my own selection or any other variable I can find.

524
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,557
It's almost deterministic. Yeah.

525
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,434
And look, some of that is because the top-tier VCs

526
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,727
can get the best deals. Exactly.

527
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,561
And some of that- Yes.

528
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,812
Is self-fulfilling prophecy,

529
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,772
so here's my analysis, having been on both sides

530
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,816
of the table, John, mapping what you said.

531
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,693
My analysis basically, is that if you think about,

532
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,653
mechanically, what's happening with a startup,

533
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,113
a startup needs to basically get into a loop

534
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,198
in which is it's accruing more and more resources

535
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,368
as it goes, and those resources are qualified executives,

536
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:20,748
technical employees, future-downstream financing,

537
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,084
positive brand momentum, public perception,

538
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,503
customers, revenue, throw weight in the government.

539
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:28,839
All of these resources that you need

540
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,632
to be able to succeed as a business,

541
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,094
and so, there's a snowball-rolling-down-the-hill phenomenon,

542
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,180
which is you're either a snowball rolling down the hill,

543
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,724
picking up resources as you go, gaining size, and scale,

544
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,018
and scope, and power as you go, or you're not,

545
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,020
and you're stuck at the top of the hill as a snowflake

546
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,521
and you're just not going anywhere,

547
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,399
and so the question is how do you get into

548
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,443
this kind of aggregation of resources thing?

549
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,278
Economists call this, what's the term for the things

550
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,196
that are at the height of the power...

551
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,030
Preferential attachment.

552
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,864
Yeah. But it's—

553
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,990
A sort of beating of companies.

554
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,326
It's the Matthew principle

555
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,953
from the Bible, which is, he who has a lot will get more

556
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,871
and he who doesn't...

557
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,624
And so, when a company gets momentum,

558
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,458
you hear about momentum,

559
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,793
when a company gets momentum, what it means is

560
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,877
the next resource that you need

561
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,462
is preferentially willing to attach

562
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,339
to your thing as opposed to somebody else.

563
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,508
That's the mechanical process that drives

564
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,717
the power-law curve. So that creates

565
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,968
a chicken and egg question— Correct.

566
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,679
Which is, does the product create the company

567
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,223
or does the company gather enough resources

568
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,307
to create a product?

569
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,517
Yeah, so that's part of it, but again,

570
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,643
to create the product,

571
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,646
it's often now, just a process of,

572
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,272
it's also, okay, you got to create the engineers,

573
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,274
and then you got to actually feel the product

574
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,192
and...

575
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,026
Let me give you an example.

576
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,987
You got to have you got to have top-end security engineers.

577
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,406
There are only so many top-end security engineers.

578
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,241
Where do they want to work?

579
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,242
They want to work at the top companies.

580
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,243
If you're a brand-new startup,

581
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,035
how do you convince somebody

582
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:40,869
that you're going to be a top company?

583
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,371
You raise money from a top-tier VC.

584
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,497
So that happens over and over again.

585
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,499
The prosaic way that I put it is,

586
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,959
as my experience as a founder is,

587
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,003
a top-tier VC is a bridge-loan of credibility

588
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,798
at a point in time when the startup maybe deserves it,

589
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,216
but just doesn't have it yet,

590
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,301
and that credibility is harvested in the form

591
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,346
of primarily personnel, money, and brand,

592
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,557
and those three things turn out to be

593
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,724
really important in the beginning.

594
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:07,104
We're talking about the Silicon Valley ecosystem here

595
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,273
and you referenced Andy Bechtolsheim

596
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,942
and his investment in Google.

597
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,735
One thing that I find funny about that story is,

598
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,779
that's the case where he just wrote a 100K check to them.

599
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,573
He actually wrote a 100K check to Google Inc.,

600
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,907
even though they didn't have a company.

601
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,659
I think he'd gotten in his Porsche and drove off,

602
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,618
and is like, "Here you go,"

603
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,245
but there was no terms, there was no nothing,

604
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,164
and that obviously worked out really well for him.

605
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,374
But that's not unusual, I've heard other story...

606
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,459
I think we even got some check like that

607
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,587
where again, it was just like, "Tell me the terms later,"

608
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,173
and Silicon Valley is very-high trust.

609
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,175
How did that come about?

610
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,218
Let me tell you, that story is a great story. That is true.

611
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,179
And I will tell you there is another part of that story,

612
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,763
which is the venture firms that turned down Google

613
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,058
on the Series A, which is the whole other side of things

614
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,143
that maybe we should talk about,

615
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,604
because, in retrospect, it all looks obvious.

616
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,688
At the time, it's not so—

617
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,522
Sure, but it wasn't obvious.

618
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,356
Yeah. Not obvious, so maybe that

619
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,274
reinforces what you're saying,

620
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,942
which is it's definitely not obvious.

621
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,112
Look, quite frankly, you could have all kinds of theories

622
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,447
about this, do all kinds of things.

623
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,406
Talk about how wonderful everybody is.

624
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,741
I think the prodigal reality is anybody who's been

625
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,785
in the Valley for a while has had the experience,

626
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,078
typically in the form scar tissue

627
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,205
where there was some kid in a T-shirt

628
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,831
with some crazy idea, and you were like,

629
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,665
"Okay, that's great."

630
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,042
Oh, the opposite?

631
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,876
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you pat 'em

632
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,877
on the head and they go off on their way,

633
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,253
and then they turn around and five years later,

634
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,589
it turns out, "Oops, that was Mark Zuckerberg.

635
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,758
Shit. I had my moment. I had my chance."

636
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,551
The problem with missing,

637
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,928
remember it's category one— So it's basically,

638
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,722
okay, that's how ventures is, it's FOMO leads to high trust.

639
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,058
That has a cynical truth to it.

640
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,934
It feels weird. Like, yeah.

641
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,810
If you sit around, yeah.

642
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,687
It goes to category-one versus category-two error.

643
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,813
Again, it goes back to the economics,

644
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,565
which is Andy's $100,000,

645
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,443
if it got stolen, it's, he only loses $100,000.

646
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,779
If he gets it right, he makes the 30,000x return,

647
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,781
and so, there's this thing,

648
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,366
which you learn over time, is the category-two errors

649
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,785
are much, much worse,

650
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,579
and, by the way, they torture you for fucking decades,

651
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,997
because you read about

652
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,167
the success cases that you've screwed up, all the way up,

653
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,002
and so you just learn the hard way.

654
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,546
You have to be extremely open-minded for people—

655
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,506
I have a confession here,

656
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,883
which is what I tell entrepreneurs off to see VC,

657
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,385
I'd say, "Look, don't try and convince me

658
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,346
you're going to be successful, just try and create a fear

659
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,099
that there's this possibility for the next 20 years,

660
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,517
they might regret this—

661
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,352
That's so painful. As their past

662
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,645
personal billion that they missed.

663
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,106
When the company goes bankrupt, at least it ends.

664
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,482
Yeah. It's over.

665
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,317
The pain is over .

666
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,860
When you pass on the company that succeeds,

667
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,695
the pain is forever.

668
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,654
It's like the asymmetry of shorting.

669
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,488
You're shorting

670
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,323
the entrepreneur. Oh yes, absolutely. 100%.

671
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,908
It's a horrible mistake, and so, as a consequence,

672
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,576
there's just this thing of,

673
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,620
what it leads to is this incredible sense of possibility

674
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,664
and incredible sense of optimism,

675
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,581
in a very positive way,

676
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,792
which is you just need to be extremely open to the idea

677
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,626
that you're going to run into

678
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,836
the next big thing at any moment.

679
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,005
And they say, karmically, you want to really

680
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,881
put yourself out there to be part of that.

681
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,716
I think that's true,

682
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,633
but I think that's maybe a different thing.

683
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,136
You're describing that success can come from anywhere.

684
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,555
There's a big asymmetry in success where companies

685
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,849
can, 10,000x, where they can't go down

686
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,102
by more than 1x from their present position,

687
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,397
but it seems like particularly the business culture,

688
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,691
and even moving outside the fact

689
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,068
that startups get really big, is particularly high trust.

690
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,738
So you have all of investing happens based on handshakes,

691
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,824
and people can just shake hands and it's going to happen,

692
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,326
and trust that everything happens there.

693
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,786
Even when we buy companies,

694
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,122
we generally agree with the founders at a high level

695
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,915
of the terms and there might be a single-page

696
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,083
or a two-page term sheet,

697
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,045
and obviously lots of due diligence will happen after that,

698
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,298
but it won't be the kind of East Coast

699
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,633
process, private equity process after that,

700
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,968
where everyone's trying to pull a fast one,

701
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,094
and you can't trust the lawyers

702
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,137
as fast as you can throw them,

703
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:27,971
so there seems to me,

704
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,640
there's a particular kind of high-trust relationship

705
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,101
in how all the actors work

706
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,187
with each other on that. I was going to ask, Marc,

707
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,022
why the East Coast and why Europe

708
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,857
hasn't to Silicon Valley,

709
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,444
whereas you have Detroit, but then Japan copies it.

710
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,071
And I think maybe he's actually already

711
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,323
answered the question, which is maybe

712
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,950
because I haven't had those 10,000x returns,

713
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,119
they haven't instilled the fear of FOMO,

714
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,247
and it's the fear of FOMO that means you've got to

715
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:58,210
take a trusting bet on a new person,

716
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,545
and maybe that's the kernel

717
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,422
that creates a high-trust ecosystem.

718
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,883
Yeah, and then maybe just add, I think maybe you're right

719
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,510
that I'm being a little bit too cynical in my answer.

720
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,512
It's also that you want your reputation

721
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,514
to project into the future,

722
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,808
and so if you have a reputation,

723
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,643
it's a fairly close-knit community,

724
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,436
if you have a reputation for being helpful

725
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,646
and being positive, and constructive,

726
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,648
and value-add, then that plays well,

727
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,192
because then the person you've done something nice for

728
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,819
is going to introduce you to other people in the future,

729
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,986
and even you're— It's a very repeat game.

730
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,363
Right, right, it's the

731
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,239
ultimate repeating game.

732
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,156
Yeah. And so there's that,

733
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,741
and then, look, I think the other side of it,

734
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,160
that you guys alluded to, but I think is very important,

735
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,578
which is it's not zero sum.

736
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,913
When I talk to my friends in Hollywood,

737
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,290
which is not that far away,

738
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,460
and is it's own entrepreneurial ecosystem,

739
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,711
and if you talk to anybody in Hollywood, they're like,

740
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,004
"Oh, my God, this is a shark tank."

741
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,174
You're lucky if your friends knife you in the chest.

742
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,759
Generally, it's in the back.

743
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,177
It's this constant thing, and the reason is,

744
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,847
because, at least my analysis, there's a fixed amount

745
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,474
of money to be spent and made in movies, for example,

746
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,394
and if my movie gets green lit, it means yours doesn't.

747
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,645
And so even if we're close friends,

748
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,272
we're going to undermine each other as much as possible.

749
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,982
Whereas in tech, at least historically,

750
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,067
you have this multiplicative generative thing

751
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,318
where it keeps expanding.

752
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,779
So why did nowhere else manage

753
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,448
to get that ecosystem going?

754
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,741
If you look at the history of this last 50 years,

755
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,703
one of the stories that will come out is a utter uniqueness

756
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,621
that tech almost became a Silicon Valley,

757
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,206
or at least a West Coast monopoly.

758
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,250
Yep. There's no

759
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,793
precedent for that in any other industry.

760
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,627
Well, I think we're back to that.

761
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,712
Exactly. I think,

762
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,047
you see this in data actually, already,

763
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,883
AI was re-consolidating— Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

764
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,509
into basically two places on Earth,

765
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,052
and only one in the west.

766
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,054
No part of the industrial economy had that dynamic.

767
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:33,972
Right. What is it?

768
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,267
So, there have been a long parade of officials

769
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,477
from other cities in the US

770
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,936
and from other countries who have come to the Valley

771
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,770
in the last 30 years.

772
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,605
I've met with many of them.

773
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,522
They all ask that question.

774
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,690
I answered as follows, which is,

775
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,651
there are a set of things that you need all in combination,

776
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,028
and then they usually, at that point,

777
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,029
they get a stricken look on their face

778
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,071
and they say, "Well, what if we can't do

779
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:50,906
any of those things?"

780
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,699
Yeah. And so—

781
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,451
What if we build a really linear city?

782
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,619
Exactly.

783
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,454
Well, actually, it's surprising the number of people,

784
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,789
and I don't want to badmouth people,

785
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,875
because people should try to make these things work

786
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,709
and I'm proud of them for trying,

787
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,835
but literally the number where it's like,

788
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,671
"Wow, if we just built the right buildings...

789
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,089
Yeah. "This would happen."

790
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,174
That's actually fairly common,

791
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,467
and anybody who's been to Silicon Valley knows,

792
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,301
the key factor— Exactly, yeah.

793
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,469
The key to it is not- Go on El Camino Real,

794
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,303
it's not the buildings.

795
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,429
It is definitely not the buildings.

796
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,472
Yeah. And so I think

797
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,182
it's a formula, and I think it's a list of things,

798
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,767
and it's like making a cake.

799
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,684
They all have to be in the cake,

800
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,229
and the best way, I think I can describe it is,

801
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,356
it's a set of things that have to do with stability,

802
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,775
and maturity, and rule of law.

803
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,944
So you need absolute contract law.

804
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,987
You need liquid-deep capital markets.

805
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,907
You need expert specialists in all these different areas

806
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,952
that have real experience, accounting and everything else,

807
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,120
and so there's a maturity and a depth,

808
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,497
and it's that stuff that

809
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,958
developing-market countries struggle with,

810
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,835
but at the same time, you need the Wild West

811
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,963
and you need the spirit of adventure,

812
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,590
and the craziness, and the willingness to take risks,

813
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,550
and if somebody fails— And that's what

814
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,425
the East Coast missed?

815
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,468
And that's what the East Coast missed,

816
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,095
and that's what Europe doesn't get right.

817
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,680
At least, when I talk to my friends in the East Coast,

818
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,722
or my friends in Europe, that's what they say,

819
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,267
like, "Well, I can't take that kind of career risk.

820
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:04,020
That's crazy," and look, in a lot of countries

821
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,898
and in a lot of cultures, if you take a risk like that

822
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,316
and it doesn't work, it's a real problem.

823
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,359
And sorry, why is there more risk taking

824
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,735
on the West Coast versus the East Coast?

825
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,321
because like— Ah. The frontier.

826
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,407
There's no established hierarchy.

827
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,241
The frontier. The frontier. Really?

828
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,075
The frontier.

829
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:17,909
It's the frontier. Yeah, if you were in 1985,

830
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,119
you could go join— It's all in,

831
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,953
what's his name?

832
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,038
The Winslow, "The Frontier" guy from—

833
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,790
I was going to say it's in "Bonfire of the Vanities" too.

834
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,833
Okay, true. You would go join

835
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,210
Goldman Sachs, you would join McKinsey.

836
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,170
You would join existing institutions

837
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,547
and go up them on the East Coast.

838
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,090
Those just didn't exist on the West Coast.

839
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,258
You effectively had a country of

840
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,593
50 to 70 million people— But don't worry.

841
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,677
With no hierarchy— There was Wells Fargo,

842
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,804
there was lots of institutions

843
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,848
that you could join. Yeah, but were they

844
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:44,519
prestigious enough that they trapped young talent?

845
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,606
Another way to say this is, why did Stanford

846
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,816
do so much better than Harvard and MIT?

847
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,277
Because obviously, the input quality is the same,

848
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,112
so there has to be something in the place

849
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,864
they're sitting that creates a difference.

850
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,616
I think there's a frontier spirit. I really do.

851
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,159
So it—

852
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,202
But you're always skeptical of cultural explanations

853
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:01,995
in other places.

854
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,830
Well, there's clearly a talent-aggregation effect.

855
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,332
So there's clearly talent-aggregation effect

856
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,166
that takes place inside the US.

857
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,917
And look, most of the great people in Silicon Valley

858
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,378
did not grow up in Silicon Valley.

859
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,630
My wife grew up here in Palo Alto.

860
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,048
I tease, I call her a townie.

861
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,633
Right?

862
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,176
By the way, she has three more degrees than I do,

863
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,386
so it's definitely not a status thing,

864
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,471
but most people are imports.

865
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,598
They get imported all through the entire rest

866
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,974
of the country, and around the rest of the world,

867
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,934
and so it's definitely a selector,

868
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,562
an attraction point for talent, and that's a big part of it,

869
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,106
but, look, I think if you just trace the history,

870
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,692
it's not an accident that both Silicon Valley

871
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,528
and Hollywood are the places that they are

872
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,906
because the people involved went west as far as they could

873
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,699
before they were literally stopped by the Pacific Ocean.

874
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,950
Right?

875
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,370
It was the ultimate selector in the build out of the country

876
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,664
to the people who were the most oriented towards risk,

877
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,332
and, to your point, independence,

878
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,833
and doing their own thing,

879
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:53,004
and that was true in the gold-rush days in 1850

880
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,506
where San Francisco was ground zero for that.

881
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,924
It's equally true today.

882
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,175
Hollywood is the exact same thing.

883
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,009
In Hollywood's case, it's actually funny,

884
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,511
because one of the reasons they needed

885
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,762
to get so far away is they were trying

886
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,556
to evade Thomas Edison's patent enforcers,

887
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,559
because Thomas Edison owned the patent for the film cameras

888
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,061
and the original Hollywood entrepreneurs

889
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,688
had no desire at all to pay for that,

890
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,314
and then Edison would hire the Pinkertons

891
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,774
to come bust up the movie sets.

892
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,027
But you see what I'm saying.

893
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,822
Rogue, renegade, iconoclastic—

894
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,906
How about tech? But do you think the

895
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:20,740
inverse is true?

896
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,783
Do you think that certain people

897
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,786
didn't move because it wasn't a fun city

898
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,621
that had hit the scale of London

899
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,747
or Europe? Oh, 100%. Yeah, yeah.

900
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,333
No, look, we all have lots of friends in New York

901
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,211
and London, and they're all just like, "Wow."

902
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,629
My friends in New York, I don't know,

903
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,131
if you get two pints of this into them,

904
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:36,965
they'll be like...

905
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,799
They literally don't understand

906
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,758
why anybody doesn't live in New York.

907
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,343
Yeah. Well, I think they'll

908
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,428
tell you that at 9:00 AM

909
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,679
on a Monday morning.

910
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,722
You don't need to get any drink into them.

911
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,597
That's a very good point.

912
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,349
It's a New Yorker cover.

913
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,267
Yeah, essentially. I trying to—

914
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,393
So, the frontier and a mining camp,

915
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,103
you have to be willing to move to the mining camp?

916
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:50,895
I think so.

917
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,148
And then this gets into the danger.

918
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:53,982
This is like the back-to-banking

919
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,316
and back-to-consulting thing.

920
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,444
The danger, in a lot of ways,

921
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,778
is it becomes established,

922
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,029
and when it becomes established,

923
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,614
it starts to attract establishment people—

924
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,490
The Social Network problem.

925
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,616
Right. Exactly.

926
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,994
And in that sense, the downturns,

927
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,454
as much of a pain in the butt as they are,

928
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,289
are probably helpful. Are good because

929
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,832
you go back to banking, you go back to consulting.

930
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,417
Yes, and the only people who are left,

931
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,918
and by the way, this was Silicon Valley

932
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,962
when I arrived in '93, this had happened,

933
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,173
and then this was Silicon Valley in 2004 as we discussed,

934
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,508
which is, you flush all the status seekers,

935
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,634
you flush all the tourists.

936
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,344
It's like fuel management for fire.

937
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,929
Correct. Exactly.

938
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,056
100%. You clear out the brush.

939
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,018
Now look, how long can this last? I don't know.

940
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,854
We're in a country that has, at least certainly

941
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,897
over the last 60 years,

942
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,482
has had a strong tendency towards stagnation.

943
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,650
The thing that has kept this whole thing going, I think,

944
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,028
is just that there are these new platforms,

945
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,738
these new paradigm shifts in technology.

946
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,365
Everyone loves the defense-company explanation

947
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,492
for Silicon Valley—

948
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,326
That's a big part of it. Yeah.

949
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,243
That's been part of it. Yeah. It's real.

950
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,538
So, Steve Blank has done the best reconstruction of this.

951
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,790
The typical Silicon Valley history

952
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,750
goes back to the 1950s with HP

953
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,627
and the 1960s with the chip companies.

954
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,588
I think he makes a very compelling case.

955
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,215
The real history was actually defense-tech startups

956
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,841
in the late 1920s, 1930s,

957
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,052
and you still see remnants of that

958
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,095
if you drive around Sunnyvale. NASA Ames.

959
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,723
NASA Ames, but this is the place where early,

960
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,433
I forget the exact, but early radar

961
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,019
and early missile-guidance systems and all that stuff,

962
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,813
avionics, a lot of that was innovated here

963
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,647
in the exact same way,

964
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,440
and that was 100 years ago. So, if you could go back,

965
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,858
could you AB test it?

966
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,778
Is there any way you could have made Silicon Glen

967
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,823
or whatever the Boston corridor was called, successful?

968
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,990
Well, they did.

969
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,867
And keep it successful versus the Valley.

970
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,701
That's the problem.

971
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,412
Was there a point where it could have gone the other way,

972
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,122
or was it inevitable from the 50s?

973
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,167
Like you're in 1970. Can it go both ways still?

974
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,211
So, when I arrived in the Valley in '93,

975
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,796
I think it's fair to say the Valley and Boston

976
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,130
were probably considered neck and neck—

977
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,715
Mm? Yeah, and sort of—

978
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,717
That late? In Boston,

979
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,552
these are kind of forgotten now,

980
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,553
but DEC- Mm-hmm, oh yeah.

981
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,971
DEC in digital, it was like—

982
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,556
Ashton-Tate. Extremely important company.

983
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,558
Ashton-Tate the inventor of the word processor,

984
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,767
and I think, was there Lotus—

985
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,561
Lotus was. Yeah Was there, 1-2-3

986
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,605
was there, and then you had, later years,

987
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,233
other great companies, EMC and others,

988
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,734
and then there's a great book

989
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,819
called "Soul of a New Machine,"

990
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,612
which is one of the great all-time startup books,

991
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,407
which is about a supercomputer company in Boston

992
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,533
in the late 80s.

993
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,244
It was just extremely excellent literary book,

994
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,079
and it really tells the story of a startup,

995
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,873
but it also tells the story of Boston

996
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,707
in that time and place,

997
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,667
so a lot of leading-edge supercomputing stuff was there.

998
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,586
By the way, Thinking Machines was there.

999
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,420
The original

1000
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,880
supercomputer company. Wow.

1001
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,714
The original computer.

1002
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,965
The original. Yeah, exactly.

1003
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,927
Yeah, so Danny Hillis, the company that's the forerunner

1004
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,679
of what we think of today as large-scale AI

1005
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,973
and cloud stuff, was there,

1006
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,183
and look, MIT was there

1007
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:38,187
and generated huge numbers of smart people,

1008
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,523
and so it worked really well for a long time,

1009
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,109
and then basically, in the mid 90s, it separated,

1010
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,821
and then people in Boston will say that again, two pints in,

1011
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,114
they'll say that the final blow

1012
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,949
was probably when Mark Zuckerberg could not raise

1013
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,743
venture capital for Facebook,

1014
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,661
and had to leave and come west.

1015
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,495
That was a meaningful signal?

1016
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,413
That was sort of

1017
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,415
the last moments. We can call it

1018
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,249
the chapter marker.

1019
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,083
Yeah, it was just like,

1020
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,627
"Okay, if we couldn't do that one,"

1021
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,171
and then, by the way, in the counterfactual,

1022
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,172
had he stayed in Boston,

1023
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,090
maybe there would be an entirely new

1024
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,092
ecosystem there that doesn't exist today.

1025
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,511
Yeah, so I think, basically, it worked for a while,

1026
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,805
and again, this is why I locked in on frontier spirit,

1027
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:16,684
so what Boston has is all of the stability aspects

1028
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,518
that we were talking about.

1029
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,561
Okay, so if that— They just didn't

1030
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,646
have the same frontier spirit,

1031
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,480
and it just turned out that,

1032
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,315
put it back to preferential attachment,

1033
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,816
it just turned out on the margin,

1034
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,486
the smartest people from MIT wanted to come here,

1035
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,320
and that was basically it.

1036
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,447
So, if that's how to move ecosystems,

1037
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,657
same question, but for companies,

1038
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,076
what's the company that could have been a trillion

1039
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,536
that didn't, that you would have to change the least

1040
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,663
to make it a trillion?

1041
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,914
You know, they get that one exec,

1042
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,250
they get that one lawsuit, that just goes differently.

1043
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,752
There's many, many, many.

1044
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,087
The all-time story of that is a company

1045
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,046
called Digital Research,

1046
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,547
which should have been Microsoft.

1047
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,633
Yeah. And there's a famous,

1048
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,884
I can tell the whole—

1049
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,552
Please. Oh, oh yeah. Okay, okay.

1050
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,763
So, the story roughly goes as follows.

1051
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,181
It's in the books, but it roughly goes as follows,

1052
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,058
which is, so Bill Gates and Paul Allen

1053
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,519
had this little software company, originally Albuquerque,

1054
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,438
down the street from "Better Call Saul," I imagine,

1055
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,272
which they moved

1056
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,984
to Seattle, and they were building, very early,

1057
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,277
they were building programming tools for computers.

1058
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,238
And so, when I first used Microsoft as a kid,

1059
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,406
it was Microsoft Basic.

1060
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,615
They were a compiler company,

1061
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,702
or interpreter company, not an OS company,

1062
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,996
and then there was this PC wave

1063
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,205
with all these, basically,

1064
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:23,084
these kind of cat and dog early PCs from '76 to '82,

1065
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,919
and they basically sold the basic interpreter

1066
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,338
to all those companies, and that's how they got going,

1067
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,673
but they weren't in the operating system business.

1068
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,341
And then IBM decided, famously,

1069
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,509
to enter the PC business,

1070
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,095
and then there was a network connection

1071
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,972
with Bill Gates's mother and the CEO of IBM,

1072
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:36,848
and they were on a board together,

1073
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,559
and it resulted in the IBM team coming out

1074
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,727
and going up to Seattle

1075
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,311
and buying a license to Microsoft Basic,

1076
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,813
which is what everybody did in those days,

1077
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,857
and then the IBM team asked Bill Gates,

1078
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,191
like, "What operating system should we use?"

1079
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,985
And he's like, "Oh, well, the standard operating system

1080
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,487
for PCs is called CPM," which at the time was true,

1081
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,323
it was the standard operating system for early business PCs,

1082
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,283
and they said, "Well, who makes that?"

1083
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,492
And he said, "Well, there's a company

1084
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,120
called Digital Research down in Santa Cruz in California.

1085
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,205
There's this guy Gary Kildall, you should go see him."

1086
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,499
And this was the synergistic relationship that he had

1087
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,710
with Digital Research at that time.

1088
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,045
So the story goes, the IBM team,

1089
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,005
which is 20 lawyers in blue suits,

1090
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,882
get on a plane, go to Santa Cruz,

1091
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,675
they show up at the office to meet with Gary Kildall,

1092
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,219
discuss licensing CPM, and Gary Kildall,

1093
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,096
being a frontier-like person,

1094
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,639
decided not to come to the meeting,

1095
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,183
decided he'd rather go flying

1096
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,934
that day, John.

1097
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:25,521
That's a reasonable thing to want to do.

1098
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,647
And instead, had his wife,

1099
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,025
who was the company's general counsel, negotiate the NDA.

1100
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:33,237
IBM was famous for its lawyers, and the lawyer was not about

1101
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,572
to sign the NDA and the day ended inconclusively,

1102
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:37,784
and the IBM team was like, "All right, this is ridiculous,"

1103
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,327
and they went back up to Seattle,

1104
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,828
and they told Gates, "If you can't find us

1105
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:44,206
an operating system, the deal for the interpreter is off,"

1106
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:46,751
and Bill said, "Give me a few days,"

1107
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,628
and Bill literally went down the street

1108
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,172
to an independent developer named Tim Patterson,

1109
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,841
licensed what at the time was called QDOS,

1110
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,592
quick and dirty operating system,

1111
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:57,428
which is the true name of DOS

1112
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:01,724
and, for a $50,000 flat fee,

1113
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,310
turned around and sold it to IBM,

1114
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,728
that created MS-DOS.

1115
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,814
The kicker to the story is, 30 years later,

1116
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,441
Gary Kildall was knifed to death in a bar fight.

1117
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,275
Oh, my God. Yes.

1118
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,568
Oh, God. Sorry. Sorry.

1119
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,403
Something changed terribly there.

1120
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,863
I didn't want to bring the room down.

1121
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,532
That was... But it should have,

1122
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,492
again, counterfactual and who knows, who knows,

1123
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,451
who knows, but you know.

1124
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,620
But I think, it seems hard to argue

1125
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,579
that Digital Research would've become

1126
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,457
a trillion dollar company because Bill Gates

1127
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,668
had such a killer commercial instinct

1128
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:32,463
that there were, I mean obviously, the IBM OS moment

1129
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,840
was the biggest moment,

1130
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,676
but there were several other moments in Microsoft's history

1131
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,052
where they steered things, and it doesn't feel like

1132
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:43,057
if they get the IBM OS pick, that then you magically

1133
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,392
become a giant company. Oh, no, no.

1134
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,018
Definitely, you don't magically become the giant company,

1135
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,354
but again, this goes back to preferential attachment.

1136
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,399
That IBM deal's a classic.

1137
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,151
It's impossible to remember how important IBM was

1138
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,235
at that time. Yes.

1139
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,361
IBM in the mid 80s was 80%

1140
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,363
of the market capitalization of the entire tech industry.

1141
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,698
Mm-hmm.

1142
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,658
They were the absolute gorilla,

1143
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,411
and by the way, the IBM PC,

1144
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,537
and then the clones ultimately,

1145
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,956
that came out of it, completely standardized

1146
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,710
the industry, but all of the PC companies

1147
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,170
from before that went away.

1148
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,796
Yeah. It was an extinction-level

1149
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,881
event for everybody else,

1150
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,465
and so whoever got that deal,

1151
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,633
had he not gotten that deal,

1152
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,343
it's not even clear Microsoft would've stayed in business.

1153
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,262
Now, having said that, he gets obviously credit

1154
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,597
for everything as well. There is a trend where

1155
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,724
if you go to the absolute cutting edge of tech,

1156
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,685
they're so sort of wilderness people,

1157
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,353
that they don't have the conscientiousness.

1158
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,063
Correct. Right, yeah. They go flying instead of

1159
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:31,898
turning up to the meetings.

1160
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,732
That's right. And it's almost like

1161
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,984
you get a second generation who go to the frontier,

1162
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,486
but a conscientiousness enough to institution build,

1163
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,988
and those become the super-big companies.

1164
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,574
Yeah, by the way, Dell's another classic case dated

1165
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,950
from that same time.

1166
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,952
Dell computer was founded at the same time.

1167
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,663
There's like 400 IBM-clone companies at that time,

1168
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,123
that were actually in the process of going under.

1169
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,249
Most of them just vaporized.

1170
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,126
This is later, it's five years later,

1171
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,544
during the down cycle in the late 80s,

1172
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,379
and that was around the time that Michael Dell

1173
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,256
in his dorm room decided to get into the PC business,

1174
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,174
and that's exactly right.

1175
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,092
He was a version of that.

1176
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,886
He was a more systematic thinker

1177
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,720
than the Wildcatters who had been

1178
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,763
in the PC industry before that.

1179
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,848
Is that how Oracle wins in databases?

1180
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,309
because there's a ton of database companies back then.

1181
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,019
Yeah, I think Oracle was a somewhat different story.

1182
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,145
I think it might've been more of a story

1183
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,063
of just raw aggression.

1184
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,022
Got it. Larry was always

1185
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,732
very into Japanese Samurai culture,

1186
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,567
and I don't think that was a—

1187
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,236
So moving forward in time,

1188
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,197
why did none of the pre-Google internet companies survive?

1189
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,618
Lycos, Excite, AltaVista, AOL, Yahoo. None of them.

1190
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,663
So, I think that you need to really rewind back

1191
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,122
to the differences between then and now,

1192
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,166
and I would just say a couple things on that.

1193
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,211
One is the whole internet boom bubble,

1194
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,337
whatever you call it, of that period,

1195
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,922
was basically four years.

1196
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,090
It was basically four years in and out.

1197
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,217
For example, the companies you just mentioned,

1198
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,302
for the most part, my company got going in '94,

1199
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,054
those companies really got going in '96.

1200
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,847
By 2000,

1201
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,141
it was nuclear winter,

1202
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,851
and so it was a four-year period.

1203
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:54,355
The business models either didn't exist or were brand new,

1204
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,731
and we could spend a lot of time on that,

1205
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,692
but all the business models that you have today,

1206
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,527
that have these big mega companies,

1207
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,195
those business models didn't exist.

1208
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,365
It was still mostly just packaged software in those days,

1209
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,908
and so it was really hard to build the kind of

1210
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,118
enduring business that you see today.

1211
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,703
And then I would say the third thing is,

1212
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,621
the market was so small,

1213
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,291
so the total market size in 1999,

1214
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,626
for internet anything was 50 million people

1215
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,669
total, max, maybe.

1216
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,753
Wow. Maybe.

1217
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,547
Half of those people were on dial up,

1218
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,132
which only barely counted.

1219
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,718
By the way, and that was mostly AOL,

1220
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,344
which only barely had internet support

1221
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,178
the way we understand it.

1222
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,013
Yep. Right.

1223
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,016
They had a browser, but it wasn't like what you're used to.

1224
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,976
No. And then the PCs

1225
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,477
were super slow, the modems were slow,

1226
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,604
and that was still, the median internet experience

1227
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,772
in those days was you dial in

1228
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,733
for maybe an hour at night from your desk at home.

1229
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,900
Yep. And then businesses,

1230
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,862
by the way, even businesses that had internet connectivity,

1231
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,280
were doing everything they could to prevent their employees

1232
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,114
from using it.

1233
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,115
How are we doing over here? Everyone all right?

1234
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,283
Guinness? All right?

1235
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,117
All right. Here you go.

1236
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,243
All right. Very good.

1237
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,328
Anyone need anything else?

1238
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,664
Finally, a real Irish—

1239
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,749
Bartender? Finally a

1240
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,292
legitimately-Irish bartender.

1241
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,209
You need a refill?

1242
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,210
That would be fantastic.

1243
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,045
Thank you very much.

1244
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,713
All right. Outstanding.

1245
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,675
So, it was a very early crude time as compared to now.

1246
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,052
So there's another question that leads to,

1247
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,846
which is normally, you get bull and bear cases

1248
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,515
on crypto, or defense, or enterprise SaaS.

1249
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,226
AI seems unique in that there's very little in terms

1250
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,771
of articulate bear cases about why it matters.

1251
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,814
In fact, most of the bear cases go the other way,

1252
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:19,648
that it's going to destroy the world,

1253
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,150
or something like this.

1254
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,527
Were there articulate bear cases on the internet

1255
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,862
during the bubble?

1256
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,780
Oh, yeah.

1257
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,697
Well, the original bear case was just,

1258
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,367
"Nobody's ever going to make any money. This is ridiculous."

1259
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,576
And then there was just a huge onslaught

1260
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,620
of, "This is just going to be cyber crime, and porn,

1261
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,288
and spam, and fraud, and abuse."

1262
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,247
So you had the similar

1263
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,207
sort of equivalent of AI safety.

1264
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,000
Well, every new technology has a moral panic

1265
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,085
that it's going to ruin society.

1266
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,127
Every consumer technology.

1267
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,922
And then you just use the product

1268
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,965
and be like, "This is a joke. It doesn't really work.

1269
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,801
Look at how long it takes images to load."

1270
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,635
Is anybody really going to

1271
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,637
put their credit card in?

1272
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,264
So, I don't know if bear case is the right term,

1273
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,849
but there was massive skepticism.

1274
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,309
Let's do remember bear case here for a second.

1275
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,771
I think the smartest bear case was that,

1276
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,147
"The internet's clearly a cool thing.

1277
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,857
You guys are getting way over your skis

1278
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,692
in terms of valuations here,

1279
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,611
and in particular, you're getting way over your skis

1280
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,196
in terms of the build out that's happening

1281
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,823
of the internet infrastructure

1282
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,783
where the demand will take awhile to catch up,"

1283
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,618
and of course, that was true where there was

1284
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:16,497
a fiber overbuild, and clearly,

1285
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,832
there isn't an AI bubble in the sense

1286
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,126
that everyone really likes their tokens.

1287
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,377
The stuff that we're doing with AI

1288
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,046
or my personal ChatGPT usage, I really like that.

1289
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,381
You're not going to take that away from me,

1290
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,466
and so it's not a bubble in that regard,

1291
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,760
and it's sensibly priced and everything like that.

1292
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,930
It's a true tech better, faster, cheaper story.

1293
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,475
However, there is a huge ramp up

1294
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,602
in AI data center build out.

1295
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,815
Oracle just had that 4x RPO beat

1296
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,316
that caused their stock to go up 40%

1297
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,527
and Larry Ellison to become the richest man in the world.

1298
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,029
Basically, they're doing giant data center projects

1299
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,324
for AI companies, and one can imagine

1300
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,827
that there will be a data center bubble

1301
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,872
where people get too excited about the build out

1302
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,207
and we build capacity ahead of utilization,

1303
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,460
and people finally, it's the last musical chair,

1304
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,503
people build that data center

1305
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,589
where actually no one wants to lease it.

1306
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,423
Right. Do you think

1307
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,257
that is happening?

1308
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,633
Will happen? Is that a sensible framework?

1309
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,260
So, I would say actually, that is precisely

1310
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,386
what happened with the internet boom.

1311
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,471
Exactly. Right.

1312
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,805
Sorry. That's my analogy. Right, right. That's right.

1313
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,931
And so for people who don't know this,

1314
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,765
what happened with the internet boom

1315
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,392
was there was this sort of internet software

1316
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,019
and services, and Netscape, and Amazon and these things—

1317
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,980
And by dollars, people confuse the dot-com boom.

1318
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,814
Correct. The internet stuff didn't

1319
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,648
matter, it was a—

1320
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,483
It was a Telco bubble.

1321
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,650
It was a Telco bubble.

1322
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,485
It was almost entirely a Telco bubble

1323
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,736
and it was almost entirely a Telco crash,

1324
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,820
and you know that for two reasons.

1325
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,030
One is the sheer amounts of money involved

1326
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,364
were so much greater on the Telco side,

1327
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,949
and then the other is Telco is where the debt came in.

1328
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,494
And to get a really monumental crash,

1329
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,912
depression, recession depression,

1330
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,747
you need a credit bubble to pop,

1331
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,082
and the credit bubble was 100%, I can tell you,

1332
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,000
not on the tech companies.

1333
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,503
It was 100% on the telecom companies,

1334
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,255
and it was massive, and it was amazing.

1335
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,882
And some of them had dodgy stuff going on, like WorldCom.

1336
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,925
Oh, and then there was fraud.

1337
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,385
Right, exactly, and those stories are truly spectacular.

1338
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,346
My retrospective explanation of what happened,

1339
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,805
consistent with what you were saying, basically,

1340
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,516
was, there were a small number of people

1341
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,392
who were building the software and services,

1342
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,521
and that was because they all had to be invented

1343
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,106
from scratch, and then there just only a small number

1344
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,942
of people who even understood the software

1345
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,151
and how you could possibly apply it.

1346
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,319
There just weren't that many of us

1347
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,153
running around who did that,

1348
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,947
and so, John Doerr had a famous saying,

1349
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,281
at some point internet became a cream

1350
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,742
that you rub on investors to get them excited,

1351
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,994
and when that happened, what happened was

1352
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,955
you had a much larger number of people

1353
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,373
who had a lot of knowledge about

1354
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,250
how to put buildings in the ground

1355
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,043
and how to fill those buildings with fiber.

1356
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,920
And the good news with being in the data center,

1357
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,255
in those days it was data centers, right,

1358
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,798
it was data centers and— Hold on, hold on.

1359
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,840
This gets to an interesting point,

1360
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,675
which is— Yes.

1361
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,593
That when you get a boom,

1362
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,637
because the new people, there aren't enough people

1363
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,846
with the new skill set to do it—

1364
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:38,681
That's right. That can never be

1365
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,640
the epicenter of the bubble.

1366
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,474
That's right. It's always where

1367
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,601
the 50-year-olds with lots of capital are,

1368
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,894
that's where the epicenter is,

1369
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,106
so it was Telco in the internet bubble

1370
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,233
and all those Telco people, sort of 50,

1371
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,693
and so now it's data centers.

1372
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,361
Well, exactly,

1373
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,195
and the way I would describe it is,

1374
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,072
when the thing takes off,

1375
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,324
when the core thing takes off, there's just too much money.

1376
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,492
Yep. There's too much money

1377
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,327
that wants to come in and participate, and it literally

1378
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,745
cannot participate— But also it comes in

1379
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,580
the way it knows how.

1380
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,914
It comes in the way it knows how,

1381
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,208
and this is what you would find at the time,

1382
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,127
which was you would meet a lot,

1383
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,169
and I met a lot of these guys,

1384
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,796
a lot of these were Telco CEOs

1385
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,882
or a lot of these new Telco companies, Global Crossing,

1386
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:14,925
all these new companies,

1387
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,177
but Global Crossing was one of the great boom, boom, boom

1388
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,012
blow-up stories at the time,

1389
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,555
and the entrepreneur was this guy Gary Winnick,

1390
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,599
and he was actually at Drexel Burnham.

1391
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,144
He was a bond guy from the 80s, a Leonard Brown guy,

1392
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,354
and he figured out like, "Oh, we know how

1393
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,272
to put buildings in the ground.

1394
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,481
We know how to build fiber.

1395
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,025
You go to Cisco, you buy the devices,

1396
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,776
you rig up the fiber, Corning will sell you the fiber,

1397
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,154
and it's a known thing, and his expertise

1398
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,947
was going to the debt market, convince them to finance that.

1399
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,158
And then he could go just like hoover up capital,

1400
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,285
and, in fact, he built like tremendously valuable,

1401
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,037
tremendously important infrastructure.

1402
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,747
It's just that a bunch of that infrastructure

1403
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,124
was not actually filled up for 15 years,

1404
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,002
and in the meantime, much like luxury hotels,

1405
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,629
it traded hands three times.

1406
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,422
The people who own that infrastructure today

1407
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,965
are doing very well with it—

1408
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,425
And so it would be— Many of those companies

1409
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,343
went under.

1410
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:01,347
It would be ironic if AI researchers are still underpaid,

1411
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,350
but there are too many GPUs per AI researcher.

1412
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,934
Yeah, so, this is the thing,

1413
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,061
and here's where you get into the question

1414
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,063
of whether you can have a reason by analogy,

1415
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,231
and whether things are actually the same,

1416
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:14,234
and so then it's like, "All right, is AI the new internet?"

1417
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,278
And it's like, "Okay, if AI is the new internet,

1418
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,406
then you could maybe plausibly expect this kind of cycle,"

1419
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,784
and for sure, you guys probably meet,

1420
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,618
I meet people all the time,

1421
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,119
which is like, "I don't know how to invest in the software

1422
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:24,953
side of this, but we're going

1423
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:25,788
to do a giant data center build,"

1424
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,791
and you know, this includes nation states doing this,

1425
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,043
and so you could say history is repeating itself.

1426
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,712
The counter argument to that is, I don't know that AI

1427
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,547
and internet are even remotely comparable.

1428
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,840
Well, another way to say it is,

1429
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,511
if you could have sped up broadband by maybe five years,

1430
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,054
the internet bubble isn't a bubble.

1431
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,515
It just seamlessly goes into 2007.

1432
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,184
You still at 56K modems in 2001.

1433
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,103
Correct. People forget.

1434
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,314
You remember this, but people forget or don't know this,

1435
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,651
home internet broadband was not common until after 2005,

1436
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,362
and I was actually at AOL, I followed this very closely,

1437
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,738
because we sold our company AOL.

1438
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,490
I was at AOL on the executive staff

1439
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,908
in the board meetings in 1999,

1440
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,952
and the big question for AOL at that point

1441
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,662
was how to get the narrow band provider

1442
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,996
to being the broadband provider,

1443
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,623
because we knew it would happen at some point,

1444
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,999
but it was unclear when,

1445
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,501
and ultimately the company couldn't figure it out.

1446
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,087
But the question in those days was very much,

1447
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,505
and it was literally, it was cable modems

1448
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,216
or, it was called ISDN, it was proto broadband

1449
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,926
from the Telcos, and it just wasn't happening,

1450
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,512
and in fact, it didn't happen in that scale in 2005,

1451
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,806
and then mobile broadband didn't really happen

1452
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,142
until 2012. Yeah.

1453
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,852
And people actually forget, the original iPhone

1454
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,770
from 2007 did not have mobile broadband.

1455
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,730
Or apps.

1456
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,689
Or apps. Right.

1457
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,482
But it also, it was on the old AT&T—

1458
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,484
It was useless.

1459
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,318
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah

1460
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,320
Yeah, so there was this just incredible lag

1461
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,864
for when an ordinary person could have

1462
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,074
the kind of experience that you can have today.

1463
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,993
And so, yeah, so one theory

1464
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,369
for why, quote, AI is different,

1465
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,705
is actually, no, the experience that you're having today,

1466
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,374
just in ChatGPT, it's just so monumentally amazing.

1467
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,835
It's fully there, and yeah, you have to watch it

1468
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,504
type the thing out, but the answers are like spectacular.

1469
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,338
Yep. And so there's that,

1470
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,423
and then there's the other thing,

1471
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,301
which is just the problem with metaphors,

1472
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,179
which is, one of the theories you could say on this is,

1473
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,098
the internet was a network technology,

1474
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,850
whereas AI is a computing technology,

1475
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,019
and maybe the only comp comp for AI

1476
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,022
that you can have is actually the creation of the computer,

1477
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,816
because it's the first major reinvention

1478
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,359
of the fundamental model of what is a computer

1479
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,653
in 80 years, going from the Von Neumann architecture

1480
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,488
to the neural network.

1481
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,947
And if you trace the history back,

1482
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,408
they knew in the 1940s that these were the two paths.

1483
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,242
Yeah.

1484
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,495
They knew what the neural network was in 1943.

1485
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,954
There was a big argument at the time

1486
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,915
of whether the computer should be based on

1487
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,459
fundamentally adding machines on cash registers

1488
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,253
or whether it should be based on brain architectures,

1489
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,005
and we had to wait 80 years for it to work,

1490
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,925
but now we have the computer industry V2,

1491
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,760
which is much more valuable and important

1492
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,804
because of all of the obvious things it can do

1493
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,348
that the hyper-literal Von Neumann machines can't do,

1494
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,893
and so, we've successfully unlocked computer industry V2,

1495
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,603
it's 10, or a hundred, or a thousand,

1496
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,772
or a million times more important and valuable,

1497
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,399
and all of your petty comparisons to

1498
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,194
bubbles in the 1990s just wash out, because, my God,

1499
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,279
look at what the thing could do.

1500
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,782
AI is funny, because it is always the case

1501
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:10,869
that the hype cycle for technologies predates the technology

1502
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:11,995
being ready for that hype,

1503
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,622
and so, Charlie and I often talk about

1504
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,873
the mobile internet hype.

1505
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,042
Yeah, that people were excited about.

1506
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,252
You'll buy cinema tickets on your mobile phone

1507
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,797
in the 2000s on a Nokia 3310, which is not actually

1508
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,549
how the mobile internet played out,

1509
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,425
and even the crypto excitement,

1510
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,427
the kinds of things people talk about with crypto,

1511
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,221
of like, "Oh, you'll be able to make payments," or whatever,

1512
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,306
we're finally getting to it in 2025

1513
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,850
in any kind of meaningful volumes,

1514
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,394
but it took a good 15 years

1515
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,855
from when people started being excited about it.

1516
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,898
AI is maybe the longest time lag

1517
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,025
from those things where,

1518
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,027
when was "2001 A Space Odyssey" released?

1519
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,822
The books that it was based on, were in the 1950s,

1520
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,448
and then "2001 A Space Odyssey"

1521
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,533
was the 60s? 60s. '68.

1522
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,451
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. '69, yeah.

1523
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,496
And that was voice mode with tool use,

1524
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,331
like HAL 9000,

1525
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:59,793
and so, I find it funny that we had such a specific vision

1526
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,421
that was pretty much right,

1527
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,548
but it took a long time for the tech to be...

1528
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,676
And there was various waves, dragon systems,

1529
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,510
the tech wasn't that good,

1530
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,096
but people were excited about it.

1531
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,639
There's a book called "Rise of the Machines"

1532
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,724
that has the prehistory of AI,

1533
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,809
and, I believe I remember correctly,

1534
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,561
there were actually debates about this in the 1930s.

1535
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,771
It actually predated even the invention

1536
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,606
of the neural network—

1537
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,523
Okay, so roughly a hundred years later,

1538
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,275
we're getting around to it. Yeah, yeah,

1539
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,693
and I think Alan Turing and folks like that

1540
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,736
were involved in that at that time.

1541
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,696
There was a famous moment in the history on this.

1542
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,823
So, Alan Turing, Claude Shannon,

1543
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,743
the inventor of information theory, two very important guys,

1544
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,369
during World War II, they're building the computer

1545
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,330
originally in World War II, to beat the Nazis,

1546
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,956
crack the codes, and so Alan Turing

1547
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,833
and Claude Shannon are having lunch

1548
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,793
at the AT&T executive dining room

1549
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,421
in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, in 1943,

1550
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,173
and they're talking about exactly this topic,

1551
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,133
and Alan Turing starts to raise his voice, raise his voice,

1552
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,635
and finally, he gets up in the middle

1553
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,012
of the AT&T dining room and says, "I'm not talking about

1554
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,513
building a genius computer brain.

1555
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,974
I'm talking about building a mediocre computer brain,

1556
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,309
like the president of AT&T."

1557
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,478
Right?

1558
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,606
And so, they knew, I think he knew that the path

1559
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,984
that they were on, the Von Neumann-machine path

1560
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,236
was building this hyper-literal,

1561
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:11,907
you can almost say hyper-autistic math savant in a box,

1562
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,034
which obviously, was not going to be the thing

1563
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,369
that was going to be English language

1564
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,329
and write everything else that you were going to want to do,

1565
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,165
and so he knew this is the wrong path,

1566
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,459
but he just didn't live in the time in which the technology

1567
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,377
was available to do what he wanted to do,

1568
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,962
and it just happens that we do.

1569
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,381
What are these things emerging heuristics

1570
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,256
of how the market works?

1571
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,967
So, let me give an example from software.

1572
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,135
There's no inferior-goods market for software.

1573
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,305
There's no cheap version of Excel,

1574
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,640
there's sort of one— There was at one point.

1575
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,474
There was at one point,

1576
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,850
and it didn't succeed, which is the point—

1577
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,685
They'll throw it out. But in general,

1578
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,437
software's gone to one company, some horizontal,

1579
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,981
some vertical, being the best—

1580
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:44,815
because they're such a great deal.

1581
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,149
because it's such a great deal.

1582
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,693
A hundred percent. A hundred percent.

1583
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,902
Is it the same in AI?

1584
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,697
Do we go with horizontal intelligence?

1585
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,116
Is there an inferior-goods market where

1586
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,368
you end up with AI and device, it's intelligent

1587
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,327
but not super intelligent,

1588
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,286
but you don't need it— Would people use—

1589
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,204
To ask the weather? Worse models?

1590
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:02,207
The way I would think about it is, if you think about,

1591
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,584
let's say this is a computer industry V2,

1592
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,545
what did you experience in computer industry V2?

1593
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:10,007
You had many different sizes and shapes of computers,

1594
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:10,841
and actually what happened

1595
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,551
at the time was the big ones got built first,

1596
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,678
and then it literally was mainframe,

1597
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,595
and then it was mini computer,

1598
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,931
and then it was server,

1599
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,057
and then it was— And then it goes down

1600
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,308
to the PC. Personal computer,

1601
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,185
and then mobile phone, and then embedded devices.

1602
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,020
Yep. Right?

1603
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,730
And then, by the way, and then it multiplies outward.

1604
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,606
Cars, and light bulbs, and doorknobs,

1605
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,150
and everything else.

1606
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,401
As you know, what you have as a consequence,

1607
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,527
is the computer industry,

1608
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,695
and specifically, the chip industry,

1609
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,281
is therefore in the form of a giant pyramid,

1610
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,532
where at the top, you have a small number

1611
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,658
of supercomputers and mainframes,

1612
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,035
and at the bottom you have billions

1613
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:38,869
and billions of embedded devices,

1614
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,746
and then you have everything else in the middle.

1615
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,039
And the reason you have that is because

1616
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,417
you have custom performance and fit implications

1617
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,418
for the specific devices.

1618
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,837
You don't want your light bulb

1619
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,799
to have to do a round trip to an IBM mainframe or something.

1620
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,675
It doesn't make any sense.

1621
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,801
You want it to have the embedded device

1622
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,762
so that it senses whatever you want.

1623
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,346
Senses whether there's light in the room.

1624
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,223
That's just a specific chip,

1625
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,726
and so, I think the scenario in which you only have

1626
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,895
a few big AI models is the scenario in which

1627
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,855
not only are those models the smartest,

1628
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,900
but they're also the cheapest, and the most power efficient,

1629
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,236
and the fastest, and easiest to adopt and use

1630
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,113
for every scenario,

1631
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,782
and I think that's highly unlikely

1632
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,408
just because, if this is the breakthrough

1633
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,911
that we believe it to be, and it's the computer industry V2,

1634
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,413
you're going to want models in everything.

1635
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,625
So you're going to want AI infused into everything,

1636
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,376
and then, for a lot of those infusions,

1637
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:31,088
you don't need your doorknob to teach you quantum physics,

1638
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,589
but you do need it to be really good

1639
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,049
at knowing that it's you and not somebody else.

1640
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:34,883
Yep. Right?

1641
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,384
And so you're going to have all of these

1642
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,552
hyper-optimized use cases,

1643
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,138
and so, my guess in the way we're betting

1644
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,807
is you're— Everywhere all at once.

1645
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,891
You're going to have that pyramid approach.

1646
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,059
Yeah. And then, look,

1647
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,186
the economics are going to be a big part of that,

1648
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:50,816
if only because the doorknob gets to run a local power,

1649
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,276
and then the processing the doorknob needs to do

1650
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,778
is a tiny fraction of what you need to do

1651
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,404
when you ask GPT-5 a query.

1652
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,324
And so, I think this is computer industry v2 in that way.

1653
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,450
And how do the markets play out where,

1654
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,453
is it just a normal battle price performance

1655
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,038
with proprietary players?

1656
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,957
How big a player is open source here?

1657
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,085
Charlie mentioned Oracle earlier.

1658
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,920
I feel like people today forget

1659
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,922
that the proprietary databases

1660
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,465
used to be the best databases

1661
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,424
all the way through the 90s,

1662
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,593
and you had to, step one of founding an internet company,

1663
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,220
was write a check to Oracle,

1664
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,180
and then you can do stuff after that.

1665
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,016
And then the open source databases,

1666
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,768
most people in post-grads became competitive

1667
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,061
in the 2000s.

1668
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,397
You don't like me reasoning by analogy

1669
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,231
too much here,

1670
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,441
but can you reason by analogy to the database world?

1671
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,776
Just how does the market structure play out?

1672
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,153
Yeah, no, I think that's right. I think that's right.

1673
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,571
I think that's actually a good comp.

1674
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,156
Another one is operating systems.

1675
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,740
So, when I was a kid,

1676
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,411
the world's best operating systems were specifically,

1677
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,413
Windows is its own trajectory, and iOS,

1678
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,708
but for what we used to describe

1679
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,335
as proper computing on real computers,

1680
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,672
like Unix computers, including supercomputers

1681
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,049
and workstations, and advanced scientific applications,

1682
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,927
things like that, the best versions of Unix

1683
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,304
were proprietary for a very long time,

1684
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,556
and you had these really big companies, like DEC,

1685
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,683
and HP and others, IBM,

1686
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,642
that had their own versions of Unix

1687
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,728
and they made a lot of money on those,

1688
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,273
and then Linux, same story.

1689
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,192
Linux came along, looked like a toy,

1690
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,651
and then 10 years later it was better

1691
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,611
than all the proprietary ones

1692
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,070
and all the proprietary ones died.

1693
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,323
That's my guess, is that something like that.

1694
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,783
I definitely think we'll live in a world

1695
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,035
of a small number of big models

1696
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,036
that'll be incredibly valuable

1697
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,330
and incredibly widely used for many things.

1698
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,207
My guess is we are going to live in a world

1699
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,918
in which most aggregate AI is going to be executed

1700
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,003
probably on smaller-form factors,

1701
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,255
and probably most of that is going to be open source.

1702
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,924
So where is ground zero, where the rate of change

1703
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,258
would be highest?

1704
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,886
Software development? Somewhere else?

1705
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,720
Software development

1706
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,763
is a very good candidate for that,

1707
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,931
just because you have people building

1708
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,807
for themselves, I think,

1709
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,644
and you have this incredibly tight iterative loop,

1710
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,980
and you see that with these AI tool companies,

1711
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,023
so that's the claim,

1712
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:55,815
and then, by the way, the other advantage

1713
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:56,650
of software development is,

1714
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,443
this is a really underrated thing

1715
00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,527
with respect to AI adoption

1716
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,820
that a lot of the people in the field are missing,

1717
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,989
is software development is not regulated,

1718
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,492
and so it's like impossible— Yet.

1719
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,370
Well, there is that. They are trying.

1720
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,789
The enemies of progress and freedom are trying,

1721
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,290
and we are fighting them very hard,

1722
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,626
but AI medicine actually can't move that fast,

1723
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,670
because it's regulated, and AI can't be a doctor.

1724
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,004
It can't get licensed.

1725
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:18,838
AI can't be a lawyer,

1726
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,508
it can't go make an argument at a court,

1727
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,676
and so forth and so on,

1728
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:27,055
and so, the unregulated fields populated by

1729
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,182
the same kinds of people who are building AI.

1730
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,475
Charlie had the interesting question

1731
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:34,479
of are we overestimating the broad impact

1732
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,481
and underestimating the specific impact,

1733
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,483
or what of, at least for the next five years,

1734
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,902
as you say, AI in medicine or AI in law

1735
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,279
doesn't make that much progress

1736
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,030
because of some of the challenges,

1737
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,783
but software engineering is totally transformed.

1738
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,868
So the counter argument, I think there's a big argument

1739
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,121
in that direction, and, by the way, I actually wrote

1740
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,956
a big Substack piece maybe we can link to,

1741
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,249
talking about how the employment shifts

1742
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,792
everybody's worried about are actually not going to happen

1743
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,335
at anywhere near the velocity people think,

1744
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:01,298
because a significant percentage of jobs

1745
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,550
in the US literally are licensed or unionized,

1746
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,427
or civil service in a way where they literally

1747
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,386
cannot be replaced,

1748
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,013
and so, I do think there is part of that.

1749
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,015
Having said that, I think things are going to pop

1750
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:10,849
in really interesting ways,

1751
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,977
and so, for example, ChatGPT is in fact

1752
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,312
a better doctor than your doctor today,

1753
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,813
with almost a hundred percent certainty,

1754
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,274
and just the fact that it can't literally be your doctor

1755
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,108
doesn't mean you're not going to ask all the

1756
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,484
doctor questions.

1757
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,652
And then you already have people online

1758
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,571
who are taking surreptitious camera-phone footage

1759
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:28,116
of their own doctor asking ChatGPT during the appointment.

1760
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,743
I think the medicine use case is an interesting one,

1761
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,703
because it turns out it was a space

1762
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,497
where most people were actually intelligence bottlenecked,

1763
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,416
which, it's like test-time compute,

1764
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,043
they were getting a very small fraction

1765
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,045
of their doctor's headspace,

1766
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,964
and if you put just more thought on the problems,

1767
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,591
you can get really good outcomes.

1768
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,217
And, by the way, medicine and law,

1769
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,720
you could also look at the self-driving car thing,

1770
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,222
which is, there's always this test for self-driving cars,

1771
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,223
there's always been this question of

1772
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,267
is the requirement perfection

1773
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,228
or is the requirement better than the median human driver?

1774
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,772
And if you apply that same question

1775
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,316
into law or medicine, it's just overwhelmingly clear

1776
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,151
that you're better off today with doctor ChatGPT.

1777
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,029
Now, in one sense, you can't live your life that way,

1778
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:06,863
because it can't be your doctor.

1779
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,573
On the other hand, you can sit there all day long

1780
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,657
talking to it about your health.

1781
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,492
Yep. And, by the way,

1782
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,910
I think there's going to be a lot of tension

1783
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,162
and a lot of drama in these different fields

1784
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,247
as that happens, but here's another ar argument

1785
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,165
that comes back around on this,

1786
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,501
which is the argument of "Oh, AI's horrible

1787
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,543
because it's going to lead to five companies

1788
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:24,506
controlling everything," and that's it.

1789
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,257
The monopoly cartel fear,

1790
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,802
and there's a bunch of reasons to be suspicious of that,

1791
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,969
including things like open source,

1792
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,554
but the other reason to be suspicious is,

1793
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,557
at least with downstream impact is AI is already

1794
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,684
maybe the most democratically-distributed

1795
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,603
technology in history,

1796
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,022
so 600 million people or whatever the number now is,

1797
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:43,441
on ChatGPT in two years,

1798
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,110
and again, you compare that to internet adoption,

1799
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,362
it's far faster, and of course,

1800
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,072
the reason is because the internet exists today

1801
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:49,948
to be able to distribute it,

1802
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:53,034
but the world's most advanced AI is in an app

1803
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,160
that 600 million people have.

1804
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,162
It's not in the one that I have or that you have.

1805
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,123
It's the one that 600 million people have,

1806
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:02,252
and so this technology has already been hyper-democratized,

1807
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,923
and so it's going to be in everybody's hands.

1808
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,341
And people get confused about this,

1809
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,509
because they're like, "Well, why would

1810
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,468
big companies do that?"

1811
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,302
And the reason is because the mass market's

1812
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,595
always the biggest market.

1813
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,890
You want to get to everybody if you're trying to build

1814
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,724
the most successful company,

1815
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,643
and to be the company that is the most important,

1816
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,520
and look, for sure there are always concerns

1817
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,688
about aggregation of power

1818
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,565
and centralization of power, for sure,

1819
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,108
but there's this other thing which is,

1820
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,986
what if this is just the philosopher's stone,

1821
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,655
the alchemy of sand into thought,

1822
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,490
in literally everybody's hand,

1823
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,242
right out of the gate? Well, so there's a...

1824
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,411
if you look back at the old companies,

1825
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,747
you look at the S&P 500 of some 1980,

1826
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:43,585
there's not that much change in the success based on tech.

1827
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,879
I.e. it's not like some bank gets better tech

1828
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,923
than all the others and just goes past all the competitors.

1829
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:49,966
If what you're saying is true,

1830
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,800
you would say that old companies

1831
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,634
are going to adapt less well

1832
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,095
to this. Oh, 100%.

1833
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,306
And the level of change is going to be unprecedented.

1834
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,390
Yeah. I believe that to be the case.

1835
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,475
Well, so again, let's go back

1836
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,601
to the computer industry on this.

1837
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,227
This, I think is a very interesting idea.

1838
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,730
So, the computer industry started out

1839
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,106
by building the big thing.

1840
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,149
Started out by building the mainframe.

1841
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,234
Thomas Watson Senior, who ran IBM in the 1950s,

1842
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,278
said he thought there was a world market for five computers,

1843
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,323
and it was literally one mainframe each

1844
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,115
for the three big insurance companies,

1845
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,950
and then two for the Department of Defense,

1846
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:16,784
and that was it.

1847
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,161
And, by the way, at that time, it was true.

1848
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,537
That was the world market—

1849
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,371
For those computers.

1850
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,706
For those computers at that time,

1851
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:24,083
and then basically, over 40 years, he went from mainframe,

1852
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,419
to mini computer, to client server, to, as you said,

1853
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,254
to PC, and to phone, and so what happened is over 40 years,

1854
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:32,008
the technology cascaded down into the mass market,

1855
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,426
and then today, it's culminated in

1856
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,387
the $10 Android smartphone in India,

1857
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,058
and so, that was that.

1858
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,227
AI, at least so far, and, by the way,

1859
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,937
many other categories of new technology

1860
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,563
in the last 30 years, because smartphone

1861
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,481
is another example of this,

1862
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,358
or have been the reverse, which is no,

1863
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,902
the individual gets it first.

1864
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,946
The companies are deciding to go

1865
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:53,947
for the individual market first,

1866
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,240
because that's the largest market,

1867
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,533
and those are the people who are

1868
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,659
the easiest to adopt. It's Andy Warhol,

1869
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,911
"The president drinks the same Coke as you and I." Yeah.

1870
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,288
Exactly, and then what happens is, over time,

1871
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,999
and this is what I think happens with smartphones,

1872
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,919
and this is what I believe is happening with AI,

1873
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,921
which is the individuals get it first, adopt it first,

1874
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,923
the small businesses get it second, adopt it second,

1875
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,258
the big businesses get it third,

1876
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,717
and the government gets it forth.

1877
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,553
Not because the governments and the big companies

1878
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,930
couldn't get it faster if they wanted to,

1879
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,599
but they can't, because they can't absorb it.

1880
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,642
They have all their rules

1881
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,477
and then have all their bureaucracy

1882
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,062
and they just simply can't absorb it,

1883
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,857
and so, and again, at the level of politics,

1884
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,859
structured society, you could say this is like

1885
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,069
a fight between the power of the individual

1886
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,238
versus the power of the state.

1887
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,073
Obviously, there's fears of like AI surveillance

1888
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,700
and all these things on the state,

1889
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,535
but the other side is every individual citizen

1890
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,870
being super empowered, being a PhD in everything,

1891
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,289
including how to deal with the state.

1892
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,748
Right?

1893
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,333
So everybody, all of a sudden is a super lawyer.

1894
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,751
Yep. Okay, and then,

1895
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,461
within business, it's the balance of power

1896
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,171
between small companies and big companies.

1897
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,215
And, if you're just looking at speed of adoption,

1898
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,092
there's no question small companies are adopting faster.

1899
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,012
I was going to ask about that, because Robert Solow said

1900
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,513
the computer age shows up everywhere

1901
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,223
except the productivity statistics,

1902
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,350
AI productivity is showing up everywhere

1903
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,894
except the hiring plans of your portfolio companies,

1904
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,230
which still seem to be hiring a lot of humans.

1905
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,482
What does the realization of significant

1906
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,192
AI productivity-gains look like?

1907
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,570
Because presumably like stodgy, large companies

1908
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,698
you believe will fight the gains at some level.

1909
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,491
They won't take as much AI productivity as they should.

1910
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,285
So, I think the most basic question,

1911
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,705
the fundamental question of, is this a centralizing power

1912
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,332
or is this a democratization of power?

1913
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,166
And— So do you think

1914
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,292
it'll make smaller companies more powerful

1915
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,543
in the battle against large companies?

1916
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,086
I think there's a really good chance of that.

1917
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,588
I don't know for sure and we'll see.

1918
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,174
But it seems certain that it will make younger companies

1919
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,842
more successful against older companies.

1920
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,762
I would assume so, or the kinds of—

1921
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,347
Less bureaucratic. That have the kinds of...

1922
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,181
Right. Exactly.

1923
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:47,018
Less bureaucratic, but let's take the employment

1924
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,895
and the jobs thing, just because that's the one

1925
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,854
that gets all the headlines,

1926
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,147
which is it's just like, "Oh, all the jobs are going to

1927
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,273
go away, because AI's going to do everything.

1928
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:55,276
So one version of it is, okay, that is going to be the thing

1929
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:57,236
of it, and this leads to the meme

1930
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,529
of five companies are going to own the world

1931
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,697
and you have, whatever, three years to get out

1932
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,990
from the permanent underclass.

1933
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,824
Yeah. Right?

1934
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,451
Whatever, whatever. Right, this leads to that.

1935
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,744
The more conventional economic argument

1936
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:07,413
is the opposite argument, which is, this is going to deliver

1937
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,457
massive productivity improvements,

1938
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,960
not just to companies, but also to individuals.

1939
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,088
When you put a technology in the hands of an individual,

1940
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,840
it massively increases their productivity,

1941
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,258
and the way I think about that is AI

1942
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,886
just makes every individual a super PhD in every topic.

1943
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,429
That's the most dramatic increase

1944
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,556
in what economists call marginal productivity of the worker

1945
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,058
that has ever existed,

1946
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,309
and so, as a consequence,

1947
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:30,436
every single one of those people is now capable of doing

1948
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,730
so much more than they were ever capable of doing before.

1949
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,649
Whether they're doing that as a solo entrepreneur

1950
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,858
or whether they're doing that as somebody

1951
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,610
who works in an organization.

1952
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,529
And so, in that version of the world,

1953
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,364
you don't get the aggregating effects.

1954
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,991
You get some, but they're swamped by the democratization

1955
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,910
and the superpowers that every individual gets,

1956
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,036
and then 10 years from now,

1957
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,538
we'll do part two of this,

1958
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,915
probably with the same glass of beer,

1959
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,000
with the same room temperature,

1960
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,712
and we will be shocked by how much AI drove

1961
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,340
both employment growth and drove incomes,

1962
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,259
because again, the conventional economic view is

1963
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,844
marginal productivity improvements,

1964
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,678
you want to hire more people at higher

1965
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,512
levels of productivity,

1966
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,473
because they can do more, and then you pay them a lot more

1967
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,641
because they can help at a higher rate-

1968
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,351
A huge part of that is, when people think about this,

1969
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,978
is intelligence but not imagination.

1970
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,521
Right. If you go back to 1950,

1971
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:17,191
there's some movie there where basically a single person

1972
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,693
is a cell in Excel.

1973
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,654
They're all sitting in a big room, effectively,

1974
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,072
doing accounting.

1975
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,075
If you described the computing evolution,

1976
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,660
they would all say, "I'm going to lose my job,"

1977
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,663
but the jobs that emerge, video gaming,

1978
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,832
you couldn't imagine, you couldn't describe,

1979
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,251
so it's very hard, I think, for people to overcome

1980
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,044
the jobs they can see existing disappearing,

1981
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,880
but they can't see the emergence of new categories—

1982
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,922
That's right. But we've always had

1983
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,424
the emergence of those new categories.

1984
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,508
That's right. And if you take things

1985
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,386
like sport, which I think is like 3%, 4% of GDP,

1986
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,222
you can imagine that extending to 20% of GDP,

1987
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,433
and whole new sports emerging.

1988
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,185
If you get more GDP— We already have

1989
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,811
whole new sports emerging with eSports,

1990
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:58,357
and, so you can argue all sports have gotten way bigger

1991
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,192
over the past five years.

1992
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,652
Like basketball is way bigger, F1 is obviously way bigger.

1993
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,154
Just, they've all gotten much bigger.

1994
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,447
Yeah. We're even bringing soccer

1995
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,406
to the US, which—

1996
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,240
Exactly.

1997
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,492
It's even inconceivable.

1998
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,618
No, that's exactly right,

1999
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,411
and yeah, and then the corellator to that,

2000
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,330
by the way, this is very difficult to talk about,

2001
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,164
because people get very upset,

2002
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,333
but the correlator to that is those old jobs,

2003
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,793
after the fact, you're just like, "I can't believe

2004
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,170
human beings were required to do that,"

2005
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,004
because literally, like as you're alluding to,

2006
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,172
what happened,

2007
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,049
the original— Back-breaking Excel work.

2008
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,218
The original computer

2009
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,178
was a person sitting at a desk doing manual math

2010
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,137
all day long.

2011
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,847
Imagine if I showed up today and told you

2012
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,516
that's what your kids are going to be doing as a profession.

2013
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,892
You'd be like, "Sounds like torture."

2014
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,769
Have you read ever, Iain M. Banks,

2015
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,479
the science fiction author?

2016
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,313
"The Culture Suits."

2017
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,189
No, I've actually never read that. No.

2018
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:41,108
Okay, he tries hard to contemplate

2019
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,694
what a super-advanced society with AI is like,

2020
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,988
and what's interesting is, everyone has stuff

2021
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,450
that looks like a job, but is actually leisure.

2022
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,701
Right, well, the best jobs in the world have

2023
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,203
that characteristic, right? Yeah.

2024
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,080
And then you have very complex status hierarchies

2025
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,540
as people aspire, and if you look

2026
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,793
at Gemeinschaftic societies, like Formula One

2027
01:03:58,793 --> 01:03:59,752
or something like that,

2028
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:02,171
you have a very clear motivation

2029
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,173
states hierarchy for people within it

2030
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,591
that seems to fill

2031
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:06,592
a lot of human needs. Aren't you describing

2032
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,426
being a VC?

2033
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,261
I've seen the activities

2034
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,762
that lots of VCs go to. Yes!

2035
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,013
Exactly, as we like to say,

2036
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,431
it's a nine-through-four profession,

2037
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,183
so— Exactly.

2038
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,018
It's a country club kind of thing.

2039
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,436
The other, by the way, great economic fallacy

2040
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,479
that I just see everywhere right now,

2041
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,439
is this idea that AI is somehow going to be

2042
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,358
this hyper-successful thing.

2043
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,693
Hyper acceleration of productivity

2044
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,778
and dramatically change everything, destroy all the jobs,

2045
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:26,821
and yet somehow that's going to lead

2046
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,823
to people being eviscerated, and being poor

2047
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:29,657
and not having anything,

2048
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,617
and the missing element there is that

2049
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:33,870
even if that scenario plays out, which I think,

2050
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,580
as I said, I don't think it's a centralization scenario,

2051
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,747
but even if it played out,

2052
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:39,333
the result would be hyper deflation of prices,

2053
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,793
which is the thing that people miss,

2054
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:43,504
and so, in that environment,

2055
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,964
with that level of productivity growth,

2056
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,133
the price of business services will collapse,

2057
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,676
and things that today cost a lot of money

2058
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,094
will all of a sudden all be cheap or free.

2059
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,053
This is sort of the—

2060
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,555
Everything becomes oversupplied.

2061
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,975
In Star Trek, GDP would be zero.

2062
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:56,976
Right. Because you just—

2063
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:57,810
The replicator does everything.

2064
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,644
The replicator does everything.

2065
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,354
Right, and so things that cost

2066
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,606
a hundred dollars cost a penny.

2067
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:06,569
In that world, even real GDP looks like it's shrunk,

2068
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,030
and everybody is much, much, much, much better off,

2069
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:09,947
and by the way, this is not the first time this is,

2070
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:12,992
there have been periods of sustained deflation in the past.

2071
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:13,951
Well, you see it within categories.

2072
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,453
Look at the spend on CDs.

2073
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,538
Yeah. Yeah. Music CDs versus

2074
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,748
music today. So, I always talk

2075
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,334
a lot of the so-called second industrial revolution,

2076
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,795
so the time in which our entire modern world was built

2077
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:25,755
with everything from airplanes

2078
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,299
to freeways and everything else, 1880 to late 1930,

2079
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,718
it's that 50-year stretch,

2080
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,553
and for a lot of that period,

2081
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:33,763
they were in essentially a protracted

2082
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,765
deflationary depression,

2083
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,516
because what happened was the technology

2084
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,352
for acquiring and processing raw materials

2085
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,355
was advancing so fast that there were gluts in all

2086
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,648
the different raw materials,

2087
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:46,317
and so it felt like the economy was caving in,

2088
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,610
because prices were collapsing,

2089
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,321
economic activity was down, GDP was down.

2090
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,239
In reality, what happened was a massive surge

2091
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,783
in productivity growth and a massive surge

2092
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,076
in material prosperity,

2093
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,786
and over that period, both productivity growth

2094
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,706
and economic growth advanced something like 3x of our time,

2095
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,376
but if you read the books at the time,

2096
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,710
they're obsessed with this problem of like,

2097
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,420
"Oh, my God, there's this oversupply of iron,

2098
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,130
what are we ever possibly going to do with it?"

2099
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,924
And it's destroying the economics

2100
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,717
of the iron-production business.

2101
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:16,681
Could you not have low-productivity segments

2102
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,558
of the economy find ways to

2103
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:25,106
avoid the prices collapsing too much—

2104
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,816
Yes. Such that you

2105
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,234
don't get this effect, and people—

2106
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,360
Baumol's cost disease.

2107
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,904
Yeah, we've gotten much better at healthcare

2108
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,365
over the past 50 years, and yet.

2109
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,200
Yes, yes, so, Baumol's cost disease,

2110
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,284
but also just simply, government.

2111
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:38,119
You see this today.

2112
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:41,372
So, basically, it today what happens if you chart,

2113
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,833
basically, the prices of products

2114
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,292
across all these sectors, what you see is—

2115
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:46,585
The deflationary economy and the inflationary economy.

2116
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:48,212
Yeah, there's two different economies,

2117
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,548
and the deflationary economy is everything electronic,

2118
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,383
everything software, everything media,

2119
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,510
by the way, basically everything, all light manufacturing,

2120
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,720
clothes and everything.

2121
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,138
Well, not housing.

2122
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,389
So, the price of clothes collapses,

2123
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,599
the price of housing hyper-rises—

2124
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,101
Oh, sorry. Yeah, they rise. They deviate.

2125
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,353
On the other side, on the non-productive side,

2126
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,897
you've got housing, education, and healthcare,

2127
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:10,067
and that, I think, explains a lot of the politics

2128
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,111
and feeling of our society right now,

2129
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,239
which is just, everything that's optional

2130
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,449
and fun is getting super cheap,

2131
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,700
and everything that's actually necessary

2132
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,578
to raise a family is getting like hyper-expensive,

2133
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:21,746
and, exactly to your point,

2134
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,456
it's because these are two different economies,

2135
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,000
and then you look at, and this gets complicated,

2136
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,752
but if you look at housing, and healthcare,

2137
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,920
and education, what they all have in common is

2138
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,005
heavy government interference,

2139
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,632
specifically of the form of restricting supply.

2140
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,551
In all cases, the government basically restricts

2141
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,344
how many houses can get built,

2142
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:38,971
they restrict how many doctors can get licensed,

2143
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:42,933
they restrict how many universities can get accredited,

2144
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,352
and then because restricted supply

2145
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,813
leads to prices skyrocketing, the voters get mad

2146
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,732
and so then, the politicians subsidize.

2147
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:50,775
In all three of those markets,

2148
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,234
there's massive government subsidies,

2149
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,277
federal student loan programs,

2150
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:55,654
federal mortgage programs, federal healthcare programs,

2151
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:57,990
and, basic economics,

2152
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,993
if you constrain supply, you cause prices to rise,

2153
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,704
and if you subsidize demand, you cause prices to rise.

2154
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,956
I think this is basically the state

2155
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:08,125
of the Western democracies over the last 50 years is,

2156
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:12,046
every step of the way, as the price of what they call

2157
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:17,051
the American dream, housing, education, and healthcare,

2158
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,094
as the price of those rise,

2159
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,223
the pressure from the government to subsidize increases,

2160
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,390
which just drives the prices higher,

2161
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,643
and so, you're in this ever-escalating spiral.

2162
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,478
I'm presuming you're concerned about more of that.

2163
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:30,606
Everyone's making fun of the Boston City Council,

2164
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,399
objecting to Waymo, and maybe voting

2165
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,734
to preserve driving jobs and everything like that,

2166
01:08:34,734 --> 01:08:36,569
and so we find more categories

2167
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:38,531
to turn into healthcare or education.

2168
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,865
Yeah, so sinecures fundamentally

2169
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:41,200
and then Baumol's cost disease kicks in,

2170
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,912
because then you have the hyper

2171
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,247
incomes being earned by people

2172
01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:48,791
in the deflating sectors

2173
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,126
where there's massive productivity growth,

2174
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,627
and then people in healthcare

2175
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:52,461
get to command those wages,

2176
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:53,504
and the whole thing compounds

2177
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,546
and gets worse.

2178
01:08:54,546 --> 01:08:56,799
By default, this is what the governments are going to do.

2179
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,635
In fact, by default, it's what they're

2180
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,053
exactly doing today,

2181
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,180
and then there's a really tricky political-economy

2182
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,807
thing to this, which is,

2183
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,225
it's very hard to tell the voters,

2184
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,393
"Don't vote for the guy who says

2185
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,810
he's going to subsidize housing more."

2186
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,645
Right. Right?

2187
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,022
So, are you worried about this as a political future?

2188
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:12,857
Yes, 100%.

2189
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:15,818
Well, I think this is our political present.

2190
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:18,904
Sure, sure. I was thinking an expanded version.

2191
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,281
Oh, an expanded version, 100%.

2192
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,866
I'll give you the latest example of this.

2193
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,535
Latest example, so remember the dock workers strike?

2194
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:25,703
Oh, I do. Okay.

2195
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,912
Remember the guy with the gold chain, the whole thing,

2196
01:09:27,912 --> 01:09:29,372
and we found out about the dock workers

2197
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:30,249
and you dig into it, and you're like,

2198
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,667
"Oh, the dock workers union, it's the reason

2199
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:34,002
why we've got—" Reason why European ports

2200
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:35,880
are way more productive than the US.

2201
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,090
Automated ports, because you have unions,

2202
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,383
and they have a tremendous amount of political stroke.

2203
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:41,176
One of the things that was discovered

2204
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:42,511
during that process that I didn't know,

2205
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,180
is that in prior union agreements with the dock workers,

2206
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,682
they already had a one-to-one ratio

2207
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,809
of people sitting at home doing nothing

2208
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,853
to every productive dock worker as a consequence

2209
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,729
of the last, whatever, 60 years of these things.

2210
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:54,273
So, basically, there's a long history here

2211
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,108
that just never became visible in public,

2212
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:58,110
which is every time any kind of new automation

2213
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:58,944
shows up at the docks,

2214
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,321
the dock workers renegotiate the contract

2215
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,530
to preserve the jobs,

2216
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,908
which literally means people sitting at home,

2217
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,702
and that was before the most recent agreements,

2218
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:07,536
and that's just a micro example

2219
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:08,746
that's easy to pick on.

2220
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,081
The much larger example is the civil service,

2221
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,834
public-sector unions, obviously,

2222
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:15,628
and then here we're into teachers unions

2223
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,921
and nursing unions and—

2224
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,756
Yes, yes. All of these things.

2225
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,091
And then, here we're into this fairly amazing

2226
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:23,177
bizarre world we've been in for the last 50 years,

2227
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,803
where you have, especially around government,

2228
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,388
you have both civil service protections

2229
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:29,183
and union protections, so, exactly.

2230
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,268
So, by default, the political economy

2231
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:32,645
makes all of this worse and worse.

2232
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,105
By the way, this is why I think inflation

2233
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,649
doesn't mean what it used to.

2234
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,943
Inflation 50 or 100-years-ago used to mean

2235
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,861
the price of raw materials was so important

2236
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,530
in the economy that you felt it very directly.

2237
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,699
Now, that, as you say, you've got this—

2238
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:46,825
It's hard to talk about a single bundle.

2239
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,953
Yeah, because it's not the same thing,

2240
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,455
and this is the thing, where you can't build a family

2241
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,540
off of the price of the iPhone.

2242
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,793
Just because everybody has infinite media on their iPhone

2243
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,211
for free does not mean that they feel good

2244
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,379
if they can't buy a house.

2245
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:02,383
I liked your, what was your inflation stat?

2246
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:06,345
Of if there's a hole in your drywall, it's cheaper to put

2247
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,179
a flat-screen TV over it

2248
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:09,014
than it is to repair the drywall.

2249
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,599
100%. Exactly.

2250
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,977
Let me drag us back to AI a sec.

2251
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,063
You used to have the 10x engineer,

2252
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,731
you going to have the 1,000x engineer with AI?

2253
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:20,192
Yeah, for sure. I think you already do, in practice.

2254
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,026
Okay. And, of course,

2255
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:22,403
we have had for a long time.

2256
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:24,655
I mean we've had the 1,000x engineer for a long time,

2257
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:25,614
it's just, it's becoming— We're going to add

2258
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:26,573
another order. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2259
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:27,574
It's becoming more visible.

2260
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,285
It's going to apply in more areas of software,

2261
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,369
and then, look, the other thing is

2262
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,579
just the payoff to software has been rising,

2263
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:34,081
because the markets are so much larger now.

2264
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,791
This goes back to the why would this time be different

2265
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,667
with AI versus the internet?

2266
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,335
Which is just, well, okay, this is the first time

2267
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:39,628
in human history that you've had five billion

2268
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,630
people connected on an interactive network,

2269
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,757
and if you are a provider of products

2270
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:45,634
and services that go into that market,

2271
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,636
if it worked, it may or not work,

2272
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,888
but if it works, it can get infinitely large,

2273
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:51,682
and actually really fast now,

2274
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:54,810
and so, what is the upside?

2275
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:58,063
How many people are there in the world

2276
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:59,273
who are going to pay whatever it is,

2277
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,817
20 bucks a month for the world's best AI?

2278
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,569
So, you can— It's not all five billion,

2279
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,779
but it's a much larger number

2280
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:07,072
than you would've had 10,

2281
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,824
or 20, or 30 years ago,

2282
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,868
and maybe it's just simply market size.

2283
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,332
As you just heard from Marc, we're in the midst

2284
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,375
of a massive platform shift with AI.

2285
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,669
It's like the computer industry v2,

2286
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,629
and Stripe is the company building the economic

2287
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,423
infrastructure for AI.

2288
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,133
If you've used an AI product recently,

2289
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,801
you've almost certainly used Stripe.

2290
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,845
More than three quarters of the Forbes AI 50,

2291
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,431
including OpenAI, Anthropic, Lovable, ElevenLabs,

2292
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,891
Perplexity, Cursor, Midjourney,

2293
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,894
they all use Stripe to monetize their products,

2294
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,812
and they're growing at a historic pace.

2295
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,231
We analyzed the top hundred AI startups on Stripe

2296
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:43,442
and found they reached the million dollar revenue milestone

2297
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,903
four months faster than the SaaS companies

2298
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,071
that preceded them.

2299
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,782
AI companies choose Stripe for high converting checkout,

2300
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,618
instant global reach, and AI-driven payments performance,

2301
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,745
all while monetizing in the ways that they need

2302
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,872
with subscriptions and usage-based billing.

2303
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:59,333
And then as AI agents begin to buy on our behalves,

2304
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,585
Stripe is building the tooling for agent e-commerce

2305
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,046
so that any business can thrive in this next era.

2306
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,091
So come to Stripe to explore our MCP toolkit,

2307
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,258
agentic payment flows,

2308
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:10,511
and everything your AI business needs.

2309
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,641
You've been super early to crypto with a16z.

2310
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,227
It's probably the area where there's been the most

2311
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:21,480
concentration of VC performance.

2312
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,566
You, Paradigm, not that many others.

2313
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:27,319
Two questions. Why did so few VCs focus on crypto?

2314
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:28,946
Yeah. And then how important

2315
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,155
is stablecoins going to be?

2316
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,490
So, sorry, the first question is why did they,

2317
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,699
or why didn't— Why didn't they?

2318
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:33,534
Didn't they.

2319
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,036
So, what I've— Status or...?

2320
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,164
So one is you could always just say the easy explanation

2321
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,082
is just they didn't understand it

2322
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,333
or they were focused on other things.

2323
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,751
What I've observed is that,

2324
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,586
as technology has become more important,

2325
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:45,963
people's belief systems have a lot more

2326
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,339
to do with technology,

2327
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:49,216
so your worldview,

2328
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:51,927
the part of your brain that thinks about things,

2329
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,053
a larger and larger percentage of that

2330
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,179
is devoted to technology,

2331
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,013
and, of course, if you're a VC,

2332
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:55,848
that's a hundred percent,

2333
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,307
and then whatever you're spending your time on,

2334
01:13:57,307 --> 01:14:02,104
you form whatever myths, legends, religion, cults,

2335
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:05,065
so it means the same question

2336
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:07,276
of why is the press so much more focused on technology

2337
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,653
than they were 15 years ago? It's—

2338
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:11,363
Essentially, it was harder to be politicized

2339
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:12,823
about AOL and eBay—

2340
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:13,740
Yeah, who could get— Than it's today.

2341
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,575
Yeah. Exactly.

2342
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,618
I think what we observed is, a lot of VCs

2343
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,704
who were very logical and passionate

2344
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,998
on topics like SaaS

2345
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,583
for which there's no religion.

2346
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:23,459
It's hard to get political

2347
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,418
about SaaS. It's hard to get political

2348
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:25,711
about SaaS, and for some reason,

2349
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,753
there was something about crypto

2350
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:28,422
where they just got locked in on, yeah,

2351
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,048
the politics or the whatever,

2352
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:32,551
and it was just like...

2353
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,470
Oh, so my theory of it after a while,

2354
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,429
because I just met so many people

2355
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,263
who would just flow with it,

2356
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:37,764
and it wasn't even that they were like, "Ah, we don't think

2357
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:38,599
it's going to be valuable."

2358
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:39,516
They were going to be like, "Oh, it's evil."

2359
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:41,894
"It's full-on evil." "It's a scam."

2360
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:42,853
"It's a fraud." "It's a this."

2361
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:43,729
"It's a that."

2362
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,607
If it works, it's evil. If it doesn't work, it's evil.

2363
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,150
One of one my tentative conclusions,

2364
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,319
was just money pisses people off,

2365
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,738
and so, making money through tech

2366
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,822
is usually an indirect process.

2367
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:54,698
In this case there was a

2368
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:55,866
more direct aspect— I see that.

2369
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:56,700
It interesting. People, really,

2370
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,994
people have always built up all kinds of weird religious

2371
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,329
and political views around money.

2372
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,331
And yeah, so what we experienced

2373
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,374
was people just got really upset,

2374
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:05,292
and we could never understand it,

2375
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:07,252
because what's the point of,

2376
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,879
being a venture capitalist, of all things,

2377
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,380
what's the point about being negatively upset

2378
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,673
about a new technology?

2379
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,884
And in particular, it feels like it requires

2380
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:17,888
high openness where, there's something about early crypto

2381
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:21,266
where it attracted folks like Balaji

2382
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,143
where there was all these grand pronouncements

2383
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:26,313
of like, "Oh, Bitcoin will supersede the nation state."

2384
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:29,816
It led to a lot of that kind of slightly cultish,

2385
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:32,277
very cyber punk.

2386
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:33,987
It really reminds me of the,

2387
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:36,573
what's the John Perry Barlow letter?

2388
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:38,450
"Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace."

2389
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:39,368
Exactly. Exactly.

2390
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,953
John Perry Barlow's the "Declaration of Independence

2391
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:41,787
of Cyberspace."

2392
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:42,621
There's a lot of that

2393
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,248
kind of vibe about crypto— That's right.

2394
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:48,043
And so it required one to be open-minded enough to think,

2395
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,253
"there could be something here,"

2396
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,505
and I think most people are not that high openness.

2397
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:52,714
High openness, and then it also got—

2398
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:53,674
But you're not that high openness.

2399
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:54,508
Building on that.

2400
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:58,262
Well, I'm, yeah, I don't know, but I'm not introspective

2401
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,304
so I don't have to think about that.

2402
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,182
It also got white coded.

2403
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:03,475
I think it got right wing coded,

2404
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,686
because it got libertarian coded,

2405
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,479
early, especially in the 2010s

2406
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:08,939
when everything got politicized,

2407
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,941
anything coded right libertarian was bad.

2408
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,735
And then, quite honestly, and maybe

2409
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:14,820
this will piss people off if I say it,

2410
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,905
but quite honestly, if you actually want to understand

2411
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,532
how it works, it actually is quite difficult.

2412
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,367
It is a complex, technical thing,

2413
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,535
and I think maybe—

2414
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:22,369
People don't understand the tech.

2415
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,579
Maybe people literally don't understand.

2416
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,290
I dealt with this a lot when I would deal with people

2417
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,708
who were causing us trouble in public,

2418
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:29,751
and I literally would try to explain it to them

2419
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,336
and I just fundamentally couldn't.

2420
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:33,505
By the time we're using the phrase

2421
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:34,464
Byzantine Generals Problem—

2422
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:35,591
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2423
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,301
Yeah. You're done.

2424
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,635
It's never going to work.

2425
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:41,388
My observation is that we have a friend who

2426
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,765
talks about how crypto contains multitudes,

2427
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,601
and that's the important thing you have to internalize,

2428
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,061
because the criticism you will hear

2429
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:49,688
is sometimes something like, "Oh, there's a lot

2430
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,023
of scams in crypto."

2431
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:51,982
That's right. And it's like,

2432
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:53,317
okay, crypto is this big box

2433
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:56,320
and within this big box, there's a lot of scams happening.

2434
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,032
There's like Vitalik types

2435
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,701
who are really interested in developing new protocols.

2436
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,370
There's people using it as a store of wealth,

2437
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,080
especially in emerging-market countries.

2438
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,999
There's people who are just interested

2439
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,834
in speculative number-go-up games.

2440
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:13,128
There's people who are passionate about developing new

2441
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,755
payment systems and they're working on

2442
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:16,048
Bitcoin Lightning or something like that.

2443
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:19,009
It's this big box that contains so much different stuff

2444
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:22,638
and there are strengths and there are weaknesses

2445
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,806
or there are things that we might not like.

2446
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:28,435
Again, I don't like some of the rug-pulling scam aspects,

2447
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,103
but it's just a big box with a whole

2448
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:31,813
lot of different stuff in it,

2449
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,024
and people seemed incapable of

2450
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:34,858
reasoning that way. Yeah.

2451
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:36,026
They'd see what they want to see,

2452
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:38,195
and, plus it was also you want to see the tech guys

2453
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,696
taken down a notch, and this is some way

2454
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:41,281
that tech guys are manufacturing magic money,

2455
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:44,576
and then maybe another more focused way

2456
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:47,204
of what you're saying is every new form

2457
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:49,539
of financial technology associated has been

2458
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:52,125
historically associated with some form of bubble and crash,

2459
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:53,502
and scams along with that,

2460
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,670
and the classic example of that

2461
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,089
that I think is illustrative for crypto,

2462
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:58,715
the invention of paper money.

2463
01:17:58,715 --> 01:17:59,966
Mm-hmm. John Law.

2464
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:01,510
John Law invented paper money in France

2465
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:04,471
about 360 years ago, and it immediately sparked

2466
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,889
what became the South Sea bubble,

2467
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:07,140
and actually, he ended up,

2468
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:08,892
basically, his life did not go well

2469
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:09,726
after that, because people got—

2470
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:10,560
No, he fled

2471
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,395
to Venice, I think. Fled to Venice

2472
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,563
and basically died poor, and—

2473
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:14,940
High-yield finance may be another example.

2474
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,441
What's that? High-yield finance.

2475
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:17,359
Michael Milken. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2476
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,193
Junk bonds. Junk bonds.

2477
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,486
Junk bonds were completely discredited

2478
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,655
by the time Mike Milken was sent to jail.

2479
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,365
Yeah, junk bonds had been completely discredited.

2480
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,658
because everybody, again, the moral story,

2481
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:26,576
everybody knew that it led to this massive bubble

2482
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:31,581
of all these deliberately high-risk bonds.

2483
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,126
Who would ever do that?

2484
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,503
That decade later that, that market was much larger

2485
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:37,713
than it ever had been in the 80s

2486
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,089
and was extremely well respected

2487
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:40,215
and it played a huge role in the

2488
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:41,717
build out of everything since,

2489
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,677
and so, new kinds of money lead to—

2490
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:44,845
So— New kinds of scams,

2491
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,054
lead to new rebels— Speaking of new

2492
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:46,888
kinds of money. Need new.

2493
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:47,723
Yeah?

2494
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,682
How do you think about stablecoins?

2495
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:51,351
Yeah, yeah, so stablecoins, I would say,

2496
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:52,269
primarily what I think about it is

2497
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:55,439
it's been super helpful to have stablecoins succeed,

2498
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,899
because it's just an obvious incredible use case.

2499
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,234
It's worked incredibly well.

2500
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,528
They're being used all over the world

2501
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,362
for many different reasons.

2502
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:05,157
The numbers are now extremely large.

2503
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:05,991
I think it's great.

2504
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,617
It was, originally, you guys probably know,

2505
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:10,537
it was originally part of Vitalik's early work.

2506
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:11,830
He had a very unfortunate,

2507
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,498
do you remember the original name for stablecoins?

2508
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:14,958
No. Colored coins.

2509
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:16,835
Oh, yes! Yes.

2510
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:19,421
Only an ESL speaker would pick that name,

2511
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,882
but the idea was a crypto token wrapped

2512
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,842
in a real world asset, so that was part

2513
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,427
of the original thinking on all this stuff.

2514
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,846
It's worked incredibly well for dollars.

2515
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,639
I believe that'll work incredibly well

2516
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,266
for many other kinds of assets.

2517
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,851
It's great, now having said that,

2518
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,019
the crypto purist natives are like,

2519
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:36,146
"Well, that's not the main thing,"

2520
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:39,191
because it's a bridge technology of the old world.

2521
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:42,277
I think it's great and I think it's fantastic

2522
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,653
that you have such a successful use case.

2523
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:46,531
So FinTech has generally not produced great companies

2524
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:48,325
or giant companies, because it's been

2525
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:49,367
country-by-country demarcated—

2526
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,202
He's here in our pub.

2527
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,703
In fact—

2528
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:53,663
He's really upset about the waiter.

2529
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,709
You end up with these very mediocre companies

2530
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:00,337
like Stripe, but fantastically managed.

2531
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:02,923
It seems like stablecoins could lead

2532
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,051
to the global scalability in FinTech

2533
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,469
that has been the prerequisite

2534
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,096
to making super-valuable tech companies.

2535
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:12,140
We've had some FinTech ones that we're very proud of,

2536
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:13,433
including Stripe.

2537
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:15,811
Just, it's the level of,

2538
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:18,480
one is regulation, and then it's particularly—

2539
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,774
And the payments is different because they did go global—

2540
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,275
They did go global. But not many companies

2541
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,653
have been able— But they have regulatory

2542
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:25,654
constraints there as well,

2543
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,781
and then the last decade in particular,

2544
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,157
a lot of the western countries,

2545
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:31,660
they've been, if anything, on a crusade against any kind

2546
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,703
of financial innovation, just on general principle,

2547
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:35,455
and so there's been these real regulatory government

2548
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:37,374
headwinds, and then just look,

2549
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:38,583
dealing with the banks,

2550
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,628
dealing with the credit card companies,

2551
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:42,504
dealing with these...

2552
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,882
They're not psyched at the idea of some kid

2553
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:46,716
with some new idea.

2554
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:48,927
They're just not, and so even if you have

2555
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:51,930
regulatory clearance, can you actually implement the thing

2556
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:52,764
is an open question,

2557
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:55,600
and so, I just think there's a lot of glue,

2558
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,434
a lot of stickiness.

2559
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:58,353
And then, look, to be fair,

2560
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:00,772
you could also say, look, it's a high hurdle

2561
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:03,984
to go to a consumer and to say you should trust your money

2562
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:04,818
with some new company,

2563
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:07,737
so there's a whole issue there, so, yeah.

2564
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:10,991
Yeah, so, yeah, I agree with your optimistic point of view.

2565
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:14,119
Yeah, this was always part of the crypto philosophy,

2566
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,954
which was programmable money.

2567
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,163
If you have programmable money,

2568
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:18,748
then all of a sudden you could have financial

2569
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:20,125
services work a lot more like software.

2570
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,543
You could have a much higher rate of innovation,

2571
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,378
and you're right, maybe we're starting to get there.

2572
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,463
Was there someone who really got you into crypto?

2573
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:28,008
I would say the main person was my partner, Chris Dixon.

2574
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:29,551
It was very early and had figured it out,

2575
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,720
and then we were involved in Coinbase early on,

2576
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,847
and so Brian and Fred at Coinbase

2577
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,765
were super helpful in helping us understand it.

2578
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:36,600
And how do you think—

2579
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,476
Oh, and, sorry, and the Balaji.

2580
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:40,395
Actually, Balaji's at the head of that list.

2581
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,898
And how do you think Chris cracked it so early?

2582
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:47,068
So, Chris' entire life has been this pursuit of,

2583
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,486
it's just how he thinks.

2584
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:49,446
He's just born to do this,

2585
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,406
and it's in pursuit.

2586
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:52,282
He uses these terms.

2587
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:53,783
He used one term, he says, "What nerds do

2588
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:57,120
on nights and weekends," is one way to look at it.

2589
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,290
Second way to look at it is "Good ideas

2590
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:03,126
look like bad ideas," and then his third

2591
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:06,212
most recent version of that is "internet cults."

2592
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:08,423
It's if it has like a thriving subreddit,

2593
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:09,674
then like something's going on.

2594
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:12,928
It's the other side of the people's negative emotion

2595
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,722
on this is, the things that become movements early.

2596
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:18,266
The internet enables movements.

2597
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,268
Yeah, this is the home-brew computer club—

2598
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,770
That's right. Thing.

2599
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,063
That's right. John, how did you think

2600
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:24,522
about stablecoins for you?

2601
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:26,566
It's funny, when you were saying crypto

2602
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:29,903
is an internet cult, we find that it's very vibes-based

2603
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:34,240
in a funny way where there's always a thing of Stripe is

2604
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,369
pro-crypto, we're super excited, Stripe is anti-crypto,

2605
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,080
not going to make it, Stripe is pro-crypto again.

2606
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,666
That's never how we've conceived of it.

2607
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,876
We just want to build things that people find useful,

2608
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:47,545
and the Bitcoin Whitepaper dropped in 2008,

2609
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,299
I want to say, and Stripe was founded in 2009,

2610
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:54,386
and so we've been watching all along, stuff.

2611
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,096
Wasn't it February '09? I think—

2612
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:56,930
It might have been '09. You're right.

2613
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,682
Yeah, but anyway, it was just before Stripe,

2614
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,684
and so, we've just been trying various things.

2615
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,060
We funded Stellar in the early days.

2616
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,353
We tried Bitcoin support.

2617
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:05,063
Original Bitcoin was a horrible payment method,

2618
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:05,897
you know what I mean?

2619
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:07,232
And the thing we have really noticed

2620
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:10,151
that's really striking is there's a level of

2621
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:13,613
consumer adoption and familiarity

2622
01:23:13,613 --> 01:23:15,115
that allows for mainstreaming.

2623
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,533
We just worked with Shopify,

2624
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:19,619
they now offer stablecoin payments

2625
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:21,663
on all of their checkouts, or they're rolling that out

2626
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:22,539
on all their checkouts.

2627
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,749
That's just not a thing that would've made sense

2628
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:26,543
even three or four years ago,

2629
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:30,338
and so, we're talking about the internet stuff,

2630
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,590
just at a certain point, Google and Facebook

2631
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:33,591
and all these companies start to work,

2632
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:36,803
and if you try to launch Facebook in 1998, it doesn't work,

2633
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:39,806
because there aren't enough internet connections.

2634
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,766
I think there weren't enough wallets

2635
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:42,976
for a lot of things to work.

2636
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,103
Even, you look at the stablecoin supply charts,

2637
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,939
we're growing at 40%, 50% year over year.

2638
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:49,441
It's the grains of rice and the chess board.

2639
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,193
You don't need that many years of 40% to 50%

2640
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:54,112
year-over-year growth before it really works,

2641
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:56,823
but it's been really striking for us over the past 18

2642
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,199
to 24 months where we've been trying

2643
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,369
to make different things work at various points,

2644
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:04,414
and we're going to be shut off products that don't work,

2645
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:09,044
but now, all of the products are really working all at once.

2646
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:09,878
Okay, I had some questions

2647
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:10,837
on the Andreessen Horowitz's business.

2648
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:11,880
Yeah. Why aren't you a hedge fund

2649
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,632
in that you, or why don't you do public investing?

2650
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:15,675
You don't have to be a hedge fund,

2651
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:18,178
you can just do long only, but aren't you in the business

2652
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:20,305
of predicting tech trends and evaluating companies?

2653
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:21,389
After having done this conversation,

2654
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:22,390
we think you might be quite good at it.

2655
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:25,018
Exactly.

2656
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:28,396
We've considered it, and it's just if you guys spend time

2657
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,356
with public-market investors, they just have a very

2658
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,275
different motion than what we do,

2659
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:33,777
and so they just—

2660
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:37,197
But is that tradition or is that fundamentally

2661
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,782
intrinsic to the ontology of the job?

2662
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:39,866
I think there would be a different way

2663
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:41,618
to run public money in a way that, for example,

2664
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:42,952
would've caught a lot of the mega seven.

2665
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:44,454
I think that possibility exists,

2666
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:45,705
and literally, you could just say it's as simple

2667
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:48,583
as apply the venture mindset to to mega caps,

2668
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:49,709
and away you go,

2669
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:52,629
and obviously, we now know venture scale returns

2670
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,422
when you get that right.

2671
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:58,343
I would just tell you, one of the things that saves venture

2672
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:02,097
is that we're locked up, and our investors are locked up.

2673
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:02,931
It's a feature, not a bug.

2674
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,224
It's an incredible feature,

2675
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:06,142
and in traditional finance theory, they always tell you

2676
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,770
illiquidity is a deficit, and it turns out it's—

2677
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,564
Which is true, but human nature is a bigger one.

2678
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:12,690
Human nature is—

2679
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,818
Liquidity would be a feature if we were—

2680
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,111
Correct. Less messed up.

2681
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,113
It is so incredibly hard to no get sucked into

2682
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,280
the psychology of the moment,

2683
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,366
and I spend a lot of time at our firm

2684
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:22,575
trying to get people to not be sucked up

2685
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:24,285
in the psychology at the moment.

2686
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:25,870
So, for example, it's just like an absolute ban

2687
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,539
on television news in the office.

2688
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,542
No, if it's on CNBC today, it does not matter to us.

2689
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,418
If it does matter to us, we made some horrible mistake

2690
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:34,003
eight years ago that we can't fix now anyway,

2691
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:34,921
and if it's anything else,

2692
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:36,464
we shouldn't be paying attention to it.

2693
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,758
because the whole point of this is things that are

2694
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:40,677
going to take five or 10 years in the future to develop,

2695
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,762
and people just need to get back to work.

2696
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,432
Okay, here's a very pragmatic challenge.

2697
01:25:46,432 --> 01:25:48,143
You're running public money with a venture strategy.

2698
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,853
All right, what's your lockup?

2699
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,354
Okay, now you got a quarterly lockup,

2700
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:52,564
congratulations, big guy.

2701
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,233
The market rips your face off, all your investors redeem.

2702
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,526
So much for your strategy.

2703
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:59,070
And so, that's just really hard,

2704
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,363
and then you people who have gone out

2705
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:01,698
to try to raise money on longer lockups

2706
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:02,699
are like, "Well, why would I do that?

2707
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:03,533
Illiquidity is a problem.

2708
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:06,369
Why would I lock up an Apple position? That's insane."

2709
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:09,622
And again, you can say, the fact that nobody did that

2710
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:11,708
is illustrative of how difficult it is now.

2711
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,376
I don't know. Maybe at some point we should.

2712
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,587
And then the other is just flat-out opportunity cost.

2713
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:17,547
which is, are you really going to spend the time

2714
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:19,340
dealing with that you could be spending

2715
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,633
meeting the next Mark Zuckerberg?

2716
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:25,638
You invest in companies that succeed and then go public.

2717
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:26,723
Can I tell the actual story?

2718
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:27,557
So we almost did this. Yeah.

2719
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:28,808
We almost started the thing

2720
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:30,435
and we're like, "All right, we have the venture mentality,

2721
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:31,769
we have the thing, but because of how

2722
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,438
the public markets work, we need a public market."

2723
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:35,023
I mean, somebody with some public markets background

2724
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,482
to even be able to raise the money.

2725
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:38,443
So we ran a long recruiting process

2726
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,111
and we got down to the final candidate

2727
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:43,615
and we met with him during COVID in,

2728
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:46,868
I'm going to say September '21, something around that time,

2729
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:51,623
and we said, "Look, just do the workup

2730
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:54,500
and bring your best idea. The one company that you would

2731
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,710
commit the portfolio to."

2732
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,920
Would you like to take a guess what it was?

2733
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,880
No. Peloton.

2734
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,507
Oh, my God.

2735
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:03,468
Which then proceeded to fall 99.9%.

2736
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,929
So you, yeah, missed bullet.

2737
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,555
Right, and by the way, at the time, Peloton,

2738
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,765
and you remember,

2739
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:09,599
we used to talk about this at the time,

2740
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:13,770
we were, "Peloton, oh, this isn't just a bike company,

2741
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:14,604
this is a movement." Yeah. Right.

2742
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:15,688
"This is a cult, and this is a brand,

2743
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:17,148
and this is immediate," and everybody had their

2744
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:19,150
theory on subscriptions and recurring revenue,

2745
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:19,984
and, you know— Well, during COVID,

2746
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:21,694
where people overestimated the permanence

2747
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:22,862
of the behavior changes.

2748
01:27:22,862 --> 01:27:24,030
Yes, exactly, well, there was that,

2749
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:28,034
but there was also just that kind of company,

2750
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:32,247
fitness is a trend, fad-driven business historically,

2751
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:35,625
and so anyway, that just felt like a message from God.

2752
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:39,003
Go back to public market investing.

2753
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:41,589
So, you invest in companies that then go off and succeed

2754
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:44,550
and go public, like Coinbase or Airbnb

2755
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:45,969
or all these sorts of companies.

2756
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,596
You then, because they're public,

2757
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:49,806
you get to distribute the stock

2758
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,933
and so you distribute it to all the LPs.

2759
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,143
They get their shares. You get your shares.

2760
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:56,229
Yeah. Do you hold the companies?

2761
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:58,231
Do you make a decision? Is it formulaic?

2762
01:27:58,231 --> 01:27:59,524
Is it not formulaic?

2763
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,150
Are you secretly a public-markets investor

2764
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,694
because you have to make these decisions?

2765
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,905
Yeah, so, to be clear, there's two parts to that.

2766
01:28:05,905 --> 01:28:07,824
The part, each of us as individuals do whatever we do

2767
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:08,992
with the stock. Yes, but what do you do?

2768
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:10,410
What do I do?

2769
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,786
Nothing specifically, but I'm basically saying,

2770
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:12,954
do you make active decisions

2771
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,163
or is it totally formulaic?

2772
01:28:14,163 --> 01:28:15,456
Well, lemme tell you how we do it as a firm,

2773
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:17,917
and then it gets to the individuals.

2774
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:20,503
As a firm, we try to make it as mechanical as possible.

2775
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:22,213
We're trying to get out of the psychology

2776
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:23,339
of whatever's happening at that moment.

2777
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:25,591
So you try to define a process upfront,

2778
01:28:25,591 --> 01:28:28,261
but you do want to be discriminating,

2779
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:30,930
and so we have a magic box formula

2780
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:34,892
of things like, are the founders still running the company?

2781
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:39,397
Quality of the founders, are they beating their numbers?

2782
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:40,231
What's the growth rate?

2783
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:41,065
What's the second derivative? What's the service

2784
01:28:41,065 --> 01:28:41,899
like in the pub?

2785
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:43,192
Exactly.

2786
01:28:43,192 --> 01:28:45,695
Do they tolerate low-performing bartenders?

2787
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:49,991
Yeah, and then, yeah, we have some schedule against that.

2788
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,242
There is a theory afoot

2789
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:53,619
and Sequoia is pursuing it, that basically

2790
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:56,331
the venture firms and their LPs have left

2791
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,373
enormous amounts of money on the table

2792
01:28:57,373 --> 01:28:59,542
by distributing too soon,

2793
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:02,754
and, if you backtest over 50 years,

2794
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,172
the best strategy, at least for the top firms,

2795
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,632
probably would've been to hold everything in perpetuity,

2796
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:08,760
and so, Sequoia, notably, is trying a strategy

2797
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,345
where they're trying to do more of that.

2798
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,014
I will tell you the LPs don't like that.

2799
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:13,931
The LPs—

2800
01:29:15,224 --> 01:29:16,351
The LPs just want their shares.

2801
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,727
Of money in and out, and, yeah,

2802
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:19,604
and they do have a positive argument

2803
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:20,688
that says, "Look, we're not paying you

2804
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:21,564
to manage public money."

2805
01:29:21,564 --> 01:29:22,940
Yeah. And, by the way,

2806
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:23,858
they have their own needs,

2807
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:24,984
and, by the way, they have their own needs

2808
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:26,569
now more than ever.

2809
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:28,780
They're under real pressure in a lot of cases,

2810
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:32,367
and so, if you ask an LP,

2811
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,243
they will tell you, "Yeah, we want you to try

2812
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:35,703
to shoot the lights out on as long-dated

2813
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,121
a horizon as possible."

2814
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,373
Having said that, like—

2815
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,249
As soon as humanly possible. We want out money back.

2816
01:29:40,249 --> 01:29:42,877
Get us some money, please.

2817
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:45,671
And so, where this comes up is

2818
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:47,632
it's just the thing of, well, should we hold it

2819
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,133
for another three years and go for another doubling

2820
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:51,386
or should we bird in hand on that?

2821
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,221
Anyway, so we try to run that mechanically.

2822
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,098
On the individual side, it really varies by the individual,

2823
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:57,183
just based on idiosyncratic life circumstances.

2824
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:58,017
Off to big-company world

2825
01:29:58,017 --> 01:30:00,686
for a couple of questions. Yeah. Sure.

2826
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:03,731
How much should big companies focus on their competitors?

2827
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,733
So, this is a real double-edged sword.

2828
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:08,444
So, the easiest thing in the world is

2829
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:10,446
to focus on your competitors,

2830
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:12,573
because you've got somebody to benchmark index against,

2831
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:15,410
and it's just been amazing how many other big companies

2832
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,161
start or stop their VR and AR programs

2833
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,746
based on what everybody's doing at that moment.

2834
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:20,790
They seem to have outsource their thinking entirely to Meta,

2835
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:23,126
and so there is this dysfunctional version

2836
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,002
where you're outsourcing your thought to the competitor,

2837
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:26,712
and then there's the peter critique of

2838
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:29,465
you're getting into these Girardian spirals,

2839
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:31,843
and I think there's something to that.

2840
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:34,929
Having said that, I see the other side of that all the time,

2841
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:35,972
which is the Andy Grove side,

2842
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,306
which is "Only the Paranoid Survive,"

2843
01:30:37,306 --> 01:30:41,102
and isn't it great if you have an intellectual framework

2844
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:43,438
to be able to not think about your competition?

2845
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:44,730
because that's a lot more fun.

2846
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:46,607
Yeah. If your competition's good,

2847
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:48,985
thinking about them is actually really painful.

2848
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:51,028
If you have this enlightened point of view

2849
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:52,822
that says you don't ever have to think about them,

2850
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:54,490
you're letting yourself off the hook,

2851
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,450
and so I think there's-

2852
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,201
Maybe the answer is whatever's most painful thinking about

2853
01:30:57,201 --> 01:31:00,079
them or not thinking about them, is best.

2854
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:01,831
Well, and this gets to what I've experienced

2855
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:02,790
with big companies.

2856
01:31:03,749 --> 01:31:06,002
What I've experienced with big companies, and, by the way,

2857
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:08,671
this includes, in a lot of cases, fast-growing startups,

2858
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:10,381
they think a lot about their competitors

2859
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:12,383
for the purpose of trying to basically,

2860
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:15,595
essentially ultimately copycat with their competitors.

2861
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:18,473
If your competitor's decent, for whatever it is they do,

2862
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,390
you assume they must have some

2863
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:20,475
analytical reason they're doing it,

2864
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,102
and so there's this natural tendency to try

2865
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:24,854
to build the analytical case to do the same thing,

2866
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:27,315
and so, there's an over focus in that way.

2867
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,609
Having said that, I can count the number

2868
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:32,111
of true competitive teardowns.

2869
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:33,654
Yep. I don't know,

2870
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:36,073
maybe on one hand, that I've ever really seen,

2871
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:37,533
because again, your pain point,

2872
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:39,619
the most painful thing in the world is to talk honestly

2873
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:40,828
about somebody beating you.

2874
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:42,788
Yeah, I always find that Jeff Bezos,

2875
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:45,666
we're not competitor-focused, we're customer-focused,

2876
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:46,584
a bit of a misdirection, because, again,

2877
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:49,295
at least at Stripe, we think that our customers

2878
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:52,089
are very smart, and so if they're picking something else,

2879
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:55,051
that is some signal of revealed preference

2880
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:57,970
that a well-informed person trying to do

2881
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:00,264
the best thing for them says, "This is better than Stripe,"

2882
01:32:00,264 --> 01:32:02,183
and so, we do a lot of secret shopping,

2883
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:03,267
we do a lot of tearing down.

2884
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:04,101
We want to understand what's out there,

2885
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:07,104
and again, as you say, that shouldn't define the roadmap.

2886
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:08,814
You should be able to come up with your own products,

2887
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:10,608
but if you're not coming at it from an informed place,

2888
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:11,734
something is horribly wrong.

2889
01:32:11,734 --> 01:32:13,819
I think, yeah, it's some combination of

2890
01:32:13,819 --> 01:32:15,446
you need to be brutally honest with respect

2891
01:32:15,446 --> 01:32:16,280
to what your actual issues are,

2892
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,698
and those actual issues include

2893
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:20,034
you're losing for reason XYZ.

2894
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:21,118
I mean, in some ways, what they're saying

2895
01:32:21,118 --> 01:32:22,787
is bureaucracies avoid pain—

2896
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:23,621
Yes. And so you need to

2897
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:24,455
steer them into pain.

2898
01:32:24,455 --> 01:32:25,748
But I would say it slightly differently,

2899
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:27,792
which is I have found people willing to tolerate any level

2900
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,168
of chronic pain in order—

2901
01:32:29,168 --> 01:32:30,419
to avoid acute pain. Avoid acute pain.

2902
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:31,963
In order to avoid acute pain,

2903
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:34,465
and so people would much rather lose slowly

2904
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:36,592
over five years, than have the conversation

2905
01:32:36,592 --> 01:32:39,095
that involves a dramatic change to stop losing.

2906
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,763
Wow. And I've seen that

2907
01:32:40,763 --> 01:32:41,597
over and over again.

2908
01:32:41,597 --> 01:32:43,891
It's almost impossible to get people to do that.

2909
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:46,227
Just, the level of aversion is incredibly high.

2910
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,145
What founders or companies do you respect—

2911
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:50,273
People seem fine just bleeding out.

2912
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:51,357
It's just incredible.

2913
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,113
You see it in politics.

2914
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,197
I don't want to name names,

2915
01:32:58,197 --> 01:32:59,365
but there are political parties, let's say,

2916
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:00,408
in various places around the world,

2917
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:01,284
where you just look at it

2918
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:03,578
and you're just like, "I can't believe that you're

2919
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,663
willing to inflict this strategy on yourself

2920
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:07,582
with these results that are clearly not working."

2921
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:08,416
Actually, that leads

2922
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,875
to a next question. And yet, they will not

2923
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:10,918
revisit their core assumptions.

2924
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,878
If you look at companies that have died

2925
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:14,964
over the last 20 years, they do seem to have

2926
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:17,341
these very long operatic deaths,

2927
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,261
and they change less than you would think.

2928
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,178
Yes. Do you think that's because

2929
01:33:21,178 --> 01:33:24,098
of people that are prescient and see it, just exit?

2930
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:26,100
Yeah. And so, you've got

2931
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,060
a selection effect in the people that remain,

2932
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,354
or is it just that it's too socially awkward

2933
01:33:30,354 --> 01:33:31,314
to have a conversation that says,

2934
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:34,567
"We've backed out"? Most people would rather

2935
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:36,444
just put one foot in front of the other.

2936
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:37,820
Most people don't want to rock the boat.

2937
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:40,823
Most people don't want to be the skunk at the garden party.

2938
01:33:40,823 --> 01:33:43,075
Most people don't want to call their own baby ugly.

2939
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:46,579
Yeah, most people don't want the reputation

2940
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:47,788
of being a troublemaker.

2941
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:52,251
It's this very interesting signal

2942
01:33:52,251 --> 01:33:53,461
you have to decide whether you want to send as a leader,

2943
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,630
which is do you want people to bring you bad news?

2944
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,423
Because, if all people are doing to you every day

2945
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:58,674
is bringing you bad news, number one,

2946
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:00,092
you're going to slit your own wrists,

2947
01:34:00,092 --> 01:34:01,552
because that fucking sucks, and then, number two,

2948
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:03,262
you don't want people to just be complainers.

2949
01:34:03,262 --> 01:34:04,096
Yeah. Right?

2950
01:34:04,096 --> 01:34:06,557
And so, maybe the more advanced version is

2951
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:07,433
only bring me a problem if you're

2952
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:08,392
also bringing me the solution.

2953
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:11,729
But, okay, now your life as a CEO is better, but what if

2954
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:13,272
there really is a problem? Is a problem,

2955
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:14,106
and they don't— And they don't have

2956
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:15,232
the solution. Because it's beyond them.

2957
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:16,067
Yeah. And it's beyond them,

2958
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,526
and then they're the one that you're going to give

2959
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:19,737
the negative performance review to, so...

2960
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:21,113
By the way, the other twist on

2961
01:34:21,113 --> 01:34:22,073
the big company failing thing,

2962
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,866
which I think is really underrated,

2963
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,993
is the big companies that fail,

2964
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:28,371
the way the story gets written is they never figured it out,

2965
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:31,040
and the easy example of this is always Kodak,

2966
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,458
for example, they never figure digital photography.

2967
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:33,751
What you often find in the backstory is,

2968
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:36,087
no, they actually figured it out and they did it too soon.

2969
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:37,588
That's interesting. Kodak had actually

2970
01:34:37,588 --> 01:34:39,173
a very active digital camera program

2971
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:40,299
before— Then they got burned.

2972
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:41,634
And then they got burned. Once burnt, twice shy.

2973
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:43,052
Twice shy.

2974
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:44,679
By the way, Yahoo had mobile early.

2975
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:48,391
Yahoo was all over mobile between 2002 and 2006,

2976
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:50,601
and then they got burned so hard on it

2977
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:53,896
that by the time the iPhone appeared, it was too late.

2978
01:34:53,896 --> 01:34:55,773
Yeah, I think that if you did WAP,

2979
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,942
you were unlikely to succeed in the post-iPhone world.

2980
01:34:57,942 --> 01:34:58,776
Yeah. Yeah.

2981
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,611
And, quite frankly, well, you mentioned

2982
01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:02,279
the big tech companies, a lot of the big tech companies,

2983
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:05,324
they had internet fully deployed internally,

2984
01:35:05,324 --> 01:35:06,992
they had TCP/IP products.

2985
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:08,619
They actually knew it quite well.

2986
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:10,204
They were running it, it just was something

2987
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:11,497
that they were very used to that they didn't

2988
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:12,873
really think about in a new way,

2989
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:15,126
and, yeah, there's the status quo bias thing.

2990
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,128
So, this is a good segue— You had very

2991
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,755
intelligent-sounding reasons as to why it won't work

2992
01:35:19,755 --> 01:35:23,551
from a recent document. Oh, people are really good

2993
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:25,803
at the analytical explanation,

2994
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:26,971
either as to why something won't work,

2995
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:28,556
or conversely, why something is going to work

2996
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:29,515
when it's currently failing.

2997
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:30,349
Yeah. No, but again, you just

2998
01:35:30,349 --> 01:35:32,309
get it to sound very convincing, where it's like,

2999
01:35:32,309 --> 01:35:33,269
"That's a great point.

3000
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:34,770
We actually tried that 18 months ago."

3001
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:35,688
That's right. Yes.

3002
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:40,359
It is, no man steps in the same river twice, and so...

3003
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:42,862
That's a good segue into you've been on many boards.

3004
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:45,740
What makes a good one? Or maybe what makes a bad one?

3005
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:49,243
Yeah, I mean, step one is if it's a successful company.

3006
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:51,036
Step two is—

3007
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:52,246
Which way does the cause and effect?

3008
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:55,124
Step two is if it's a good CEO.

3009
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:56,709
Just practically speaking, the boards just

3010
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:59,628
can't do that much, and even the old cliche

3011
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:00,713
is to hire and fire the CEO,

3012
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:02,506
and even that, it's really fraught with peril.

3013
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:03,924
Yeah. It's very easy for a board

3014
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:04,884
to blow that up.

3015
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:06,135
By the way, again, it's often—

3016
01:36:06,135 --> 01:36:08,137
I do remember your blog had a,

3017
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:09,722
"How do I hire a professional CEO?"

3018
01:36:09,722 --> 01:36:10,931
And the answer was one sentence,

3019
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:12,892
expecting this long article, and it's like, "Don't."

3020
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:13,893
Don't. If you need to do that,

3021
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:15,519
sell your company. Sell your company.

3022
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:18,022
And that's probably an overstatement.

3023
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:20,733
There have been some very successful professional CEOs

3024
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:22,526
over the years, John Chambers and Frank Slootman and others,

3025
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:25,029
but, yeah, look, it's just really hard.

3026
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,280
Is the company going to succeed or not?

3027
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,365
Is the CEO great or not?

3028
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:30,201
Is the company on the right side of history or not?

3029
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,243
That's honestly most of it.

3030
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:32,077
The board— Well, do you think

3031
01:36:32,077 --> 01:36:32,995
boards matter then?

3032
01:36:32,995 --> 01:36:35,956
It's one of those things, you can't not have one,

3033
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:38,959
which is, if you're on another board,

3034
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:40,503
then you're, as a CEO, legally liable

3035
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:42,922
for every screwed-up thing that happens.

3036
01:36:43,839 --> 01:36:46,050
You're much more likely to go to jail.

3037
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,927
You're much more likely for things to spin out of control.

3038
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:49,595
There are real requirements.

3039
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:50,846
Governance needs to be taken seriously.

3040
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:52,973
You're representing a lot of other people's money,

3041
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:55,476
so there's that, and then do you want to have

3042
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:59,230
absolute dictatorships with no examination inside ever?

3043
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,440
And then, aspirationally, obviously,

3044
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,150
the hope would be to be able to positively contribute.

3045
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:05,528
Yeah, you're giving the governance explanation

3046
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:06,987
and you're saying that it's rare

3047
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:08,656
that founders are actually removed,

3048
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,324
or CEOs are actually removed,

3049
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:12,243
and then even the cases where they are,

3050
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:13,869
maybe things are too far gone and everything,

3051
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:15,412
and sure, maybe that's true,

3052
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:17,414
but I feel like I would make a cultural pitch

3053
01:37:17,414 --> 01:37:19,458
where, let me try this on and you can react to it,

3054
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,044
we've found the Stripe board very useful

3055
01:37:22,044 --> 01:37:25,130
because it's important to have to organize your thinking

3056
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:26,632
and have some accountability mechanism

3057
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:28,884
where you go on a quarterly basis and talk about things,

3058
01:37:28,884 --> 01:37:31,554
and then, we're doing this for the first time,

3059
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:34,890
and so there's lots of people on the Stripe board

3060
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:36,934
who have a different set of experience and come to us

3061
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:38,853
and advise us on various things,

3062
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:42,773
and we've gone and tried to pick the hall of fame

3063
01:37:42,773 --> 01:37:45,442
of various industries who can then go opine on things.

3064
01:37:45,442 --> 01:37:47,152
And I actually notice,

3065
01:37:47,152 --> 01:37:49,822
when I talk to way-earlier stage founders,

3066
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:53,409
I think they underrate the value of a good board,

3067
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,953
where they are worried about the governance thing

3068
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:57,830
you say, where they don't want to give up a whole bunch

3069
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:59,456
of board seats and then have to do management

3070
01:37:59,456 --> 01:38:02,001
of VC personality and everything, which is true,

3071
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:04,253
but they don't seem to take seriously,

3072
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:06,130
and, again, maybe they just get this from investors,

3073
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,841
but they don't seem to take seriously the idea

3074
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:12,595
that you can put together a group

3075
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:15,180
who will meaningfully increase the odds of success

3076
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,433
of the company.

3077
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:19,768
I don't know, is that just a particular thing to us?

3078
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:21,645
We needed more help than others

3079
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:23,105
or would you agree with that broadly

3080
01:38:23,105 --> 01:38:25,482
as a cultural explanation, where they're pretty useful

3081
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:26,817
culturally for management?

3082
01:38:26,817 --> 01:38:29,111
Yeah, so what you just said is what we aspire to,

3083
01:38:29,111 --> 01:38:30,863
and what we aspire to is that the boards

3084
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:32,781
that we're on are like that, and that the CEOs

3085
01:38:32,781 --> 01:38:33,616
that we work with want to have a board like that,

3086
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:35,284
and that we're able to be a contributor to it,

3087
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:36,410
and so we aspire to that.

3088
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,787
I think there are many examples of that being true,

3089
01:38:38,787 --> 01:38:41,999
and hopefully, on that, I've been an example of that myself.

3090
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:43,292
I think that's all true.

3091
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:45,210
Having said that, I guess, a board cannot rescue

3092
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:46,045
a failing company.

3093
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:48,172
Sure. Well, yeah,

3094
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,424
but there are a lot of people

3095
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:51,592
on a lot of boards in a lot of companies

3096
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:52,676
that are failing, that are spending an

3097
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:55,012
enormous amount of time trying to rescue those companies,

3098
01:38:56,221 --> 01:38:57,389
both in and outside of tech,

3099
01:38:57,389 --> 01:39:00,059
and so, it's just a high-order bit is still succeeding

3100
01:39:00,059 --> 01:39:02,853
or failing, and it's still quality people versus not.

3101
01:39:02,853 --> 01:39:04,355
It ties into your,

3102
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,272
someone once said— The easiest thing

3103
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:06,357
in the world is to go on the board of a company

3104
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:09,234
that is going to succeed wildly no matter what you do,

3105
01:39:09,234 --> 01:39:11,904
and then to take credit for it after the fact.

3106
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,364
I mean, that sounds fun, but—

3107
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:15,532
Having been through it,

3108
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:16,951
the hardest thing in the world is to be on a team,

3109
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,744
on a board, where you're struggling valiantly

3110
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:20,120
to keep the ship from going down.

3111
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,580
And the ship is going down.

3112
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:22,414
So, that goes back to

3113
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:23,540
can you hire— I've been on those too.

3114
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:26,168
Can you hire great CEOs or are those great CEOs,

3115
01:39:26,168 --> 01:39:28,295
someone once described it to me,

3116
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:30,923
the people that have reputation for great professional CEOs

3117
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:32,967
are actually great stock pickers.

3118
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:33,968
Yeah. They understand tech

3119
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,427
deeply enough that they pick the company—

3120
01:39:35,427 --> 01:39:37,012
Right. That's in a great position.

3121
01:39:37,012 --> 01:39:37,846
Same thing for VCs. So—

3122
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:38,847
Same thing, yeah. Right.

3123
01:39:38,847 --> 01:39:41,350
You can't hire them to turn around a failing company,

3124
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,143
because they self-select out of it.

3125
01:39:44,186 --> 01:39:46,063
I don't know, there's exceptions to everything.

3126
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,106
Every once in a while you get—

3127
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:48,399
Actually, that is also a great point,

3128
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:51,402
which is there's a world full of heuristics in VC,

3129
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:53,362
single founders, multiple founders.

3130
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:54,863
Yeah. But, there's so many

3131
01:39:54,863 --> 01:39:57,241
exceptions to each rule— You'd never back

3132
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:59,326
a married couple, and then you didn't back Cisco, right?

3133
01:39:59,326 --> 01:40:01,328
Alright, last call, but you just made it.

3134
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:03,372
That was the saddest

3135
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:04,206
pub service. That was the

3136
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:06,583
slowest pint.

3137
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:07,710
Is that the Irish—

3138
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,669
Here, let me get you a cup of coffee.

3139
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,714
Is that the Irish standard?

3140
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:14,675
Does this explain, or are you actually a...? Yes.

3141
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,051
We've all seen the productivity stats.

3142
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:17,886
We specialize in economic infrastructure,

3143
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:19,096
not in hospitality service.

3144
01:40:22,307 --> 01:40:24,476
I would just like to note that the result

3145
01:40:24,476 --> 01:40:26,520
of that entire exercise is one less of

3146
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,981
my cups on the table.

3147
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,899
Yeah, you're negative

3148
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:32,234
two drinks from that interaction.

3149
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:33,777
Net subtractive.

3150
01:40:33,777 --> 01:40:37,948
You think people under study the Elon

3151
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:39,116
method for running companies?

3152
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:41,160
A hundred percent, yes.

3153
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,870
Maybe just briefly describe that method

3154
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:47,249
and then why everyone is so incurious about it.

3155
01:40:47,249 --> 01:40:49,960
Yeah, and there's two reasons they're incurious about it.

3156
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,462
There was the original reason they were incurious about it,

3157
01:40:51,462 --> 01:40:53,172
and now there's the new reason they're incurious about it,

3158
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:55,716
which is Elon also generates emotion in people.

3159
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:57,843
Yeah, so, look, you guys, you know,

3160
01:40:57,843 --> 01:40:59,303
so how do you run a company?

3161
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,180
Well, there's been a hundred years of management books

3162
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,474
starting with Alfred Sloan's book.

3163
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:04,558
Alfred Sloan built General Motors,

3164
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:07,436
and so, Alfred Sloan famously wrote a book

3165
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,645
that people like Andy Grove learned from,

3166
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:10,105
that basically said, "Here's how you build a large,

3167
01:41:10,105 --> 01:41:11,815
multi-national, multi-product-line industrial company."

3168
01:41:11,815 --> 01:41:13,817
And so there's this system, and it involves

3169
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:14,818
somebody at the top of the company

3170
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:16,779
that's overseeing this machine,

3171
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:18,572
and fundamentally, they're getting reports

3172
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:20,282
and then respond to the reports,

3173
01:41:20,282 --> 01:41:22,409
and then there's all these rules.

3174
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:25,162
I would say, both rules inflicted

3175
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:28,123
from the outside and rules generated internally,

3176
01:41:28,123 --> 01:41:30,167
and then there's Elon, who just doesn't do any of that.

3177
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:33,212
He just doesn't do any of that,

3178
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:34,713
and has a completely different playbook,

3179
01:41:34,713 --> 01:41:37,299
and the Elon playbook, in a nutshell, as far as I can tell,

3180
01:41:37,299 --> 01:41:39,259
I haven't worked for him directly, but from observing him

3181
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:40,552
and working with him, as far as I can tell,

3182
01:41:40,552 --> 01:41:43,138
it's basically, number one, it's only engineers.

3183
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:45,808
People who matter in your company are the engineers,

3184
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:47,434
the people who understand the technical content

3185
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:49,561
of what you're doing for technology companies,

3186
01:41:49,561 --> 01:41:51,480
and then you only ever talk to the engineers.

3187
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,148
You never ever talk to mid-level management.

3188
01:41:53,148 --> 01:41:55,192
If you have it fine, if they need it for whatever,

3189
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:57,653
to do their, whatever, vacation policy or whatever,

3190
01:41:57,653 --> 01:41:59,822
it's fine, but if you are the CEO, to get the truth,

3191
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:01,198
you only talk to the line engineer,

3192
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,534
and so you just ruthlessly violate the chain of command

3193
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:07,079
at all times, and then your job, as the CEO,

3194
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:08,789
is, every week, to fix whatever is

3195
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,916
the most important bottleneck to the company's progress.

3196
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,793
And the way that you do that is you parachute in

3197
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:15,087
and you find the engineers that are working on that problem

3198
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:17,089
and you basically stay up with them all night

3199
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:20,092
until they fix the problem,

3200
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:23,762
and then if there's no current major bottleneck,

3201
01:42:23,762 --> 01:42:26,265
you spend your time instead, doing engineering reviews,

3202
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:28,183
specifically engineering reviews, not product reviews,

3203
01:42:28,183 --> 01:42:31,854
engineering reviews, and you get all the engineers together,

3204
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:33,772
and you have them each present

3205
01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:34,857
what they're doing for five minutes,

3206
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:36,733
and the result of that is, you know every single engineer

3207
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:39,027
in the company, you know exactly what they're working on.

3208
01:42:39,027 --> 01:42:41,947
If somebody's not good, you fire them on the spot.

3209
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:44,700
If somebody's great, you go all out to get them.

3210
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:45,826
But what's the inverse of that?

3211
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:47,744
because for 10 years after Steve Jobs,

3212
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:50,539
we had people doing mimetic bad version,

3213
01:42:50,539 --> 01:42:53,625
wearing turtlenecks, trying to—

3214
01:42:53,625 --> 01:42:54,543
Be an asshole. Do the social style.

3215
01:42:54,543 --> 01:42:56,044
Exactly, I was trying to say that

3216
01:42:56,044 --> 01:42:58,589
more diplomatically, but yes, being an asshole.

3217
01:42:58,589 --> 01:42:59,423
The people were being,

3218
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:00,632
not Steve. No joke, that they were big.

3219
01:43:00,632 --> 01:43:02,009
That was the misinterpretation.

3220
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:05,846
What is the danger for entrepreneurs,

3221
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:07,306
what's the bad version of copying you on?

3222
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:10,475
Oh, the bad version is, this is the critique,

3223
01:43:10,475 --> 01:43:12,227
actually, my partner Ben levies this critique.

3224
01:43:12,227 --> 01:43:14,521
He's like, "Marc, the thing you don't get is as follows,"

3225
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:16,857
which is that, which is, that assumes you have

3226
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:18,817
somebody like Elon, who can hold the entirety

3227
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:20,277
of every engineering topic,

3228
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:23,488
and every business topic in their head all at the same time,

3229
01:43:23,488 --> 01:43:25,073
and so, when you're sitting there

3230
01:43:25,073 --> 01:43:27,075
with the 23-year-old engineer

3231
01:43:27,075 --> 01:43:28,118
and you're working with them to redesign

3232
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:30,162
the database architecture or whatever,

3233
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:32,247
you actually are qualified to do that,

3234
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:33,832
and that you're qualified to do that,

3235
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:36,335
not just that one time, but every time,

3236
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:38,253
and then again, this goes right back

3237
01:43:38,253 --> 01:43:40,255
to the last topic we just talked about, which is like,

3238
01:43:40,255 --> 01:43:42,758
okay, how many of those people exist

3239
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:43,884
who can possibly do that?

3240
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:46,136
And we know the answer is one.

3241
01:43:46,136 --> 01:43:47,846
Yeah.

3242
01:43:47,846 --> 01:43:49,890
I believe the answer is 10, or a hundred, or a thousand.

3243
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,808
I don't know if it's a million.

3244
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:54,519
I tend to think we have more of those people

3245
01:43:54,519 --> 01:43:55,812
than we think we do.

3246
01:43:55,812 --> 01:43:58,732
I see a lot of founders who struggle with this.

3247
01:43:58,732 --> 01:44:01,860
So my observation for how founders try to figure this out,

3248
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,695
is, in the beginning, they run everything.

3249
01:44:03,695 --> 01:44:04,863
You just do everything.

3250
01:44:04,863 --> 01:44:06,365
You just do everything, run everything, because you have to,

3251
01:44:06,365 --> 01:44:07,950
and you have to have a unified vision

3252
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:08,825
and you don't have this army of people anyway,

3253
01:44:08,825 --> 01:44:11,453
and so you just do it, and then at some point,

3254
01:44:11,453 --> 01:44:13,205
your high-value board comes to you

3255
01:44:13,205 --> 01:44:14,790
and says, "You idiot, you're micromanaging.

3256
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:16,291
You need to bring in all these executives,"

3257
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:18,293
and then what happens is, then you go the other way.

3258
01:44:18,293 --> 01:44:20,671
You over delegate, and then your high-functioning

3259
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:21,922
board says, "You idiot, you're not involved

3260
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:24,299
in enough of the details," and then you correct.

3261
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:25,384
And then, what most of the

3262
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:26,718
successful founders I work with do is,

3263
01:44:26,718 --> 01:44:27,678
they end up with a hybrid model

3264
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:29,429
where they're deep in the details on some things,

3265
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:32,766
but they have a traditional system on the other hand.

3266
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:33,934
And do you think that works pretty well?

3267
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:36,520
I think, for most of the founders we work with

3268
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,647
that have very successful outcomes, I think that generally

3269
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:39,564
is what they do.

3270
01:44:39,564 --> 01:44:42,359
I think it works well, but it's not the Elon method.

3271
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:43,735
Sure. It's not the Elon method.

3272
01:44:43,735 --> 01:44:45,070
By the way, there's other aspects

3273
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:45,988
to the Elon method. I was going to say,

3274
01:44:45,988 --> 01:44:47,906
I feel like there's more. There's other aspects.

3275
01:44:47,906 --> 01:44:50,033
So another aspect of it is, the function and purpose

3276
01:44:50,033 --> 01:44:51,660
of the legal department is to file lawsuits.

3277
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:54,288
Mm.

3278
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:56,915
And I am not interested in all the rest of this stuff.

3279
01:44:56,915 --> 01:44:58,292
You can go deal with it, if you want to,

3280
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,751
whatever, whatever, whatever,

3281
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:02,713
but anybody who goes up against us,

3282
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:04,381
we are going to terrorize.

3283
01:45:04,381 --> 01:45:05,507
We are going to declare war,

3284
01:45:05,507 --> 01:45:07,926
and then, of course, as a consequence to declaring war,

3285
01:45:07,926 --> 01:45:08,927
we're not always going to win all the wars,

3286
01:45:08,927 --> 01:45:10,679
but we're going to establish massive deterrence,

3287
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:12,597
and so nobody will screw around with us.

3288
01:45:12,597 --> 01:45:13,890
By the way, let me give you number three,

3289
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:15,684
which is becoming more and more salient, I think,

3290
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:16,810
and something we're trying to get our founders

3291
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:17,644
to do a lot more of.

3292
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:19,771
Number three is, it's going to be a cult of personality

3293
01:45:19,771 --> 01:45:20,981
and it's going to be a cult of personality,

3294
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:23,191
not just inside the company, but outside the company.

3295
01:45:23,191 --> 01:45:25,485
And we're not going to spend any money on marketing.

3296
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:26,528
We're not going to put any time into IR.

3297
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,488
What we're going to do is we're going to put on the show

3298
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:31,825
of all time, and the company, and the stock,

3299
01:45:31,825 --> 01:45:33,869
and the books, and the videos, and the products,

3300
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:36,288
and the jobs, are all a function

3301
01:45:36,288 --> 01:45:37,706
of the cult of personality.

3302
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:41,168
I would add three things to that list too,

3303
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,545
and you can tell me if you think you agree with these.

3304
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,132
And, by the way, I thought the Walter Isaacson book,

3305
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:49,509
it got a mixed reception,

3306
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:51,928
but I thought if you want to study the Elon method a bit,

3307
01:45:51,928 --> 01:45:53,889
it was actually pretty useful for that,

3308
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:55,891
the recent biography.

3309
01:45:55,891 --> 01:46:00,354
One is picking sensible metrics for the business

3310
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:01,855
at any one moment in time,

3311
01:46:01,855 --> 01:46:06,860
and so, with SpaceX, as they were building up

3312
01:46:06,902 --> 01:46:10,364
the launch business, dollars per kilo to orbit

3313
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:11,823
being the metric they were going to optimize for it.

3314
01:46:11,823 --> 01:46:13,784
That's not totally obvious that it falls out.

3315
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:16,912
Even Tesla, as they're wrapping up production,

3316
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:19,247
it's deliveries per week.

3317
01:46:19,247 --> 01:46:20,332
You could have focused on revenue,

3318
01:46:20,332 --> 01:46:21,416
you could have focused on profitability,

3319
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:23,668
you could have focused on deliveries per year.

3320
01:46:23,668 --> 01:46:25,921
The number of deliveries per week

3321
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:28,090
rolling off the factory line is, itself,

3322
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,925
an interesting choice of high-level metric.

3323
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:32,469
So a big focus on, I think there's lot of this in Twitter

3324
01:46:32,469 --> 01:46:33,970
as well, when he took it over,

3325
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:36,264
focus on what are the right metrics that we should be...

3326
01:46:36,264 --> 01:46:38,558
And some of the criticism that's been levied at X

3327
01:46:38,558 --> 01:46:41,395
is their focus on engagement minutes on the site

3328
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:44,648
has led to things like the ban on URLs,

3329
01:46:46,441 --> 01:46:47,901
the de-boosting of URLs,

3330
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:48,902
which a lot of people think is pretty silly.

3331
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:50,821
Okay, so, one is choosing the right metrics.

3332
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:53,573
The second is creating a sense of urgency,

3333
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:56,284
and people talk about this as inventing crises,

3334
01:46:56,284 --> 01:46:57,744
but I would say, the generous version,

3335
01:46:57,744 --> 01:46:59,496
is shortening the time horizons,

3336
01:46:59,496 --> 01:47:01,832
and so, it's funny, Elon was going around talking about

3337
01:47:01,832 --> 01:47:04,918
when he was sleeping on the floor of the factory

3338
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:08,713
in Nevada for Tesla, that "Tesla will go bankrupt

3339
01:47:08,713 --> 01:47:10,841
if we don't do this, and if we don't figure out

3340
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:12,092
Model 3 production."

3341
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:13,468
Tesla was a $200 billion company,

3342
01:47:13,468 --> 01:47:14,469
by market cap, at that time.

3343
01:47:14,469 --> 01:47:15,720
So, it's Tesla will go bankrupt

3344
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:19,182
or do a very, very non-dilutive equity rate,

3345
01:47:19,182 --> 01:47:21,393
but creating a lot of urgency around this idea

3346
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:23,478
of fixing production and sleeping on the factory floor,

3347
01:47:23,478 --> 01:47:25,272
which clearly shortens the timeline.

3348
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:26,606
And then the third is actually,

3349
01:47:26,606 --> 01:47:27,899
the business is already capital efficient,

3350
01:47:27,899 --> 01:47:29,651
so I'm curious if you see this with hardware companies.

3351
01:47:29,651 --> 01:47:31,403
I think sometimes hardware companies

3352
01:47:31,403 --> 01:47:34,406
can be really indulgent with capital

3353
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:36,992
where they say, "Venture capitalists will fund my vision

3354
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:39,327
of exploration for five or 10 years,"

3355
01:47:39,327 --> 01:47:40,996
and the risk now, is people get into robotics

3356
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:42,873
and stuff like this, and then you get the self-indulgence,

3357
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:44,875
and it's like, "I will do my science project for ages

3358
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:46,376
and then I'll maybe figure out a product and figure out how

3359
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:47,586
to commercial it." I would say the other thing

3360
01:47:47,586 --> 01:47:49,713
hardware founders do is, they fall in love

3361
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:50,755
with the hardware and the product.

3362
01:47:50,755 --> 01:47:52,382
Yes. And they can almost

3363
01:47:52,382 --> 01:47:55,427
redefine themselves as like producers of science,

3364
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:57,637
or beauty, or product, and forget they're

3365
01:47:57,637 --> 01:47:59,389
running a business, or even worse,

3366
01:47:59,389 --> 01:48:00,682
start to think of running the business

3367
01:48:00,682 --> 01:48:03,477
as slightly unpleasant— An annoyance.

3368
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:04,311
Beneath them. Exactly. Yeah.

3369
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:06,771
And maybe even not intellectual enough.

3370
01:48:06,771 --> 01:48:09,024
Right, and so, Elon's companies have always been

3371
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:11,067
very capital efficient and build a bad one

3372
01:48:11,067 --> 01:48:11,943
and then build a good one,

3373
01:48:11,943 --> 01:48:14,738
and so The Boring Company bought a commercial tunnel-boring

3374
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:16,448
machine before they started developing their own.

3375
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:17,532
Tesla had the master plan

3376
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:18,742
where they build the low-volume roadster

3377
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,160
before they get to the high-volume stuff.

3378
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,746
SpaceX just for what they do, has never actually burnt

3379
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:25,665
that much capital lifetime, and got grant money,

3380
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:27,542
they were selling to the DOD, all this kind of stuff,

3381
01:48:27,542 --> 01:48:30,879
and so, yeah, would you agree with those three?

3382
01:48:30,879 --> 01:48:32,214
And do you think people can pick and choose?

3383
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:34,966
because we can take some of those things without maybe

3384
01:48:34,966 --> 01:48:37,219
the lawsuit department or something.

3385
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:38,762
Yeah, so, I think that's all right.

3386
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,347
I would maybe add one more thing

3387
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:41,806
or distill it out of a bunch of these,

3388
01:48:41,806 --> 01:48:44,392
which is basically truth seeking at all cost.

3389
01:48:44,392 --> 01:48:46,436
Mm. That's a good point. At least, I find this

3390
01:48:46,436 --> 01:48:49,523
to be the case with him, and I think this is really not,

3391
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,357
especially people who are mad at him,

3392
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:51,316
really don't understand this.

3393
01:48:51,316 --> 01:48:53,443
He really, really genuinely wants to know ground truth,

3394
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:54,986
and he really genuinely does not want

3395
01:48:54,986 --> 01:48:57,572
to know anything that's not ground truth.

3396
01:48:57,572 --> 01:48:58,990
And again, it goes back to our thing

3397
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:00,408
of how to confront bad news.

3398
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:03,870
He's absolutely ruthless and relentless

3399
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:05,580
in making sure that he actually understands what's going on,

3400
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:07,958
and you would think that that's common,

3401
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:09,876
and I've not found that to be common at all

3402
01:49:09,876 --> 01:49:11,795
among people in business.

3403
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,630
Or, related to another thing, which is,

3404
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:16,508
you mentioned the thing where, literally, with Elon, it's,

3405
01:49:16,508 --> 01:49:19,553
"We're all going to die, if we don't get this rolling."

3406
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:21,346
Every other typical startup founder,

3407
01:49:21,346 --> 01:49:22,472
me when I was doing it,

3408
01:49:23,431 --> 01:49:24,266
you get in front of the company, you're trying to—

3409
01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:26,226
Put on a brave face. Optimistic, brave face.

3410
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,979
"It's going to be great. You should have faith.

3411
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:30,438
You shouldn't quit and go to another company,"

3412
01:49:30,438 --> 01:49:32,482
like, "Please, stay with us. You're going to be great," and—

3413
01:49:32,482 --> 01:49:34,859
Trying to weed out the non-believers or something?

3414
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:38,154
Apparently, yeah, and I think it's urgency,

3415
01:49:38,154 --> 01:49:41,408
but, yeah, literally, it is just to be the guy

3416
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:42,492
who can show up there and just be like,

3417
01:49:42,492 --> 01:49:45,787
"Yeah, if this doesn't happen, it's going bankrupt."

3418
01:49:45,787 --> 01:49:47,789
The number of other companies where that would happen,

3419
01:49:47,789 --> 01:49:49,916
okay, the talent would just bleed out,

3420
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:52,127
and then, maybe I could add one more thing to this,

3421
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:54,254
which is he has what's, you mentioned Steve,

3422
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:56,548
he has what Steve had, which is the people who work for Elon

3423
01:49:56,548 --> 01:49:57,507
and the people who work for Steve,

3424
01:49:57,507 --> 01:49:59,551
they often report after the fact that they did

3425
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:00,927
the best work of their lives,

3426
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:03,388
and they often report that they could have

3427
01:50:03,388 --> 01:50:06,057
had difficult interactions along the way,

3428
01:50:06,057 --> 01:50:07,475
or they could have had whatever, whatever,

3429
01:50:07,475 --> 01:50:09,144
or, by the way, maybe it didn't even end well.

3430
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:11,396
Yeah. And—

3431
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:12,272
And they were pushed.

3432
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:14,441
Yeah, but literally, they'll say like,

3433
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:16,818
"Wow, I got to work on the iPhone."

3434
01:50:16,818 --> 01:50:18,987
There's a lot of very good ex SpaceX founders.

3435
01:50:18,987 --> 01:50:21,114
Yeah. Right. And they imbibe

3436
01:50:21,114 --> 01:50:23,158
a work ethic that reminds me of, I don't know,

3437
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:25,076
Goldman Sachs in the 1990s or something,

3438
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:27,329
where they work incredibly hard,

3439
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:30,540
and they think from first principles

3440
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:31,583
and they're truth seeking.

3441
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:33,752
Yeah, that's right. And they're risk taking,

3442
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:34,919
both technically and,

3443
01:50:34,919 --> 01:50:37,047
they're risk seeking technically,

3444
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:38,214
and risk avoiding in business.

3445
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:40,216
Yeah, so then my version of your question is,

3446
01:50:40,216 --> 01:50:42,469
I call this the question of the milliElons,

3447
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:47,140
it's like, okay, if a full Elon is a thousand milliElons,

3448
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:49,309
right?

3449
01:50:49,309 --> 01:50:50,393
You can microdose.

3450
01:50:50,393 --> 01:50:51,353
Yeah. Can you microdose?

3451
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:52,520
So, can you operate at the level

3452
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:56,066
of a hundred milliElons, or at 10, or at one?

3453
01:50:56,066 --> 01:51:00,070
And a huge number of observers of Elon,

3454
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,112
it's a classic thing.

3455
01:51:01,112 --> 01:51:02,489
He gets the classic feedback.

3456
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:03,448
Steve used to get this feedback.

3457
01:51:03,448 --> 01:51:04,616
Lots of people get this feedback.

3458
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:08,745
Just, "Wow, you're great. If you could only just do 80%,

3459
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:10,955
if we could just get the 800 milliElon version

3460
01:51:10,955 --> 01:51:15,543
and you could just not do the other 200 milliElons,

3461
01:51:15,543 --> 01:51:16,378
you'd be so much better,"

3462
01:51:16,378 --> 01:51:19,923
and literally, what I found with these guys is,

3463
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:20,965
they've heard that a thousand times

3464
01:51:20,965 --> 01:51:22,467
and it's a completely no-up of a statement,

3465
01:51:22,467 --> 01:51:26,137
because, for them, there's no reduced version.

3466
01:51:26,137 --> 01:51:27,263
Yeah. And so, if there's

3467
01:51:27,263 --> 01:51:29,724
no reduced version of it for them,

3468
01:51:29,724 --> 01:51:31,976
is a normal person going to be able

3469
01:51:31,976 --> 01:51:34,604
to construct like an optimally-titrated

3470
01:51:34,604 --> 01:51:36,022
dosage of milliElons?

3471
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:39,901
And, I aspirationally believe that you should be able

3472
01:51:39,901 --> 01:51:41,444
to learn things and replicate,

3473
01:51:41,444 --> 01:51:43,947
but it is a system.

3474
01:51:45,323 --> 01:51:49,953
It's not just a set of practices. It's an entire worldview.

3475
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:51,371
I'm not sure it's a whole system

3476
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:53,373
where if you don't have one thing,

3477
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:55,458
the whole thing falls apart.

3478
01:51:55,458 --> 01:51:56,793
I feel like you can—

3479
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:58,586
Well, the other part of that, though,

3480
01:51:58,586 --> 01:52:00,714
that would be one, the other way of looking at that, though,

3481
01:52:00,714 --> 01:52:03,842
is the person capable of doing the partial version?

3482
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:05,301
No. That I—

3483
01:52:05,301 --> 01:52:06,845
You see what I'm saying? Yeah, that I can buy.

3484
01:52:06,845 --> 01:52:07,846
Are there people—

3485
01:52:07,846 --> 01:52:08,805
Yes. Who can do

3486
01:52:08,805 --> 01:52:10,890
the 300 milliElon version of it?

3487
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:12,475
Yeah. Yes. Maybe.

3488
01:52:13,435 --> 01:52:15,270
I wish I had met more of them by now,

3489
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:18,314
and then the other side of that is why is it understudied?

3490
01:52:18,314 --> 01:52:20,734
And, literally, I think this goes back to the same thing as

3491
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,235
why do people get mad about cryptocurrency?

3492
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:23,361
Is, I think, this—

3493
01:52:23,361 --> 01:52:24,696
It's tribalism. Yeah.

3494
01:52:25,947 --> 01:52:27,365
There was always something about him

3495
01:52:27,365 --> 01:52:29,159
and how he operated that caused people

3496
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,952
to have an emotional response,

3497
01:52:30,952 --> 01:52:33,329
and then that is now magnified a thousand x

3498
01:52:33,329 --> 01:52:36,124
or a million x, and people are just not having it.

3499
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:41,129
And part of it he's polarized the market very deliberately,

3500
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:44,841
in the same way that I think a lot

3501
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:46,801
of great entrepreneurs do, which is unique.

3502
01:52:46,801 --> 01:52:47,927
People tend to either love him or hate him.

3503
01:52:47,927 --> 01:52:49,554
They either love the products, hate the products.

3504
01:52:49,554 --> 01:52:51,222
That's very helpful from a business standpoint,

3505
01:52:51,222 --> 01:52:52,640
recruiting standpoint, because it does create

3506
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:53,850
this cult-like thing.

3507
01:52:54,934 --> 01:52:56,394
The thing you don't want in any market

3508
01:52:56,394 --> 01:52:57,562
is a lack of differentiation.

3509
01:52:57,562 --> 01:52:59,355
He a hundred percent always has that,

3510
01:52:59,355 --> 01:53:02,358
but as a consequence, I believe there are a lot of people

3511
01:53:02,358 --> 01:53:03,651
who should be learning a lot more from him

3512
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:05,445
who cannot bring themselves to do it,

3513
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:07,197
and to their own detriment.

3514
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:08,031
Can I talk about the media?

3515
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:11,785
So, I feel like my framework is that there are

3516
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:13,369
often these new technologies

3517
01:53:13,369 --> 01:53:17,540
that then cause an explosion in interesting media activity

3518
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,833
in new companies and things like that,

3519
01:53:18,833 --> 01:53:22,378
and so there was the cable boom,

3520
01:53:22,378 --> 01:53:23,505
and I'm excited for John Malone's,

3521
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:25,632
new book, but I saw an interview with him recently

3522
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:27,175
and he was talking about, they just thought up

3523
01:53:27,175 --> 01:53:30,720
a lot of new channels, when they had this pipe

3524
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,138
going into people's homes that could support

3525
01:53:32,138 --> 01:53:33,681
a lot of programming, they had to invent

3526
01:53:33,681 --> 01:53:35,308
new programming for it, he was talking about

3527
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:36,351
creating Fox News, because they were like,

3528
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:39,562
"Well, the existing channels seem a little bit to the left,

3529
01:53:39,562 --> 01:53:42,565
and conservative talk radio is really popular,

3530
01:53:42,565 --> 01:53:44,359
so it seems like conservative news channels

3531
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:46,277
should work really well," and it did.

3532
01:53:46,277 --> 01:53:48,446
So that was cable, then the internet came along

3533
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:51,241
and famously, really worked from a media perspective,

3534
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:53,159
and in particular, that was the big nail in the coffin

3535
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:56,454
for local newspapers, where they were the

3536
01:53:56,454 --> 01:53:59,749
main distribution outlet to people previously

3537
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:02,210
for information, and the internet went over the top.

3538
01:54:02,210 --> 01:54:05,380
I feel like plausibly, X is a big enough change

3539
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:07,674
to be a new media platform.

3540
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:10,426
A slightly trivial example, but TPBN

3541
01:54:10,426 --> 01:54:13,429
is kind of a CNBC competitor where, I saw Mati

3542
01:54:13,429 --> 01:54:16,975
from ElevenLabs, a great a16z company,

3543
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:18,142
and they did a fundraise

3544
01:54:18,142 --> 01:54:19,727
and he went on TBPN to talk about it,

3545
01:54:19,727 --> 01:54:22,105
but previously, that would've been CNBC,

3546
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:25,733
but now TBPN is where he chose to go.

3547
01:54:25,733 --> 01:54:29,362
And that's one example. There's lots of others.

3548
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:31,489
Is X that big a deal from a media perspective

3549
01:54:31,489 --> 01:54:33,658
as to be cable, the internet, then X,

3550
01:54:33,658 --> 01:54:35,076
or am I missing something?

3551
01:54:35,076 --> 01:54:36,578
I think it is, and maybe the twist I would put on

3552
01:54:36,578 --> 01:54:38,913
the TPBN or the cable thing is,

3553
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:41,499
actually, this is also, what I'm about to say,

3554
01:54:41,499 --> 01:54:43,084
a big deal in sports.

3555
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:44,377
There's also now the clip,

3556
01:54:45,336 --> 01:54:47,422
and clips used to be weird and esoteric,

3557
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:50,842
and now clips are the main way that people consume content.

3558
01:54:50,842 --> 01:54:52,468
I see, so X and short-form generally.

3559
01:54:52,468 --> 01:54:53,386
Exactly, yeah. Yeah. Mm.

3560
01:54:53,386 --> 01:54:56,764
And so, for example, a TPBN episode,

3561
01:54:56,764 --> 01:54:58,641
or for that matter, a sports game,

3562
01:54:58,641 --> 01:55:00,894
now generates five or six or eight clips,

3563
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:04,272
or an interview, or, hopefully, this discussion,

3564
01:55:04,272 --> 01:55:06,649
and then those clips go hyper viral,

3565
01:55:06,649 --> 01:55:07,734
if you're doing it right,

3566
01:55:07,734 --> 01:55:09,277
but it's very common when you look at the analytics

3567
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:11,070
that the clips get a thousand times the distribution

3568
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:12,572
of the actual program itself.

3569
01:55:12,572 --> 01:55:14,699
Interesting. And so, I think

3570
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:16,075
there's this art form, it is one of the reasons

3571
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:17,577
why a lot of historical television shows

3572
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:18,411
never figured out what to do with the internet,

3573
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:19,829
because they didn't really understand

3574
01:55:19,829 --> 01:55:22,373
that the internet native artifact was the clip.

3575
01:55:22,373 --> 01:55:25,209
But the new media entrepreneurs,

3576
01:55:25,209 --> 01:55:26,586
I think, tend to really understand that,

3577
01:55:26,586 --> 01:55:28,588
and so, yeah, I think that's true.

3578
01:55:28,588 --> 01:55:29,881
Having said that, the impact of the internet

3579
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:31,382
is still mostly what it's been this whole time,

3580
01:55:31,382 --> 01:55:33,718
which is a disintermediation mechanism.

3581
01:55:34,802 --> 01:55:37,221
In the cable era, there were only 200 channels—

3582
01:55:37,221 --> 01:55:38,056
Right. Or whatever it was.

3583
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:39,682
In the internet, there's a billion.

3584
01:55:39,682 --> 01:55:42,268
Yeah. So, the overwhelming trend

3585
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:44,062
is still disintermediation desegregation.

3586
01:55:44,062 --> 01:55:45,104
Yeah, and Substack— Democratization.

3587
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:47,732
Obviously, is the other big trend, to me,

3588
01:55:47,732 --> 01:55:48,733
in media right now.

3589
01:55:48,733 --> 01:55:49,567
And Substack's a great example,

3590
01:55:49,567 --> 01:55:50,818
because, of course, Substack as a thing

3591
01:55:50,818 --> 01:55:53,655
is a centralizing phenomenon.

3592
01:55:53,655 --> 01:55:56,115
It's a singular platform, and we have growth charts

3593
01:55:56,115 --> 01:55:57,367
and we're proud when they go

3594
01:55:57,367 --> 01:55:58,826
up that way. Unbundling and bundling.

3595
01:55:58,826 --> 01:56:01,371
Exactly, but it's not a re-bundling

3596
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:03,414
in the form of a new magazine, and specifically,

3597
01:56:03,414 --> 01:56:04,749
the way that Substack thinks about it is,

3598
01:56:04,749 --> 01:56:07,001
they're not a publisher, there're a platform,

3599
01:56:07,001 --> 01:56:09,170
and the distinction is they do not have editorial judgment.

3600
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:10,880
They are not trying to create bundles. They're not—

3601
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,216
And the economics are different for the publishers.

3602
01:56:13,216 --> 01:56:14,801
It's land reform for journalists.

3603
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:17,053
Yes, exactly. Exactly right.

3604
01:56:17,053 --> 01:56:18,930
But again, you would still say notwithstanding

3605
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:21,140
the success of Substack as a centralized platform,

3606
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:23,184
it's overall effect is still disintermediation,

3607
01:56:23,184 --> 01:56:26,062
because, specifically, what it's doing is it's bleeding off

3608
01:56:26,062 --> 01:56:27,689
many of the talented individual contributors

3609
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:28,898
at Legacy Media— Yes.

3610
01:56:28,898 --> 01:56:30,191
To have their own Substacks.

3611
01:56:30,191 --> 01:56:33,277
It somehow feels to me like we're not done

3612
01:56:33,277 --> 01:56:34,529
with the media changes.

3613
01:56:34,529 --> 01:56:38,366
Yeah. I think that's true for sure, yes.

3614
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:40,118
Oh, sorry, the media changes wrought

3615
01:56:40,118 --> 01:56:42,578
by just this latest platform change

3616
01:56:42,578 --> 01:56:46,582
of X and clips, the fact that, again, TPBN,

3617
01:56:46,582 --> 01:56:48,251
which I mention just because they're in our corner

3618
01:56:48,251 --> 01:56:50,003
of the tech world, is from this year?

3619
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:50,837
Last year? Yeah.

3620
01:56:50,837 --> 01:56:52,630
It's a very new thing, and,

3621
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:55,008
yeah, we haven't seen all the last changes.

3622
01:56:55,008 --> 01:56:55,925
Do you have any predictions?

3623
01:56:55,925 --> 01:56:57,301
For sure, I'd expect to see more of those.

3624
01:56:57,301 --> 01:56:59,721
Again, I would just say, look, what is the macro thing,

3625
01:56:59,721 --> 01:57:00,930
the big macro thing happening?

3626
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:02,640
And I love what those guys are doing

3627
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,225
and I love what Substack's doing,

3628
01:57:04,225 --> 01:57:05,852
but the big macro thing,

3629
01:57:05,852 --> 01:57:07,103
if you just think about the world change,

3630
01:57:07,103 --> 01:57:09,022
the big macro thing is TikTok, Instagram,

3631
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:11,816
and then short-form video on X,

3632
01:57:11,816 --> 01:57:13,276
and a handful of other platforms.

3633
01:57:13,276 --> 01:57:16,738
That's the macro thing, and so,

3634
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:20,783
where the future of the macro culture goes.

3635
01:57:20,783 --> 01:57:22,660
I mean, look, read Substacks,

3636
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:26,247
but a thousand, or 10,000,

3637
01:57:26,247 --> 01:57:27,832
or a hundred thousand times more activity

3638
01:57:27,832 --> 01:57:29,459
is happening on TikTok,

3639
01:57:29,459 --> 01:57:32,003
and so the macro culture is going to be shaped, I think,

3640
01:57:32,003 --> 01:57:33,504
much more by short-form video,

3641
01:57:33,504 --> 01:57:35,423
at least for the foreseeable future,

3642
01:57:35,423 --> 01:57:38,384
and then, as I'm sure is obvious now,

3643
01:57:38,384 --> 01:57:40,470
but, the role of AI production

3644
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:43,973
is about to really change things.

3645
01:57:43,973 --> 01:57:46,476
And there also may be the fact

3646
01:57:46,476 --> 01:57:48,603
that there's a single global feed now,

3647
01:57:48,603 --> 01:57:50,688
the fact that there's much less personalization in a way,

3648
01:57:50,688 --> 01:57:53,149
because so many things go to the top,

3649
01:57:53,149 --> 01:57:57,028
and in a way, I really actually don't like

3650
01:57:57,028 --> 01:57:59,614
the number of videos in my X feed these days.

3651
01:57:59,614 --> 01:58:02,033
I'm sure they perform in the metrics or something like that,

3652
01:58:02,033 --> 01:58:04,786
but if I wanted to scroll TikTok, I'd open TikTok,

3653
01:58:04,786 --> 01:58:08,289
and I don't want all the TikTok videos that get crammed in.

3654
01:58:08,289 --> 01:58:10,666
Do you guys get these in your feeds

3655
01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:12,960
where you get just random TikTok videos

3656
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,504
from random accounts in your Twitter feed?

3657
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:15,338
Yeah. Like, "No,

3658
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:17,632
I'm reading a newspaper here. I'm not trying to watch TV."

3659
01:58:17,632 --> 01:58:20,885
Yeah, no, I think the people who run these things

3660
01:58:20,885 --> 01:58:21,761
have talked about this publicly,

3661
01:58:21,761 --> 01:58:23,721
but, yeah, all the old algorithms of

3662
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:25,181
things that your friends like,

3663
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:26,933
those are not as effective as

3664
01:58:26,933 --> 01:58:29,393
just the macro algorithm.

3665
01:58:29,393 --> 01:58:30,895
We are all more similar than we think.

3666
01:58:30,895 --> 01:58:33,356
Yeah, that, but but also the nuances

3667
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:35,191
and interconnections are more subtle.

3668
01:58:36,984 --> 01:58:37,902
It's not the people you know,

3669
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:39,112
it's the people you don't know

3670
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:40,154
that you have connections with.

3671
01:58:40,154 --> 01:58:41,322
Yeah, exactly. Right.

3672
01:58:41,322 --> 01:58:42,657
You're probably more like a lot of other people

3673
01:58:42,657 --> 01:58:43,866
you've never met than you are like the people you know.

3674
01:58:43,866 --> 01:58:45,535
Yeah. For example, there's that.

3675
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:47,537
By the way, having said that,

3676
01:58:47,537 --> 01:58:49,705
I believe the biggest, I think everything

3677
01:58:49,705 --> 01:58:50,706
we just talked about is very important.

3678
01:58:50,706 --> 01:58:52,792
I think the biggest, biggest, biggest thing that's happening

3679
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:54,836
is just, we really, I think, for the first time,

3680
01:58:54,836 --> 01:58:57,755
we're entering the true era of free speech,

3681
01:58:57,755 --> 01:59:00,591
and I think that we started to get at that

3682
01:59:00,591 --> 01:59:02,051
in the 90s and 2000s,

3683
01:59:02,051 --> 01:59:04,303
and then there was a big reversion in the 2010s

3684
01:59:04,303 --> 01:59:07,265
with the censorship industrial complex that formed up,

3685
01:59:07,265 --> 01:59:09,308
and all the policies and all the government interference

3686
01:59:09,308 --> 01:59:11,185
and so forth, and, of course, a lot of that

3687
01:59:11,185 --> 01:59:14,147
continues on the part of the governments in particular,

3688
01:59:14,147 --> 01:59:18,151
but, in the US at least, that project has failed,

3689
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:21,070
and the platforms themselves are really liberalizing out,

3690
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:24,907
and then just the sheer volume, and scope,

3691
01:59:24,907 --> 01:59:26,993
and variety of content, and the number of ways

3692
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:28,452
that people have to get messages out

3693
01:59:28,452 --> 01:59:32,498
in all kinds of ways, in the hyper-acceleration culture

3694
01:59:32,498 --> 01:59:34,292
where the sensors don't even know what to ban,

3695
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,419
because they don't even know what half the stuff means.

3696
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:40,882
We probably are living in the only true mass era

3697
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:43,176
of free speech in human history.

3698
01:59:44,468 --> 01:59:46,137
You're seeing things now,

3699
01:59:47,763 --> 01:59:48,973
this is, although, probably not real time,

3700
01:59:48,973 --> 01:59:50,933
but you just see things now as just a normal user

3701
01:59:50,933 --> 01:59:52,018
that you never would've seen 10,

3702
01:59:52,018 --> 01:59:53,436
or 20, or 30, or 50 years ago.

3703
01:59:53,436 --> 01:59:54,312
There's not even a chance.

3704
01:59:54,312 --> 01:59:55,980
So, does this get to a political realignment?

3705
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:57,106
I believe it does. Yeah.

3706
01:59:57,106 --> 01:59:58,649
So, I think this is the big thing,

3707
01:59:58,649 --> 01:59:59,483
I think Martin Gurri,

3708
01:59:59,483 --> 02:00:01,194
the guy who has published this book.

3709
02:00:01,194 --> 02:00:02,361
I think he really nailed it,

3710
02:00:02,361 --> 02:00:05,156
and I think his thesis and his book came out in 2015,

3711
02:00:05,156 --> 02:00:08,117
and I think a lot of people said either,

3712
02:00:08,117 --> 02:00:09,118
"Wow, he predicted Trump,"

3713
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:11,078
which is true to some extent,

3714
02:00:11,078 --> 02:00:13,039
but that's not the big thing that he predicted.

3715
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:14,665
And then I think his prediction is, in some ways,

3716
02:00:14,665 --> 02:00:17,293
so fundamental that it's easy to just take it for granted

3717
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:18,544
and say, "Oh, of course that's what's going to happen,"

3718
02:00:18,544 --> 02:00:20,671
but it's actually so fundamentally important,

3719
02:00:20,671 --> 02:00:21,631
I can't stop thinking about it,

3720
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:23,966
which is basically true transparency,

3721
02:00:23,966 --> 02:00:27,136
true transparency, true free speech.

3722
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:29,305
It's just a fundamental solvent

3723
02:00:29,305 --> 02:00:30,139
basically dissolving all

3724
02:00:30,139 --> 02:00:32,558
centralized institutional authority.

3725
02:00:32,558 --> 02:00:34,018
And the reason for that is

3726
02:00:34,018 --> 02:00:36,145
centralized institutional authority is never perfect,

3727
02:00:36,145 --> 02:00:37,772
and it often has problems,

3728
02:00:37,772 --> 02:00:39,023
and, in fact, it often has very deep

3729
02:00:39,023 --> 02:00:41,567
and severe problems, as we were just discussing,

3730
02:00:41,567 --> 02:00:45,029
and the show that a government agency

3731
02:00:45,029 --> 02:00:46,155
or a big company could put on

3732
02:00:46,155 --> 02:00:47,698
to claim that they're better than they are,

3733
02:00:47,698 --> 02:00:49,200
that would've worked in under centralized media,

3734
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:52,286
just simply collapses under conditions of

3735
02:00:52,286 --> 02:00:54,872
true free peer-to-peer communication.

3736
02:00:54,872 --> 02:00:56,290
There are just too many examples

3737
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:58,584
of too many things that go wrong, for any institution,

3738
02:00:58,584 --> 02:01:00,628
for them to retain their credibility.

3739
02:01:00,628 --> 02:01:03,256
And then Martin and I have this big debate about this.

3740
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:04,090
Martin and I have talked about it,

3741
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,216
we have this big debate, which is, I'm like,

3742
02:01:05,216 --> 02:01:06,259
"Wow, that's fantastic," and he's like,

3743
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:07,677
"No, Marc, I didn't mean this was good.

3744
02:01:07,677 --> 02:01:09,136
I never said this was good."

3745
02:01:09,136 --> 02:01:09,971
He said to me, the following.

3746
02:01:09,971 --> 02:01:12,348
He said, "Look, it is true that every major institution

3747
02:01:12,348 --> 02:01:15,059
is much, much more broken than they have been putting on."

3748
02:01:15,059 --> 02:01:17,061
He said, "However, it is also true that we do not know

3749
02:01:17,061 --> 02:01:19,563
how to run a society without large centralized institutions,

3750
02:01:19,563 --> 02:01:21,274
and so," he said, "those of you," like me,

3751
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:23,651
"who cheerlead the collapse of centralized institutions

3752
02:01:23,651 --> 02:01:25,194
have not yet come up with an answer

3753
02:01:25,194 --> 02:01:26,654
for what exists on the other side."

3754
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:29,198
But anyway, point being, I think

3755
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:31,200
now, we're really going to go through that.

3756
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,159
Now, we're really going to find out.

3757
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:33,452
The business version of this is,

3758
02:01:33,452 --> 02:01:35,871
you used to be able to push a bad product

3759
02:01:35,871 --> 02:01:37,123
through a strong channel,

3760
02:01:37,123 --> 02:01:38,582
with strong marketing and sales.

3761
02:01:38,582 --> 02:01:39,417
Mm. Right.

3762
02:01:39,417 --> 02:01:40,376
You just can't do that anymore.

3763
02:01:40,376 --> 02:01:42,461
Right. The product quality will out

3764
02:01:42,461 --> 02:01:44,964
and it's deterministic.

3765
02:01:44,964 --> 02:01:45,798
Yeah, that's right.

3766
02:01:45,798 --> 02:01:47,258
And, by the way, you get this phenomenon.

3767
02:01:47,258 --> 02:01:48,592
You see this all over the place,

3768
02:01:48,592 --> 02:01:50,845
and you see this in Gallup does this great poll

3769
02:01:50,845 --> 02:01:54,473
of trust in institutions, and the numbers are just all

3770
02:01:54,473 --> 02:01:57,268
cratering, and the declines are accelerating.

3771
02:01:58,352 --> 02:01:59,895
You also see, and again, not to pick on specifics,

3772
02:01:59,895 --> 02:02:01,439
but you also see this in these political parties,

3773
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:02,982
and you have a lot of this happening in Europe right now,

3774
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:04,608
where these parties come in and they have, whatever,

3775
02:02:04,608 --> 02:02:05,901
60% approval or whatever,

3776
02:02:05,901 --> 02:02:09,030
and then six months later, they have 15% approval.

3777
02:02:09,030 --> 02:02:11,407
It's like, "What the hell?"

3778
02:02:11,407 --> 02:02:12,241
Mm-hmm. Right?

3779
02:02:12,241 --> 02:02:14,785
Or, I'll give you an American example.

3780
02:02:14,785 --> 02:02:17,330
Eric Adams in New York, as the incumbent, has 9%.

3781
02:02:18,456 --> 02:02:22,168
It's just, how can you possibly have a system

3782
02:02:22,168 --> 02:02:25,129
in which the ruler has a 9%-approval rating?

3783
02:02:25,129 --> 02:02:26,297
Well, it's like, "Well, how did that happen?"

3784
02:02:26,297 --> 02:02:28,382
Well, it's all too transparent.

3785
02:02:28,382 --> 02:02:30,968
Everything that's going wrong is too transparent.

3786
02:02:30,968 --> 02:02:33,054
It can't be finessed.

3787
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:34,513
The extreme version of this,

3788
02:02:34,513 --> 02:02:37,516
for good or ill, is that the centralized state

3789
02:02:37,516 --> 02:02:39,477
is an outcome of centralized media.

3790
02:02:39,477 --> 02:02:41,604
The nation state is downstream from the newspaper.

3791
02:02:41,604 --> 02:02:43,522
Right. Yeah, that's right.

3792
02:02:43,522 --> 02:02:44,982
Right, exactly, right, and so, yeah,

3793
02:02:44,982 --> 02:02:48,361
you can't hold it together.

3794
02:02:48,361 --> 02:02:52,198
You know, another of my counter arguments to Martin was,

3795
02:02:53,407 --> 02:02:55,576
basically, if you look at what the media landscape was like

3796
02:02:55,576 --> 02:02:57,828
in Colonial America, it was actually much more like

3797
02:02:57,828 --> 02:03:00,456
what it's like now than it was like it was in 1950.

3798
02:03:00,456 --> 02:03:02,458
Pamphleteers. Pamphleteers, and you'd have

3799
02:03:02,458 --> 02:03:04,794
15 small newspapers in a city like Philadelphia,

3800
02:03:04,794 --> 02:03:07,546
and you'd have just enormous amounts of

3801
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:08,923
contention and name calling,

3802
02:03:08,923 --> 02:03:09,965
and all kinds of things.

3803
02:03:09,965 --> 02:03:10,883
Anonymous bloggers.

3804
02:03:10,883 --> 02:03:13,219
Anonymous bloggers, yeah. They had all that stuff.

3805
02:03:13,219 --> 02:03:14,720
Benjamin Franklin literally wrote

3806
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,347
under 15 different pseudonyms and he would

3807
02:03:16,347 --> 02:03:17,181
send them to people—

3808
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:18,432
Voltaire, the same. Yeah. Fighting with each other.

3809
02:03:18,432 --> 02:03:20,643
Right, all these things.

3810
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,978
And I was, "Look, we've lived this before,"

3811
02:03:22,978 --> 02:03:25,189
and he's like, "Yes, and it was a time of revolution."

3812
02:03:27,274 --> 02:03:30,486
Correct, and to me it's so fascinating.

3813
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:34,532
We're really in that now.

3814
02:03:34,532 --> 02:03:37,493
I feel like that was still being held back,

3815
02:03:37,493 --> 02:03:39,954
as late as last year, by the censorship apparatus,

3816
02:03:39,954 --> 02:03:41,664
and now, it's just like, "Okay."

3817
02:03:41,664 --> 02:03:43,582
Now it's all coming out.

3818
02:03:43,582 --> 02:03:45,292
And, maybe another way to think about this

3819
02:03:45,292 --> 02:03:47,128
is the narrative for the last decade

3820
02:03:47,128 --> 02:03:49,380
has been the internet is a fountain of misinformation,

3821
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:50,881
and there is some truth to that.

3822
02:03:50,881 --> 02:03:52,466
There's a lot of misinformation online,

3823
02:03:52,466 --> 02:03:53,426
but the other thing is,

3824
02:03:53,426 --> 02:03:54,593
according to the Martin Gurri thesis,

3825
02:03:54,593 --> 02:03:56,345
the internet is an x-ray machine,

3826
02:03:56,345 --> 02:03:58,472
because every actually correct thing

3827
02:03:58,472 --> 02:04:00,891
that all of these institutions are doing wrong

3828
02:04:00,891 --> 02:04:03,018
is now being fully ventilated for the first time ever,

3829
02:04:03,018 --> 02:04:04,603
and they cannot survive that,

3830
02:04:04,603 --> 02:04:08,691
and that may ultimately include the governments themselves.

3831
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:10,443
We're describing one trend here,

3832
02:04:10,443 --> 02:04:12,736
which is the move along

3833
02:04:12,736 --> 02:04:15,239
the decentralization centralization spectrum,

3834
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:17,616
and, I think I'm not quite as enthusiastic,

3835
02:04:17,616 --> 02:04:21,579
or it seems pretty complex, that whole spectrum,

3836
02:04:21,579 --> 02:04:23,581
but the other change, to me, again,

3837
02:04:23,581 --> 02:04:25,916
seems to be the single global feed that's emerging.

3838
02:04:25,916 --> 02:04:28,752
So take an example, the Astronomer CEO,

3839
02:04:28,752 --> 02:04:31,714
and that whole thing, the CEO with his HR lady

3840
02:04:31,714 --> 02:04:35,134
being caught on video, that was just the front page

3841
02:04:35,134 --> 02:04:36,719
of the internet for that day,

3842
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:37,887
or those one or two days.

3843
02:04:37,887 --> 02:04:38,762
I was talking to someone who was saying

3844
02:04:38,762 --> 02:04:40,306
they were talking to someone in China,

3845
02:04:40,306 --> 02:04:41,682
and they were joking about it,

3846
02:04:41,682 --> 02:04:44,393
but it was just prominent in China as well,

3847
02:04:44,393 --> 02:04:49,148
in the news there, and that didn't happen as much

3848
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:50,191
10 or 20 years ago,

3849
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:52,026
and I don't even think it happened again,

3850
02:04:52,026 --> 02:04:53,777
even when we had the internet and cable media,

3851
02:04:53,777 --> 02:04:55,070
because we didn't have the clip

3852
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:56,030
and the ability for the things to go as—

3853
02:04:56,030 --> 02:04:58,657
Yeah, I guess text is much more

3854
02:04:58,657 --> 02:04:59,909
language barrier. There's less virality.

3855
02:04:59,909 --> 02:05:01,744
But it's also language barriers

3856
02:05:01,744 --> 02:05:04,455
prevent text from crossing borders.

3857
02:05:04,455 --> 02:05:05,664
Clips can cross borders.

3858
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,957
And just recommender algorithms

3859
02:05:06,957 --> 02:05:08,250
for things right at the top, I think.

3860
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:09,835
So, all these factors,

3861
02:05:09,835 --> 02:05:12,213
do you just have thoughts on the implications

3862
02:05:12,213 --> 02:05:14,632
of having a single global feed?

3863
02:05:14,632 --> 02:05:18,802
Yeah, so this is kind of the global monoculture.

3864
02:05:18,802 --> 02:05:22,097
Maybe, I mean... Well, Marshall McLuhan

3865
02:05:22,097 --> 02:05:24,683
had this concept he called "The Global village,"

3866
02:05:24,683 --> 02:05:27,394
and this is another one of these things where he said,

3867
02:05:27,394 --> 02:05:30,022
"People think I meant it positively and I actually didn't,"

3868
02:05:30,022 --> 02:05:31,732
and so he said, "Electronic media formed the entire world

3869
02:05:31,732 --> 02:05:32,691
into a global village."

3870
02:05:32,691 --> 02:05:33,692
And he was talking about TV,

3871
02:05:33,692 --> 02:05:35,194
but you could say TV had a certain

3872
02:05:35,194 --> 02:05:36,153
amount of that too. Early version of that.

3873
02:05:36,153 --> 02:05:37,112
An early version of that, because it could spread

3874
02:05:37,112 --> 02:05:39,573
a single video feed much, much more broadly.

3875
02:05:39,573 --> 02:05:44,453
And what he said is like, "It used to be that every

3876
02:05:44,453 --> 02:05:45,412
village was its own village,

3877
02:05:45,412 --> 02:05:47,248
and so the things that happened in that village,

3878
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:48,624
if the wrong man kissed the wrong woman,

3879
02:05:48,624 --> 02:05:50,209
it was a really big deal in that village,

3880
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:51,502
but it wasn't a big deal in the next village.

3881
02:05:51,502 --> 02:05:52,586
Didn't even know about it.

3882
02:05:52,586 --> 02:05:55,172
Now all of a sudden, the entire world is becoming

3883
02:05:55,172 --> 02:05:55,965
a single global village."

3884
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:58,133
And he said, "Here's the problem with that,

3885
02:05:58,133 --> 02:06:00,719
is that villages are really fucked up."

3886
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:02,429
They're really dysfunctionally

3887
02:06:02,429 --> 02:06:03,472
fucked up a lot of the time,

3888
02:06:03,472 --> 02:06:06,892
because they're panopticons, everybody sees everybody else,

3889
02:06:06,892 --> 02:06:08,561
they're tremendously judgemental,

3890
02:06:09,562 --> 02:06:11,897
the social relations have carried tremendous weight.

3891
02:06:11,897 --> 02:06:13,691
If you end up getting sideways with the social relations

3892
02:06:13,691 --> 02:06:15,150
of the village, you're in serious trouble.

3893
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:16,944
You might get exiled. You might die.

3894
02:06:17,903 --> 02:06:20,906
They're prone to manias and panics, witch trials,

3895
02:06:20,906 --> 02:06:23,492
They're hot-house environments.

3896
02:06:23,492 --> 02:06:24,618
They tend to go crazy.

3897
02:06:25,578 --> 02:06:29,331
And then specifically, I think, the next version of that,

3898
02:06:29,331 --> 02:06:30,916
I don't know if he said this, but other people said this,

3899
02:06:30,916 --> 02:06:35,796
is like, cosmopolitan societies

3900
02:06:35,796 --> 02:06:36,964
are like written written.

3901
02:06:36,964 --> 02:06:39,425
They're written in nature,

3902
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:41,844
and they have the ability to have

3903
02:06:41,844 --> 02:06:43,887
dispassionate communication discussion.

3904
02:06:43,887 --> 02:06:47,433
Villages are all about orality. It's all oral.

3905
02:06:47,433 --> 02:06:49,602
It's all spoken, and, again,

3906
02:06:51,103 --> 02:06:54,064
it's this social hot house of spoken,

3907
02:06:54,064 --> 02:06:57,359
and therefore, de-intellectualized,

3908
02:06:57,359 --> 02:06:58,527
highly-emotionalized content.

3909
02:06:58,527 --> 02:07:00,738
So, Marshall McLuhan was writing about TV culture,

3910
02:07:00,738 --> 02:07:01,780
but he was actually pressing

3911
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:02,615
into the clip culture. He was actually writing

3912
02:07:02,615 --> 02:07:04,533
about... I believe that's right,

3913
02:07:04,533 --> 02:07:05,993
and then, I think what he would say

3914
02:07:05,993 --> 02:07:07,244
if he were here today is, I think he would say,

3915
02:07:07,244 --> 02:07:09,705
"Yes, congratulations, guys. You got the global village."

3916
02:07:09,705 --> 02:07:11,332
He would say, "The Bible has the parable

3917
02:07:11,332 --> 02:07:13,626
of the Tower of Babel being a disaster

3918
02:07:13,626 --> 02:07:15,628
for a very specific reason.

3919
02:07:15,628 --> 02:07:17,338
If you centralize everybody

3920
02:07:17,338 --> 02:07:18,839
into a single, giant village,

3921
02:07:18,839 --> 02:07:20,841
you're going to have all the dysfunctionality,

3922
02:07:20,841 --> 02:07:23,636
you're going to have all the crazed panics

3923
02:07:23,636 --> 02:07:25,137
and freakouts of a village,

3924
02:07:25,137 --> 02:07:26,221
basically happening all the time,"

3925
02:07:26,221 --> 02:07:29,433
which is, in fact, what we see.

3926
02:07:29,433 --> 02:07:34,438
You know, I think our friend Tyler Cohen,

3927
02:07:35,731 --> 02:07:38,317
at this point thinks this is all very bad.

3928
02:07:38,317 --> 02:07:39,902
McLuhan definitely thought it was bad.

3929
02:07:39,902 --> 02:07:43,030
On the other hand, I don't know, I grew up in a small town,

3930
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:44,198
it wasn't that great.

3931
02:07:44,198 --> 02:07:45,282
A disconnected small town

3932
02:07:45,282 --> 02:07:46,533
wasn't that great either.

3933
02:07:50,162 --> 02:07:51,413
Is it really better to live in a world

3934
02:07:51,413 --> 02:07:52,498
where there's only a few places

3935
02:07:52,498 --> 02:07:55,084
where there's access to advanced thinking

3936
02:07:55,084 --> 02:07:57,544
and cosmopolitanism, or is it actually

3937
02:07:57,544 --> 02:07:58,629
the fact that everybody in the planet

3938
02:07:58,629 --> 02:08:00,839
can now be a full part of society and culture?

3939
02:08:00,839 --> 02:08:02,841
I feel like there's a Marc Andreessen worldview

3940
02:08:02,841 --> 02:08:03,801
that you've talked about enough

3941
02:08:03,801 --> 02:08:06,220
that it's now kind of a thing that exists beyond you,

3942
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:08,555
that's maybe just being dispositionally optimistic

3943
02:08:08,555 --> 02:08:13,560
on technology generally, and refusing to break

3944
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:16,522
any false nostalgia about the past.

3945
02:08:16,522 --> 02:08:18,524
Like, "I was there in rural,

3946
02:08:18,524 --> 02:08:19,566
small-town Wisconsin.

3947
02:08:19,566 --> 02:08:20,651
It wasn't good." You know?

3948
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:21,568
Right, yeah. Exactly.

3949
02:08:21,568 --> 02:08:22,403
Yes, exactly. That's right.

3950
02:08:22,403 --> 02:08:23,487
That's right. I agree.

3951
02:08:23,487 --> 02:08:24,863
Great. Thank you. All good.

3952
02:08:24,863 --> 02:08:25,698
To cheeky pints.

3953
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:26,865
Exactly. There you go.
