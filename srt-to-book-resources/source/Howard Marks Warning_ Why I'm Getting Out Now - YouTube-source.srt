1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,290
all right, here's what i said.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,290
i said, " describe howard marks in 280 characters.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,770
" here's what he gave you. howard marks is a legendary investor

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,450
co and co-founder of oak tree capital. known for his sharp memos, contrarian thinking, and risk focused approach,

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,769
he made billions zigging when others zag,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,969
especially in crisises.

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,690
when he writes, wall street listens.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,130
pretty flattering.

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,250
> > pretty pretty good.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,570
yeah.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:33,450
[music] okay. well, i i think the best place to start is that kind of zigg while other zag.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,050
so, i want to ask about the s & p

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,570
because you don't know much about us, but the the short version of uh

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,290
of the guy you see across from you there, sam, is

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,250
uh

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,890
sam's an entrepreneur.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,090
sam builds his company.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,969
he sold his company

19
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,489
and he took the money that he made and he said, " look, i worked hard for this money.

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,690
now, i want this money to work hard for me, but i need it to be safe.

21
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:51,690
"

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,329
and says, " sam went into a a mostly, you know, best practice lowcost index funds in the s & p 500.

23
00:00:58,339 --> 00:00:58,329
"

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,010
and anytime i ask sam about his strategy,

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,890
or i tell him, " dude, you got to buy bitcoin, ethereum.

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,690
you got to buy this.

27
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,490
you got to put some money over here. " cuz i'm i'm like, you know,

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,729
if sam is vanilla, i don't even know what i am.

29
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:10,250
i'm some flavor off in the side.

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,250
that's > > how strange tutti frutti.

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,490
> > i'm tutti frutti over here.

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,210
and i keep trying to pull him over here, but he says, " no, no, no.

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,530
i like vanilla.

34
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,330
" and so he

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:18,970
um

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,330
he basically just says the long-term average of the s & p 500 is 10

37
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:22,330
%.

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,850
if i just hold this for 50 years, i'm going to double, you know, this many times, i'm good.

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,530
but, you know, i do get a little wary when

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,170
um

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,090
anything seems too safe or too too certain

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,290
or i guess too taken for granted

43
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,650
that this 10 % number over the long term will be the be what it'll be.

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,970
i guess what would your message be to sam? is sam

45
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,210
just

46
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,530
you know,

47
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:39,930
is he right?

48
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,409
is he wrong?

49
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,170
would you give him a caution of warning? if if he was your nephew, he looks like he might be your nephew.

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,130
if he was your nephew,

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,649
what would you be telling him? well, on the one hand, sam, you're right

52
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:49,930
because if you

53
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,049
if you have more money

54
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:57,290
than you need to eat, the first purpose of your money should be to make you comfortable.

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,689
it doesn't make any sense.

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,930
buffett says, " don't risk what you have and need to get what you don't have and don't need.

57
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:15,450
" it does makes no sense for somebody with a surplus of money to make their daily life less pleasant

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,530
by going to investments that put them under pressure.

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,690
> > but there's going to be a butt on your statement. it sounds like > >

60
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:31,129
but on the other hand, the riskiest thing in the world is the belief that there's no risk.

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,250
the risk in the markets does not come from the companies. the securities or the institutions

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,530
like the exchanges.

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,970
the risk in the markets comes from the behavior of people.

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,330
and it's that for that reason that buffett says

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,330
when others are imprudent, you should be prudent.

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:03:02,730
when other people are carefree, you should be terrified because their behavior unduly raises prices and makes them precarious.

67
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,330
when other people are terrified, you should be aggressive because their behavior

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,569
their behavior suppresses prices to the point where everything's a giveaway.

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,890
so, i don't

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,170
i mean, look,

71
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,690
in the long run, you're right about the s

72
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:19,690
& p

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:31,930
and over the over the coming years, american companies on balance are going to produce prosperity. what

74
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:40,330
what's that defined as long-term in this? > > well, i would say 20 or more > > is

75
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,489
is

76
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:41,129
is the

77
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,330
is the real long term.

78
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:50,810
and i'll tell you in a minute how i get there, but my favorite cartoon, i have a file of cartoons from over the years.

79
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,530
my favorite one, there's a guy, he's got his

80
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,170
there's a car pulled over to the side of the road.

81
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,610
the guy's in a phone booth. so, you know, it's an old uh

82
00:03:59,620 --> 00:03:59,849
cartoon

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,370
cuz there are no more phone booths

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,890
and there's a f there as a factory going up in the background

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,489
and he's screaming into the telephone, i don't give a damn about prudent diversification.

86
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,330
sell my fenwick chemical. in other words,

87
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,769
prudent diversification

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,729
calls for certain investment positions and a variety of them in a certain composition.

89
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,970
reality says, " i see fenway chemicals burning to the ground. get me out. " and you have

90
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:40,650
you can't ignore reality. now, why what's reality in this case for you? reality is recognizing where things stand.

91
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,850
and jp morgan

92
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:44,889
uh

93
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,090
published a chart around the end of 24

94
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,850
and it was a scatter diagram showing over the years

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,889
if you bought

96
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,090
uh

97
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,250
the relationship between the s & p 500 at purchase

98
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,570
and the return over the annualized return over the next 10 years.

99
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,370
and it looked like this. on this axis we had return

100
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,850
and on this axis we had pe ratio

101
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,530
and it was a

102
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,690
it was a a negative correlation

103
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,250
which means the higher the pe ratio you pay

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,490
the lower the return you should expect.

105
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,810
makes perfect sense. and it showed there was a number here 23

106
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,610
on the pe ratio axis

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,130
and it showed

108
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,250
and which is what the pe ratio on the s & p was at the time.

109
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,490
and it showed that historically

110
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,729
if you bought the s & p

111
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,250
when the pe ratio was 23

112
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,370
in every case there were no exceptions.

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,610
in every case, your annualized return over the next 10 years was between 2 and minus 2.

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,289
that's all you have to know. > > and what what are we today? what is it today? 23

116
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,370
25

117
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,330
because

118
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:06,729
why?

119
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,289
because this prices have risen. now maybe the outlook has risen. so maybe it's still 23.

120
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,130
but i think let's say i think 24.

121
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,490
um, so you can say the s & p has returned 10 % a year on average for 100 years.

122
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,690
i i'm happy with 10.

123
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,250
i'm in.

124
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,289
or you can say it doesn't always return 10.

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,289
by the way, one of the most interesting things about the s & p, if you do the research,

126
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,810
and i did it for a memo,

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,330
on average, it has returned 10 % a year for 100 years.

128
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,810
but do you know that the annual return is almost never between 8 and 12?

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,169
> > think about that. > > like it

130

137

so

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:02,569
um

139
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,370
a lot of our listeners

141
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,530

you know i i was fortunate.

143
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,770

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,770

148

> > well, you

149
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,690
you do have an alternative.

150
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,930
you could figure out an algorithm to rebalance your position based on relative price

151
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,449
and you could put it on autopilot.

152
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,490
i don't recommend, you know, making judgments about the future

153
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,410
and the appropriateness of today's price for the future you perceive,

154
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,690
but you can do that and and uh

155
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,610
there are ways to do these things even if you just use common sense.

158
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,370
so, i i've tried to suppress my tendency to talk my book

159
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,930
until now, but but i i think an alternative is is bonds,

160
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,050
you know,

161
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,930
and in 19

162
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,729
i joined city bank in the investment research department in 1969 as an equity analyst.

163
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,650
and the bank did so horribly that in 78 i was banished to the bond department

164
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,129
and the bond department was the equivalent of siberia.

165
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,810
the good news is that at that time, american corporations pretty much gave lifetime employment.

166
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,569
so, i didn't get sacked, but i'm in the bond department

167
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,849
and i get a phone call from the head of the bond department saying

168
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,809
that there's some guy in in california named something like milin

169
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,690
and he he invests in something called high yield bonds.

170
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,130
can you figure out what that means? and i said, " yes.

171
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,130
" and i became a high yield bond investor.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,810
and and you know what?

173
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,450
when you buy a bond, there's a contract that says the borrower will pay you interest every six months

174
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:59,290
and give you your money back at the end and you can figure out the return that is implied

175
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,410
by that contract.

176
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,930
and if they

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,010
if the borrower doesn't keep that contract,

178
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,410
over generalizing, oversimplifying,

179
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,730
the creditors get the company through the bankruptcy process.

180
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,850
so the borrower has a lot of incentive to pay you

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,610
and they almost always pay.

182
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,850
i've been involved in high yield bonds for 47 years and i can tell you they've almost all paid.

183
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,850
so today you can buy high yield bonds

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,570
whether it be the us or europe or variations on that theme what we call lowgrade uh credit

185
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,010
and you can buy buy it to get yields of 7 to 8.

186
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,050
now 7 to 8 is pretty close to 10.

187
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,370
so that's that that's a good thing.

188
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,970
the bad thing is you have to pay tax every year on the on the income.

189
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,010
that's a bad thing.

190
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,690
but for those of us who are cautious like you

191
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:09,370
and me, we might say, i'll take, you know, eight, which in the long run will give me four after tax, as opposed to 10, which after capital gains taxation will give me seven.

192
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,290
or maybe i'll mix them. maybe i'll own a little less s & p and a little more debt

193
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,370
because i'm > > that's what i do now. > > yeah.

194
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,930
because i'm worried. it's not all or nothing.

195
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,370
then that's why i

196
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,730
when i'm on tv shows

197
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,769
and they say, " well, is this a sell or buy? is this risk on or risk off?

198
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,329
" i resist that formulation

199
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,130
because it's never one or the other. it's it's a mix

200
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,769
and the only question that's relevant is what mix.

201
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,329
i think the way

202
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:50,649
when you manage your portfolio, the the operative continuum to think about is the continu continuum

203
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,209
that runs from aggressive to defensive.

204
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,170
and i think about a speedometer in the car. so zero is no risk.

205
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,570
100 is max risk.

206
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,570
100 % aggressive.

207
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,290
you should have a sense for your appropriate normal posture.

208
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,370
and it sounds to me like sam, you're a little conservative guy.

209
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,610
you've made so much money you can't believe it, but you don't want to give it back.

210
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,970
so, so i would say that you're a

211
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,610
you're a 65

212
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,050
and especially given your youth, you may be a 55 for your cohort.

213
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,290
so i

214
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,610
and

215
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:36,010
and i think you should figure out every every listener, every investor should figure out the right place for them

216
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,930
and try to stay there most of the time.

217
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,450
we need to get a couch here and you could just i'll call you dr. markx

218
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,209
and you know what i run

219
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,970
i once wrote a memo called on the couch

220
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,410
because i think that once in a while the market needs a trip to the shrink.

221
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,209
i went back

222
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:50,250
and i read a bunch of old memos

223
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,930
and the one that stood out to me was the uh bubble.

224
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,649
com one.

225
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,769
so, you wrote this back in 2000, and i actually have a few of these,

226
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:04,170
where i feel like there's been moments in time, maybe 2000, 2008, 2012, 2020, where

227
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,690
uh

228
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,410
it seemed like consensus was going one way,

229
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,010
maybe it was max greed

230
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,769
and you went the other way, or was max fear and panic, and then you

231
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,050
you were actually very aggressive.

232
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,410
um, you did the thing where buffett says, " be fearful

233
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,570
when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

234
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,209
" it's cool to say, but it's hard to actually do.

235
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,690
and i thought it'd be fun if you could kind of walk us through a couple of those moments.

236
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,050
and i don't know, like, you know, not to go too far down memory memory lane, but just, you know,

237
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,329
take us back to, you know,

238
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:35,130
the one in 2000.

239
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,610
what'd you see? what'd you do? how did it, you know,

240
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,730
how did it play out? what'd you learn from

241
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,610
that? take us through a couple of those, cuz i think that's your superpower.

242
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,610
first of all,

243
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,410
uh,

244
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,250
one of my sayings is we never know

245
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,970
where we're going, but we sure as hell ought to know where we are.

246
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,010
and at oak tree, uh,

247
00:12:52,079 --> 00:13:01,850
we loudly proclaim our, uh, inability to make macro forecasts and our non-reliance on macro forecasts.

248
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,690
but if we want to do the right thing

249
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,089
visav

250
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,970
the macro, we should be able to figure out what's going on at the present time

251
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,529
and what that implies for the future.

252
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,930
it may not happen the thing you think it implies, but it probably has a higher chance of happening

253
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,010
than not happening if you're logical

254
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,410
and and understand history and patterns.

255
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,769
and i i wrote a book called mastering the market cycle, which was published in 18.

256
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,610
and uh

257
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,329
uh

258
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:37,610
i always say it's a cheesy title, but it wasn't my idea.

259
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,649
the publisher wanted that title because they thought it would sell more books.

260
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,570
but i like the subtitle and the subtitle says getting the odds on your side.

261
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,209
and i believe that

262
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,290
where we stand in the cycle determines what probably is going to happen and how likely it is.

263
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,649
and understanding that can improve your odds.

264
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,250
it can't make you a sure winner, but it can improve your odds.

265
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,449
and that's the best we can do in an uncertain world beset by randomness.

266
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,170
so, you know, i i don't know if you know that i started writing the memos in 1990. uh

267
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,570
uh

268
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:20,410
bubble. com on the first day of 2000 was the first one that ever garnered a response.

269
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,170
i went 10 years.

270
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,649
not only did nobody say, " hey, that was good.

271
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,329
" nobody even said, " i got it.

272
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,410
" and and and and so one of the mysteries is why i kept

273
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:30,649
> >

274
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:34,170

275
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,889
how many > > crickets?

276
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,570
well, you know,

277
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,810
in 1990, a h 100red,

278
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,649
> > okay? > >

279
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:40,810
you know,

280
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,170
and by mail, of course,

281
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,410
i wrote bubble. com january the 2nd of uh 2000,

282
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,329
and it had two virtues. it was right, and it was right fast.

283
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,730
if you're right slow, it it doesn't look like you were right.

284
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,970
one of the great sayings in our business is

285
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,889
that being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,889
so the

287
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:08,089
the answer is i was not too far ahead. uh

288
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,649
in in the fall of 99

289
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,930
i read a book called devil take the heindostmost. it

290
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,170
it's

291
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,410
a

292
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,410
it's a history of financial speculation. > > were you looking for books about that

293
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,050
cuz you had a hunch or you just randomly read this book? > > no,

294
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,730
i i don't remember why i read it. uh

295
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,250
the idea comes first.

296
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,769
not my books.

297
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,130
my memos are not researchbased.

298
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,449
they're based on ideas that resonate with me.

299
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,970
and so i'm reading this book.

300
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,610
i am interested in financial speculation. i'm interested in cycles. i'm interested in in the extremes of uh

301
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,649
financial behavior.

302
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,610
uh

303
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,449
so that's probably why i read it.

304
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,290
but i'm reading this book

305
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,329
and it talks about all these crazy things that people did, especially in something called the south sea bubble.

306
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,690
uh

307
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,690
britain had this big national debt and they concluded that they could uh

308
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,130
pay it off by starting a company called the south sea company.

309
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,009
uh

310
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,610
and they granted them a license to trade with the south sea

311
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:08,329
by

312
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,889
which they meant not samoa but brazil

313
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:12,089
and

314
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,130
and they would charge them a license fee and that would pay off the debt.

315
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,209
and it was one of the one of the great bubbles.

316
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,410
and so i'm reading in the book about what people were doing in 1720

317
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,009
and you know people were quitting their day jobs

318
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:39,529
and hanging out in alehouses to trade the shares of the south sea company

319
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,130
etc

320
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,610
etc

321
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:41,850
etc.

322
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,209
and i said that's what's going on now in the tech bubble.

323
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,690
people, you may recall that people were quitting their jobs, becoming day traders.

324
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,290
people with no money could trade stocks as long as they didn't co carry any balance overnight. and um

325
00:16:59,600 --> 00:16:59,850
and

326
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,089
and

327
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,730
uh

328
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,370
young people were quitting mba programs

329
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,329
because they had an idea and if they waited until they graduated, somebody else would take it.

330
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,410
so so it just resonated.

331
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,970
and one of the quotes i use the most now is from uh

332
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,449
mark twain

333
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,169
who said, " history does not repeat, but it does rhyme.

334
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,329
there are certain themes that rhyme from generation to generation and cycle to cycle

335
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,970
because they are embedded in human nature

336
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,329
and so they recur.

337
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,809
" and so and when you

338
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,450
when you get older in our business, you know,

339
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:40,010
obviously one of the things i uh hasten to point out is there is no such thing as knowing something about the future.

340
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,130
and if you don't know about the future

341
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,730
and you want to figure out the future, there's no such thing as analyzing the future.

342
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,010
it doesn't exist.

343
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,850
and the only thing you can do to get a handle on the future is look at the past

344
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,130
and uh look for the repetition of patterns as twain said

345
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,450
and try to figure out if they apply today.

346
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,289
so this was very easy. so i wrote this memo bubble. com and it said what they were doing

347
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,490
people are doing today.

348
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,770
and i point tried to point out the folly of what i saw going on.

349
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,130
companies with no profits and no revenues were being highly valued

350
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,570
maybe no product

351
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,450
just an idea.

352
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,490
and that is the epitome of a bubble.

353
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,690
so i wrote the memo

354
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,650
uh

355
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,370
as i say

356
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,250
january the 2nd

357
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,890
sometime around midyear the tech bubble started to collapse.

358
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,450
so as i said in the introduction to one of my books after 10 years i became an overnight success.

359
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,090
and did you actually bet against it

360
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,970
or did you just preserve capital by not fomoing into every you know tech company

361
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:53,690
basically like

362
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,410
what was the

363
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,370
what was the win of that for you? first of all,

364
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,010
we're not involved.

365
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,770
we're basically not involved in the us stock market and we're not involved at all in technology.

366
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,250
so, we wouldn't have a chance to apply that.

367
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,090
but i think what we did is we recognized that

368
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,130
and by the way,

369
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,250
things don't happen in isolation uniquely.

370
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,890
so when you

371
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,610
when you see something like i describe in the tech bubble, you should realize

372
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,929
that maybe there are ramifications in other world parts of the world.

373
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,570
and we figured out that people were engaging in optimism, not pessimism, greed, not fear,

374
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:39,770
uh

375
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,090
credulousness,

376
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,610
not skepticism, risk tolerance, not risk aversion.

377
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,370
and when

378
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,410
uh

379
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,250
as buffett says about prudence,

380
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,330
when nobody's afraid,

381
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,770
unwise deals can get done easily. simple as that.

382
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,890
and the people who buy that stuff, it usually ends badly.

383
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,289
> > the way that you explain it, i think everything makes sense and i totally buy into it.

384
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,130
but that's actually quite challenging to understand this like macro environment and to say this is where we are.

385
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,530
> > yeah.

386
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,250
well,

387
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,370
uh,

388
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,850
you have to be clinical. you have to observe and and without emotion

389
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,450
understand what's going on and what the what the implications are.

390
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,650
and of course, the what we call what i call emotion is part of what's called human nature.

391
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,730
if you succumb to human nature, it tends to get you to do the wrong thing at the wrong time.

392
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,490
i came across a great quote within the last year from a guy who's a retired trader.

393
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,530
when the time comes to buy, you won't want to.

394
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,370
and and that in that that that encapsulated encapsulates so much wisdom

395
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,570
because what is it that causes the great moments to buy?

396
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,850
it's probably the point of lowest

397
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,730
uh

398
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,130
consensus.

399
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,010
so, but

400
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,730
when most people don't believe would be the time

401
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,010
that the price is going to be the lowest, right? it's the time with either the most uncertainty

402
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,289
or the most pessimism or the most fear,

403
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,409
most conservatism.

404
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,450
uh

405
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,250
so, you also want to be all those things. > > what causes those things? you're talking about

406
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:30,330
you're talking about the manifestation. what's the cause? > > bad news. i don't know.

407
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,809
bad news, bad events, > > bad moves, either either exogenous

408
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:44,490
or geopol or or in the economy, faltering corporate fortunes, declining stock prices, widespread losses,

409
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,169
and a proliferation of articles about how terrible the future looks.

410
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,650
so the point that's why you don't want to buy at the low.

411
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,409
who would want to buy under those circumstances, > > right?

412
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:02,250
and so you you talked before in your introduction

413
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:03,850
uh

414
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,049
about zigging when others zag.

415
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,049
the only thing i'm sure of is if you zigg

416
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,929
when they zigg, you're not going to outperform.

417
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,809
do you still feel that fear

418
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,530
uh

419
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,970
you know of you

420
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,570
like when you know you're supposed to buy, do you still feel fearful

421
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,650
or do you feel like nice, hello

422
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,370
my old friend.

423
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,169
i love this emotion.

424
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,450
this is what i'm supposed to do.

425
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,809
right? i mean, it's not easy, but you have to know, you have to do it.

426
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:43,690
if you think about it, the fortunes of companies and the outlook for companies doesn't change much. what

427
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,169
and i'm

428
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:45,370
i'm writing a memo about this

429
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,970
that'll come out one of these days.

430
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,610
and what changes is how people think about what's going on and think about the future. and co.

431
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:59,289
so what changes is the relationship of price to what i'll call value.

432
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,890
sometimes they hate them, sometimes they love them.

433
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,929
when they love them too much, you should expect them to probably go down.

434
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,890
that sounds like a bull market or a bubble.

435
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,409
and when they hate them too much, you should expect them to go up.

436
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,809
that sounds like a bare market or a crash.

437
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,010
and so you have to do the opposite.

438
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,570
and and the the same developments in the environment that that affect everybody else will affect you.

439
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,730
you're subject to them.

440
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,450
you feel them.

441
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,610
you read about them. you hear about them. everybody tells you how dire the outlook is. and you know,

442
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,169
uh

443
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,210
it's hard to ignore them, but you have to do the right thing in the face of them.

444
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,610
uh

445
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,169
1998,

446
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,010
we had

447
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:46,809
uh

448
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,890
the russian ruble devaluation.

449
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,970
the debt crisis in in southeast asia

450
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:53,929
and

451
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:55,289
um

452
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,929
the meltdown of long-term capital management.

453
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,049
and one of our portfolio managers who who was young came to me

454
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,490
and he said, " i think this is it.

455
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,370
i think we're going to melt down. i think it's all over. i'm terribly pessimistic.

456
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,890
" i said, " tell me why.

457
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,169
" he went through his reasoning.

458
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,890
i said, " okay, now go back to your desk and do your job. " a

459
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,130
a

460
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,730
a battlefield hero.

461
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,090
and i don't want to compare what we do to being a battlefield hero.

462
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,610
but a battlefield hero is not somebody who's unafraid.

463
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,970
it's somebody who does it anyway.

464
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,529
and that's that's the way you have to be. > > can i actually

465
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,330
can i ask

466
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,289
let me ask you about that?

467
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,730
because so it's funny.

468
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,690
interesting enough, even though i'm the conservative one, i'm actually way more emotional. sean's like a more

469
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,090
uh

470
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,890
mostly is

471
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,650
is is a pretty stable guy emotionally.

472
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,929
i go up and down, which i think is actually closer to the average for um average folks.

473
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,610
you said something really

474
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,929
you said a bunch of stuff about emotion in the past.

475
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:56,409
i think you said to be a good investor, you better

476
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:56,970
uh

477
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,370
be able to invest without emotion or at least act as if you don't have a lot of emotion.

478
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,049
has there ever been anything like a mindset shift

479
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,490
or a practice or something that you've had to use in order to learn to be less emotional

480
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,490
when investing? no, these things are not intentional on my part.

481
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,289
> > you think you were born like that? > > i was born unemotional,

482
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,890
by the way.

483
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,289
and and i want to point out here because my wife's downstairs having lunch that that

484
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:23,929
uh

485
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:28,169
i i wrote in my book that it's really important to be unemotional in investing. uh

486
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,049
not so good to be unemotional in life in in arenas like marriage.

487
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,169
uh

488
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,770
so there it's not an advantage. but

489
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,090
uh

490
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,730
no, for me

491
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,169
it came naturally. i don't have to

492
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,490
i don't have to say, " oh, there i go again.

493
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,450
i'm getting emotional. i have to restrain that. " blah, blah, blah. it

494
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,610
and and and my partner, bruce kh,

495
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,250
who's been my partner successfully for 37 years, he's pretty much the same.

496
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,690
so, that makes it easy.

497
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,210
i don't have to restrain him.

498
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,730
> > we we've gassed you up about some of your your best moves.

499
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,330
what's the worst mistake you made due to an emotional mistake

500
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,090
where you you didn't control your temperament properly and you made a mistake?

501
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,330
my worst mistake is not

502
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,809
and i know you're talking about a point in time.

503
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:18,809
my worst mistake is that i have always been too conservative. my parents were traumatized by the depression.

504
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,850
i always say the question is not whether your parents were alive during the depression

505
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,130
but whether they were adults.

506
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,049
my parents were adults. they were born in the 19s and so in the depression

507
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,690
they were in their 30s and they were

508
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:34,409
they

509
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,210
you know

510
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,010
and the depression was really traumatic. nobody knows what it was like

511
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,210
and it ground on for over 10 years

512
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,490
and and so you when you grow up with parents of the depression

513
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,690
they say things like don't put all your eggs in one basket save for a rainy day.

514
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,210
you know that kind of stuff.

515
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,210
and i ended up too conservative. and i

516
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,370
i

517
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,090
if

518
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,330
i

519
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,770
if i wasn't as conservative, i'd be richer today. i'm not sure i'd be happier. uh

520
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,289
because > > what's an example?

521
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,730
what do you mean you were too conservative? like i

522
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,210
i guess

523
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:09,370
like

524
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,610
how

525
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,890
what makes you say that?

526
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,770
what would you have done differently

527
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,490
had that not

528
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,330
had that wiring not been done in you?

529
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,610
> > well, i mean

530
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,090
uh

531
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,570
i

532
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,049
i don't know.

533
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:22,010
i might i might have gone to an into an a more aggressive asset class than credit

534
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,049
like equities.

535
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,970
i might have become a venture capitalist

536
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,090
or

537
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,250
or

538
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:26,890
uh

539
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,210
you know

540
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,130
like my son andrew or a private or a leveraged buyout investor.

541
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,370
but you know the reason i was talking about the appropriateness of credit for sam is

542
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,010
because while the returns are a little lower

543
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,010
there's much less uncertainty and downside.

544
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,529
so i i would say

545
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:52,970
that if i i've been in this business 56 years, if i would have spent those 56 years in less conservative asset classes, uh

546
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,130
i would have made more money. having said that,

547
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,169
it happens that i went into things like high yield bonds in 78

548
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,450
and distress debt in 88

549
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,570
and if i had not been a conservative person, i probably wouldn't have had any clients

550
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,370
because they would have been scared off by the risk.

551
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,730
so it served me well in in pioneering in those businesses. but that was my

552
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,049
i

553
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:13,370
i mean

554
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,690
i ne

555
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,730
we never had a mistake

556
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,330
like we were too defensive at a in a crisis or too aggressive in a bubble.

557
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,890
we just i just was too conservative all my life.

i i guess

564
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,450
leading up to it, were you already financially successful? were were you a success leading up to that?

> > i was secure. i

568
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,929
i wasn't rich by today's standards

569
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,130
and i may not have been rich by the standards at the time, but i had

570
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,490
i had lot

571
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,529
i had good money

572
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,330
and i lived well.

573
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,809
so i started running money in 78. i joined my oak tree founder partners in 85

574
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:05,929
86

575
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,490
87

576
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:06,970
88.

577
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,890
we did a great job through a a variety of environments

578
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,809
and we weren't worried about the ability to do a good job

579
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,570
and we had enough money to eat.

580
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,490
so it it wasn't

581
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,130
i mean

582
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,010
but it it it

583
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,690
i had to overcome my innate caution. my wife had to give me a kick in the ass

584
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,570
uh

585
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:26,890
which she

586
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:27,529
uh

587
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,409
happily did.

588
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:29,289
um

589
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:29,850
i

590
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,049
i may not have done it without her. probably wouldn't have. you

591
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,450
uh

592
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:33,929
you said you're

593
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,330
you're too conservative, but there's been times when you've been very aggressive and

594
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:38,890
uh

595
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,529
you know

596
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:42,090
i think the sort of 0708 financial crisis

597
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,130
i read something that > > as the crisis happens

598
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,210
you go raise $ 10 billion

599
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,850
cuz you see the opportunity and you started deploying something like $ 600 million a week

600
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,690
which is just sounds badass to be honest. i don't

601
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:57,770
even

602
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,010
maybe

603
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,250
that's

604
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,649
maybe that's not not as crazy in the financial world

605
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,049
but that sounds crazy to me. well, it

606
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:03,529
your

607
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,529
your fact set is inaccurate in one regard.

608
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,690
we did not raise 10 billion after the crisis hit.

609
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,330
because

610
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,490
remember what i said about the guy who said when the time comes to invest, you won't want to.

611
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,289
you can't raise money in a crisis. you

612
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,850
if you went to people, he say world's melting down.

613
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,890
we're going to buy all this stuff.

614
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:21,850
it's going to be a bonanza.

615
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,649
we're going to get rich.

616
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,610
nobody will give you money.

617
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,490
why? because the same factors that influence the world influence the people you talk to.

618
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,289
and no, everybody will stick their hands in their pockets and say

619
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:34,090
maybe later after the after the dust settles

620
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,210
and and like

621
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,570
and a lot of people say

622
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,289
uh

623
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:39,529
you know we're not going to try to catch a falling knife

624
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,370
and i believe that you you make the big money catching falling knives carefully.

625
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,770
so what happened is we

626
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,649
like i described about the tech bubble in 2000.

627
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:56,090
we detected in'056 that the world was behaving in a in a carefree manner

628
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,970
and and i i would wear out the carpet between my office and bruce's with the wall street journal

629
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,010
and i'd say, " look at this

630
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,890
look at this piece of junk that got issued yesterday.

631
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,090
there's something wrong.

632
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,529
if a deal like this can get done, the world is exercising inadequate prudence.

633
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,850
> > specifically on mortgage is

634
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,610
or or just > > i didn't know about mortgage.

635
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,570
i never heard of mortgages.

636
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,450
i never heard a sub

637
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:19,690
i

638
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,130
i don't think i ever heard the word subprime.

639
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,409
i don't think i ever knew what a mortgage back security was.

640
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,570
it just seemed that the world was operating in a prorisk fashion. and when people are pro-risk, they they

641
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,330
they permit bad deals and they pay prices higher than they should.

642
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,409
so what happened was on on the first day of'07, we went out to our clients

643
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,169
and we said we think there's an opportunity.

644
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:45,289
uh

645
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:45,769
we didn't

646
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,289
i don't think we raised funds in'05 or six for his

647
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:49,929
uh

648
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:50,809
distress debt area,

649
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,649
but on the first day of 07

650
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,370
we went out

651
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,450
and we said we think there's a great opportunity coming and we'd like to have three billion.

652
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:58,169
the

653
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,970
at that time the biggest distress debt fund in history was our 01 fund

654
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,570
which preceded the enron meltdown and so forth

655
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,690
and it was two and a half billion

656
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,130
and so two and a half

657
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:11,769
yeah

658
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,409
around there

659
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:12,970
so

660
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:13,850
uh

661
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:14,809
we went out to clients

662
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,929
we said we'd like to have three

663
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,490
that would be the biggest distress to fund in history

664
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,090
so within a month we had eight and we said you know we can't do anything with 8 billion

665
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,289
it's it's

666
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,769
it exceeds our ability to invest it wisely.

667
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,529
so, we're going to take three

668
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:32,169
and a half billion

669
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,490
and we're going to close the fund, but we would like to have the remainder of your interest in a standby fund

670
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,370
that we'll implement if the stuff hits the fan.

671
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,289
so the first fund was seven and it was three and a half billion

672
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,890
and the next fund was 7b

673
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,130
and by the time we finished raising money for it a year later it was 11 billion

674
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,090
and with and we and fund 7 got fully invested. so we started investing gradually investing 7b

675
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,289
uh

676
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,409
in june of08. it's sitting there on the shelf

677
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,970
and by september 18th 15th

678
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,370
it was

679
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,330
uh

680
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,490
no

681
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:14,890
18th

682
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:15,850
it was

683
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,330
uh

684
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,090
uh

685
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,210
12 % invested

686
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,090
so just over a billion and lehman brothers declares bankruptcy.

687
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,049
and so the question which you implied was do you invest it or not?

688
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,769
you're sitting there with all that money, but the it looks like the world's going to melt down.

689
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,929
do you invest it? very simple.

690
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,850
and uh

691
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,490
this,

692
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,130
as you say,

693
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,610
i think this was one of our uh best moments

694
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,649
because i reached a very simple conclusion.

695
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,409
if we invest it and the world melts down, it doesn't matter what we did.

696
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:02,010
but if i don't invest it and the world doesn't melt down, then we didn't do our job. qed,

697
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,370
you have to move forward.

698
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,929
i also wrote that it's hard to predict the end of the world.

699
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,810
it's hard to assign a high probability to it.

700
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,409
it's hard to know what to do if the world is going to melt down.

701
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,570
if you do those things and the world doesn't melt down, it's probably a disaster

702
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,690
and most of the world time the world doesn't melt down.

703
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,649
that was the

704
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,250
that was the sum of our analysis because there was nothing to analyze.

705
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,129
there had never been a global financial crisis before.

706
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,889
the the meltdown of the financial sector had not been anticipated since the great depression

707
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,050
and there was

708
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,210
there

709
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:39,449
was

710
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,849
there were no past patterns to extrapolate.

711
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,730
so you have to resort to logic. that was the logic.

712
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,489
so, as you say,

713
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,050
we invested450 million a week for the next 15 weeks in that fund, which was 7 billion.

714
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:00,250
and oak tree overall invested an average of 650 million a week for the next 50

715
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:00,970
uh

716
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:01,690
15 weeks.

717
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,970
> > how did that turn out?

718
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,170
so, that's what you put in.

719
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,410
how did what was the sort of result of that that investing during that time? well, it was great

720
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,089
except for

721
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,329
i mean we got good buys and we made good money, but the fed mobilized

722
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,410
uh

723
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,450
very

724
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:19,770
astutely

725
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,450
cutting interest rates to zero for the first time in history

726
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,650
at the beginning of 09

727
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,810
and introducing qe

728
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:35,369
and those two things saved the economy. so we didn't get the meltdown that everybody was afraid of

729
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,770
and there were relatively few bankruptcies

730
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,290
especially outside the financial sector

731
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,010
that res resulted from the global financial crisis. so we had

732
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,770
we've had some barn burner funds in crisis. uh

733
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,210
this was very good but not a barn burner. > > you've you

734
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,369
you've

735
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,730
you've done something that i love

736
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,210
which is

737
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:55,609
um

738
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,170
well

739
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,329
you

740
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:57,609
you've quoted a ton of different people.

741
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:59,930
you've quoted mark twain a bunch of times. you've had all these quotes

742
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,290
which like clearly shows that you retain information that you read

743
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,369
and i imagine you read a lot.

744
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:09,930
can i ask you about your reading habits? how do you pick what books you read? > > i

745
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:15,849
i've never read any books about how to be an investor like you know

746
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,570
multiply this by that and add this and subtract that.

747
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,450
and the books i've found most interesting have always been the ones about investor behavior.

748
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,970
and i mentioned

749
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,170
devil take the hindmost

750
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,210
uh

751
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,530
99

752
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:28,890
uh

753
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,450
one of the greatest books i ever read was

754
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,089
uh

755
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,890
before that

756
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:33,690
uh

757
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,650
john kenneth galbra's

758
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,290
book

759
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:35,770
uh

760
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,170
uh

761
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,089
called the short history of financial euphoria.

762
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,329
that was really pivotal for me

763
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,930
and since i'm a slow reader

764
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,730
uh

765
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,730
i like the fact that it was only about a 100 pages.

766
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,650
and then you know

767
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,050
back in back in uh

768
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:49,849
74

769
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,369
i think charlie ellis wrote an article winning the losers game

770
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,130
where he said that because

771
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,250
uh

772
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,450
you can't predict the future

773
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,250
uh

774
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,010
active investing doesn't work

775
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,170
he was a believer in the efficient market. so rather than try to hit winners like the tennis player

776
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,010
you should try to avoid hitting losers and keep the ball in play. um

777
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,770
and that has always defined my uh investing style.

778
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,250
in fact, i wrote a memo in the summer of 24

779
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,170
or 23 called fewer winners, fewer losers or more winners.

780
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,450
and that's the basic choice of investing style. there's a great

781
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,089
i think

782
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,250
like sort of math paradox that you've pointed out

783
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,290
which is that you know a fund

784
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,970
i don't know if it was your fund

785
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,250
but any fund it could be

786
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,050
you know

787
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,770
never above

788
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,050
never in the top 10 % but sort of never in the bottom 50

789
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,050
%

790
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,770
and there's this strategy of >

791
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:39,770
>

792
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,089
just consistently being above average will place you in the top 5

793
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:44,089
%

794
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,650
right

795
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:44,810
it'll

796
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,170
it'll place you in the top percent

797
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:46,890
uh

798
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,410
can you unpack that idea a little bit

799
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,770
i just i just sort of butchered it

800
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,490
>

801
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:50,490
>

802
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:50,490
>

803
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:50,890
in uh

804
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:51,369
1990

805
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,450
i wrote a memo called the route to performance

806
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,010
and i had uh dinner in minneapolis with my client dave van bencoten

807
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,930
who ran the general mills pension fund.

808
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,930
and he dave explained to me that he had run the fund for 14 years. and in 14 years

809
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,730
the the equities

810
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,609
general mills equity portfolio was never above the 27th percentile or below the 47th percentile.

811
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,050
so 14 years in a row solidly in the second quartile.

812
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,290
now if you said to the normal person not in the investment business, so this thing fluctuated between the 27th

813
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,089
and the 47th.

814
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,130
where do you think it was for the whole period? they would say, well, let me think.

815
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,170
probably around 37th.

816
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,730
the answer is fourth.

817
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,970
so if you

818
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,849
if you can do well for 14 years in a row

819
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,050
and avoid the tendency to shoot yourself in the foot in a bad year,

820
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,490
you can pop up to the top.

821
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,130
at the same time, another investment management firm had a terrible year

822
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,410
because they were deep value investors and they were heavy in the banks

823
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,970
and the banks suffered terribly. so they were at the bottom.

824
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,570
so the president comes out

825
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,890
and of course things people in the investment business are great rationalizers and communicators.

826
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,050
and he says the answer is simple.

827
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,530
if you want to be in the top 5 % of money managers, you have to be willing to be in the bottom.

828
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,410
well, that makes great sense

829
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,410
except that my clients don't care if i'm ever in the top five

830
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,369
and they absolutely don't want to see me in the bottom five.

831
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,210
so, my reaction is the first guy's approach is the right one for me.

832
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,650
so, that's why at oak tree, we go for fewer losers, not more winners.

833
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,210
> > yeah, i love that because it's one of the um unsexy ideas.

834
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,730
i think any idea you can't, you know, make a movie about or won't make you sound really cool

835
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,930
are generally undervalued ideas when they

836
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,810
when they actually logically math out the way the way that one does.

837
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,530
and so i i sort of that was one that stuck out to me is nobody's going to

838
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:49,770
nobody's

839
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,730
going to give you a motivational video about being consistently above average

840
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,570
and just never shooting yourself in the foot, right? it's all about heroic greatness

841
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,609
and huge risks you can take and, you know,

842
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:01,849
being willing to do it. and so, you know,

843
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:02,810
that's all you hear.

844
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,170
> > but, but you know,

845
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:04,730
uh,

846
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,849
the financial times of london, every saturday they they have an article, uh,

847
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:11,369
called the lunch with the ft,

848
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,250
and they take somebody to lunch and they write an article about the person, the restaurant, and the food.

849
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,690
and they did that with me in late 22. and uh

850
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,010
i

851
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:22,890
uh

852
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,329
took the reporter to

853
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,290
uh

854
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,010
my favorite italian restaurant near the office in new york

855
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,770
where i go 100 % of the time if i have a lunch.

856
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,490
and i and i said to her, eating in this restaurant is like investing at oak tree.

857
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,530
always good, sometimes great, never terrible.

858
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,329
now, that to to me

859
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,210
that sounds like a modest boast, but if you can do that for 40

860
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,210
or 50 years, i think it'll compound to great results.

861
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:56,329
uh,

862
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,730
if you never shoot yourself in the foot, and i think it's

863
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,530
i think i

864
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,650
i don't know if the sec is listening, but i think it's descriptive of what of what we've accomplished.

865
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,770
there's like this um class of investor that's like kind of become like folk hero

866
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:10,810
you know

867
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,970
like warren buffett's an obvious one where the like a folk hero sort of

868
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,369
uh

869
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:15,930
they're high integrity

870
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,210
they make greatness seem achievable and relatable

871
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,410
uh

872
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,089
which is like a whole skill in itself

873
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,690
and and you've become one of these

874
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,329
like folk heroes

875
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:24,890
um

876
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,290
you know

877
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,130
and a lot of them they have in common

878
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,170
where they like write a lot

879
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,569
they write

880
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:28,730
well

881
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,770
they've got wonderful sayings

882
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:30,810
uh

883
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,050
they make challenging things easy to understand

884
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,050
did you purposely tried to become like this public figure. > > well,

885
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,250
first of all, you can't ask

886
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:40,730
uh

887
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,730
somebody who did whether they did

888
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,609
cuz they'll say no.

889
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,690
nobody will admit that.

890
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,650
nobody will say my my public persona is a facade.

891
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,569
> > me and sam were joking before this, we were saying it's cool

892
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:52,730
how

893
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,210
uh

894
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,849
it's interesting how i think when you started as an investor, there was like no celebrity investors.

895
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,450
there's no like famous person who was doing what you were doing. and then now you have

896
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,569
whether it's buffett or munger,

897
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,050
there's

898
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,530
like the investment guys are now like the philosophers.

899
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,490
> > yeah.

900
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,930
> > the tech ceo nerds are now like the power players of the world, right? > >

901
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:13,930
uh

902
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,130
podcaster comedians are now like the new trusted media. it's like this very strange shift on all fronts

903
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:21,849
where

904
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:22,569
um

905
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,369
you know

906
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:24,410
influence has sort of shifted.

907
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,130
but i i find the like investment crossover life philosopher to be just like one of the really wholesome ones

908
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,369
that i i personally really like, you know.

909
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,690
> > right. well,

910
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:40,730
you know, i i i hesitate to put myself in the same category, but i think warren has always tried to just educate people

911
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,609
and share his knowledge

912
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,010
and

913
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,730
and people say, " well, why do you give away your secrets? aren't you afraid

914
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,089
that other people will emulate you

915
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,210
and and catch up with you? " but i i don't think so

916
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,250
because, you know, we can tell them all day long what what you should do, but it's hard to do.

917
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,250
like we said at the beginning of the podcast,

918
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,490
friend of mine, richard oldfield in london wrote a book once entitled simple but not easy.

919
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,050
i think the things we have to do are simple. they're just not easy to do.

920
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:14,410
i think buffett makes investing seem simple because he boils it down to the essential ingredients.

921
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,490
by the way, you said there were no famous investors. i

922
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,410
but i think buffett started around 53

923
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,490
if i'm not mistaken. uh

924
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,810
he just wasn't famous. uh

925
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,210
yeah.

926
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,530
uh

927
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,010
but

928
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,250
and

929
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,089
and there were a few people who were famous in the investment business, but i don't think anybody was

930
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:30,650
was

931
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,210
uh

932
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,890
famous in the in the wider world.

933
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,329
well, what's interesting for

934
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:39,050
like the normal guys like me and and and sean is like

935
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,569
we learn from you about how to live life and you just and you

936
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:42,890
and

937
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,089
and that's kind of cool

938
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:44,490
and it

939
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:50,010
just like investing is just your way of like testing if your way of living is true, > > right?

940
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,690
well, investing is a lot like life.

941
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,770
but but and and by the way,

942
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,250
uh

943
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,450
i'm working on a book along those lines, sam.

944
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,050
> > what's it called? > > uh

945
00:43:59,119 --> 00:43:59,849
i don't know yet.

946
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:00,569
uh

947
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,050
but

948
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:01,369
but

949
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,089
uh

950
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,130
uh

951
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,930
if you wait a few years, i think it'll be out. > > well, we appreciate you coming.

952
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:08,329
uh

953
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,450
i do want to leave you with what it's a question for for for you.

954
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,810
so, we've asked you a bunch of questions, but i i actually think it would be interesting. um

955
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,130
what question do you think people who listen to this should ask themselves? what's a

956
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,050
what's a useful question that you think people could ask themselves as a

957
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:28,650
as a final final note here? well, i would think in terms of the mistakes that investors made

958
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,569
and i would ask yourself whether you make them.

959
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:31,369
uh

960
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,329
so what are the big mistakes investors make? uh

961
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:36,650
i

962
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,770
i can think of three. number one, do you think you do

963
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:47,770
you think you understand what the future holds and and do you reasonably think that's accurate?

964
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:48,970
uh

965
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:49,690
number two,

966
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:50,890
uh

967
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,410
i think the biggest single mistake

968
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,930
that investors make is that they think the world will remain the way it is.

969
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,970
that the things that are working today will continue to work.

970
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,450
the things that aren't working will continue not to work.

971
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:02,089
uh

972
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,849
that the trends are in motion will continue. and that there won't be any new trends.

973
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,210
so do you

974
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:07,450
do

975
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:07,609
you

976
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,650
are you part of that?

977
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,170
and then number three is

978
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,369
do your emotions

979
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:12,730
uh

980
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,770
rise and fall and get you to do what they want as opposed to what you should do.

981
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,050
uh

982
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:19,609
so

983
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,250
uh

984
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,849
i think you just have to have a checklist.

985
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,569
you know,

986
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,890
in my first book, the most important thing, i had a thing in there called the uh

987
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,890
poor man's guide to market assessment.

988
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,170
and and it says on the left a bunch of things

989
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,170
and on the right there's a bunch of things. and and and it was half tongue and cheek

990
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,369
or maybe more than half.

991
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,970
but i mean, it says, you know,

992
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:41,770
uh

993
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:42,970
are the is the market rising

994
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,490
or falling? are are the tv shows about investing popular

995
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,250
or unpopular? if an investor goes to a cocktail party, is he mobbed or shunned?

996
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:50,970
uh

997
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,690
are do deals get done easily or hard?

998
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,569
do people ra are are deals overs subscribed

999
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,930
or left begging?

1000
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,050
you know, that kind of thing.

1001
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:07,290
and you can tell, you can figure out from that checklist whether the market is overheated and too popular

1002
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,290
or uh

1003
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:09,530
frigid

1004
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,930
and and and too shunned.

1005
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,210
and this can tell you a lot of what to do if you're methodical and clinical. > > well,

1006
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,690
um

1007
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,609
sean and i have have read your stuff forever.

1008
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,530
we've listened to so many of your podcasts.

1009
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,730
it's been an honor. we really appreciate you doing this. i think the best part of our

1010
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,130
uh

1011
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,290
best part of our job is we have an excuse to hang out with amazing people who are way out of our leagues

1012
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,250
and uh

1013
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:30,650
this is

1014
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,530
this is one of those occasions. so, thank you so much. > > well, thank you, sam.
