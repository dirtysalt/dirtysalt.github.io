00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
the following is a conversation with neil ferguson

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,240
 one of the great historians of our time at times controversial

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,520
 and always brilliant

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,679
 whether you agree with him or not

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,000
 he's an author of 16 books

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,960
 on topics

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,679
 covering

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,679
 the history of money power

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,960
 war pandemics

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,320
 and empire

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,400
 previously at harvard currently at stanford and today

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,920
 launching a new university here in austin texas called the university of austin a new institution

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
 built from the ground up to encourage open inquiry and discourse

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,000
 by both thinkers and doers from philosophers and historians

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,079
 to scientists and engineers

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,760
 embracing debate dissent and self-examination

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,520
 free to speak to disagree to think to explore truly novel ideas

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,360
 the advisory board includes stephen pinker jonathan height and many other amazing people with one exception

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,320
 me

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,320
 i was graciously invited to be on the advisory board which i accepted

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,479
 in the hope of doing my small part in helping build the future of education

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
 and open discourse

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
 especially in the fields of artificial intelligence robotics and computing

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,400
 we spend the first hour of this conversation talking about this new university

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
 before switching to

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
 talking about some of the darkest moments in human history

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,320
 and what they reveal

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,400
 about human nature

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,320
 this is the lex friedman podcast

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,840
 to support it please check out our sponsors in the description

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,960
 and now here's my conversation with neil ferguson

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,000
 you are one of the great historians of our time respected sometimes controversial

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
 you've flourished in some of the best universities in the world from nyu

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,240
 to london school of economics to harvard

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
 and now to hoover institution at stanford

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,040
 before we talk about the history of money war and power

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,600
 let us talk about a new university

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
 you're part of launching

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,600
 here in austin texas

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,399
 it is called university of austin

41
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,880
 uatx

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,199
 what is its mission its goals its plan

43
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,080
 i think it's pretty obvious

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,440
 to a lot of people in higher education that there's a problem

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,920
 and that problem manifests itself in a great many different ways

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,680
 but i would sum up the problem as being

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,160
 a drastic

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,560
 chilling of the atmosphere

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,560
 that constrains free speech free exchange even free thought

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,319
 and i had never anticipated

51
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,040
 that this would happen in my lifetime my academic career began in oxford in the 1980s

52
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,239
 when

53
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,760
 anything went one sensed that a university was a place where one could risk

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,239
 saying the unsayable and debate the undebatable

55
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
 so the fact that in a relatively short space of time

56
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,280
 a variety

57
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,000
 of ideas

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 critical race theory or wokeism

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
 whatever you want to call a variety of ideas have come along

60
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,080
 that seek to limit and quite drastically limit what we can talk about

61
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
 strikes me as deeply unhealthy

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,200
 and i'm not

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,599
 sure

64
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,680
 and i've thought about this for a long time you can fix

65
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
 it with the existing

66
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480
 institutions

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,400
 i think you need to create a new one and so after much deliberation

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,840
 we decided to do it and i think it's a hugely timely opportunity

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,480
 to

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,480
 do what people used to do in this country which was to create new institutions

71
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
 i mean that used to be the default setting of america

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,319
 we sort of stopped doing that i mean i look back and i thought why why

73
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,680
 why are there no new universities

74
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,959
 or at least if there are why do they have so little impact

75
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,000
 it seems like we have the billionaires

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 we have the need let's do it so you still believe

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,840
 in institutions in the university in the ideal of the university

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
 i believe passionately in that ideal

79
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,720
 there's a reason they've been around for nearly a millennium

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,239
 there is a a unique thing that happens

81
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,680
 on a university

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,399
 campus when it's done right and that is the transfer of knowledge between generations

83
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,000
 that is a very sacred activity and it seems to

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,959
 withstand

85
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,199
 major changes in technology so this form that we call the university predates the printing press

86
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
 survive the printing press

87
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,520
 continue to function through the scientific revolution the enlightenment

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,840
 the industrial revolution

89
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,280
 to this day and i think it's because

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,240
 maybe because of evolutionary psychology we need to be together

91
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,280
 in one relatively confined

92
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,479
 space

93
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,759
 when we're in our late teens and early 20s

94
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,240
 for the knowledge transfer between the generations to happen

95
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,560
 that's my feeling about this but in order for it to work well

96
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,520
 there need to be very few constraints

97
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,800
 there needs to be a sense that one can take intellectual risk remember

98
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,160
 people in their late teens and early 20s are adults but they're inexperienced adults

99
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,759
 and if i look back on my own time as an undergraduate

100
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,600
 saying stupid things was my mo

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,080
 my way to finding

102
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,960
 good ideas was through a minefield

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
 of bad ideas

104
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
 i feel so sorry

105
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,520
 for my

106
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,080
 for people like me today people age 18 19 20 today

107
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
 who are

108
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,960
 intellectually

109
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,880
 very curious ambitious but inexperienced

110
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
 because the minefields today

111
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,720
 are absolutely lethal and you know one wrong food

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
 and it's cancellation i said this to peter thiel the other day

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,600
 imagine being asked now i mean we were obnoxious

114
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,039
 undergraduates

115
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,240
 there's nothing

116
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,240
 that peter did at stanford that andrew sullivan and i were not doing at oxford

117
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,960
 and perhaps we were even worse

118
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:17,039
 but it was so so not career ending to be to be an absolutely insufferable

119
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
 obnoxious

120
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
 undergraduate then

121
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,039
 today if we if we

122
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,080
 if people like us exist today they must live in a state of of constant anxiety

123
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
 that they're going to be

124
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,240
 outed for some heretical

125
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,919
 statement that they made five years ago on social media so

126
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,560
 part of what motivates me is that it's the desire to give

127
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:49,919
 the means of today a shot at free thinking and really i i'd call it

128
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,160
 aggressive learning learning where you're really pushed

129
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
 and i just think that stopped happening

130
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
 on the the major campuses

131
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,479
 because whether at harvard where i used to teach at stanford where i'm now based i

132
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,800
 i sense a kind of suffocating

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
 atmosphere of self-censorship

134
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
 that that means people are afraid

135
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,560
 to take even minimal risk in in class i mean just just take for example

136
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,319
 a survey that was published

137
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,960
 earlier this year that revealed

138
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,680
 this is of undergraduates in four-year programs in the us

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,720
 85 percent of self-described liberal students said they would report a professor to the university administration

140
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,599
 if he or she said something they considered offensive

141
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,000
 and something like 75 said said they do it to a fellow undergraduate

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,599
 that's the kind of culture that's evolved in our universities

143
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,720
 so we need a new university in which none of that is true

144
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
 in which you can speak your mind

145
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,360
 say stupid things get it completely wrong

146
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
 and live to

147
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,960
 to tell the tale there's a lot more going on i think because

148
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,319
 when you start thinking about what's wrong with a modern university

149
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,680
 many many more things suggest themselves

150
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,199
 and i think there's an opportunity

151
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,720
 here to build something that's radically new in in some ways and radically traditional

152
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,479
 in other ways for example i have a strong preference for

153
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,680
 the tutorial system that you see at oxford and cambridge which is small group teaching

154
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,120
 and and highly socratic in its structure

155
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,879
 i think it'd be great to bring that to the united states where it doesn't really

156
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,240
 exist but at the same time i think we should be doing

157
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,879
 some very 21st century things

158
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,440
 making sure that while people are reading and studying classic works

159
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,519
 they're also going to be immersed in the real world

160
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,159
 of technological innovation a world that you know very well

161
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,200
 and i'd love to get a synthesis

162
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,480
 of the ancient and classical which we're gradually letting fade away with the novel

163
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 and technological so we we want to produce people who can simultaneously talk intelligently

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,680
 about adam smith or for that matter shakespeare or proust and

165
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,360
 have a conversation with you about where a.i is going

166
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,399
 and how long it will be before i can get driven

167
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,680
 here by

168
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,560
 a self-driving

169
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,680
 vehicle allowing me to have my lunch and prepare rather than

170
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
 focus on

171
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,880
 the other crazy people on the road so

172
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,000
 that's the dream that we can create something which is

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,040
 you know partly classical and partly 21st century

174
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
 and we look around

175
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,880
 and we we don't see it if you if you don't see an institution

176
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
 that you really think should exist

177
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,000
 i think you have a more responsibility to create it

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,120
 so you're thinking including

179
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,680
 something bigger than just liberal education also including science engineering and technology i should also comment

180
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
 that

181
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,080
 you know i mostly stay out of politics and out of some of these

182
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,519
 aspects of liberal education that kind of been the most controversial and difficult within the university

183
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,720
 but there is a kind of ripple effect of fear within that space

184
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,880
 into science and engineering and technology that i think

185
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,839
 has

186
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,760
 has a nature that's difficult to describe

187
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,560
 it doesn't have a controversial nature it just has a nature of fear where you're not

188
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,440
 you know you're not just saying stupid stuff as a young 20 year old

189
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
 you know

190
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,160
 for example

191
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,279
 deep learning

192
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,959
 machine learning is really popular

193
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,920
 in the computer science now as an approach for creating artificial intelligence systems

194
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,360
 it's

195
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,600
 it is controversial in that space to say that

196
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,640
 anything against machine learning saying

197
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,680
 sort of exploring ideas that saying this is going to lead to a dead end

198
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,279
 um now that that takes some guts to do as a young 20 year old within

199
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,240
 within a classroom

200
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,720
 to think like that to raise that question in a machine learning course it sounds ridiculous

201
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
 because it's like who's going to

202
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,800
 complain about this but the the fear that starts

203
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
 in

204
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,079
 in a course on history

205
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,880
 or

206
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,200
 on the some course that covers society the fear ripples

207
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,560
 and affects those students they're asking big out of the box questions about engineering

208
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,000
 about computer science

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,079
 and there's a lot you know there's like linear algebra that's not going to change

210
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,320
 but then there's like applied

211
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,600
 linear algebra which is machine learning and that's when

212
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
 robots and

213
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,079
 real systems touch human beings and that's when you have to

214
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,800
 ask yourself these difficult questions about

215
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,920
 about humanity

216
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
 even in engineering and science and technology courses and these are not

217
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,240
 separate worlds in two senses

218
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,839
 i've just

219
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,880
 taken delivery of my copy of the book that eric schmidt and henry kissinger have

220
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,519
 co-authored

221
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,600
 on artificial intelligence the central

222
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,440
 question of which is what does this mean for us broadly

223
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600
 but they're not separate worlds

224
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
 you know in cp snow's

225
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,680
 sense of you know the the chasm between science and arts because on a university campus

226
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,240
 everything is contagious from a novel coronavirus to the behaviors that are occurring

227
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,399
 in the english department

228
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,200
 those behaviors if denunciation

229
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
 becomes a norm

230
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,480
 you know undergraduate denounces

231
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,760
 professor teaching assistant denounces undergraduate those behaviors are contagious and will spread inexorably

232
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,760
 first to social science and then to natural sciences and i think that's

233
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,839
 that's part of the reason why

234
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,920
 when this started to happen when we started to get the origins of

235
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,240
 disinvitation and cancel culture

236
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,760
 it was not just

237
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,880
 a few conservative

238
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,839
 professors in the humanities who had to worry everybody

239
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,920
 had to worry because eventually

240
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,240
 it was going to come even to the most apparently

241
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
 hard stem

242
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
 part of the the campus

243
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,680
 it's it's contagious this is something nicholas christakis should look at because he's

244
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,160
 very good at looking at the way in which

245
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,760
 social networks like the ones that exist in a university can spread

246
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,560
 everything

247
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,680
 but i think when when we look back and ask why did wokism

248
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,440
 spread so rapidly

249
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,320
 and rapidly out of humanities into other parts of universities and why did it spread

250
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,800
 across the country and d beyond the united states to the other english-speaking

251
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,519
 universities it's because it's a contagion

252
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,399
 and and these behaviors are contagious

253
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,880
 the president of a university

254
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,920
 i won't name said to me that he receives

255
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,440
 every day at least one denunciation

256
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,240
 one call for somebody or other to be fired for something that they

257
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,959
 said

258
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,760
 that's the crazy kind of totalitarianism

259
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
 light

260
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,399
 that now exists in our our universities

261
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,240
 and of course the people who want to downplay

262
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
 this say oh well there only have been 100 and something in dis invitations

263
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,199
 or oh there really aren't that many cases but the point is that

264
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,320
 the famous events the events that get the attention

265
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
 are responsible for a general chilling

266
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,760
 that as you say spreads to every part of the university

267
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,199
 and creates a

268
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,720
 very familiar culture

269
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,160
 in which people are afraid to say what they think self-censorship

270
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,720
 look at the heterodox academy data on this

271
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,880
 grows and grows so now a majority

272
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,760
 of students will say this is clear from the latest heterodox

273
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,959
 academy surveys

274
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,760
 we are scared to say what we think in case

275
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
 we get denounced in case we get cancelled

276
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,279
 but that's just not the correct atmosphere

277
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,839
 for a university in a free society

278
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,600
 to me what's really

279
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,480
 creepy

280
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,959
 is how many of the behaviors i see

281
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,440
 on university campuses today are reminiscent

282
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,480
 of the way that people used to behave in the soviet union

283
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,120
 or in the soviet bloc or in maui's china

284
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
 the sort of totalitarianism

285
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,399
 light that i think we're we're contending with here which manifests itself as denunciations

286
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,720
 people informing on superiors some people using it for career advantage

287
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:10,880
 other people reduced to hapless desperate apology to try to exonerate themselves people disappearing

288
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,399
 metaphorically if not literally all of this is so reminiscent

289
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,519
 of the totalitarian

290
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,040
 regimes that i studied earlier in my career that it makes me feel

291
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,920
 sick

292
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
 and what makes me really feel sick is that

293
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,480
 the people

294
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,399
 doing this stuff the people who write the letters of denunciation

295
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,440
 are apparently

296
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,480
 unaware that they're behaving exactly like people in stalin's soviet union they don't know that

297
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,920
 so they clearly have there's been a massive educational failure

298
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,360
 if somebody can write an anonymous or non-anonymous letter of denunciation

299
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
 and not feel shame

300
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,480
 i mean you should feel morally completely contaminated

301
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,600
 as you are doing that but but people haven't been taught the realities of totalitarianism

302
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,199
 for all these reasons i think

303
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,160
 you need to

304
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,720
 try at least to create a new institution

305
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,160
 where those pathologies will be

306
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,759
 structurally excluded

307
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,560
 so

308
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,920
 maybe a difficult question maybe you'll push back on this

309
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,040
 but you're widely seen politically as a conservative

310
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,399
 hoover institution is politically conservative

311
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,519
 what is the role of politics at the university of austin because some of the ideas

312
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,279
 people listening to this when they hear the ideas you're expressing

313
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,839
 they may think there's a lien to these ideas

314
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,880
 there's a conservative

315
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,160
 lean to these ideas is there such a lien

316
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,320
 there will certainly be people who say that because the standard

317
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,639
 mode of trying to discredit any new initiative is to say oh this is a sinister

318
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,880
 conservative

319
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:49,040
 plot but one of our co-founders heather heing is definitely not a conservative

320
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
 she's as committed to the idea of academic freedom

321
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,120
 as i am

322
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,199
 but i think on political issues we probably agree on almost nothing

323
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,839
 and at least i i would guess

324
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,199
 but but politics

325
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,720
 max weber made this point a long time ago

326
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,000
 the politics really should stop at the threshold of the

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,559
 the classroom

328
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,119
 of the lecture

329
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,520
 hall

330
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,400
 and in my career

331
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,959
 i've always

332
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,599
 tried to make sure that when i'm teaching

333
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,959
 it's not

334
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,839
 clear where i stand politically

335
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,199
 though of course undergraduates

336
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,319
 and insatiably

337
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,039
 curiously

338
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,559
 want to know but it shouldn't be clear from what i say because indoctrination

339
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,000
 on a political basis

340
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,640
 is

341
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
 an abuse of the power of the professor

342
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,880
 as weber rightly said

343
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,840
 so i think one of the key principles

344
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,760
 of of the university of austin will be that barbarian principle

345
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,919
 that politics is not

346
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,400
 an appropriate

347
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,280
 subject for the lecture hall for the classroom and we should pursue truth

348
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,679
 and enshrine

349
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,400
 liberty of thought

350
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,000
 if that's a political issue then i can't help you i mean if you're against

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,640
 freedom of thought then we don't really have much of a discussion to have

352
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,480
 and clearly there are some people who politically

353
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,760
 seem quite hostile

354
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,400
 to it but my sense is that there are plenty

355
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
 of people on the left in academia

356
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,120
 i think of

357
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,160
 that interesting partnership between cornell west

358
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,240
 and robbie george

359
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,400
 which has been institutionalized

360
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,440
 in the academic freedom alliance it's bipartisan

361
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,400
 this issue it really really is after all

362
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,320
 50 years ago it was the left that was in favor of free speech

363
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,280
 the right still has an anti-free speech

364
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,679
 element to it look how quickly they're out to

365
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,840
 ban critical race theory critical race theory won't be banned at the university of texas

366
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
 wokism won't be banned

367
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
 everything will be up for discussion

368
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
 but the rules of engagement will be clear chicago principles

369
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
 those will be enforced

370
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,320
 and if you have to give a lecture on well let's just take a recent example

371
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,000
 the dorian abbott case if you're giving a lecture on astrophysics

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,640
 but it turns out that in some different venue

373
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
 you express skepticism

374
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
 about a formative action

375
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,080
 well it doesn't matter it's irrelevant

376
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,919
 we want to know what your thoughts are on astrophysics because that's

377
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,600
 what you're supposed to be doing a lecture on that used to be understood

378
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
 i mean at the oxford of the 1980s

379
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,559
 there were communists

380
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,799
 and there were ultratories

381
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,679
 at cambridge there were people who were so reactionary

382
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,080
 that they celebrated franco's birthday

383
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,160
 but they were also out and out communists

384
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,640
 down the road at king's college

385
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,080
 the understanding was that that kind of intellectual diversity

386
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,000
 was part and parcel of

387
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,480
 university

388
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,919
 life and frankly for undergraduate

389
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
 it was great fun to cross the road and go from

390
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,280
 you know outright conservatism

391
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,160
 ultra

392
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,840
 tourism to communism one learns a lot that way

393
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,799
 but the issue is when you're promoting or hiring or tenuring people

394
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,880
 their politics is not relevant it really isn't

395
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,360
 and when it started to become relevant

396
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,799
 and i remember this coming up at the harvard history department late in my time there

397
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
 felt deeply deeply uneasy

398
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,440
 that we were having conversations

399
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:21,600
 that amounted to well we can't heart x person despite their obvious academic qualifications because

400
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,559
 of some political issue that that's not what should happen at a healthy university

401
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,919
 some practical questions

402
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:39,679
 will university of austin be a physical in person university or virtual university what are some

403
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,880
 in that aspect where the classroom is it will be a real space institution

404
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,600
 there may be an online

405
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,799
 dimension to it because there clearly are a lot of things that you can do

406
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,559
 via the internet but the core activity

407
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,120
 of of teaching and learning i think requires

408
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
 real space and i've

409
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
 thought about this a long time debated

410
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,600
 sebastian

411
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,320
 throne about this many many years ago when he was a complete

412
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,360
 believer in

413
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,799
 let's call it the metaversity

414
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,799
 to go with the metaverse i mean the metaversity

415
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,799
 was going to happen wasn't it but i never really believed in the metaversity

416
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,280
 i didn't do moocs because i just didn't think you'd a be able to retain

417
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,640
 the attention b be able to cope with the scale

418
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,360
 scaled

419
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,960
 grading that was involved

420
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,919
 i think

421
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,080
 there's a reason universities have been around and that they're formed for about a millennium

422
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,400
 you kind of need to all be in the same place

423
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
 so i think answer to that question definitely

424
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 a campus in the austin area that's where we'll start

425
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,520
 and if we can

426
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,400
 allow some of our content to be available online great we'll certainly do that

427
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,600
 another question is what kind of courses and programming

428
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,600
 will it offer is that something you can speak to what's your vision here

429
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,960
 we think that we need to begin

430
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,520
 more like a startup than

431
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
 like a full service university

432
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,200
 from day one so our vision is that we start with a summer school

433
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,640
 which will offer provocatively the forbidden courses we we want i think to begin by giving

434
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
 a platform

435
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,280
 to the professors who've been most

436
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,840
 subject to council culture and also to give an opportunity

437
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,480
 to students

438
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,799
 who want to hear them to come so we'll start with the summer

439
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,720
 school that will be

440
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,799
 somewhat in the tradition of

441
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,159
 of those institutions

442
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,720
 in the interwar period that were havens for refugees

443
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,280
 so we're we are dealing here with the internal refugees

444
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,919
 of

445
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,679
 of the work era

446
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,640
 we'll start there it'll be an opportunity to test out some

447
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,799
 some content see what students will come

448
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,480
 and spend time in austin to hear so that's part a that's the sort of

449
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,120
 if if you like the launch product and then we go straight to a masters

450
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,799
 program i don't think you can go to undergraduate education right away

451
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,720
 because the established brands in undergraduate education are offering

452
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,799
 something it's impossible to compete with initially because they have the brand harvard yale stanford

453
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,960
 and they offer also this peer network

454
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,039
 which is part of the reason people want

455
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,000
 so badly to go to those places not really the professors

456
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,799
 it's the

457
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,440
 classmates

458
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
 so we don't want to compete there initially

459
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,559
 where there is i think room for new entrants is in

460
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,799
 a masters program

461
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,360
 and the first one will be in entrepreneurship and leadership

462
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,320
 because i think there's a huge hunger

463
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,919
 amongst people who want to get into particularly the technology world

464
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,159
 to learn about those things and they know they're not really

465
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,039
 going to learn about

466
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:49,840
 them at business

467
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,559
 schools

468
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,919
 the people who are not going to teach them leadership and entrepreneurship

469
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,360
 are professors

470
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,679
 so we want to create something that will

471
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,279
 be a little like

472
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,480
 the very successful

473
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,200
 schwarzman

474
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,919
 program

475
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,440
 in china which was come and spend a year in china and find out about china

476
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,720
 we'll be doing the same

477
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,159
 essentially saying come and spend a year and find out about technology

478
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,039
 and there'll be a mix of academic content

479
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,559
 we want people to understand

480
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,279
 some of the first principles of what they're studying

481
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,520
 there are first principles of entrepreneurship

482
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,080
 and leadership but we also want them to spend time with

483
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,600
 people like one of our co-founders

484
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
 joe lonsdale who's been a hugely

485
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,320
 successful venture capitalist and and learned directly from people

486
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,919
 like him so

487
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,279
 that's the kind of initial

488
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,120
 offering i think there are other masters

489
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,600
 programs

490
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,760
 that we will look to roll out quite quickly

491
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,679
 i have a particular passion

492
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,360
 for a masters in applied history or politics and applied history

493
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,919
 i'm a historian driven crazy by the tendency of academic historians

494
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,520
 to drift away from

495
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
 what seemed to me the important questions

496
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,320
 and certainly to drift away from addressing

497
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,760
 policy relevant questions so i would love to be involved in

498
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,640
 in in a masters in applied history

499
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:10,640
 and we'll we'll build some programs like that before we get to the full liberal arts

500
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
 experience that we envisage for an undergraduate program

501
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,760
 and that undergraduate

502
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,520
 program is an exciting one because i think we can be innovative there too i

503
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
 i would say two years

504
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,159
 would be spent

505
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,000
 doing some very classical

506
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,840
 and difficult classical things

507
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,799
 those old divides between arts and sciences

508
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,760
 but then there would also be in the second

509
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,520
 in the second half in the junior and senior years

510
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,960
 something somewhat more of an apprenticeship

511
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,520
 where we'll have centers including a center for technology engineering mathematics

512
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,679
 that will be designed to to help people make that transition

513
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,720
 from the theoretical to the the practical

514
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
 so that's the vision

515
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,360
 and i think like any like any early stage

516
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,840
 idea

517
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,080
 we'll doubtless tweak it as we go along

518
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,200
 we'll find things that work and things that don't work

519
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,120
 but i have a very clear

520
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,440
 sense in my own mind of how this

521
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,840
 should look five years from now

522
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,000
 and i don't know about you i mean i i'm unusual

523
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,640
 as an academic because i quite like starting new institutions

524
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,400
 and i've done a bit of it

525
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
 in my career

526
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,120
 you got to kind of know what it should look like

527
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,440
 after

528
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,919
 the first

529
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,640
 four or five

530
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,039
 years

531
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:27,360
 to

532
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,559
 get out of bed in the morning

533
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,720
 and put up with all the kind of

534
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,679
 hassles of doing it not not least the inevitable

535
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,200
 flack that we we're bound to take from the educational

536
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,960
 establishment

537
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,679
 and i was graciously invited to be an advisor to this

538
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,799
 university of austin and one the reason i would

539
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,679
 love to help in whatever way i can

540
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:58,880
 is several so one i would love to see austin the physical location flourish intellectually

541
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,400
 and especially

542
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,600
 in the space of science and engineering that's really exciting to me

543
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,480
 another reason is i am still a research scientist at mit i still love mit

544
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,039
 and i see this effort

545
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,840
 that you're launching as a as a

546
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,919
 beacon

547
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,320
 that leads the way to the other elite institutions in the world

548
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,720
 i think too many of my colleagues and especially in robotics

549
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,440
 kind of see

550
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,320
 don't see robotics as a humanities problem but to me

551
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,200
 robotics and ai will define much of our world in the next century

552
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,919
 and for not to consider

553
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,360
 all the deep psychological sociological

554
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,799
 human problems associated with that

555
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,080
 to have real open conversations to say stupid things to challenge

556
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,720
 the ideas that

557
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,159
 of how companies are being run for example

558
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,640
 that is the safe space it's very difficult to talk about the difficult questions about technology

559
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,000
 when you're employed by facebook or google and so on

560
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,960
 the university

561
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,279
 is the place to have those conversations

562
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,960
 that's right we're hugely excited

563
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
 that you want to be one of our advisors

564
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,640
 we we need a

565
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
 a broad

566
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,880
 and an eclectic

567
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,320
 group of people

568
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,279
 and i'm excited by the way that group has

569
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,200
 has has developed

570
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,159
 it has some of the some of my favorite intellectuals are there steve pinker for example

571
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,840
 but but we're also you know making sure that we have people with experience in

572
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,880
 academic leadership

573
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,320
 and so it's a it's a happy coalition of the willing

574
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,799
 looking to try to build something new which as you say will be complementary

575
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,760
 to

576
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,159
 the existing and established institutions

577
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,080
 i think of the academic world as a as a network

578
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,039
 i've moved from some major hubs

579
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,640
 in the network

580
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,840
 to others but i've always felt that we do our best work

581
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,440
 not in a silo

582
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,960
 called oxford but

583
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,240
 in a silo that

584
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,159
 that is really a hub connected

585
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:22,880
 to stanford

586
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,440
 connected

587
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,000
 to

588
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,559
 harvard

589
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,399
 connected to mit

590
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,039
 one of the reasons

591
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,919
 i moved to the united

592
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,120
 states was that i sensed

593
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,760
 that there was

594
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,720
 more

595
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,679
 intellectual

596
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,720
 action in my original field of expertise

597
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,320
 financial history and

598
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,080
 that was right it was it was a good move i think i'd have stagnated

599
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,440
 if i'd stayed

600
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,880
 at oxford

601
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,679
 but at the same time i i haven't lost connection

602
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,640
 with oxford i recently went and gave a lecture there

603
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,720
 in honour of sir roger scrutin one of the great conservative philosophers

604
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,080
 and the burden of my lecture was

605
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:03,120
 the idea of the anglo-sphere which appealed a lot to roger will go horribly wrong if

606
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,679
 illiberal ideas that inhibit academic freedom spread all over the anglo-sphere

607
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,039
 and this network gets infected with

608
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,960
 these i think deeply

609
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,399
 deeply damaging notions so yeah i think we're creating a new node

610
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,679
 i hope it's a node that makes the network overall

611
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,200
 more resilient

612
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,240
 and

613
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,120
 right now there's an urgent need for it i mean there are people

614
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,399
 whose academic careers have been terminated

615
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:37,600
 i'll name two who are involved peter bogosian who was harassed out of portland state

616
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,279
 for the reason that he was one of those

617
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,919
 intrepid figures who carried out the grievance studies

618
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,039
 hoaxes

619
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:54,720
 exposing the utter charlatan ray going on in many supposedly academic journals by getting phony

620
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,799
 gender studies articles published was genius and of course

621
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,159
 so put the noses out of joints of the academic establishment

622
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,240
 that he began to be subject to disciplinary

623
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,120
 actions

624
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,720
 so peter is going to be involved and in a recent

625
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,080
 shocking british case

626
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,720
 the philosopher kathleen stock has essentially been run off the campus of sussex university

627
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,240
 in england

628
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,080
 for trans

629
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,559
 for violating the the increasingly complex rules about discussing

630
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,519
 transgender

631
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,120
 issues and

632
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,159
 women's rights

633
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,120
 she will be

634
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,240
 one of our advisors and i think also one of our founding

635
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,000
 fellows actually teaching

636
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,919
 for us in our in our first iteration so

637
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,720
 i think we're creating a node that's badly needed

638
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,519
 those people i mean i remember saying this to

639
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,320
 the the other founders when we first began to talk about this idea

640
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,080
 to barry weiss

641
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,640
 and to panic and losses pano canelos as well as to heather heing

642
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,880
 we need to do this urgently

643
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,720
 because there are people whose livelihoods are in fact being destroyed

644
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,640
 by these extraordinarily

645
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,840
 illiberal campaigns

646
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,360
 against them and so

647
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,200
 there's no time to hang around and come up with the perfect design

648
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
 this this is an urgently needed lifeboat

649
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,519
 and let's start with that and then we can build something spectacular

650
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,559
 taking advantage of the fact that all of these people have

651
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,080
 well they now have very

652
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,600
 real skin in the game they they need to make this a success

653
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,360
 and and i'm sure they will help us make it a success

654
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,240
 so you mentioned some interesting names like heather heing barry weiss and so on

655
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,720
 stephen

656
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,159
 pinker somebody i really admire

657
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,480
 he too was under a lot of quite a lot of fire

658
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,000
 many reasons i admire him one because of his optimism about the future and two

659
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,760
 how little of a dam he seems to give

660
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,640
 about the

661
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,279
 like walking

662
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:47,919
 through the fire

663
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,480
 there's nobody

664
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,039
 more zen

665
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:49,360
 about

666
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,679
 walking

667
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,240
 through the fire

668
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,799
 than stephen

669
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,279
 pinker

670
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:51,840
 but

671
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,399
 anyway you mentioned a lot of interesting names jonathan height is also interesting there

672
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,880
 um who is involved with this venture at this early days

673
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,600
 well

674
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,320
 one of the

675
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
 one of the things that that i'm excited

676
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,120
 about is

677
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,039
 is that we're getting people from

678
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,720
 inside and outside the academic world so we've got

679
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,600
 arthur brooks who for many years ran the american enterprise very s enterprise institute very successfully

680
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,720
 has a harvard role now teaching

681
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,799
 and and so he's somebody who brings i think a different perspective

682
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:33,360
 there's obviously a a need to get experienced

683
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,919
 academic leaders involved

684
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,360
 which is why i was talking to larry summers about

685
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,440
 whether he would join our board of advisors

686
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:52,000
 the chicago principals owe a debt to the former president of chicago and he's

687
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,559
 graciously

688
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,080
 agreed to be in the board of advisors

689
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,120
 i could go on it would become a long and tedious list but

690
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,519
 my goal in in trying to get this happy band to form has been

691
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,360
 to signal that it's a bipartisan

692
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,960
 endeavor it is not

693
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,079
 a conservative institution that we're trying to build it's an institution that's committed to academic freedom

694
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,000
 and the pursuit of truth

695
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,159
 that will mean it when it takes

696
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:25,359
 robert zimmer's chicago principles and enshrines them in its its founding charter and will make those

697
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,520
 something other than honored in the breach which they seem to be at some institutions

698
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,280
 so the idea here is is to grow this organically

699
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,560
 we need

700
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,399
 rather like the academic freedom alliance that robbie george created earlier this year we need breadth

701
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,359
 and we need to show that this is not some kind of

702
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:50,320
 institutionalization of the intellectual dark web though we welcome founding members of that

703
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,199
 that

704
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,440
 nebulous body it's really something designed for all of academia

705
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,160
 to provide a kind of reboot that i i think we all agree is is needed

706
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,599
 is there a george washington

707
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,680
 type figure who is is there a president

708
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
 elected yet or is is

709
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,920
 who's going to lead this institution hannah canelos

710
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,079
 the former president of st john's

711
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,320
 is the president of university of austin

712
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,200
 and so he is our george washington

713
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,560
 i don't know who alexander hamilton is i'll lead you to guess

714
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,520
 it's funny you mentioned idw intellectual dark web have you

715
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,040
 talked to your friend sam harris about but any others he

716
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,240
 um

717
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,680
 he is another person i really admire and i've talked to online and offline

718
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,480
 quite a bit for

719
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,880
 not belonging to any tribe he stands boldly on his convictions

720
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,240
 when he knows they're not going to be popular

721
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,160
 with like he based

722
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,160
 he basically gets canceled by every group he sort of he doesn't shy away from controversy

723
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,480
 and not for the sake of controversy itself he is

724
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,480
 one of the best examples to me of a person who thinks freely

725
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,920
 i disagree with him on a few quite a few things

726
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,560
 but

727
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,000
 i deeply admire

728
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,640
 that he is he he is what it looks like to think freely by himself

729
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,240
 it feels to me like he represents

730
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,920
 a lot of the ideals of this kind of effort yes he would be a natural

731
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,280
 fit sam if you're listening i hope you're in

732
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,880
 i think in in the course of his recent intellectual

733
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,520
 quests

734
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,640
 he did collide with one of our founders heather hying so

735
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,960
 we'll have to model civil disagreements

736
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,359
 at the university of austin it's extremely

737
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,440
 important that we should all disagree about many things but do it

738
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,800
 amicably

739
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,480
 one of the things that has been lost

740
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,520
 sight of perhaps

741
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,240
 it's all the fault of twitter or maybe it's something more profound

742
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,960
 is that

743
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,560
 it is possible to disagree

744
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,400
 in a civil way and

745
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,119
 and still be friends i certainly had

746
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,720
 friends at oxford who were

747
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,400
 far to the left of me politically

748
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,880
 and

749
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
 they are still among my best friends so

750
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,520
 the university of austin has to be a place where we can

751
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,680
 disagree

752
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,200
 we can disagree vehemently

753
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,480
 but we can then go and have a beer afterwards

754
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,079
 that's that's in my mind a really important part of university life learning

755
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,079
 the difference between the political

756
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:14,960
 and the

757
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,599
 and the personal

758
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,079
 so sam

759
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:16,640
 is a

760
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,680
 i think a a

761
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,320
 good example

762
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,040
 as a you

763
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,680
 of

764
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,480
 a certain kind of intellectual

765
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,160
 hero

766
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,400
 who has been willing to go into the cyber

767
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,520
 sphere the metaverse and carve out an intellectual

768
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,440
 space

769
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:45,040
 the podcast and debate everything fearlessly his

770
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,839
 essay was really an essay on black lives matter and the question of police

771
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:50,800
 racism

772
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,240
 was a masterpiece of 2020

773
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,599
 and

774
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,200
 and so he i think is a a model of what we believe in

775
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,119
 but we can't save the world with podcasts good though

776
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,880
 yours is

777
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,760
 because there's a kind of

778
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
 solo element

779
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,960
 to this form of public intellectual activities

780
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,040
 it's also there in substance where all our best writers

781
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,480
 now seem to be including our founder barry weiss

782
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,640
 the danger with this

783
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,720
 approach is ultimately

784
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,000
 your subscribers are the people who already agree with you and we are all therefore

785
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,920
 in danger of preaching

786
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,599
 to the choir

787
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,960
 i think what makes an institution

788
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,800
 like university of austin so attractive

789
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,000
 is that we get everybody

790
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,839
 together

791
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:51,680
 at least part of the year and we do that informal interaction at lunch at dinner

792
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,520
 that allows

793
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,200
 in my experience the best ideas to form

794
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,400
 intellectual activity isn't really a solo voyage

795
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,800
 historians often make it seem that way but i've realized over time that

796
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,359
 i do my best work in a collaborative

797
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,320
 way and scientists have been better at this than people in the humanities

798
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,599
 but what really matters what what's magical about a good university is that interdisciplinary

799
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,640
 serendipitous

800
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,359
 conversation that happens on campus

801
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,079
 tom sergeant the great nobel prize-winning economist and i used to have these

802
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,359
 kind of random conversations in elevators at nyu or in corridors at stanford

803
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,480
 and sometimes they'd be quite short conversations

804
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,920
 but in that short serendipitous exchange

805
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,960
 i would have

806
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,119
 more intellectual stimulus than in in many a seminar lasting an hour and a half so

807
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,119
 i think we want to get the sam harris's and and lex friedman's

808
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,359
 out of their darkened rooms

809
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,720
 and give them a chance to interact in a much less structured

810
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,160
 way than we've got got used to again

811
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,319
 it's that it's that sense that sometimes you need some free willing

812
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,040
 unstructured

813
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
 debate to get the really good ideas

814
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,480
 i mean to talk anecdotally for a moment i look back on my oxford

815
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,200
 undergraduate

816
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,280
 experience and i wrote a lot of essays and attended a lot of classes but

817
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,079
 intellectually the most important thing i did

818
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,400
 was to write an essay on the viennese satirist carl krause

819
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,040
 for a an undergraduate

820
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,280
 discussion group called the cannon club

821
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,839
 and i probably put more work into that paper

822
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,760
 than i put into anything else except maybe my final examinations

823
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,800
 even although

824
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,040
 there was only really one senior member present

825
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,520
 the

826
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,000
 historian

827
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,760
 jeremy cato i was really just trying to impress my contemporaries

828
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,680
 and that's the kind of thing we want the great intellectuals

829
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,040
 the great intellectual leaps forward occurred

830
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,000
 often in somewhat unstructured settings

831
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,520
 i'm from scotland you can tell from my accent a little at least

832
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,119
 the enlightenment happened in late 18th century scotland in a very interesting

833
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:12,160
 interplay between the universities which were very important glasgow edinburgh st andrews and

834
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,599
 the coffee houses and and pubs of

835
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,839
 the scottish cities where

836
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,640
 a lot of unstructured discussion often

837
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,000
 fueled by copious amounts of wine to place

838
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
 that's what i've missed

839
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,200
 over the last few years

840
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,240
 let's let's just think about how hard academic

841
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,560
 social life has become

842
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,839
 that we've reached the point

843
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,680
 that amy chua

844
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,599
 becomes the object of a full-blown investigation

845
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:49,040
 and media storm for inviting to yale law school students over to her house

846
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
 to talk

847
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,680
 i mean when i was at oxford it was regarded as a tremendous

848
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,920
 honor to be asked to go to one of our tutors homes

849
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,960
 the social life of oxford and cambridge is one of their great strengths

850
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
 there's a sort of requirement

851
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,359
 to

852
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,560
 sip unpleasant

853
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,119
 sherry

854
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:05,680
 with

855
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,480
 the dons

856
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,240
 and we've kind of killed all that

857
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,079
 we've killed all that in the us because nobody

858
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:10,880
 dares

859
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,960
 have a social interaction with an undergraduate

860
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,599
 or

861
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,160
 exchange

862
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,800
 an informal

863
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,160
 email in case the whole thing ends up on the front page of the local

864
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,000
 or student newspaper so that that's what we need to kind of restore

865
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,880
 the

866
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:29,359
 the social life of academia so there's magic we didn't really address it sort of explicitly

867
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:36,720
 but there's magic to the interaction between students there's magic in the interaction between

868
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,280
 faculty

869
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,839
 the people that teach and there's the magic and the interaction

870
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,520
 between the students and the faculty

871
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,319
 and it's

872
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,920
 it's an iterative process that changes everybody involved

873
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,240
 so it's like world experts in a particular discipline are changed

874
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,960
 as much as the students as the 20 year olds with the with the wild ideas

875
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,040
 each are changed and that's the magic of it that applies in liberal education

876
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,440
 that applies in this in the sciences too

877
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,520
 that's probably maybe you can speak to this why so much

878
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,560
 scientific innovation has happened in universities

879
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,520
 there's something about the youthful energy of like young minds

880
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,040
 graduate students undergraduate

881
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,400
 students that inspire

882
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,440
 some of the world experts to do some of the best work of their lives

883
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,960
 yeah well the human brain

884
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,040
 we know is at its most dynamic

885
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,200
 when people are pretty young

886
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,520
 you know this with your background in math

887
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,880
 people don't get better at math after the age of 30.

888
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,000
 and

889
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,599
 this is important when you think about the intergenerational character of university

890
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,280
 the older

891
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,079
 people the professors have the experience

892
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,800
 but they're fading intellectually

893
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,760
 from much earlier than anybody really wants to admit and so you get this intellectual

894
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,680
 shot in the arm

895
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,280
 from hanging out with people who are circa 20

896
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,640
 don't know shit

897
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,160
 but the brains are kind of like cooking yeah

898
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
 i look back on

899
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,480
 the career i've had in teaching which is over 25 years where cambridge oxford

900
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,119
 nyu harvard and

901
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,440
 i have extremely strong relationships with with students from those institutions

902
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,359
 because

903
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,000
 they would show up whether it was at office hours or in tutorials

904
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,839
 and disagree with me and for me it's always been about encouraging

905
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,040
 some active intellectual rebellion

906
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,760
 telling people

907
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,200
 i don't want your essay

908
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,640
 to echo my views

909
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,200
 if you can find something wrong with what i wrote

910
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,000
 great or if you can find something i missed that's new

911
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,280
 fantastic

912
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,760
 so there is definitely as you said a magic in that interaction across the generations

913
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,000
 and it's extraordinarily

914
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,200
 difficult i think for an intellectual to make the same progress

915
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,160
 in a project in isolation

916
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,920
 compared with the progress that can be made in these very very special communities

917
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,280
 what does a university do amongst other things

918
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,040
 it creates a somewhat artificial environment

919
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,480
 of of abnormal job security that's the whole idea of giving people tenure

920
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,040
 and then a relatively high turnover new faces each year and an institutionalization

921
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,880
 of thought experiments and actual experiments

922
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,520
 and then you get everybody living in the same kind of vicinity

923
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,560
 so that it can spill over into 3 a.m conversation

924
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,359
 well that that always seems to me to be

925
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,119
 a pretty potent combination

926
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,960
 let's ask ourselves a counterfactual

927
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,480
 question next let's imagine let's imagine that

928
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,599
 the the world wars happen

929
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,119
 but but there are no universities

930
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,839
 i mean how does the manhattan project happen with with no academia

931
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,119
 to take just one of many examples in truth

932
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,599
 how does britain even stay in the war without bletchley park without

933
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,599
 be being able to crack the german

934
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:15,119
 cipher the academics are unsung partly sung heroes of these conflicts

935
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,960
 the same is true in the soviet union the soviet union was a terribly

936
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,680
 evil and repressive system but it was good at science and that kept it

937
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,000
 in the game not only in

938
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,319
 in world war ii kept it in the cold war so

939
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:36,400
 it's clear that universities are incredibly powerful intellectual force multipliers

940
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,599
 and our our history without them

941
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,119
 would look very different

942
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,720
 sure some innovations would have happened without them that's clear the industrial revolution

943
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,240
 didn't need universities in fact they played a very marginal role

944
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,119
 in the key technological breakthroughs of the industrial revolution

945
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,880
 in its first phase

946
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,640
 but by the second industrial revolution in the late 19th century

947
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,560
 german industry would not have leapt ahead of british industry if the universities

948
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,319
 had not been superior

949
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,040
 and it was the fact that the germans institutionalized

950
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:12,079
 scientific research in the way that they did that really produced a powerful powerful advantage

951
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,000
 the problem was that

952
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,680
 this is a really interesting point

953
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,480
 that friedrich meinecker makes in d deutsche catestor for the german catastrophe

954
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,760
 the german intellectuals became technocrats

955
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,559
 homo faber he says they knew a great deal about their speciality

956
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,000
 but they were alienated

957
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,319
 from broadly speaking humanism

958
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:38,240
 and that is his explanation one of his explanations for why this very scientifically advanced germany

959
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,000
 goes down the path of hell led by hitler

960
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,839
 so when i come back and ask myself

961
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,760
 what is it that we want to do with

962
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
 a new university

963
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,319
 we want to make sure that we we don't fall into that that german

964
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,720
 pit where very high levels of technical and scientific expertise

965
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,680
 are decoupled from the fundamental

966
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,160
 foundations of of a free society

967
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,920
 so liberal arts are there i think to stop the scientists

968
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,760
 making fausty impacts and that that's why it's really important that people working on ai

969
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,440
 read shakespeare i think you

970
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,680
 said the academics are unsung heroes of the 20th century

971
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,119
 i think there's kind of an intellectual

972
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,599
 a lazy intellectual desire to kind of

973
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,720
 destroy the academics that the academics are the source of all problems in the world

974
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,359
 and i personally believe that exactly as you said we need to recognize that

975
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,319
 the university

976
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,359
 is probably

977
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,640
 where

978
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,480
 the ideas that will protect us from the catastrophes

979
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,720
 that are looming

980
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,920
 ahead of us

981
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,960
 is that's where those ideas are going to come from people who who work on economics

982
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,440
 can argue back and forth about john main arcanes

983
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,040
 but i think it's pretty clear that he was the most important economist

984
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,359
 and certainly the most influential economist

985
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,440
 of the 20th century and i think his ideas are looking

986
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,640
 better

987
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,680
 today in the wake of the financial crisis than they

988
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,680
 have at any time since the 1970s

989
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,520
 but imagine

990
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:24,720
 imagine john maynard keynes without cambridge you can't because someone like that doesn't actually

991
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,280
 doesn't actually exist without the incredible hot house

992
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,520
 that a place like cambridge wars in keynes's

993
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,640
 life he was a product

994
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,240
 of a kind of hereditary

995
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:34,880
 intellectual

996
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,160
 elite

997
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,760
 it had its vices

998
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,079
 but you can't help but admire

999
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,680
 the sheer power of the mind i've spent a lot of my career reading

1000
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,839
 keynes and i i revere

1001
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,280
 that intellect it's so so powerful

1002
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,839
 but you can't have people like that if you're not prepared to have

1003
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,599
 king's college cambridge

1004
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,880
 and and it comes with redundancy

1005
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,359
 i think that's the point there are lots and lots of things

1006
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,240
 that are very annoying about academic life

1007
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,839
 that you just have to

1008
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,520
 you have to deal with they're they're made fun of in that recent netflix

1009
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,960
 series the chair

1010
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,319
 and it is easy to make fun of academic life

1011
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:17,520
 tom sharpe's porterhouse blue did it it's it's an inherently comical

1012
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:23,200
 subject professors at least used to be amusingly eccentric

1013
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:31,040
 but we've sort of killed off that side of academia by turning it into an increasingly

1014
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,200
 doctrinaire place

1015
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,480
 where eccentricity

1016
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,680
 is not tolerated

1017
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,079
 i'll give you an illustration of this i had a call

1018
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,280
 this morning from a british academic

1019
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,559
 who said can you can you give me some advice because they're trying to decolonize

1020
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,559
 the curriculum

1021
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,480
 this is coming from the

1022
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,520
 diversity equity and inclusion officers

1023
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,319
 and it

1024
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,839
 seems to me that what they're requiring of us is a fundamental

1025
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,200
 violation of academic freedom because it is

1026
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,359
 determining ex-ante what we should study and teach

1027
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,319
 that's what's going on and

1028
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,079
 that's the thing that we really

1029
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,359
 really have to resist

1030
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,240
 because that kills the university that's that's the moment that it stops being

1031
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,079
 the magical place of intellectual creativity

1032
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,920
 and simply becomes an adjunct of the ministry of propaganda

1033
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,280
 i've loved

1034
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,520
 the time we spent talking about this because

1035
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,160
 it's such a hopeful message for the future of the university

1036
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,200
 that

1037
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,119
 i still share with you

1038
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:42,960
 the love of the ideal of the university so very practical question you mentioned summer

1039
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,520
 which summer are we talking about so when

1040
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,000
 i know we don't want to put hard dates

1041
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,880
 here but

1042
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,920
 what year

1043
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,400
 are we thinking about when is this thing launching

1044
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,960
 what are your thoughts on this we are moving as fast

1045
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,520
 as

1046
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,319
 our resources

1047
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,440
 allow

1048
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:03,680
 the goal is to offer the first of the forbidden courses next summer summer of 2022

1049
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,400
 and we hope to be able to launch an initial

1050
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,160
 albeit relatively small scale masters program

1051
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:18,240
 in the fall of next year that's that's as fast as is humanly possible

1052
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,280
 so yeah we're

1053
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:25,280
 really we're really keen to get going and i think the the approach we're taking is

1054
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,880
 somewhat imported from silicon valley think of this as a startup

1055
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,400
 don't think of this as something that has to exist as a full service university

1056
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,920
 on on day one

1057
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,720
 we don't have the results

1058
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,280
 of that you

1059
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:35,839
 need billions

1060
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:36,640
 and billions of dollars

1061
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,680
 to build a university

1062
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,839
 sort of as a as a facsimile

1063
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,119
 of an existing university but that's not what we want to do i mean copying

1064
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,119
 copying and pasting harvard or year or stanford would be a futile thing to do

1065
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,240
 they would probably you very quickly end up with the same pathologies

1066
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,559
 so we do have to come up with a different design and

1067
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,480
 one way of doing that is to grow it organically

1068
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,720
 from something quite small

1069
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,640
 elon musk

1070
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,920
 mentioned in his usual humorous way on twitter

1071
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,160
 that he wants to launch the texas institute of technology and science

1072
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,760
 tits some people thought this was sexist because of the acronym tits

1073
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,400
 so first of all i understand their viewpoint

1074
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,319
 but i also think there needs to be a place for humor on the internet

1075
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,440
 even from ceo

1076
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,240
 so on this podcast i've gotten a chance to

1077
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,319
 talk to quite a few ceos

1078
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,440
 and what i love to see is authenticity

1079
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,559
 and humor is often a sign of authenticity the

1080
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,839
 the quirkiness

1081
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,440
 that you mentioned is such a beautiful characteristic

1082
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,480
 of professors and faculty and great universities

1083
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,480
 is also beautiful to see as ceos especially founding ceo so anyway

1084
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,000
 the deeper

1085
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,119
 point he was making is showing an excitement

1086
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,319
 for the university

1087
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,920
 as a place for big ideas in

1088
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,640
 science technology engineering so to me

1089
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,880
 if there's some kind of way

1090
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,520
 if there is a serious thought that he had behind this tweet

1091
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:13,359
 not to analyze elon musk's twitter like it's shakespeare but if there's a serious thought

1092
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,559
 um i would love to see him supporting

1093
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,240
 the the flourishing of austin as a place for science technology

1094
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,319
 for these kinds of intellectual developments that

1095
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:31,599
 that that we're talking about like make make a place for free inquiry civil disagreements

1096
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,880
 coupled with great education

1097
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:41,599
 and conversations about artificial intelligence about technology about engineering so i'm actually gonna

1098
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,640
 i hope there's a serious idea behind that tweet and i'm gonna

1099
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,720
 i'm gonna chat with him about it i do too i do too i

1100
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,040
 most of the

1101
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,160
 biggest

1102
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:00,799
 storms and teacups of my academic career have been caused by bad jokes that i've made

1103
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:07,920
 these days if you want to make bad jokes being a billionaire is a great idea

1104
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,359
 i'm not here to defend elon's

1105
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,160
 twitter style or sense of humor

1106
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,559
 he's not gonna be remembered for his

1107
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,880
 tweets i think he's gonna be remembered for the astonishing

1108
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,400
 companies that he's built and his his contributions

1109
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:30,799
 in a whole range of of fields from spacex to tesla

1110
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,559
 and solar energy and i very much hope that we can

1111
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,440
 interest elon in this project we need

1112
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,839
 not only elon but a whole range of his peers

1113
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,040
 because

1114
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,799
 this takes resources universities are not cheap things to run especially

1115
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,280
 if as i hope we can make as much of

1116
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,079
 the the tuition

1117
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,040
 covered by scholarships and bursaries we we want to attract the best

1118
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,640
 intellectual talent to this institution

1119
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,640
 the best intellectual talent is somewhat randomly distributed through society

1120
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,920
 and some of it is in the bottom quintile of the income distribution

1121
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,440
 and that makes it hard to get to elite education so this will take resources

1122
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,480
 the last generation of

1123
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,400
 super wealthy plutocrats

1124
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,079
 the generation of the gilded age of the late 19th century

1125
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,960
 did a pretty good job of founding universities

1126
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,280
 chicago wouldn't exist but for the money of that era

1127
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,280
 and so my message to not only to elon but to all of

1128
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,480
 the peers all of those people who made their billions

1129
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,440
 out of technology

1130
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,520
 over the last couple of decades is

1131
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,359
 this is your time i mean and this is your opportunity to create something new

1132
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,040
 i can't really understand

1133
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,839
 why

1134
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,920
 the wealthy of our time are content to hand their money

1135
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,599
 i mean think of the vast

1136
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:56,799
 sums mike bloomberg

1137
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:57,359
 recently

1138
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,799
 gave to johns hopkins

1139
00:56:58,799 --> 00:56:59,920
 to his established

1140
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,079
 institutions

1141
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,920
 when

1142
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,400
 on close inspection those institutions don't seem to spend the money terribly well

1143
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,440
 and in fact

1144
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,640
 one of the mysteries of our time is the lack of due diligence

1145
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,079
 that hard-nosed

1146
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,520
 billionaires seem to do when it comes to philanthropy

1147
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,400
 so

1148
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,319
 i think there's an opportunity here for this generation of very talented wealthy people to

1149
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,440
 to do what their

1150
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,319
 their counterparts

1151
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,799
 did in the late 90s and early 20th century and and create some new institutions

1152
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:33,760
 and they don't need to

1153
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,040
 put their names on the buildings

1154
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,119
 they just need to do what what the

1155
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,559
 founders of

1156
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:45,359
 of chicago university of chicago did create something new that will that will endure

1157
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,760
 yeah mit is launching a college of computing and

1158
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
 um

1159
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,880
 steven schwartzman has

1160
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,119
 given quite a large sum of money i think in total a billion dollars

1161
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:03,839
 and as somebody who loves computing and somebody who loves mit i want some accountability

1162
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:07,280
 for mit becoming a better institution

1163
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:07,760
 and

1164
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,319
 this is once again why i'm excited about university

1165
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,480
 of austin because it serves as a beacon

1166
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,640
 look you can create something new

1167
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,400
 and this is what the great institutions of the future should look like

1168
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,559
 and steve schwartzman

1169
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:27,040
 is also uh an innovator the idea of creating a college on the tsinghua campus

1170
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,880
 and creating a kind of rhodes program

1171
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,520
 for students

1172
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,000
 from the western world to come study in china was

1173
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,520
 was steve's idea

1174
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,960
 and and i was somewhat involved did some visiting

1175
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,720
 professing there

1176
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,640
 it taught me that you can create something new

1177
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,839
 in that area of graduate education and quite quickly attract really strong

1178
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:55,440
 applicants because the people who finish their four years at harvard or stanford know

1179
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:01,280
 that they don't know a lot and i having taught a lot of people

1180
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,599
 in that group know how intellectually dissatisfied

1181
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,079
 they often are at the end of four years

1182
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,280
 i mean they may have beautifully gained the system to graduate

1183
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,480
 sumo or magna cum laude but they kind of know

1184
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,760
 they they'll confess

1185
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,440
 it after a drink or two they know that they gained the system and that intellectually

1186
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,559
 it wasn't

1187
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,720
 the fulfilling experience they wanted and they also know that an mba

1188
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:29,440
 from a comparable institution would not be a massive intellectual step forward

1189
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,920
 so i think what we want to say

1190
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,359
 is here's something really novel exciting

1191
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:36,319
 that will

1192
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,440
 be intellectually very challenging i i do think the university of austin has to be difficult

1193
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,079
 yeah

1194
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,720
 um i'd like it to feel a little bit like surviving

1195
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,400
 navy seal training to come through this program because it will be intellectually

1196
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,520
 demanding

1197
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,400
 and that i think should be a magnet so yeah steve if you're listening

1198
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,240
 please join elon in in supporting this and and

1199
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,960
 and peter thiel if you're listening i know how skeptical

1200
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,240
 you are about the idea of creating a new university because

1201
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,559
 heaven

1202
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,839
 knows peter and i have been discussing

1203
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,280
 this idea for years and he's always

1204
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,799
 said well no we thought about this and it just isn't going to work but i

1205
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,839
 really think we've got a we got a responsibility

1206
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:17,920
 to to do this well steve's been on this podcast before we've

1207
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,319
 spoken

1208
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,799
 a few times so i'll send this to him i hope he does

1209
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:21,599
 actually get behind

1210
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,319
 it as well

1211
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,280
 so i'm i'm super

1212
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:23,760
 excited

1213
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,440
 by

1214
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,640
 the ideas that we've been talking about that this

1215
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,760
 effort represents

1216
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,559
 and

1217
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,040
 what ripple effect it has on the rest of society

1218
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,440
 so thank you that was a time

1219
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,079
 beautifully spent and i'm really grateful for the

1220
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,680
 the fortune

1221
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,599
 of getting a chance to talk to you at this moment in history

1222
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,160
 because i've been a big fan of your work

1223
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,640
 and the reason i wanted to talk to you today

1224
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,079
 is

1225
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:58,480
 about all the excellent books you've written about various aspects of history through money war

1226
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,640
 power pandemics all of that but i'm glad that

1227
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,200
 this

1228
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,359
 we got a chance to talk about this which is

1229
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,160
 not looking at history it's looking at the future

1230
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,319
 this is a beautiful little

1231
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,079
 fortuitous

1232
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,520
 moment i appreciate you talking about it

1233
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,000
 in the book ascent of money

1234
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,760
 you give a history of the world through the lens of money

1235
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,319
 if the financial system is evolutionary

1236
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,040
 nature

1237
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,839
 much like life on earth what is the origin

1238
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,640
 of money on earth

1239
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,040
 the origin of money

1240
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,359
 predates coins

1241
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:42,000
 most people kind of assume i'll talk about coins but coins are relatively late developments

1242
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,200
 back in ancient mesopotamia so i don't know 5 000 years ago there were

1243
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:55,039
 relations between creditors and debtors there there are even in the simplest economy

1244
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,839
 because of the way in which agriculture works

1245
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,920
 hey i need i need to

1246
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,520
 plant these seeds but i'm not going to have crops for x months

1247
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,880
 so we have clay tablets in which

1248
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,359
 simple debt transactions are inscribed

1249
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:13,680
 i remember looking at great numbers of these in the british museum when i was

1250
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,559
 writing the ascent of money and that's really

1251
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,079
 the beginning of money the minute you start recording

1252
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,559
 a relationship between a creditor and a debtor you have something that is quasi money

1253
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,000
 and that is probably what these

1254
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,599
 um clay tablets mostly denoted

1255
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,440
 from that point on

1256
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:39,599
 there's a great evolutionary experiment to see what the most convenient way is

1257
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,880
 to record

1258
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:50,079
 relations between creditors and debtors and what emerges

1259
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:56,880
 in the time of the ancient greeks are coins metal tokens

1260
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,319
 sometimes

1261
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:04,319
 a valuable metal sometimes not usually bearing the imprint of a state or a monarch

1262
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:04,880
 and

1263
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,720
 that's the sort of more familiar

1264
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,000
 form of of money that we still use today

1265
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,680
 for very very small

1266
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,400
 transactions

1267
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,000
 i expect coins will

1268
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,760
 all be gone by the time

1269
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,720
 my youngest

1270
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,119
 son is my age but but they're a last remnant of a very very old way

1271
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,880
 of of doing

1272
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,839
 of doing simple transactions and when you say coins you mean physical coins

1273
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,000
 i'm talking about coins has been

1274
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,640
 rebranded

1275
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,119
 into digital space yeah not coin based coins

1276
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,520
 actual

1277
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:33,839
 coin

1278
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:34,160
 coins

1279
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,280
 you know the ones that jangle

1280
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:35,680
 in your

1281
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,400
 in your pocket

1282
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:36,880
 and you

1283
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,440
 kind of

1284
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,839
 don't know quite what to do with once you have some

1285
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:40,559
 so

1286
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,359
 that that became an incredibly

1287
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,880
 pervasive

1288
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,839
 form of of of paying for things money's just a it's just a crystallization

1289
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,720
 of a relationship between a debtor and a creditor and coins are just very fungible

1290
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,720
 you know whereas a clay tablet relates to a specific transaction

1291
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,079
 coins are generic and fungible they can be used in in any transaction

1292
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,760
 so that was an important evolutionary

1293
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,960
 advance

1294
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,160
 if you think of financial history and this was the point of the ascent of money

1295
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,440
 as an evolutionary

1296
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,400
 story there are punctuated equilibria

1297
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,359
 people get by with coins for a long time

1298
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,039
 despite their defects as a means of payment

1299
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,280
 such as that they can be debased

1300
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,119
 they can be clipped it's very hard to avoid

1301
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,640
 fake or debased money entering the system

1302
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,880
 but coinage is still kind of the basis of payments all the way

1303
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,079
 through the roman empire out the other end into the so-called

1304
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,280
 dark ages it's still how most things are settled

1305
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,760
 in cash transactions in the early 1300s

1306
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,680
 you don't get a big shift until after the black death

1307
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,799
 when there is such

1308
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,240
 a need to monetize

1309
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,319
 the economy because of chronic labor shortages

1310
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:53,039
 and feudalism

1311
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,559
 begins to unravel

1312
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,920
 that you you just don't have a sufficient

1313
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,799
 amount of coinage and so you get bills of exchange and i'm

1314
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:03,520
 really into bills of exchange

1315
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:10,319
 because and this i hope will capture your listeners and viewers imaginations

1316
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,200
 when they start using bills of exchange

1317
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,119
 which which are really just pieces of paper saying you know

1318
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,920
 i owe you over a three month period while goods are in transit from

1319
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,760
 florence to london

1320
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,760
 you get the first

1321
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,640
 peer-to-peer

1322
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,520
 payment system which is network verified

1323
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,319
 because they're

1324
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:35,200
 they're not coins they don't have a king's head on them they're just pieces of paper

1325
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,160
 and the verification comes in the form of signatures

1326
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:43,520
 and you you need ultimately some kind of guarantee if

1327
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,200
 i write an iou

1328
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,680
 to you build change i mean you don't really know

1329
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,280
 me that well we only just met

1330
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,720
 so you might want to get endorsed

1331
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,440
 by

1332
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,799
 i don't know somebody really credit worthy like elon

1333
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,240
 and so we we actually

1334
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,359
 can see in the late 14th century in northern italy in

1335
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,799
 england and elsewhere

1336
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,640
 the evolution of

1337
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,079
 a peer-to-peer network system of of payment

1338
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:11,200
 and that's actually how world trade grows because you just couldn't settle

1339
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,599
 long oceanic transactions with coinage it just wasn't practical

1340
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:16,559
 all those

1341
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,039
 treasure chests full of doubloons which were

1342
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,480
 part of the way in which the spanish empire worked really inefficient

1343
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,200
 so bills of exchange are an exciting

1344
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,920
 part of the story and they illustrate

1345
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,200
 something i should have made more clear of the ascent of money

1346
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:36,000
 that not everything used in payment needs to be money

1347
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,280
 classically economists will tell you oh well money money has three different functions

1348
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,799
 it's you've heard this a zillion times right it's a unit of account

1349
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:49,200
 it's a store of value and it's a medium of exchange

1350
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,640
 now there are three

1351
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,799
 or four things that are worth saying about this and i'll just say two one

1352
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,039
 it may be that those three things are a trilemma

1353
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:57,920
 and it's very difficult

1354
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,480
 for anything

1355
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,359
 to be all of them

1356
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,119
 this point was made by my

1357
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:01,520
 hoover

1358
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,559
 colleague manny rincon

1359
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:02,880
 cruz

1360
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,920
 last year and i still

1361
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,599
 wish he would write this up as a paper

1362
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,599
 because it's a great insight

1363
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,799
 the second thing that's really interesting to me is that

1364
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,799
 payments don't need to be money

1365
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:13,520
 and

1366
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,520
 if we go around as economists

1367
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,559
 love to do saying well bitcoin's not money because it doesn't fulfill these criteria

1368
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,480
 we're missing the point that you could build a system of payments

1369
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,599
 which i think is how we should think about crypto that is

1370
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,079
 isn't money doesn't need to be money it's like bills of exchange it's network-based

1371
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:33,520
 verification

1372
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,920
 peer-to-peer transactions without without third-party verification

1373
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,799
 when it hit me the other day that we actually had this precedent

1374
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:41,440
 for crypto

1375
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,480
 i got quite excited

1376
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,359
 and thought

1377
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,480
 i wish i had written that in the ascent of money

1378
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,920
 can you sort of from a first principles like almost like a physics perspective

1379
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,079
 or maybe a human perspective

1380
01:07:54,079 --> 01:08:00,799
 describe where does the value of money come from like where is it actually

1381
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:04,799
 where is it so it's a sheet of paper or it's coins

1382
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:05,760
 but

1383
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,359
 it feels like in a platonic

1384
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,000
 sense

1385
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,920
 there's some kind of thing that's actually

1386
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,400
 storing

1387
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:10,960
 the value

1388
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,119
 as us a bunch of ants are dancing around and so on

1389
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,198
 i come from a family of physicists

1390
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:21,120
 i'm the black sheep of the family my mother's a physicist my sister is

1391
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,198
 and so when you ask me to explain something in physics terms i

1392
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:30,238
 i get a kind of little part of me dies because i know i'll fail

1393
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:35,439
 but in in truth it doesn't really matter what we decide

1394
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:40,560
 money is going to be and anything can record

1395
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,920
 crystallize the the relationship between the the creditor and the debtor

1396
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,319
 it could be a piece of paper it can be a piece of metal

1397
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,560
 it can be nothing can just be a digital

1398
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,679
 entry

1399
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:52,799
 it's

1400
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,640
 trust that we're really talking about here

1401
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:03,759
 we are not just trusting one another we may not but we are trusting the money

1402
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,560
 so whatever we use to represent

1403
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,040
 the credited debtor relationship whether it's a banknote or a coin or whatever

1404
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,158
 it does depend on us both trusting it

1405
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,920
 and that doesn't always pertain

1406
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,960
 what we see in episodes of inflation

1407
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,880
 especially episodes of hyperinflation

1408
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,880
 is a crisis of trust a crisis of confidence in

1409
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,880
 the means of payments

1410
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,158
 and this is very traumatic for the societies to which it happens

1411
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,560
 by and large human beings particularly once you have a rule of law

1412
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,479
 system of the sort that evolved in the west and then became generalized

1413
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,600
 are predisposed to trust one another

1414
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,479
 and the default setting is to trust money

1415
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:58,560
 even when it depreciates a quite steady rate as the us dollar has done

1416
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,679
 pretty much uninterruptedly since the 1960s

1417
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,360
 it takes quite a big disruption for money to lose that trust

1418
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,600
 but i think essentially what money should be thought of as

1419
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,800
 is a series

1420
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,760
 of tokens that can take any form we like

1421
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,080
 and can be purely digital

1422
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:23,120
 which represent our transactions as as creditors and debtors

1423
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,520
 and the whole thing depends on our collective trust to work

1424
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,719
 i had to explain this to stephen colbert once in the

1425
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:35,679
 call burster the old old show that was actually funny and

1426
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,600
 when he said

1427
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,880
 um

1428
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:44,480
 so so so neil could i be money and i said yes you know we could

1429
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,400
 we could settle

1430
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,679
 a debt with a human being that was quite common

1431
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,280
 in much of history but but it's not the most convenient

1432
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,040
 form of money

1433
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,960
 money has to be convenient

1434
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:02,159
 that's why when they worked out how to make payments with cell phones the chinese

1435
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:02,719
 simply

1436
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,640
 went straight there from bank accounts

1437
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,080
 they skipped out credit cards you won't see credit cards in china

1438
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,800
 except in the hands of naive tourists

1439
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,199
 how much can this trust

1440
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,239
 bear

1441
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,360
 in terms of

1442
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,080
 us humans with our human nature testing it

1443
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,920
 it seems that i guess the surprising thing is the thing works

1444
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,520
 a bunch of self-interested ants running around

1445
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,360
 trading in trust

1446
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,320
 and it seems to work except for

1447
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:36,800
 a bunch of moments in human history when there's hyperinflation like you mentioned and it's just

1448
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,480
 it's just kind of amazing

1449
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,760
 it's kind of amazing that us humans if i were to be optimistic

1450
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,080
 and sort of hopeful about human nature

1451
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,000
 it gives me a sense that

1452
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,199
 people want to lean on each other they want to trust

1453
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,199
 that certainly

1454
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:59,679
 i would say probably now a widely shared view amongst evolutionary psychologists

1455
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:05,679
 network scientists it's one of nicholas christakis's argument in a recent book

1456
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:11,040
 and i think economic history broadly bears this out but you have to be

1457
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,040
 cautious

1458
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,640
 the cases where the system works

1459
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,640
 are familiar to us

1460
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,920
 because those are the those are the

1461
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,400
 the states and the eras that produce a lot of written records

1462
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,920
 but when

1463
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,159
 the system of trust collapses

1464
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:34,000
 and the monetary system collapses with it there's generally quite a paucity

1465
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,640
 of of records i found that when i was

1466
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,679
 writing

1467
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:43,600
 doom and so we slightly are biased in favor of the periods when trust

1468
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,960
 prevailed and the system functioned

1469
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,800
 it's very easy to point to a great many episodes

1470
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,920
 of very very intense monetary chaos even in the relatively recent past

1471
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,880
 in the wake of the first world war

1472
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,320
 multiple currencies not just the german currency multiple currencies

1473
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,840
 were completely destroyed the russian currency the polish currency

1474
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,719
 there were currency disasters all over

1475
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,400
 central and eastern europe in the early 1920s

1476
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,600
 and that was partly because

1477
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,239
 over the course of the 19th century a system had evolved in which trust

1478
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:21,360
 was based

1479
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,640
 on gold

1480
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,960
 and rules that were supposedly

1481
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,480
 applied by central banks

1482
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,920
 that system

1483
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,239
 which produced relative price stability over the the 19th century

1484
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,120
 fell apart

1485
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,120
 as a result of the first world war and

1486
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,560
 and as soon as it was gone

1487
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,800
 as soon as there was no longer a

1488
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,159
 clear link between

1489
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,360
 those

1490
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,440
 banknotes and coins and gold the whole thing went completely haywire

1491
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:54,239
 and i think we should remember that the extent of the monetary chaos from certainly 1918

1492
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,400
 all the way through to the late 1940s

1493
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,199
 i mean the german currency was destroyed not once but twice

1494
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,920
 in that period and that was one of the most advanced economies in the world

1495
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,520
 in the united states there were periods of intensely

1496
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,719
 deep deflation prices fell by a third

1497
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,239
 in the great depression and then very serious price volatility

1498
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,120
 in the immediate post-world war ii period so

1499
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,960
 it's a bit of an illusion

1500
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,280
 maybe it's an illusion

1501
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:27,520
 for people who've spent most of their lives in the last 20 years

1502
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,280
 we've had a period of exceptional price stability

1503
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,719
 since this century began

1504
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:42,159
 in which a regime of central bank independence and inflation targeting appeared to generate

1505
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,600
 steady below 2

1506
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,159
 inflation

1507
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:48,239
 in much of the developed world was a bit too low for the central bankers liking

1508
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,880
 and that became a problem in the financial crisis

1509
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,400
 but we've avoided

1510
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,080
 major price

1511
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:54,880
 instability

1512
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,199
 for

1513
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:55,679
 the better

1514
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:56,000
 part

1515
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:56,719
 of 20 years

1516
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:59,679
 in most of the world there haven't really been that many

1517
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:02,239
 very high inflation episodes and hardly any hyperinflationary

1518
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:05,679
 episodes venezuela is one of the very few zimbabwes another

1519
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:07,760
 but if you take a hundred year view or a 200

1520
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,600
 year view or if you want to take a 500

1521
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,400
 year view

1522
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,080
 you realize that

1523
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,560
 quite often the system doesn't work

1524
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,400
 if you go back to the 17th century there were multiple competing

1525
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:23,840
 systems of coinage there had been a great inflation that had begun the previous century

1526
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,800
 the price revolution caused mainly by the arrival of new world silver

1527
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:35,120
 i think financial history is a bit messier than one might think and

1528
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:40,080
 the more one studies it the more one realizes that the need for the evolution

1529
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,880
 the reason bills of exchange came along was because the coinage systems had stopped working

1530
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,159
 the reason that banknotes

1531
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,199
 started to become

1532
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:47,600
 used

1533
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,239
 more generally

1534
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,040
 first in

1535
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:49,600
 the american

1536
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:49,920
 colonies

1537
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,480
 in the 17th

1538
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:50,800
 century

1539
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,440
 then more widely

1540
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,239
 in the 18th century

1541
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:53,440
 was just that they were

1542
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,320
 more convenient

1543
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,040
 than

1544
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:59,440
 any other way of of paying for things we had to invent the bond market

1545
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,000
 in the 18th

1546
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,320
 century

1547
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,280
 to cope with the problem

1548
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:01,760
 of public

1549
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,080
 debt

1550
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:02,400
 which

1551
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:02,880
 up until

1552
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,159
 that point had been a recurrent

1553
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:04,480
 source

1554
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,199
 of

1555
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,800
 instability

1556
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,000
 and then we invented equity finance

1557
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,719
 because bonds were not enough

1558
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,880
 so i would prefer to think of

1559
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:20,640
 of the financial history as a series of crises really that are resolved by innovations

1560
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:26,719
 and in the most recent episode very exciting episode of financial history something called bitcoin

1561
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:33,440
 initiated a new financial or monetary revolution in response i think to the growing

1562
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,880
 crisis of the fiat money system can you speak to that so

1563
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,679
 what do you think about bitcoin

1564
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,120
 what do you think it is the response

1565
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,320
 to what are the growing problems of the fiat system

1566
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,199
 what is this moment in human history

1567
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:55,040
 that is full of challenges that bitcoin and cryptocurrency is trying to overcome

1568
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,080
 i don't think bitcoin

1569
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:05,520
 was devised by satoshi whoever he was for fear of

1570
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,320
 a breakdown of the fiat currencies

1571
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,480
 if it was it was a very far-sighted enterprise because certainly in 2008

1572
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,000
 when the first bitcoin paper appeared it wasn't very likely that

1573
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,120
 a wave of inflation was coming if anything

1574
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,679
 there was more reason to fear deflation at that point i think

1575
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,239
 it would be more accurate to say

1576
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,719
 that with the advent of the internet

1577
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:33,120
 there was a need for a means of payment native to the internet

1578
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:38,000
 typing your credit card number into a random website it's not the way

1579
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,080
 to pay for things on the internet

1580
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,440
 and i'd rather think of bitcoin as the first iteration

1581
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,800
 the first attempt to solve the problem of how do we pay for things in

1582
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,719
 what we must learn to call the metaverse

1583
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:49,440
 but

1584
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,400
 let's just call it the internet for old times sake

1585
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,280
 and ever since that initial

1586
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:00,719
 innovation the realization that you could use computing power and cryptography to create

1587
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,000
 peer-to-peer payments without third-party verification

1588
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,960
 a revolution has been gathering momentum

1589
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,480
 that poses a very profound

1590
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:13,280
 threat to the existing legacy system of banks and and fiat currencies

1591
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,600
 most money in the world today is made by banks not central banks banks

1592
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,679
 that's what most money is it's entries in bank accounts

1593
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:22,719
 and

1594
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:31,600
 what bitcoin represents is an alternative mode of payment that really ought to render banks obsolete

1595
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,520
 i think this financial revolution

1596
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,400
 has

1597
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,280
 got past the point at which it can be killed

1598
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,520
 it was vulnerable in the early years

1599
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,159
 but it now has sufficient adoption

1600
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:43,840
 and has generated sufficient

1601
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,199
 additional layers

1602
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,080
 i mean ethereum

1603
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,159
 was in many ways the more important

1604
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,480
 innovation because you can build a whole

1605
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,800
 system of of payments and ultimately smart contracts on top of ether

1606
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,640
 i think we've now reached the point that it's

1607
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,600
 pretty hard to imagine it all being killed

1608
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,560
 and it's just survived an amazing thing which was the chinese

1609
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,719
 shutting down mining and shutting down everything and still here we are

1610
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,159
 in fact crypto's thriving

1611
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:13,920
 what we don't know is how much damage

1612
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,280
 ill-judged

1613
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,760
 regulatory interventions are going to do to this financial revolution

1614
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:26,800
 left to its own devices i think decentralized finance provides the native

1615
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,679
 monitoring financial system for the internet

1616
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:30,400
 and

1617
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,239
 the more time we spend in

1618
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:32,880
 the metaverse

1619
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:33,440
 the more

1620
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:33,760
 use

1621
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,080
 we

1622
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:34,960
 will make of it

1623
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,440
 the next

1624
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:35,840
 things

1625
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,560
 that will happen

1626
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,800
 i think will be that

1627
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,960
 tokens in game spaces like roblox will become fungible

1628
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,560
 as my nine-year-old spends a lot more time playing on

1629
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,000
 computer games than i ever did i can see the entertainment

1630
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,600
 is becoming

1631
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:57,040
 a game-driven phenomenon and in the game space you need skins for your avatar

1632
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,679
 the economics of the internet

1633
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:04,159
 it's evolving very fast and in parallel you can see this payments

1634
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,639
 revolution happening i think that all

1635
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,320
 that all goes naturally

1636
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:13,520
 very well and generates an enormous amount of wealth in the process

1637
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,239
 the the problem is

1638
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:23,600
 there are people in washington with an overwhelming urge to intervene and and disrupt this evolutionary

1639
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,679
 process

1640
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,280
 partly i think

1641
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:32,080
 out of a muddled sense that there must be a lot of nefarious things going on

1642
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:36,320
 if we don't step in many more will go on this i think greatly exaggerates

1643
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,199
 how much

1644
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:40,000
 criminal activity is in fact going on in the space

1645
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,800
 but there's also the vested interests at work it was odd to me

1646
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,320
 maybe not odd

1647
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,040
 perhaps it wasn't surprising but the bank for international settlements earlier this year published

1648
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,560
 a report

1649
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,000
 one chapter of which said this must all go let's all stop

1650
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
 it's all got to be shut down

1651
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,360
 and it's got to be replaced by central bank digital currency

1652
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:04,719
 and martin wolf in the financial times read this and said i agree with this

1653
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:10,000
 and one suddenly realized that the the banks are clever they had they'd achieved the intellectual

1654
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,400
 counter-attack

1655
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,080
 with almost no fingerprints on the weapon

1656
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,280
 i think central bank digital currency is a terrible idea

1657
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,400
 i can't imagine why we would want to copy a chinese

1658
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,600
 model that essentially takes all transactions

1659
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,080
 and puts them directly under the surveillance of a central government institution but

1660
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,880
 that suddenly is a serious counterproposal

1661
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,760
 so on the one side we have a relatively decentralized

1662
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,360
 technologically

1663
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,400
 innovative

1664
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,000
 internet native

1665
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,600
 system of payments that has the possibility to evolve to produce a full set of

1666
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,600
 of smart contracts

1667
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,280
 reducing enormously

1668
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,000
 the transaction

1669
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,480
 costs

1670
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,120
 that we currently

1671
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:55,600
 encounter

1672
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,239
 in the financial

1673
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,159
 world because it gets rid of all those middlemen

1674
01:21:58,159 --> 01:21:59,920
 who take their cut every time

1675
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,360
 you take out a mortgage or whatever it is that's one

1676
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,000
 alternative

1677
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,480
 on the other side we have a highly centralized

1678
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,840
 system in which transactions

1679
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,199
 will by default be under the surveillance of the central bank

1680
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:16,480
 seems like an easy choice to me but hey i have this thing about personal liberty

1681
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:22,560
 so that's where we are i don't think that the regulators can can kill

1682
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,199
 web 3 i think we're supposed to call it web 3 because crypto

1683
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,400
 is now an obsolescent

1684
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,040
 term

1685
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:30,239
 they can't kill it but they can definitely make it difficult

1686
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,040
 and

1687
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,360
 throw a lot of sand into the machine

1688
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:38,719
 and i think worst of all they can spoil the evolutionary story by

1689
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:44,960
 by creating central bank digital currency that i don't think we really need or

1690
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,320
 we certainly don't need it in the chinese form

1691
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:55,440
 but do you think bitcoin has a strong chance to take over the world so

1692
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:00,400
 become the primary you mentioned the three things that make money money

1693
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:07,040
 become the primary methodology by which we store wealth we exchange no

1694
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,440
 no i think what bitcoin is

1695
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,040
 this was a phrase that i i got from my friend matt mclennan

1696
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:18,400
 first eagle an option on digital gold so it's the gold of the system

1697
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,560
 but currently it behaves like an option

1698
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:26,719
 that's why it's quite volatile because we don't really know if this brave new world of

1699
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:29,120
 crypto is gonna work

1700
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,440
 but if it does work then bitcoin is the gold because of the finite supply

1701
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,719
 what role

1702
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:38,159
 we need gold to play in the metaverse isn't quite

1703
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:38,719
 clear

1704
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,440
 i love that you're using the term metaverse this is great

1705
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,600
 well i i just like the metaversity

1706
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,280
 as a kind of yeah

1707
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,679
 as the antithesis of what we're trying to do in in austin but

1708
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:52,159
 i love it but can you imagine i'm using it sarcastically

1709
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:56,800
 i come from glasgow where all novel words have to be used sarcastically so the metaverse

1710
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:03,360
 sarcastic but see the beauty about humor and sarcasm is that the joke becomes reality

1711
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,639
 i mean it's like using

1712
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,440
 the word big bang to describe the origins of the universe

1713
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,280
 it becomes like that

1714
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,080
 it will

1715
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,520
 after a while it's in the textbooks

1716
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,719
 yeah and nobody's laughing

1717
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,239
 yeah well that's exactly right so sticky

1718
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:17,120
 yeah

1719
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,159
 um i'm on the side of humor but it is a it is a dangerous

1720
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:20,639
 activity

1721
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:21,280
 these days

1722
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:21,920
 anyway

1723
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,280
 i think bitcoin is is the option of digital gold

1724
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,400
 the

1725
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,360
 the role it plays is probably

1726
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,960
 not so much storage value

1727
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,360
 right now it's just nicely not very correlated

1728
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,040
 asset in your portfolio

1729
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,840
 when i updated the ascent of money which was in 2018

1730
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,840
 10 years after it came out

1731
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,360
 i wrote a new chapter in which i said

1732
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:51,120
 bitcoin which had just sold off after its 2017 bubble will rise again through adoption

1733
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,000
 because if every millionaire in the world

1734
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,960
 has point two percent of his or her wealth

1735
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,679
 in bitcoin

1736
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:58,400
 the price

1737
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:03,199
 should be fifteen thousand dollars and if it's one percent it's seventy five thousand dollars

1738
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,080
 and it

1739
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,080
 might not even stay at one percent because i mean look at its recent performance

1740
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,280
 if you

1741
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:15,360
 if your exposure to stocks global stocks had been hedged with a significant

1742
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:20,239
 crypto holding you would have aced the last few months

1743
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:23,440
 so i think the non-correlation [music]

1744
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,480
 property is very very important in driving

1745
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:31,760
 adoption and the volatility also drives adoption if you're a sophisticated investor

1746
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,880
 so i think the adoption drives

1747
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,560
 bitcoin up

1748
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,639
 because it's the option of digital gold but it's also just this nicely not very correlated

1749
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:42,480
 asset that you want to hold

1750
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,040
 in

1751
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,239
 in a world where

1752
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,360
 the hell i mean

1753
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:49,120
 the bank central bank is going to tighten we've come through this massively disruptive

1754
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,560
 episode of the pandemic

1755
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,480
 public debt soared

1756
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,520
 money printing sword

1757
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,760
 you could hang around with your bonds and wait for the euthanasia

1758
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,639
 of the rontier

1759
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:04,400
 you can hang on to your tech stocks and just hope there isn't a massive correction

1760
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:04,960
 or

1761
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,719
 dot dot dot well and

1762
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,560
 it seems like a fairly obvious strategy

1763
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,440
 to make sure that you have at least some crypto

1764
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:16,480
 for the coming year given what we likely have to face

1765
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:20,560
 i think what's really interesting is that on top of ethereum

1766
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,800
 a more elaborate

1767
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,600
 financial system is being built

1768
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,159
 stable coins are the interesting

1769
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:35,840
 puzzle for me because we need off-ramps

1770
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,159
 you and i have to pay taxes in u.s dollars

1771
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,360
 and

1772
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,840
 there's no getting away from that

1773
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:48,480
 the irs is going to let us hold crypto as long as we pay our taxes

1774
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:53,520
 and the only question in my mind is what's the optimal off-ramp

1775
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,520
 to make those taxes make those tax payments

1776
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,600
 probably it shouldn't be a currency invented by facebook

1777
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,679
 never struck me as the best solution to this problem

1778
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,679
 maybe it's some kind of fed coin

1779
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,639
 or maybe one of the the existing algorithmic

1780
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:16,639
 stable coins does the job but we clearly need some stable off-ramp

1781
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,800
 so you don't think it's possible for the irs

1782
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,639
 within the next decade to be accepting bitcoin as tax payments

1783
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:24,159
 i doubt that

1784
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:30,000
 having dealt with the irs now since when did i first come here 2002

1785
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,040
 it's hard to think of an institution less likely to leap into the

1786
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:40,560
 21st century when it comes to to payments no i think i think we'll we'll be

1787
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,120
 we'll be tolerated

1788
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,560
 crypto world will be tolerated

1789
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,840
 as long as we pay our taxes

1790
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,120
 that's the and it's important

1791
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,120
 that we're already at that point

1792
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,360
 and then the next question becomes well

1793
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:56,159
 does gary gensler define everything as a security and do we then have to go through

1794
01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:00,480
 endless regulatory contortions to satisfy the sec

1795
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,600
 there's a whole bunch of of uncertainties

1796
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,639
 that the administrative

1797
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:08,880
 state excels at creating because you know that's just how that's how the administrative

1798
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,080
 state works you'll do something new hmm

1799
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,840
 i'll decide whether that's a security

1800
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,360
 but don't expect me to define

1801
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,719
 it for you i'll decide

1802
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:17,520
 in an arbitrary

1803
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,199
 way and then you'll owe me money

1804
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,440
 so all of this is going to be very annoying

1805
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,719
 and you know for people who are trying to run

1806
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:25,520
 exchanges

1807
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,400
 or

1808
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,719
 innovate in the space these these regulations

1809
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:33,760
 will be annoying but the problem with fintech is it's it's different from tech broadly defined

1810
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,600
 you know when tech got into

1811
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,239
 e-commerce with amazon when it got into social networking with facebook

1812
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:43,520
 there wasn't a huge regulatory jungle to navigate

1813
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,280
 but welcome to the world of finance which has always been

1814
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:52,880
 a jungle of regulation because the regulation is is there to you know basically

1815
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,080
 entrench the incumbents that's what it's for

1816
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,920
 so it'll be a much tougher fight than the fights we've we've seen over

1817
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:08,239
 other aspects of the tech revolution because because the incumbents are are there and they see

1818
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:09,520
 the threat

1819
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,040
 and in the end

1820
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,960
 satoshi said it very explicitly

1821
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:18,000
 it's peer-to-peer payment without third party verification and all the third parties are going wait what

1822
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,480
 we're the third parties

1823
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:24,719
 so there is a connection between power and money

1824
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:35,600
 you've mentioned world war one from the perspective of money so power money war authoritarian regimes

1825
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,600
 from the perspective of money do you have hope that cryptocurrency

1826
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,440
 can help resist war can help

1827
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:48,800
 resist the negative effects of authoritarian regimes

1828
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,679
 or is that a silly hope

1829
01:29:53,040 --> 01:30:03,760
 wars happen because the people who have the power to command armed forces

1830
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:09,040
 miscalculate that's generally what happens

1831
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,800
 and we will have a big war in the near future if

1832
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:16,960
 both the chinese government and the us government miscalculates

1833
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:23,120
 and they unleash lethal lethal force on one another and there's nothing that any financial institution

1834
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,040
 can do to stop that

1835
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:29,199
 any more than the rothschilds could rothschilds could stop world war one

1836
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:32,960
 and they were then the biggest bank in the world by far with massive

1837
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,440
 international financial influence

1838
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:40,960
 so let's accept that war is is in a different domain

1839
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,320
 war

1840
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,040
 would impact the financial world massively

1841
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,800
 if it were a war between the united states and china because

1842
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:56,800
 there's still a huge china trade on wall street is long china europe is long china

1843
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:02,719
 so the conflict that i could foresee in the future is one that's highly financially disruptive

1844
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:07,440
 where does crypto fit in crypto's obvious

1845
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,760
 utility in the short run

1846
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:15,280
 is as a store of wealth of transferable wealth for people who live

1847
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,960
 in dangerous places

1848
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:17,840
 with

1849
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,280
 failing not just failing money but failing rule of law

1850
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,639
 that's why in latin america

1851
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:23,360
 there's so much

1852
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:23,760
 interest

1853
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,320
 in crypto

1854
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:24,880
 because latin

1855
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:25,280
 americans

1856
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,159
 have a lot of monetary

1857
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:26,480
 history

1858
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,840
 to look back on and not much of it is

1859
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:34,960
 so i think that the short run problem that crypto solves

1860
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,040
 is and this goes back to the the digital gold point

1861
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:44,719
 if you are in a dangerous place with weak rule of law and weak property rights

1862
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:50,960
 here's a new and better way to have portable wealth

1863
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,520
 i think the next

1864
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,719
 question to ask is would you want to be long crypto

1865
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,000
 in the event of world war three

1866
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,920
 what's interesting about that question is that world war three would likely have a significant

1867
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,239
 cyber dimension to it

1868
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:13,920
 and i don't want to be a hundred percent in crypto if they crash the internet

1869
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:18,239
 which between them china and russia might be able to do

1870
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:21,600
 that's a fascinating question whether you want to be holding

1871
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,920
 physical gold or digital gold

1872
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,840
 in the event of world war iii

1873
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,760
 the smart person who studied history

1874
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,239
 definitely

1875
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:28,719
 wants

1876
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,320
 better both

1877
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,000
 and

1878
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,600
 so let's imagine world war iii has a very very severe

1879
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,199
 cyber component to it with high levels of disruption

1880
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:45,600
 yeah you'd be glad of the old the old shiny stuff at that point so

1881
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,120
 diversification still seems like the most important

1882
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,000
 truth

1883
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
 of a financial history

1884
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,040
 yeah and and what is crypto it's just this wonderful new source of diversification

1885
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,239
 but you'd be nuts to be a hundred percent in bitcoin

1886
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,920
 i mean i i i have

1887
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,120
 some friends who are

1888
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:03,600
 probably

1889
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,320
 quite close to that close to 100

1890
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:11,760
 i i'd marr the i'd mar the bowls of steel

1891
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:18,080
 yeah in whatever way that balls of steel takes to takes form

1892
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:21,679
 you mentioned smart contracts what are your thoughts about

1893
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:28,480
 in the context of the history of money about ethereum about smart contracts about kind of

1894
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:37,679
 more systematic at scale formalization of agreements between humans i think

1895
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:49,040
 it must be the case that a lot of the complexity in a mortgage is redundant

1896
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:55,280
 that when we are confronted with pages and pages and pages and pages of small prints

1897
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:01,040
 we're seeing some manifestation of of the late stage regulatory state

1898
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,560
 the transaction itself is quite simple

1899
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:09,520
 and most of the verbage is just ass covering by regulators

1900
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,239
 so i think the smart contract

1901
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:13,360
 although

1902
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,360
 i'm sure lawyers will

1903
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,600
 email me and tell me i'm wrong

1904
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,159
 can deal with a lot of the plain vanilla and maybe not so plain transactions

1905
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,920
 that we want to do

1906
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,360
 and eliminate

1907
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,480
 yet more intermediaries

1908
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:33,360
 that's my my kind of working assumption and

1909
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:37,840
 given that a lot of of financial transactions

1910
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:43,440
 have the potential at least to be to be simplified automated

1911
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:48,239
 turned into smart contracts that that's probably where the future goes

1912
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:51,440
 i can't see an obvious reason why my

1913
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,600
 range of different financial

1914
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:59,040
 needs let's think about insurance for example will continue to be met

1915
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:05,440
 with instruments that in some ways are 100 years old

1916
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,760
 so i think we're still

1917
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:12,320
 an early stage of a financial revolution that will greatly streamline

1918
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,960
 how we take care of all those financial needs that we have

1919
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:23,360
 mortgages and insurance leave leap to mind you know most households are are penalized

1920
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:29,600
 for being financially poorly educated and confronted with oligopolistic

1921
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:38,639
 financial services providers so you kind of leave college already in debt so you start

1922
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,239
 in debt servitude

1923
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:41,360
 and then

1924
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,560
 you gotta somehow

1925
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,080
 leave her up to buy a

1926
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:48,560
 home if you can because everybody's kind of telling you you should do that so

1927
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,320
 so you and your spouse

1928
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,960
 you are getting even more leveraged

1929
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,239
 and you're

1930
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:59,440
 you're long one asset class called real estate which is super illiquid

1931
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,880
 i mean already i'm i'm crying inside at the thought of

1932
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:05,520
 describing

1933
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,480
 so many households

1934
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:06,960
 financial

1935
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,440
 predicament

1936
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,480
 in that way and i'm not done with them yet because oh by the way

1937
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,960
 there's all this insurance you have to take out

1938
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,000
 and here are the providers

1939
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,239
 that are willing to insure you and here are the premiums

1940
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,600
 you're going to be paying

1941
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,719
 which are kind of presented

1942
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,040
 to you that's your that's your car insurance

1943
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,080
 that's your home insurance

1944
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,280
 and if you're here it's the earthquake

1945
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,159
 insurance and

1946
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:25,679
 pretty soon you're just bleeding

1947
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:26,320
 money

1948
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:30,080
 in a bunch of monthly payments to the mortgage

1949
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,480
 lender to the insurer

1950
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,440
 to all the other people that lent you money

1951
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:38,800
 and let's look at your balance sheet it sucks

1952
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:39,199
 you know

1953
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:40,400
 there's this great big chunk

1954
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,119
 of real estate

1955
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:43,520
 and what else have you really got on there

1956
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,239
 and the other side is a bunch of debt which is probably paying too high interest

1957
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:51,040
 the typical household in the median

1958
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:55,040
 kind of range is is at the mercy of

1959
01:36:55,040 --> 01:37:00,719
 oligopolistic financial services providers go down further in the social

1960
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:03,679
 scale and people are outside the financial system altogether

1961
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,639
 and those poor folks have to rely on

1962
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,800
 banknotes and informal lending with huge punitive rates

1963
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,280
 we have to do better than this this has to be

1964
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,199
 this has to be improved upon

1965
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:18,560
 and i think what's exciting about our time is that technology

1966
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,600
 now exists that didn't exist when i wrote the ascent of money

1967
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:26,320
 to solve these problems when i wrote this under money which was in 2008

1968
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:30,480
 you couldn't really solve the problem i've just described

1969
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:36,719
 certainly you couldn't solve it with something like microfinance that was obviously not viable the

1970
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,480
 interest rates were high the transaction costs were crazy

1971
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,840
 but now we have solutions

1972
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,360
 and the solutions are extremely

1973
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,639
 exciting so fintech is this great force for good that

1974
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,719
 brings people into the financial system

1975
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:50,800
 and reduces transaction costs

1976
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,159
 crypto is part of it but it's just part of it there's a much broader

1977
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:56,719
 story of fintech going on here where

1978
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:59,520
 you get suddenly you get financial services

1979
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,560
 on your phone

1980
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,880
 don't cost nearly as much as they

1981
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,639
 they did when there had to be a bricks and mortar

1982
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:04,960
 building

1983
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:05,679
 on main street

1984
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:06,960
 that you kind of went

1985
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,080
 humbly

1986
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,119
 and beseeched

1987
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:14,480
 to lend you money i'm excited about that because it seems to me very socially transformative

1988
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,520
 i'll give you one other example of what's great

1989
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:25,600
 the people who really get sculpt in our financial system are senders and receivers of remittances

1990
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:30,560
 which are often amongst the poorest families in the world the people who are

1991
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,320
 like my wife's family in east africa really kind of hand to mouth

1992
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,880
 and if you send money to east africa or

1993
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:37,600
 the philippines

1994
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,960
 or central america

1995
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,480
 it's it's the transaction

1996
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,440
 costs are awful

1997
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,840
 i'm talking to you western union

1998
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:50,080
 we're gonna solve that problem

1999
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:53,360
 so ten years from now the transaction cost will just be negligible

2000
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,400
 and the money will go to the people who need it rather than to

2001
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,440
 rent seeking financial

2002
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,000
 institutions

2003
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,360
 so i'm on the side of the revolution

2004
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,639
 with this because

2005
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:03,520
 i think the incumbent financial institutions globally

2006
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,760
 are doing a pretty terrible job

2007
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,280
 and

2008
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:11,040
 middle class and lower class families lose out and

2009
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,239
 thankfully technology

2010
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:16,080
 technology allows us to fix this yeah so fintech can remove a lot of inefficiencies

2011
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,040
 in the system

2012
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:22,000
 i'm super excited myself maybe as a machine learning person in the data oracles

2013
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,320
 so converting a lot of our physical world into data

2014
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,199
 so

2015
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:29,840
 and have smart contracts on top of that so

2016
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,560
 that no longer is there's this fuzziness

2017
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,280
 about

2018
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:36,480
 what is the concrete nature of the agreements

2019
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:42,000
 you can tie your agreement to weather you can tie your agreement to

2020
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,760
 the behavior of

2021
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,679
 certain kinds of financial

2022
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:49,520
 systems you can tie your behavior to i don't know

2023
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,159
 i mean all kinds of things you can connect it to the body

2024
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:53,440
 in terms of human

2025
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,840
 um sensory information

2026
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,880
 like

2027
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:03,119
 you can make an agreement that if you don't lose five pounds in the next month

2028
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:06,080
 you're going to pay me a thousand dollars or something like that i don't know

2029
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,199
 it's a stupid example

2030
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:08,080
 but it's not

2031
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,719
 because like you can create all kinds of services

2032
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:11,920
 on top of that you can

2033
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,280
 you can just create

2034
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,960
 all kinds of interesting applications

2035
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,040
 that completely revolutionize

2036
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,600
 how humans transact

2037
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,520
 i think

2038
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:29,520
 of course we don't want to create a world of chinese style social credit

2039
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,840
 in which our behavior

2040
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,320
 becomes so transparent

2041
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:40,239
 to providers of financial services particularly insurers that

2042
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:44,800
 when i try to go into the pub i'm i'm stopped from doing so

2043
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,159
 every time you take a drink your insurance goes up

2044
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:51,280
 right or my credit card won't work

2045
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:54,239
 in certain restaurants because they serve

2046
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:56,080
 you know ribeye steak

2047
01:40:56,080 --> 01:41:00,239
 i fear that world because i see it being built in china and

2048
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:04,960
 we we must at all costs make sure that the western world has something

2049
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,440
 distinctive to offer

2050
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:11,600
 it can't just be oh it's the same as in china only the data go to

2051
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:16,000
 to five tech companies rather than to

2052
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:22,960
 xi jinping so i think the the way we need to steer this world is

2053
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,719
 in the way that our data

2054
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:30,960
 are by default vaulted on our devices

2055
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,600
 and we choose

2056
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,400
 when to release the data yes

2057
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:40,000
 rather than the default setting being that the data are available

2058
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,960
 that's important i think because it was one of the biggest mistakes

2059
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:43,760
 of

2060
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,080
 the evolution of the internet that

2061
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:49,840
 that in a way the default was to let our our data be plundered

2062
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,760
 it's hard to undo that but i think we can we can at least

2063
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,000
 create a new regime

2064
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:03,840
 that in future makes privacy default rather than open access default

2065
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,920
 in the book doom the politics of catastrophe

2066
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:15,199
 your newest book you describe wars pandemics and the terrible disasters in human history

2067
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:19,600
 which stands out to you as the worst in terms of how much

2068
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,600
 it shook the world and the human spirit

2069
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:27,199
 i am glad i was not around

2070
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:33,760
 in the mid 14th century when the bubonic plague swept across eurasia

2071
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:38,239
 as far as we can see that was history's worst pandemic

2072
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:44,800
 maybe there was a comparably bad one in the reign of the emperor justinian but

2073
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,679
 there's some reason to think it wasn't as bad

2074
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:50,400
 and the more we learn about

2075
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:54,320
 the 14th century with the more we realized that it really was across eurasia

2076
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,080
 and the the mortality

2077
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,800
 was

2078
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:57,840
 30

2079
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,840
 in some places 50

2080
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,480
 in some places higher there were whole towns that were just emptied

2081
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:09,520
 and when one reads about the black death it's an unimaginable

2082
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:14,480
 nightmare of of death and

2083
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:20,400
 madness in the death with flagellate orders wandering from town to town

2084
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:24,719
 seeking to ward off divine retribution by flogging themselves

2085
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,800
 people turning on the local jewish communities as if it's somehow their fault

2086
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,119
 that must have been a nightmarish

2087
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,320
 time

2088
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,320
 if you ask me

2089
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:40,239
 for an an also ran a runner-up it would be it would be world war ii

2090
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:44,960
 in eastern europe and in many ways

2091
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,440
 it might have been worse because for a medieval

2092
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:56,639
 peasant the sense of being on the wrong side of divine retribution must have been overpowering

2093
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,360
 in the mid-20th century

2094
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:03,119
 you knew that this was man-made

2095
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:06,800
 murder on a massive industrial scale

2096
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:12,719
 if only if one reads grossman's life and fate just to take one example

2097
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:16,080
 one enters a a hellscape

2098
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:19,360
 that it's extremely hard

2099
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:22,000
 to imagine oneself in

2100
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,400
 so these are two of the great disasters of of human history and

2101
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:30,239
 if we did have a time machine if one really were able to transport

2102
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:31,760
 people back and

2103
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,920
 and give them a glimpse of these

2104
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,360
 times

2105
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,719
 i think the post-traumatic

2106
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,000
 stress would be enormous

2107
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,600
 people would come back from those those trips even if it was a

2108
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,719
 one-day excursion

2109
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,960
 with guaranteed survival

2110
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,000
 in a state of of utter shock

2111
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,600
 you often explore counterfactual

2112
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,320
 hypothetical

2113
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:53,600
 history this which is a fascinating thing to do

2114
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,040
 sometimes to a controversial degree

2115
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:01,440
 and again you walk through that fire gracefully

2116
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,159
 so let me ask maybe about

2117
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:12,400
 world war ii or in general or what key moments in history of the 20th century

2118
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,440
 do you think

2119
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:18,159
 if something else happened at those moments we could have avoided some of the big atrocities

2120
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:24,560
 stalin's holomore hitler's holocaust miles great chinese famine

2121
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:33,760
 the great turning point in in world history is is august the 2nd 1914

2122
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:39,440
 when the british cabinet decides to intervene

2123
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:43,520
 and what would have been a european war

2124
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,920
 becomes a world war

2125
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:51,679
 and with british intervention it becomes a massively larger and more protracted conflict

2126
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:58,159
 so very early in my career i became very preoccupied with the deliberations on that day

2127
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,159
 and the surprising

2128
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:04,400
 decision that a liberal cabinet took to to go to war

2129
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,840
 which you might not have bet on that morning because

2130
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,920
 there seemed to be a majority of cabinet members who would be disinclined

2131
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:14,080
 and only a minority including winston church

2132
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:18,560
 who wanted to go to war so that's one turning point i often wish i could

2133
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,480
 get my time machine working and go back and say wait stop

2134
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:25,520
 just think about what you're going to do and by the way

2135
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:28,000
 let me show you a video of europe

2136
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,440
 in 1918 so that's one can we linger on that one

2137
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:34,400
 that one

2138
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:40,400
 a lot of people push back on you on in the because it's so difficult

2139
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,600
 so the idea is if i could try to summarize

2140
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,400
 and

2141
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:49,280
 you're the first person that made me think about this very uncomfortable

2142
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:52,080
 thought which is

2143
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,239
 the ideas in world war one

2144
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:58,800
 it would be a better world if britain stayed out of the war

2145
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,639
 and germany won right

2146
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:10,000
 thinking now in retrospect that the whole story of the 20th century thinking about

2147
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:16,400
 stalin's rule of 30 years thinking about hitler's rise to power and

2148
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:21,199
 the atrocities of the holocaust but also like you said on the eastern front

2149
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:24,400
 the death of tens of millions of people

2150
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:25,840
 through the war

2151
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,920
 and also sort of the political

2152
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:33,920
 prisoners and the suffering connected to communism connected to fascism all those kinds of things

2153
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,679
 well that's one

2154
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:40,719
 that's one heck of an example of why you're just like fearless in this

2155
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:46,800
 particular style of exploring counterfactual history so can you elaborate on that

2156
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:52,000
 idea and maybe why this was such an important day in human history

2157
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:52,960
 this argument

2158
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,520
 was central

2159
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,560
 to my book the pity

2160
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:54,960
 of war

2161
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:55,280
 i

2162
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:55,920
 i also

2163
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:56,639
 did an essay

2164
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:57,280
 in virtual

2165
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:57,600
 history

2166
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:57,920
 about

2167
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:58,239
 this

2168
01:47:58,239 --> 01:47:58,800
 and it's always

2169
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,119
 amused

2170
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:00,080
 me that

2171
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,560
 from around that time i began to be called a conservative

2172
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,119
 historian

2173
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:05,360
 because it's actually a very left-wing argument

2174
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,719
 the people in 1914

2175
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:10,400
 who thought britain should stay at the war were the left of the labour party

2176
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:14,239
 who split to become the independent labour party

2177
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:19,760
 what would have happened well first of all britain was not ready for war in 1914

2178
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:22,960
 there had not been conscription the army was tiny

2179
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:28,800
 so britain had failed to deter germany the germans took the decision that they could risk

2180
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,880
 going through belgium

2181
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,400
 using the schlieffen plan to fight their two-front war

2182
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:40,960
 they they calculated that britain's intervention would either not happen or not matter

2183
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:44,840
 if britain had been strategically

2184
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,320
 committed

2185
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,119
 to preventing

2186
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:51,280
 germany winning a war in europe they should have introduced conscription 10 years before

2187
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,320
 had a

2188
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:55,600
 meaningful land army and that would have deterred the germans

2189
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,360
 so the liberal government

2190
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:03,199
 provided the worst of both worlds a commitment that was more or less secret to intervene

2191
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:05,280
 that the public didn't know about

2192
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,520
 in fact much of the liberal party didn't know about

2193
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,440
 but without really the means

2194
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:10,719
 to make that intervention

2195
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:14,159
 effective a tiny army with just a few divisions

2196
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:18,080
 so it's perfectly reasonable to argue as a number of people did in

2197
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:21,440
 on august the 2nd 1914 that britain should not intervene

2198
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:25,599
 after britain had not immediately intervened against the french revolutionary armies

2199
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:27,040
 back in the 1790s

2200
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:32,719
 it had played an offshore role ultimately intervening but not immediately intervening

2201
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:35,119
 if britain had stayed out

2202
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:40,159
 i don't think that france would have collapsed immediately as it had in 1870

2203
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:43,760
 the french held up remarkably well to catastrophic

2204
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:47,599
 casualties in the first six months of the first world war

2205
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:51,040
 but by 1916 i don't see how

2206
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:54,639
 france could have kept going if britain had not joined the war

2207
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:59,119
 and i think the war would have been over perhaps at some point in 1916.

2208
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:01,599
 we know that germany's aims would have been significantly

2209
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:02,239
 limited

2210
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:02,800
 because

2211
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,199
 they would have needed to keep britain out if they'd succeeded

2212
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:07,520
 in keeping britain out they'd have had to keep britain out

2213
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,199
 and the way to keep britain out was obviously

2214
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:10,560
 not to make any

2215
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,199
 annexation

2216
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:13,920
 of belgium to limit german war aims

2217
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:16,320
 particularly to limit them to eastern europe

2218
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:19,040
 and from britain's point of view what was not to like

2219
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:24,480
 so the russian empire is defeated along with france

2220
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:27,360
 what does that really change

2221
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,679
 if the germans are sensible

2222
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:35,760
 and we can see what this might have looked like they focus on eastern europe

2223
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:42,400
 they take chunks of the russian empire perhaps they create as they did in the

2224
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,239
 in the piece of brest-litovsk

2225
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:46,080
 an independent or quasi-independent

2226
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:46,960
 poland

2227
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:50,080
 in no way does that pose a threat to the british empire in fact

2228
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,920
 it's a good thing

2229
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:57,040
 britain never had had a particularly good relationship with the russian empire after all

2230
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:03,040
 the key point here is that the germany that emerges from victory in 1916

2231
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:08,480
 has a kind of european union it's the dominant part of an enlarged

2232
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:12,719
 germany with a significant missile europa

2233
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:18,080
 whatever you want to call it customs union type arrangement with neighboring countries

2234
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:21,840
 including one suspects austria-hungary

2235
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:25,199
 that is a very different world

2236
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:31,840
 from the world of 1917-18 the protraction of the war for a further two years

2237
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:36,719
 its globalization which britain's intervention made inevitable

2238
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:43,360
 as philip zeliko showed in his recent book on the failure to make peace in 1916

2239
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:47,599
 woodrow wilson tried and failed to intervene and broker a piece in 1916

2240
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:48,800
 so i'm not the only

2241
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,760
 counterfactualist

2242
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:54,480
 here the extension of the war for a further two years with escalating

2243
01:51:54,480 --> 01:52:00,400
 slaughter the death toll rose because the industrial capacity of the armies grew greater

2244
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:04,239
 that's what condemns us to the bolshevik revolution

2245
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:08,800
 and it's what condemns us ultimately to nazism

2246
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,960
 because it's out of

2247
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,679
 the experience of defeat in 1918

2248
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:20,960
 as hitler makes clear in mind camp that he becomes radicalized and enters the political realm

2249
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:26,080
 take out those additional years of war and hitler's just a failed artist

2250
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,800
 it's the it's the end of the war

2251
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,360
 that turns him into

2252
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,679
 the demagogue

2253
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:38,719
 you asked what are the things that evolve avoid the totalitarian states

2254
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:40,320
 as i've said british

2255
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,719
 intervention for me is the most plausible

2256
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:48,080
 and it takes out all of that malignant history that follows from the bolshevik revolution

2257
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:53,679
 it's very hard for me to see how lenin gets anywhere if the war is over

2258
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:58,639
 that looks like the opportunity for the the constitutional

2259
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:02,400
 elements the liberal elements in in russia

2260
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:08,960
 there are other moments at which you can imagine history taking a different path

2261
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:15,199
 if the provisional government in russia had been more ruthless

2262
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:17,360
 it was very lenient towards the bolsheviks

2263
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:20,639
 but if it had just rounded them up and shot the bolshevik leadership

2264
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:22,320
 that would have certainly

2265
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,880
 cut the bolshevik revolution off

2266
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,960
 one looks back on the

2267
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,320
 conduct of the the russian liberals with the kind of despair

2268
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,119
 at their

2269
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:35,520
 their failure to see the scale of the threat that they face and the ruthlessness

2270
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,400
 that the bolshevik leadership would evince

2271
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:42,000
 there's a counterfactual in germany which is interesting

2272
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,960
 i think the weimar republic destroyed itself in two disastrous economic

2273
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,560
 calamities the inflation and then the deflation

2274
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,880
 it's difficult for me to imagine hitler getting to be

2275
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,880
 reich chancellor without those huge economic disasters

2276
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:04,480
 so another part of my early work explored alternative

2277
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:11,040
 policy options that the german republic the weimar republic might have pursued

2278
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,639
 there are other contingencies

2279
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:15,199
 that that spring to mind in 1936

2280
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:18,880
 or 38 i think more plausibly 38

2281
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:24,639
 britain should have gone to war the great mistake was munich

2282
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:28,880
 hitler was in an extremely vulnerable position in 1938

2283
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:33,760
 because remember he didn't have russia squared away as he would in 1939.

2284
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:38,080
 chamberlain's mistake was to fold instead of

2285
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,960
 of going for going for war as church or rightly saw

2286
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:43,520
 and and that there was a magical opportunity

2287
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:44,159
 there

2288
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:48,000
 that would have played into the hands of the german military opposition and conservatives

2289
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,560
 to to snuff hitler out

2290
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,800
 over czechoslovakia

2291
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:59,119
 i could go on the point is that the history is not some inexorable narrative

2292
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:05,360
 which can only end one way it's a garden of forking paths and at

2293
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:08,960
 many many junctions in the road

2294
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,639
 there were choices

2295
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:12,560
 that could have averted the

2296
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,400
 calamities of the mid-20th century i have to ask you about this moment

2297
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:22,560
 before you said i could go on this moment of chamberlain and hitler snuff hitler out

2298
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,199
 in terms of czechoslovakia

2299
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:26,080
 and

2300
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,199
 we'll return to

2301
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:28,159
 the book doom

2302
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:30,880
 on this point what does it take to be a great

2303
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,159
 leader

2304
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:35,040
 in the room with hitler or

2305
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:38,639
 in the same time and space as hitler

2306
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:42,560
 to snuff him out to make the right decisions

2307
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:43,360
 what what

2308
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:43,840
 is

2309
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:46,560
 so it sounds like you put quite a bit of the blame

2310
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,080
 on the man

2311
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,119
 chamberlain and give credit

2312
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:57,119
 to somebody like a churchill so what is the difference where's that line you've also

2313
01:55:57,119 --> 01:56:02,719
 written a book about henry kissinger who's an interesting sort of person that's been through

2314
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:04,080
 throughout many difficult

2315
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,000
 decisions in the games of power

2316
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,400
 so what does it take to be a great leader in that moment

2317
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,119
 that particular

2318
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:10,560
 moment sorry to keep talking

2319
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:11,520
 is fascinating

2320
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:15,599
 to me because it feels like it's man on man conversations

2321
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:19,360
 that define history well hitler was bluffing

2322
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:21,599
 he really wasn't ready for war in 1938

2323
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:25,599
 the german economy was clearly not ready for war in 1938

2324
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:29,800
 and and chamberlain made a fundamental

2325
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:37,280
 miscalculation along with his advisors because it wasn't all chamberlain he was in many ways articulating

2326
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:38,639
 the establishment

2327
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:39,520
 view

2328
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,320
 and i tried to show in a book called war of the world how that establishment

2329
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,000
 worked it extended

2330
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
 through the bbc into the aristocracy

2331
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,880
 to oxford there was an establishment view chamberlain personified it churchill was seen as a warmonger

2332
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:56,159
 he was at his lowest point of popularity in 1938

2333
01:56:56,159 --> 01:57:00,719
 but what is what is it that chamberlain gets wrong because it's conceptual

2334
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:01,280
 chamberlain

2335
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:01,920
 is persuaded

2336
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:06,719
 that britain has to play for time because britain is not ready for war in 1938.

2337
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,599
 he fails to see that the time that he gets

2338
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:13,360
 that he buys at munich is also available to hitler

2339
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,960
 everybody gets the time

2340
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:18,880
 and hitler's able to do much more with it because hitler strikes the pact with

2341
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,719
 with stalin

2342
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:25,760
 that guarantees that germany can fight a war on one front in 1939.

2343
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,639
 what does chamberlain do builds some more aircraft

2344
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:31,280
 so the great mistake of the strategy of appeasement

2345
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:32,639
 was to play for time

2346
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:35,760
 i mean they knew all was coming but they were playing for time not realizing

2347
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,960
 that

2348
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,040
 hitler got the time too

2349
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,920
 and after he partitioned czechoslovakia

2350
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:46,000
 he was in a much stronger position not least because of all the resources that

2351
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,800
 they were able to plunder

2352
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,719
 from czechoslovakia

2353
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:58,239
 so that was the conceptual mistake churchill played an heroic role in pointing out

2354
01:57:58,239 --> 01:58:03,920
 this mistake and predicting accurately that it would lead to war on worse terms

2355
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:09,599
 what does it take it takes a distinct courage

2356
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,199
 to be unpopular

2357
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:13,040
 and churchill was deeply unpopular

2358
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,119
 at that point people would listen to him

2359
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:16,400
 in the house of commons

2360
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,679
 in silence

2361
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:19,920
 on one occasion

2362
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:22,880
 lady astor shouted rubbish

2363
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:26,400
 so he went through a period of being hated on

2364
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:27,920
 the other thing that made churchill

2365
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:32,639
 a formidable leader was that he always applied history to the problem

2366
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:36,880
 and that's why he gets it right he he sees the historical

2367
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:39,760
 problem much more clearly than than chamberlain

2368
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,119
 so i think

2369
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:44,239
 if you go back to 1938

2370
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:47,920
 there's no realistic counterfactual in which churchill's in government in 1938

2371
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:51,760
 you have to france collapse for churchill to come into government

2372
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:54,239
 but you can certainly imagine

2373
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:57,199
 a tory elite

2374
01:58:57,199 --> 01:59:02,239
 that's thinking more clearly about the likely dynamics

2375
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:04,639
 they haven't seen this

2376
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,800
 i guess problem of conjecture to take a phrase from kissinger

2377
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:13,040
 which is that whatever they're doing in postponing

2378
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:20,000
 the war has the potential to create a worse starting point for the war

2379
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,760
 it would have been risky in 1938

2380
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,520
 but it was a way better situation than they ended up with in 1939

2381
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:27,119
 a year later

2382
01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:31,119
 you asked about kissinger and i've learnt a lot from reading kissinger

2383
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:35,440
 and talking to kissinger since i embarked on writing his biography

2384
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:38,000
 a great many years ago

2385
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,920
 i think one of the most important things i've learned

2386
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,360
 is that

2387
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:48,560
 you can apply history to contemporary problems it may be the most important

2388
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:52,639
 tool that we have in that kind of decision making

2389
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:58,560
 you have to do it quite ruthlessly and rigorously

2390
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:05,360
 and in the moment of crisis you have to take risk so

2391
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:06,880
 kissinger often says

2392
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,239
 in his early work

2393
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:12,080
 the temptation of the bureaucrat is to wait for more data

2394
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:18,320
 but ultimately the decision making that we do under uncertainty can't be based on data

2395
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:24,639
 the problem of conjecture is that you could take an action now and incur some cost

2396
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:27,199
 an avert disaster

2397
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:31,840
 but you'll get no thanks for it because nobody is grateful for an averted disaster

2398
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:38,000
 and nobody goes around saying wasn't it wonderful how we didn't have another 911

2399
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:40,639
 on the other hand you can do nothing

2400
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,920
 incur no upfront costs and hope for the best

2401
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,440
 and you might get lucky the disaster might not happen

2402
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:54,159
 that's in a democratic system the much easier path to take

2403
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:59,440
 and i think the the essence of leadership is to be ready

2404
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:05,280
 to take that upfront cost avert the disaster and accept that you won't get gratitude

2405
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,920
 if i may make a comment

2406
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:14,320
 an aside about henry kissinger so he i think at 98 years old currently

2407
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:17,599
 has still got it yeah he's brilliant

2408
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:19,679
 it's very very impressive i

2409
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:22,320
 can only hope that my brain has the same

2410
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,119
 durability

2411
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:27,520
 that his his does because it's a formidable intellect and it's still in

2412
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,960
 in as sharp form as it it was 50 years ago

2413
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,800
 so you mentioned eric schmidt's

2414
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,080
 in his book

2415
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:37,920
 they reached out to me didn't want to do this podcast

2416
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,040
 and i'm i'm

2417
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:43,040
 i know eric schmidt i've spoken to him before i like him a lot obviously

2418
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:46,080
 um so they said

2419
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:49,920
 we could do a podcast for 40 minutes with eric

2420
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,560
 40 minutes with eric and henry together

2421
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:57,920
 and 40 minutes with henry so those are three different conversations

2422
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:00,719
 and i had to like i had to do some soul searching

2423
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:04,800
 because i said fine 40 minutes with eric we'll probably talk many times again

2424
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,119
 fine let's talk about this ai book together for 40 minutes

2425
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:12,719
 but i said what i wrote to them said i would hate myself

2426
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:16,480
 if i only have 40 minutes to talk to henry kissinger

2427
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:19,760
 as i had to hold my ground went back and forth and in the end decided

2428
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:24,480
 to part ways over this and i sometimes think about this kind of

2429
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:27,199
 difficult decision

2430
02:02:27,199 --> 02:02:35,199
 um in the podcasting space of when do you walk away because

2431
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:38,800
 um there's a particular world leader

2432
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:43,920
 that i've mentioned in the past where the conversation is very likely to happen

2433
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,440
 and

2434
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,920
 as as it happens

2435
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:50,320
 those conversations can often be

2436
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:51,360
 you know unfortunately

2437
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:55,840
 this person only has 30 minutes now i know we agreed for three hours but unfortunately

2438
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,360
 and you have to decide

2439
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:59,599
 do i stand my ground on this

2440
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:03,119
 on this point i suppose that's the thing that journalists

2441
02:03:03,119 --> 02:03:07,040
 have to think about right like um

2442
02:03:08,239 --> 02:03:09,760
 do i hold on to my integrity

2443
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:13,520
 in whatever form that takes and do i stay in my ground even if i

2444
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:16,000
 lose a fascinating opportunity

2445
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,639
 anyway it's something i thought i thought about and

2446
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:21,040
 something i think about and with henry kissinger

2447
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,719
 i mean

2448
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:24,639
 he's had a million amazing conversations

2449
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:25,599
 in your biography

2450
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:28,480
 so it's not like something is lost but it was still nevertheless

2451
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:32,480
 to me some soul searching they had to do as a as a kind of practice

2452
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,000
 for

2453
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:40,000
 what to me is a higher stakes conversation i'll just mention is vladimir putin

2454
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,320
 i can have a conversation with him unlike any conversation he's ever had

2455
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:47,679
 partially because i'm a fluent russian speaker

2456
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:48,079
 partially

2457
02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:48,400
 because

2458
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:48,880
 i'm messed

2459
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:51,679
 up in the head in certain kind of ways that make for an interesting

2460
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:52,639
 dynamic

2461
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:57,040
 because we're both judo people we both are

2462
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:01,920
 certain kinds of human beings that can have a much deeper apolitical conversation

2463
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,840
 i have to ask to stay on the topic of leadership

2464
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:13,280
 you've in your book doom have talked about wars pandemics throughout human history

2465
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:20,159
 and in some sense saying that all of these disasters are man-made

2466
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:23,440
 so humans have a role in terms of the magnitude

2467
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:27,520
 of the effect that they have on human civilization

2468
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:33,199
 without taking cheap political shots can we talk about covid19

2469
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:34,560
 how will

2470
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:41,520
 history remember the coven 19 pandemic what were the successes with what were the failures

2471
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:43,280
 of leadership

2472
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:46,880
 of of man of humans

2473
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,960
 doom was a book

2474
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:50,320
 that i was

2475
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:52,320
 planning to write before

2476
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,159
 yes the pandemic struck

2477
02:04:54,159 --> 02:04:59,520
 as a history of of the future based in large measure on science fiction

2478
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,440
 it had occurred to me in 2019

2479
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:07,199
 that i had spent too long not reading science fiction and so i decided i would

2480
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:10,880
 liven up my my intake

2481
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:14,880
 by getting off history for a bit and reading science fiction

2482
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,400
 because history is great at telling you about the perennial problems of power

2483
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,719
 putin is always interesting on history

2484
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:25,599
 he's become something of a historian recently with his essays and lectures

2485
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,960
 but what history is bad at telling you is well what will the effects of this

2486
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:29,840
 discontinuity

2487
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,520
 of technology be

2488
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,199
 and so i thought i need some science fiction

2489
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:34,000
 to think more about

2490
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:34,320
 this

2491
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:34,800
 because i'm

2492
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,119
 i'm

2493
02:05:35,119 --> 02:05:35,599
 i'm

2494
02:05:35,599 --> 02:05:36,079
 tending

2495
02:05:36,079 --> 02:05:37,360
 to miss

2496
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:41,280
 the importance of technological discontinuity

2497
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:46,320
 if you read a lot of science fiction you read a lot of plague books because

2498
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:50,159
 science fiction writers are really quite fond of the plague scenario

2499
02:05:50,159 --> 02:05:53,440
 so the world ends in many ways in science fiction but one of the most popular

2500
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:54,560
 is the lethal pandemic

2501
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,760
 so when

2502
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,360
 when the first

2503
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:57,840
 email

2504
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:00,560
 came to me i think it was on january the third from my medical

2505
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:01,840
 friend justin stebing

2506
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,679
 funny pneumonia and wuhan

2507
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:04,800
 my antennae

2508
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:05,920
 began

2509
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:08,800
 to tingle because it was just like

2510
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:13,520
 one of those science fiction books that begins in just that way

2511
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:17,679
 in a pandemic

2512
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:22,960
 as larry brilliant the epidemiologist said many years ago the key

2513
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:28,560
 is early detection and early action that's how you deal with a novel pathogen

2514
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:31,760
 and almost no western country did that

2515
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,560
 we know it was doable because the time and ease and the south koreans

2516
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:35,280
 did it

2517
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,520
 and they did it very well

2518
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,440
 but really no western country got this right

2519
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:45,119
 some were unlucky because super spreader events happened earlier

2520
02:06:45,119 --> 02:06:48,400
 than in other countries italy was hit very hard very early

2521
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:53,360
 for other countries the real disaster came quite late russia which has only relatively

2522
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:57,199
 recently had a really bad experience

2523
02:06:57,199 --> 02:07:02,000
 the lesson for me is quite different from the one that most journalists

2524
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,239
 thought they were learning last year most journalists last year thought

2525
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:08,239
 trump is a terrible president

2526
02:07:08,239 --> 02:07:10,560
 he's saying a lot of crazy things

2527
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:14,960
 it's his fault that we have high excess mortality in the united states

2528
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:20,719
 the same argument was being made by journalists in britain boris johnson dot dot dot brazil

2529
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:24,400
 bolsonaro dot dot dot even india narendra modi

2530
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,800
 the same argument

2531
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,480
 and i think this argument

2532
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:35,040
 is wrong in a few ways it's true that the populist leaders said many crazy things

2533
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:40,560
 and broadly speaking gave poor guidance to their their populations

2534
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,440
 but i don't think it's true to say

2535
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:46,480
 that with different leaders these countries would have done significantly

2536
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:49,599
 better if joe biden had magically been president

2537
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:50,400
 a year earlier

2538
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:51,280
 i don't think the us

2539
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:52,000
 would have done much

2540
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,320
 better

2541
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:52,719
 because

2542
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:53,199
 the things

2543
02:07:53,199 --> 02:07:54,000
 that caused

2544
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,040
 excess mortality

2545
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:56,400
 last year weren't presidential

2546
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:56,960
 decisions

2547
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:58,079
 they were

2548
02:07:58,079 --> 02:08:02,880
 utter failure of cdc to provide testing that definitely wasn't trump's fault

2549
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:06,880
 scott gottlieb's book makes that very clear it's just been published recently

2550
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:12,480
 we utterly failed to use technology for contact tracing which the koreans did very well

2551
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:16,400
 we didn't really quarantine anybody seriously

2552
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,960
 there was no enforcement of quarantine

2553
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:20,400
 and we exposed the elderly

2554
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:21,040
 to the virus

2555
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:22,000
 as quickly as possible

2556
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:22,639
 in elderly

2557
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:23,360
 care homes

2558
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:24,239
 and

2559
02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:28,000
 these things have very little to do with presidential incompetence

2560
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,960
 so i think leadership

2561
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,400
 is of somewhat

2562
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:32,960
 marginal

2563
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:33,520
 importance

2564
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:37,119
 in a crisis like this because what you really need is your public health bureaucracy

2565
02:08:37,119 --> 02:08:40,480
 to get it right and very few western public health bureaucracies

2566
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,159
 got it right

2567
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:46,960
 could the president have given better leadership yes

2568
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:50,560
 his correct strategy however was

2569
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:55,040
 to learn from barack obama's playbook with the opioid epidemic

2570
02:08:55,040 --> 02:09:01,679
 the opioid epidemic killed as many people on obama's watch as covert did on trump's watch

2571
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:04,880
 and it was worse in the sense because it only happened in the u.s

2572
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:09,119
 and each year it killed more people than the year before over eight years

2573
02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:14,719
 nobody to my knowledge has ever seriously blamed obama for the opioid epidemic

2574
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:18,320
 trump's mistake was to put himself front and center of the response

2575
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,960
 to claim that he had some unique insight

2576
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:23,440
 into the pandemic and to say

2577
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:27,360
 with every passing week more and more foolish things until even

2578
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:28,239
 a significant

2579
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:30,639
 portion of people who'd voted for him in 2016

2580
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:34,000
 realized that he'd blown it which is why he lost the election

2581
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,760
 the correct strategy was actually to make mike pence

2582
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:40,800
 the pandemic tsar and get the hell out the way

2583
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:44,239
 that's what my advice to trump would have been in fact it was in february

2584
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:45,520
 of last year

2585
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:47,360
 so the mistake was

2586
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:49,760
 to to try to lead

2587
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:51,199
 but actually

2588
02:09:51,199 --> 02:09:52,560
 leadership in a pandemic's

2589
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:56,719
 almost a contradiction in terms what you really need is your public health bureaucracy

2590
02:09:56,719 --> 02:09:58,159
 not to fuck it up

2591
02:09:58,159 --> 02:09:59,119
 and they really

2592
02:09:59,119 --> 02:10:02,079
 really fucked it up and that was then all blamed on trump

2593
02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:02,560
 yes

2594
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:05,280
 you know jim fallows writes a piece in the atlantic that says

2595
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:07,679
 well being the president's like flying a light aircraft

2596
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:08,880
 it's pilot error

2597
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:09,280
 and i

2598
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:11,199
 i read that piece and i thought does he really

2599
02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:11,520
 after

2600
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,560
 all the years he's spent

2601
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:13,119
 writing

2602
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:16,000
 think that being president is like flying a light aircraft

2603
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:16,960
 i mean

2604
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,040
 it's really nothing like flying a light aircraft

2605
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:22,239
 being president is you sit on top of a vast bureaucracy

2606
02:10:22,239 --> 02:10:25,840
 with how many different agencies 60 70 we've all lost count

2607
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,599
 and you're surrounded by advisers

2608
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:30,480
 at least a quarter of whom are saying this is a disaster

2609
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:33,040
 we have to close the borders and the others are saying

2610
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:36,960
 no no we have to keep the economy going that's what you're running on in november

2611
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:41,840
 so being a president in a pandemic is a very unenviable position

2612
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:44,000
 because you actually can't

2613
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,119
 you can't really determine whether your public health bureaucracy

2614
02:10:47,119 --> 02:10:48,400
 will get it right or not

2615
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:50,480
 you don't think to push back on that

2616
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:54,159
 just like being churchill in a war is difficult

2617
02:10:54,159 --> 02:11:00,079
 so leaving trump abiding aside what i would love to see from a president is somebody

2618
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:08,079
 who makes great speeches and arouses the public to push the bureaucracy the public health bureaucracy

2619
02:11:08,079 --> 02:11:09,599
 to get their shit together

2620
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:10,239
 to fire

2621
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:12,239
 certain kinds of people to do i mean i'm

2622
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:12,560
 sorry

2623
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:14,000
 but i'm a big fan of

2624
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,040
 powerful speeches

2625
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:17,280
 especially in the modern age with the internet

2626
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:19,440
 it can really move people

2627
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:20,560
 instead

2628
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:23,119
 the lack of speeches

2629
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:27,440
 resulted in certain kinds of forces

2630
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:28,960
 amplifying division

2631
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:32,480
 over whether wear masks or not or all

2632
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:37,520
 it's like it's almost like the public pick some random topic over which to divide themselves

2633
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:42,400
 and there was like a complete indecision which is really what it was fear

2634
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:46,400
 of the of uncertainty materializing itself in some kind of division

2635
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:50,800
 and then you almost like busy yourself with the red versus blue politics

2636
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:54,159
 as opposed to some i don't know fdr type character

2637
02:11:54,159 --> 02:11:57,599
 just stands and say

2638
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:01,119
 fuck all this bullshit that we're hearing we're going to manufacture

2639
02:12:01,119 --> 02:12:02,480
 5 billion tests

2640
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:07,440
 this is what america is great at we're going to build the greatest testing infrastructure

2641
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:09,440
 ever built or

2642
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:10,400
 something

2643
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,320
 or even with the vaccine development

2644
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:15,119
 but that was what i was about to interject yes

2645
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:18,239
 in a pandemic the most important thing is the vaccine

2646
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:21,360
 if you get that right then you should be forgiven for much else

2647
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:23,119
 and that was the one thing the trump administration

2648
02:12:23,119 --> 02:12:25,599
 got right because

2649
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:33,199
 they went around the bureaucracy with operation warp speed and achieved a really major success

2650
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:39,520
 so i think the paradox of of the the 2020

2651
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:43,920
 story in the united states is that the one thing that mattered most the trump administration

2652
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,520
 got right

2653
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:48,880
 and it got so much else wrong that was sort of marginal

2654
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:50,800
 that we were left with the impression

2655
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:56,320
 that trump had been to blame for the whole disaster which wasn't really quite right

2656
02:12:56,320 --> 02:13:00,000
 sure it would have been great if we did operation warp speed for testing

2657
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,800
 but ultimately vaccines are more important than tests and

2658
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:09,199
 this brings me to the question that that you raised there of polarization

2659
02:13:09,199 --> 02:13:11,599
 and why that happened

2660
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:12,320
 now

2661
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,560
 in a book called the square in the tower i argued

2662
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,000
 that it would be very costly

2663
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,040
 for the united states

2664
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:18,159
 to allow

2665
02:13:18,159 --> 02:13:19,760
 the public sphere to continue

2666
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:20,560
 to be dominated

2667
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:22,320
 by a handful of big tech companies

2668
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:23,119
 that this ultimately

2669
02:13:23,119 --> 02:13:24,000
 would have

2670
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,079
 more adverse effects than simply

2671
02:13:26,079 --> 02:13:28,960
 contested elections and i think we saw

2672
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:34,560
 over the past 18 months just how bad this could be because

2673
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:37,119
 the odd thing about this

2674
02:13:37,119 --> 02:13:42,159
 country is that we came up with vaccines with 90 plus percent efficacy

2675
02:13:42,159 --> 02:13:47,199
 and about 20 of people refuse to get them and still do refuse

2676
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:52,239
 for reasons that seem best explained

2677
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:53,599
 in terms of the anti-vaxx

2678
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:58,480
 network which has been embedded on the internet for a long time predating the pandemic

2679
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:02,320
 reni diresta wrote about this pre-2020

2680
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,679
 and this this anti-vax

2681
02:14:03,679 --> 02:14:08,079
 network has turned out to kill maybe 200 000 americans who could have been vaccinated

2682
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:09,520
 but were persuaded

2683
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:12,960
 through magical thinking that the vaccine was riskier

2684
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,119
 than the virus whereas

2685
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:16,880
 you don't need to be in epidemiology

2686
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:19,520
 you don't need to be a medical scientist to know that the virus

2687
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:21,119
 is about two orders of magnitude

2688
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:21,760
 riskier

2689
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:23,840
 than the vaccine

2690
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:27,119
 so again leadership

2691
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:33,440
 could definitely have been better but the politicization of everything

2692
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:36,239
 was not trump's doing alone it

2693
02:14:36,239 --> 02:14:37,599
 happened because

2694
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:43,840
 our public sphere has been dominated by a handful of platforms whose business model

2695
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:46,000
 inherently promotes polarization

2696
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,599
 inherently promotes

2697
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:50,560
 fake news and extreme views because those are the things that get

2698
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:51,280
 the eyeballs

2699
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:52,960
 on the screens and sell the ads

2700
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,960
 i mean this is now a common place

2701
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:59,840
 but when one thinks about the cost of allowing this

2702
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:04,000
 kind of thing to happen it's now a very high human cost

2703
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,880
 and we were foolish to leave uncorrected

2704
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:12,639
 these structural problems in the public sphere that were already very clearly visible in 2016.

2705
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:15,199
 and he described that

2706
02:15:15,199 --> 02:15:20,000
 like you mentioned that there's these networks they're almost like laying dormant

2707
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,280
 waiting

2708
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:25,199
 for their time in the sun and they stepped forward in this case

2709
02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:27,119
 and that those network effects

2710
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:28,960
 just

2711
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:32,480
 the service catalyst for whatever

2712
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,320
 the bad parts of human nature

2713
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:36,960
 i do hope that there's kinds of networks that emphasize

2714
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,639
 the the better angels of our nature to to to quote steven pinker

2715
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:41,840
 it's just

2716
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:42,639
 clearly

2717
02:15:42,639 --> 02:15:44,960
 and we know this from all the revelations

2718
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:46,320
 of the facebook whistleblower

2719
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:49,599
 there is clearly a very clear tension

2720
02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:54,079
 between the business model of a company like facebook

2721
02:15:54,079 --> 02:15:56,159
 and the public good

2722
02:15:56,159 --> 02:16:01,840
 and they know that i just talked to the founder of instagram i i yes that's

2723
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:05,920
 the case but it's not from a technology perspective

2724
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:06,719
 like absolutely

2725
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:09,760
 true of any kind of social network i think it's possible to build

2726
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:10,960
 actually i think it's

2727
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:13,040
 not just possible i think it's pretty

2728
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:16,800
 easy if you set that as the goal to build social networks

2729
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:20,560
 that don't have these negative effects

2730
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:26,000
 right but if the business model is we sell ads

2731
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,079
 and the way you sell ads is to maximize user engagement

2732
02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:31,040
 then the algorithm

2733
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:32,000
 is biased in favor

2734
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:32,959
 of fake news and extreme

2735
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:35,280
 views but it's not it's so it's not the ads a lot of people

2736
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:35,599
 blame

2737
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:37,519
 the ads

2738
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:38,638
 the

2739
02:16:38,638 --> 02:16:40,240
 the problem i think is the engagement

2740
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:43,760
 and the engagement is just the easiest the dumbest way to solve the ads

2741
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:45,439
 i think there's much different

2742
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:49,679
 metrics that could be used to make a lot more money than the engagement

2743
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:54,558
 in the long term it has more to do with planning for the long term so

2744
02:16:54,558 --> 02:16:57,439
 optimizing the selling of ads

2745
02:16:57,439 --> 02:16:59,840
 to make people happy

2746
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:02,398
 with themselves in the long term

2747
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:05,359
 as opposed to some kind of addicted

2748
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:07,200
 like dopamine feeling

2749
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:08,318
 and so that's

2750
02:17:08,318 --> 02:17:12,080
 to me that has to do with metrics and measuring things correctly and sort of

2751
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:15,040
 also creating a culture with what's valued

2752
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:16,558
 to have difficult conversation

2753
02:17:16,558 --> 02:17:18,318
 about what we're doing with society

2754
02:17:18,318 --> 02:17:21,760
 all those kinds of things and i i think once you have those conversations

2755
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:24,638
 this takes us back to the university of austin kind of

2756
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:26,959
 once you have those difficult human conversations

2757
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:30,000
 you can design the technology that will actually make

2758
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,120
 for

2759
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:32,398
 help people grow

2760
02:17:32,398 --> 02:17:36,879
 become the best version of themselves help them be happy in the long term

2761
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:41,679
 what gives you hope about the future

2762
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:48,558
 as somebody who studied some of the darker moments of human history what gives you hope

2763
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:51,840
 a couple of things

2764
02:17:52,478 --> 02:17:59,840
 first of all the united states has a very unique operating system

2765
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:01,359
 which was very well designed

2766
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:04,160
 by the founders who thought a lot about history and and

2767
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:06,558
 realized it would take quite a

2768
02:18:06,558 --> 02:18:07,760
 a novel design

2769
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:09,280
 to prevent the republic

2770
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,718
 going the way of all republics

2771
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:11,439
 because republics

2772
02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:14,799
 tend to end up as tyrannies for reasons that were well established

2773
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:16,799
 by the time of the renaissance

2774
02:18:16,799 --> 02:18:20,558
 and it gives me hope that this design has worked very well

2775
02:18:20,558 --> 02:18:24,718
 and with student enormous stress test stress test in the last

2776
02:18:24,718 --> 02:18:28,799
 in the last year i became an american in 2018

2777
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:30,398
 i think

2778
02:18:30,398 --> 02:18:32,160
 one of the most important

2779
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:38,718
 features of this operating system is that it is the magnet for talent

2780
02:18:38,718 --> 02:18:41,920
 here we sit

2781
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:45,599
 part of the immigration story

2782
02:18:45,599 --> 02:18:52,080
 in you know in a darkened room with funny accents talking to russians

2783
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:57,840
 walk into a recording studio and talk about america it's it's very much like a joke

2784
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:01,760
 and elon's a south african and so on and thiel is a german and we're

2785
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:07,040
 we're extraordinarily fortunate that the natives let us come and play

2786
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:11,840
 and and play in a way that we could not in our countries of birth

2787
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:14,240
 and as long as the united states continues

2788
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:18,718
 to exploit that superpower that it is the talent magnet

2789
02:19:18,718 --> 02:19:22,879
 then it should out innovate the totalitarian competition

2790
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:25,840
 every time so that's

2791
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:30,318
 that's one reason for being an optimist

2792
02:19:30,318 --> 02:19:35,519
 another reason and it's quite a historical reason as you would expect from me

2793
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:37,760
 another reason that i'm

2794
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,040
 optimistic

2795
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:40,478
 is

2796
02:19:40,478 --> 02:19:43,280
 that my kids

2797
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:48,640
 give me a great deal of hope they range in age from 27 down to four

2798
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:52,800
 but each of them in their different way

2799
02:19:52,800 --> 02:20:03,600
 seems to be finding a way through this crazy time of ours without losing contact with

2800
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:06,560
 that culture and civilization

2801
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:11,840
 that i hold dear i don't want to live in the metaverse as mark zuckerberg

2802
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:15,760
 imagines it to me that's a kind of ghastly hell

2803
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:20,880
 i think western civilization is the best civilization

2804
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:27,439
 and i think that almost all the truths about the human condition can be found

2805
02:20:27,439 --> 02:20:30,640
 in western literature

2806
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:34,240
 art and music

2807
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:38,960
 and i think also that the the civilization that produced the scientific revolution

2808
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:42,479
 has produced the great problem-solving

2809
02:20:42,479 --> 02:20:48,880
 tool that eluded the other civilizations that never really cracked science

2810
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:51,439
 and what gives me hope is that despite

2811
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:52,560
 all the temptations

2812
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:53,439
 and distractions

2813
02:20:53,439 --> 02:20:54,680
 that their generation

2814
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:55,840
 [music]

2815
02:20:55,840 --> 02:21:01,920
 had to contend with my children in their different ways have found the found their way

2816
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:05,520
 to literature and to art and to music

2817
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:09,120
 and and they are civilized

2818
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:12,800
 and i i don't i don't claim

2819
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:16,640
 much of the credit for that i've done my best but i think it's

2820
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:18,640
 deeply encouraging that

2821
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:22,800
 that that they found their way to the things that i think

2822
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:30,080
 are indispensable for a happy life a fulfilled life nobody i think can be truly fulfilled

2823
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:35,280
 if they're cut off from the great body of western literature for example i've thought

2824
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:36,960
 a lot about

2825
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:41,520
 elon's argument that we might be in a simulation

2826
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:44,800
 no no there is a simulation it's cold literature

2827
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:49,040
 and we just have to decide whether or not to enter it

2828
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:56,200
 i'm currently in the midst of the later stages of of proust's great

2829
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:58,800
 allah and

2830
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:05,520
 observation of human relationships is perhaps more meticulous than that of any other writer

2831
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:08,399
 and it's impossible not to find yourself

2832
02:22:08,399 --> 02:22:17,200
 identifying with marcel and his obsessive jealous relationships particularly with alberti

2833
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:20,960
 it's the simulation and you you decide i think

2834
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:26,880
 as a sentient being how far to in your own life

2835
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:29,520
 reenact these more profound

2836
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:34,240
 experiences that others have written down one of my earliest literary simulations

2837
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:38,720
 was to reenact jack kerouac tripping on the road when i was 17

2838
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:42,240
 culminating and getting very wasted in the hanging gardens of zochimilco

2839
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:46,240
 not to be not to be missed and

2840
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:48,720
 it hit me just just as i was reading proof

2841
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:49,520
 that's really

2842
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:51,040
 how to live a rich life

2843
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:53,680
 that one lives life but one lives it

2844
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:56,240
 juxtaposing one's own experience

2845
02:22:56,240 --> 02:23:00,319
 against the more refined experiences of the great the great writers

2846
02:23:00,319 --> 02:23:04,319
 so it gives me hope that my children do that a bit

2847
02:23:04,319 --> 02:23:10,240
 do you include the the russian authors very much in the canon

2848
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:11,520
 yes i don't read russian

2849
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:12,800
 um

2850
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:17,040
 but i was entirely obsessed with russian literature as a schoolboy

2851
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:19,760
 i read my way through dostoyevsky

2852
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:25,200
 tolstoy turganyev i check off i think

2853
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:27,439
 um

2854
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:29,840
 of all of those writers

2855
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:30,399
 tolstoy

2856
02:23:30,399 --> 02:23:31,520
 had the biggest impact

2857
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:35,200
 because at the end of war and peace there's this great essay on historical

2858
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:35,920
 determinism

2859
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:39,840
 which i think was the reason i became a historian

2860
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:46,800
 but i'm i'm really temperamentally a kind of togenyev person

2861
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:48,000
 oddly enough

2862
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,880
 i i think if you if you haven't read those novelists

2863
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:52,319
 i mean you can't really

2864
02:23:52,319 --> 02:23:55,760
 be a complete human being if you haven't

2865
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:59,600
 if you haven't read the brothers karamazov you will not really

2866
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:01,040
 you're not grown up

2867
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:04,720
 and so i think i think in many ways those are the greatest

2868
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:12,080
 the greatest novels raskolnikov's remember raskolnikov's nightmare at the end of crime and punishment

2869
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:14,240
 in which he imagines

2870
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:16,240
 in his dream a world

2871
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:19,200
 in which a terrible virus spreads

2872
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:24,560
 do you remember this and this virus has the effect of making every individual think

2873
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:27,520
 that what he believes is right

2874
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:30,560
 and in this

2875
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:32,960
 self-righteousness

2876
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:36,720
 people fall on one another and commit appalling violence

2877
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:44,000
 that's raskolnikov's nightmare and it's a prophecy it's a terrible prophecy of of russia's future

2878
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:45,760
 yeah it's

2879
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:50,000
 and coupled with that is probably the i also like the french the existentialist

2880
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,600
 all that that the full

2881
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:52,319
 spectrum

2882
02:24:52,319 --> 02:24:55,600
 and germans hermann has said and just that

2883
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:59,439
 range of human thought has expressed the literature it's fascinating i really

2884
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:01,040
 love your idea that

2885
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:04,000
 the simulation

2886
02:25:04,479 --> 02:25:06,000
 like

2887
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
 one way to to live life is to kind of

2888
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:14,160
 explore these other worlds and borrow from them yes

2889
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:14,880
 wisdom

2890
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:16,240
 that you then just

2891
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:18,560
 map onto your own lives you almost like

2892
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:22,240
 stitched together your life with these kind of pieces from literature

2893
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:23,439
 the highly educated

2894
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:24,960
 person is constantly

2895
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:26,080
 struck

2896
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:28,319
 by illusion

2897
02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:33,680
 everything is an allusion to something that one has read and that

2898
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:36,479
 is the simulation that's what

2899
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:41,920
 the real metaverse is it's the imaginary world that we enter when we read

2900
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:45,760
 empathize and then recognize in our daily lives

2901
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,880
 some scrap of the shared experience that literature gives us

2902
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:57,120
 yeah i think i've aspired to be the idiot from prince mishkin from dostoevsky

2903
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:01,760
 and in aspiring to be that i have become

2904
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:05,120
 the idiot i feel at least in part

2905
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:06,640
 um

2906
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:09,439
 what you mentioned the human condition

2907
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:19,240
 does love have to do what role does it play in the human condition friendship love

2908
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:25,680
 love is the drug

2909
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:32,479
 kind is this was a great roxy music line

2910
02:26:32,479 --> 02:26:36,160
 that brian ferry wrote and love is

2911
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:41,120
 the most powerful and and dangerous of all the drugs

2912
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:43,680
 the um

2913
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:49,680
 the driving force that overrides our reason

2914
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:58,560
 and of course it is the it is the primal it's the primal urge so

2915
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:05,520
 what a civilized society has to do is to prevent that drug that primal force from

2916
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:09,840
 creating mayhem so there have to be rules

2917
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:11,359
 like monogamy

2918
02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:12,560
 and

2919
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:20,160
 rituals like like marriage that that reign love in and make the the addicts

2920
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:21,680
 at least

2921
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:23,200
 more or less

2922
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:30,319
 under control and i i think that's that's part of why i'm i'm a romantic

2923
02:27:30,319 --> 02:27:34,080
 rather than a you know steve pinker

2924
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:42,960
 enlightenment rationalist because the romantics realized that that love was the drug it's like

2925
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:45,600
 the difference in sensibility

2926
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,280
 between

2927
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:49,439
 handel and wagner

2928
02:27:49,439 --> 02:27:55,280
 and i i had a vagnerian phase when i was an undergraduate i still remember thinking

2929
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:58,240
 that in in

2930
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:00,240
 as old as libra's toad

2931
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:05,040
 that wagner had got the closest to sex that anybody had ever got

2932
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:09,200
 in in music or perhaps to love

2933
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:14,240
 i'm i'm lucky that i love my wife and that

2934
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:21,760
 that we were by the time we met you know smart enough to understand

2935
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:25,840
 that that love is a drug that you have to kind of take

2936
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:29,280
 in in in certain careful ways

2937
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:36,399
 and that it works best in the context of a of a stable family

2938
02:28:36,399 --> 02:28:39,600
 that's that's the key thing that one has to sort of

2939
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:42,720
 take the drug and then submit to the

2940
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:49,439
 the the conventions of of of marriage and family life i

2941
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:52,399
 i think in that respect

2942
02:28:52,399 --> 02:28:55,280
 i'm a kind of tamed romantic

2943
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,560
 contain romantic

2944
02:28:56,560 --> 02:28:58,479
 that's how i would like to think about it and that's the degree

2945
02:28:58,479 --> 02:28:59,120
 to which

2946
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:00,160
 your romanticism

2947
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:00,960
 is tamed

2948
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:02,960
 can be then channeled into productive

2949
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:04,479
 work that's why you're a historian

2950
02:29:04,479 --> 02:29:05,439
 and a writer

2951
02:29:05,439 --> 02:29:07,120
 is the breast is that love is channeled

2952
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:07,920
 through the writing

2953
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:09,040
 so if you're going to be addicted

2954
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:09,600
 to anything

2955
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:10,240
 be addicted

2956
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:12,160
 to work

2957
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:15,600
 i mean we're all addictive but yeah the thing about workaholism

2958
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:18,000
 is that it is the most productive addiction

2959
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,680
 and

2960
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:21,760
 and rather that than

2961
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:27,040
 drugs or booze so i i'm i'm yes i'm always trying to channel my anxieties

2962
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:28,720
 in into work

2963
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:32,800
 i learnt that at a relatively early age it's a sort of massively

2964
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:36,479
 productive way of coping with the inner demons

2965
02:29:36,479 --> 02:29:40,800
 and again we should teach kids that because

2966
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:43,600
 let's come back to our earlier conversation about universities

2967
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:45,040
 part of what happens at university

2968
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,560
 is that adolescents

2969
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:52,720
 have to overcome all the inner demons and these include deep insecurity

2970
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,520
 about one's appearance about one's intellect

2971
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:56,479
 and then

2972
02:29:56,479 --> 02:29:58,160
 madly raging hormones

2973
02:29:58,160 --> 02:30:01,200
 that cause you to behave like a complete fool with

2974
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:05,520
 the people to whom you're sexually attracted all of this is going on in the university

2975
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:10,479
 how can it be a safe space it's a completely dangerous space by definition

2976
02:30:10,479 --> 02:30:16,240
 yeah so so yeah teaching young people how to manage these storms

2977
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:16,800
 you know

2978
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:18,880
 that's part of the job and and we've

2979
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,640
 we're really not allowed to do that anymore

2980
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:22,880
 because we can't talk about these things for fear of the title

2981
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:23,200
 nine

2982
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:23,600
 officers

2983
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:23,920
 kicking

2984
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:24,560
 down the door

2985
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:25,200
 and dragging

2986
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,800
 us off in chains

2987
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:31,600
 and like you said hard work and something you call work ethic

2988
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:33,280
 in civilization

2989
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:33,600
 is

2990
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:38,240
 um is a pretty is a pretty effective way to

2991
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:42,240
 achieve i think a kind of happiness in a world that's full of anxiety

2992
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:46,560
 or at least exhaustion so sleep well

2993
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:52,479
 well there is there's a beauty to the exhaustion too that's why running this manual work

2994
02:30:52,479 --> 02:30:57,600
 that some some part of us is built for that right i mean we are

2995
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:00,479
 products of of evolution and

2996
02:31:00,479 --> 02:31:05,760
 our adaptation to a technological world is a very imperfect one so

2997
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:10,960
 hence the kind of masochistic urge to to run

2998
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:12,640
 i i'd like

2999
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:16,160
 outdoor exercise i don't really like gyms

3000
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:19,200
 so i'll go for long punishing

3001
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:22,319
 runs in in woodland

3002
02:31:22,319 --> 02:31:27,760
 hike up hills i like swimming in lakes and in the sea

3003
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:31,920
 because there just has to be that physical

3004
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:36,319
 activity in order to do the good mental work and so

3005
02:31:36,319 --> 02:31:39,840
 it's all about trying to do the best work

3006
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:43,680
 that's my sense that we we have

3007
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:48,399
 some random allocation of talent you kind of figure out what it is that you're relatively

3008
02:31:48,399 --> 02:31:49,680
 good at and you

3009
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:52,640
 try to do that well i think my father

3010
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:55,040
 encouraged me to think that way

3011
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:55,760
 and

3012
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:58,399
 you don't mind about being average at the other stuff

3013
02:31:58,399 --> 02:31:58,720
 the

3014
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,359
 kind of sick

3015
02:31:59,359 --> 02:32:00,560
 thing is to try to be brilliant

3016
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:01,200
 to everything

3017
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:02,640
 i hate those people

3018
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:06,080
 you should really not worry too much if you're just

3019
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:10,960
 an average double bass player which i am or kind of average skier which i definitely

3020
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:12,160
 am

3021
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:17,439
 doing those things okay is is part of leading a rich and fulfilling life

3022
02:32:17,439 --> 02:32:20,720
 i was not a good actor but i got a lot out of

3023
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,720
 acting as an undergraduate

3024
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:25,200
 turned out after three years of experimentation

3025
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:26,720
 oxford that i was

3026
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:29,120
 broadly speaking better at writing

3027
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:31,840
 history essays than

3028
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:32,800
 my peers

3029
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:35,200
 and that was my edge that was my comparative

3030
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:35,680
 advantage

3031
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:37,760
 and so i've just tried to make a living

3032
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:38,319
 from

3033
02:32:38,319 --> 02:32:40,160
 from that slight edge

3034
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:41,040
 yeah

3035
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:44,560
 that's a beautiful way to describe a life

3036
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:46,319
 is there a meaning to this thing

3037
02:32:46,319 --> 02:32:49,760
 is there a meaning to life what is the meaning of life

3038
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:52,319
 i was brought up by a physicist

3039
02:32:52,319 --> 02:32:54,240
 and a physician

3040
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:59,280
 they were more or less committed atheists who had left the church of scotland

3041
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:03,280
 as a protest against sectarianism in glasgow

3042
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:06,479
 and so my sister and i were told from an early age life was a cosmic

3043
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:08,880
 accident

3044
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:15,200
 and that was it there was no great meaning to it

3045
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:19,760
 and i i can't really get past that

3046
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:21,280
 isn't there beauty

3047
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:24,319
 to being an accident at a cosmic scale

3048
02:33:24,319 --> 02:33:29,120
 yes i wasn't taught to to feel negative about that and if anything

3049
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:31,040
 it was a frivolous

3050
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:35,280
 a frivolous insight the whole thing was a kind of joke

3051
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:38,800
 um and and i think that

3052
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:44,720
 atheism isn't really a basis for ordering a society but it's it's

3053
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:46,560
 been all right for me

3054
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:51,359
 i don't have a kind of sense of of a missing religious

3055
02:33:51,359 --> 02:33:53,439
 faith

3056
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:59,600
 for me however there's clearly some embedded

3057
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:08,319
 christian ethics in the way my parents lived and so we were kind of atheist calvinists

3058
02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:10,240
 who had kind of deposed

3059
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:12,800
 god but carried on behaving as if we were members of the elect

3060
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:14,240
 in in a moral universe

3061
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:15,200
 so

3062
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:16,240
 that's kind of

3063
02:34:16,240 --> 02:34:25,520
 um the state of mind that i was left in and i i think that

3064
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:32,880
 we aren't really around long enough to claim that our individual lives have meaning

3065
02:34:32,880 --> 02:34:34,000
 but what

3066
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,560
 edmund burke said is true the real social contract is between the generations

3067
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:40,960
 between the dead the living and the unborn

3068
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:43,520
 and the meaning of life is

3069
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:45,680
 for me at least

3070
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:48,160
 to live in a way that honors the dead

3071
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:53,680
 seeks to learn from their accumulated wisdom because they do still outnumber us they outnumber the

3072
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:56,880
 the living by quite a significant margin and then

3073
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:59,760
 to be mindful of the unborn and our

3074
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:00,520
 our

3075
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:02,399
 responsibility

3076
02:35:02,399 --> 02:35:07,600
 to them writing books is a way of communicating with the unborn

3077
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:09,120
 it may or may not succeed

3078
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:13,120
 and probably won't succeed if my books are never assigned by work professors

3079
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:14,399
 in the future

3080
02:35:14,399 --> 02:35:18,319
 so what we have to do is more than just write books and record podcasts

3081
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:20,399
 there have to be institutions

3082
02:35:20,399 --> 02:35:23,840
 i'm 57 now i realized recently

3083
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:29,920
 that succession planning had to be the main focus of the next 20 years because

3084
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:33,840
 there are things that i really care about

3085
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:37,920
 that i want future generations to have access to

3086
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:45,920
 and so the meaning of life i do regard as being intergenerational transfer of wisdom

3087
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:50,319
 ultimately the species will go extinct at some point

3088
02:35:50,319 --> 02:35:53,760
 even if we do colonize mars one senses that

3089
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:59,680
 physics will catch up with this particular organism but it's in the pretty far distant future

3090
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:00,319
 and so

3091
02:36:00,319 --> 02:36:01,920
 the meaning of life is to make sure that

3092
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:03,359
 for as long as there are

3093
02:36:03,359 --> 02:36:04,880
 human beings

3094
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:11,040
 they are able to live the kind of fulfilled lives

3095
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:14,240
 ethically fulfilled intellectually fulfilled

3096
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:19,040
 emotionally fulfilled lives that civilization has made possible

3097
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:22,160
 it would be easy for us to revert

3098
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:27,840
 to the uncivilized world there's a fantastic book

3099
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:34,080
 that i'm going to misremember milos is the captive soul the captive mind rather

3100
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:41,520
 which has a fantastic passage here he was a polish

3101
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:46,080
 intellectual who says americans can never imagine what it's like

3102
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:49,200
 for civilization to be completely destroyed

3103
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:50,319
 as it was in poland

3104
02:36:50,319 --> 02:36:52,479
 at the end of by the end of world war ii

3105
02:36:52,479 --> 02:36:52,960
 to have

3106
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:53,280
 no

3107
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:54,160
 rule of law

3108
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:55,359
 to have no security

3109
02:36:55,359 --> 02:36:55,840
 of

3110
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:58,080
 even person never mind property rights

3111
02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:02,880
 they can't imagine what that's like and what it will lead you to do

3112
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:08,000
 so one reason for teaching history is to remind the lucky

3113
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:13,760
 generation z members of california that

3114
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,479
 that civilization is a thin film and it can be destroyed remarkably easily

3115
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:22,160
 and to preserve civilization is a tremendous

3116
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:25,680
 responsibility that we have it's a huge responsibility

3117
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:28,240
 and we must we must not destroy ourselves

3118
02:37:28,240 --> 02:37:30,880
 whether it's in the name of of wokism

3119
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:33,600
 or the pursuit of the metaverse

3120
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,880
 preserving civilization

3121
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:39,040
 and making it available not just to our kids but to people we'll never know

3122
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:42,720
 generations ahead that's the meaning

3123
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:44,000
 and

3124
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,960
 do so by studying the lessons of history

3125
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:50,479
 right not only studying them but then acting on them

3126
02:37:50,479 --> 02:37:55,040
 for me the biggest problem is how do we apply history more effectively

3127
02:37:55,040 --> 02:38:01,520
 it seems as if our institutions including government are very very bad at applying history

3128
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:04,319
 lessons of history are learnt poorly if at all

3129
02:38:04,319 --> 02:38:04,960
 analogies

3130
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:06,080
 are drawn crudely

3131
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:08,399
 often the wrong inferences are drawn

3132
02:38:08,399 --> 02:38:12,840
 one of the big intellectual challenges for me is how to make history more

3133
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:13,920
 useful

3134
02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:15,680
 and this was the kind of thing that

3135
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:19,600
 professors used to hate but really practically useful so that

3136
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:20,399
 policymakers

3137
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:21,680
 and citizens

3138
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:27,200
 can think about the decisions that they face with a more historically informed

3139
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:28,880
 body of knowledge

3140
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:33,359
 whether it's a pandemic the challenge of climate change what to do about taiwan

3141
02:38:33,359 --> 02:38:36,880
 i can't think of a better set of

3142
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:38,640
 of things to know

3143
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:41,439
 before you make decisions about those things than

3144
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:41,840
 the the

3145
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:44,880
 things that history has to offer well i love the discipline of applied

3146
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:45,359
 history

3147
02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:45,840
 basically

3148
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:46,640
 going to history

3149
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:47,680
 and saying

3150
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:48,560
 what

3151
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:49,920
 are the

3152
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:51,280
 key principles

3153
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:52,800
 here that are applicable

3154
02:38:52,800 --> 02:38:54,319
 to the problems of today

3155
02:38:54,319 --> 02:38:59,200
 right and how can we solve that great philosopher of history r.g collingwood

3156
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:02,800
 said in his autobiography which was published in 1939

3157
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:07,040
 that the purpose of history was to reconstitute

3158
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:14,560
 past thought from whatever surviving remnants there were and then to juxtapose it

3159
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:17,600
 with our own predicament and that's that juxtaposition

3160
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:21,280
 of past experience with present experience that is so important

3161
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:23,520
 we don't do that well

3162
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,359
 and indeed we've we've flipped

3163
02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:26,960
 it so that academic historians

3164
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:29,520
 now think their mission is to travel back

3165
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:32,960
 to the past with the value system of 2021

3166
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:35,280
 and castigate

3167
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:38,640
 the the dead for their racism and sexism and transphobia

3168
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:39,920
 and whatnot

3169
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:42,000
 and that's exactly wrong

3170
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,760
 our mission is to go back and try to understand

3171
02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:46,479
 what it was like to live in the 18th century

3172
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:49,200
 not to go back and condescend to the

3173
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:50,560
 the people of the past

3174
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:51,840
 and once we've had a

3175
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:56,399
 better understanding once we've seen into their lives read their words tried to reconstitute

3176
02:39:56,399 --> 02:39:58,240
 their experience to come back

3177
02:39:58,240 --> 02:40:00,240
 and understand our own time better

3178
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:04,000
 that's what we should really be doing but academic history has gone completely haywire

3179
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:07,520
 and it does almost the exact opposite of what i think it should do

3180
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:09,840
 and by studying history

3181
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:11,200
 walk beautifully

3182
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:13,120
 gracefully through the simulation

3183
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:17,680
 as you described by mapping the lessons of history into the world of today

3184
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:22,960
 we have virtual reality already in our heads we do not need oculus

3185
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:24,399
 in the metaverse

3186
02:40:24,399 --> 02:40:27,040
 this was an incredible hopeful conversation

3187
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:30,560
 in in many ways that did not expect i thought our conversation

3188
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:33,040
