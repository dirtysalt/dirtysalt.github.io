1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,250
My name's Gary Stevenson.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,620
In 2011, I was Citibank's

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,330
most profitable trader in the world.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,160
This is everything I'm authorized

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,440
to tell you about being a trader for one

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,890
of the world's biggest banks.

7
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,224
You become the best trader in the world

8
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:15,600
for one of the biggest banks in the world,

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,920
and then somebody sits you down

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,443
and threatens you basically like a gangster.

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,300
It kind of makes you realize

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,423
that they're the same f---ing people.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,440
When I started working,

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,320
it was this kind of a bit of a mad environment.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
I'm always reminded of,

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,690
you know when you hear footballers talk about like

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,980
footballers from like the '90s

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,960
and the 2000s talking about when they came through,

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,450
and the stupid, like, hazing rituals and stuff?

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,080
On my first week, they made me buy like 100 burgers

21
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,550
and carry them up and like give them around the

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,990
trading floor, this kind of thing.

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,150
There was a lot of that kind of nonsense going on,

24
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,210
and there was a lot of people getting taken out

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,010
to expensive restaurants and clubs

26
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,060
and taken out to holidays.

27
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,310
I got taken to Vegas when I was 21.

28
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,450
Before, I went to Jay-Z's after-party in LA,

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,460
and then I went to Carmen Electra's birthday party.

30
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,230
I hadn't even started working full time.

31
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,360
And one of the nights, I can't even remember,

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,090
it must've been like $20,000 or $30,000 one night,

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,160
you know, Vegas club.

34
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,720
To me, it was really weird because, you know,

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,980
I come from a very poor background,

36
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,570
and I was in a VIP table in LA

37
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,960
with a bunch of, like, 35-year-olds who were paying girls

38
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,430
who looked just like the girls I used to hang out

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,720
with at uni to hang out with them.

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,553
You know what I mean?

41
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:33,810
My specific desk started

42
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,723
to make enormous amounts of money, which was like,

43
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,240
it was really crazy for me.

44
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,390
I was super young.

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,600
Some of the guys I was working with,

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,190
like pretty crazy guys,

47
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,560
and they started getting like really big for their boots.

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,570
And one of the guys immediately got

49
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,260
one of the secretaries pregnant, like within a week.

50
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,640
What it meant was the amount

51
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,720
of money we were getting paid just

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,210
for sitting in our seats went up a lot,

53
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,040
which meant that you could afford to lose a lot

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
of money without it appearing

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,850
like you were losing a lot of money.

56
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,683
So, for example,

57
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:06,510
if you're making 100 grand a day for the bank just

58
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,039
for sitting in your seat,

59
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,340
you can afford to lose 100 grand down on bad bets

60
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,890
and not actually be officially losing money.

61
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,050
Obviously, I know now that there's

62
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,660
like this massive stereotype that traders take cocaine.

63
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,910
So I was expelled from school for selling 3 pounds' worth

64
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,580
of cannabis when I just turned 16,

65
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,440
and I was like, that's it.

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,273
No more drugs.

67
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,106
I'm off drugs.

68
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,170
No more drugs ever again.

69
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,420
So I've never taken cocaine in my life,

70
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,080
and, you know, I turn up in the place,

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,420
everyone's like going out partying till like 2 a.m.,

72
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,550
3 a.m., and getting to work at 5 in the morning.

73
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,517
And I was like, how the f--- do these guys do it?

74
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:41,340
You know, they're older than me as well.

75
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,173
But by my late twenties,

76
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:43,560
some of my mates were taking cocaine.

77
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,470
And they were doing that thing that people on cocaine do,

78
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,400
where they talk, like, just at you a lot really quickly,

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,950
and they're being really boring,

80
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,530
but they don't notice they're doing it.

81
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,480
And then, of course,

82
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,820
that is what my whole career had been like.

83
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,710
And then I realized, like, f--- me.

84
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,621
Were those guys just on cocaine the whole time?

85
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,270
And then since then, one of my colleagues

86
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,700
who is very upset about the book

87
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,170
came out and said he spent,

88
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,003
I think he said he was spending

89
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:13,410
80,000 pounds a year on cocaine.

90
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,660
Yeah, which is ...

91
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,871
But the funniest thing is like,

92
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:18,008
I had no idea what was happening.

93
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,723
I had no idea what was happening.

94
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:21,270
I thought he was an alcoholic.

95
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,970
Probably the maddest thing was, again, this guy, Rupert,

96
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,230
from a very rich background,

97
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,230
but he really took to me really quickly and, you know,

98
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,100
sometimes I feel bad about the way I portray

99
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,280
him, because he really was good to me.

100
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,140
He really like sponsored my career, drove me through,

101
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,980
and he would take me out like with all of his mates.

102
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,540
And he lived in Clapper, and I lived in Milford,

103
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,330
which is like totally opposite ends of London.

104
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,940
And he'd take me out with all his Clapper mates

105
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,430
and we'd be going to f---ing Movida,

106
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,435
which is a big, expensive club,

107
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:54,843
and, like, expensive restaurants and, you know.

108
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,660
He'd normally let me go like around midnight,

109
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,190
because otherwise I'd missed the last train

110
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,720
and he'd have to pay for a taxi.

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,980
But it was like, "No, stay."

112
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,940
He kept me out later and later.

113
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,870
In the end, I stayed around,

114
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,920
ended up staying around his place.

115
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,470
I woke up, I felt like s---.

116
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,820
I went into the office, I just threw up.

117
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,735
You know, I had to go to the bathroom, just threw up.

118
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,620
And the boss sent me home.

119
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,427
Next day, I came in early and the boss was like,

120
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:21,070
"Oh, did Rupert do that to you?"

121
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,830
And I just laughed, you know.

122
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,170
Then when Rupert came in, the boss goes to him.

123
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,060
Gary said, "You did that to him."

124
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,457
And I knew that he'd be furious, right?

125
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:31,680
And at the time, he used to sit two seats to the left of me,

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,530
but there was an empty seat between us,

127
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,610
and I just thought, don't look at him,

128
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,480
just don't look at him.

129
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,730
I could kind of feel him like burning through my cheek.

130
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,730
And then I start to hear like, at first,

131
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,570
just kind of like a gentle growling,

132
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,410
like a growling in the back, like a "grr," like this.

133
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,120
And then I just think, f---,

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,047
just don't look at him, don't look at him.

135
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,640
And it starts to get like louder.

136
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,160
This growling gets like louder and louder.

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,440
He's on the trading floor in front of everyone.

138
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,034
I'm just thinking s---.

139
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:03,390
And then I hear like, this bang, this big bang, right?

140
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,273
And then I think like f---,

141
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:05,310
I better turn around now

142
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,620
because like what the f--- has he done?

143
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,180
We used to have like all the

144
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,190
computing stations were like behind these doors,

145
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,510
and he'd kicked the door

146
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,950
so it like smashed into the brackets,

147
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,450
and he was just kicking like that.

148
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,790
And he was turned around in his chair,

149
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,050
like leaning over towards me like that like that "grr,"

150
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:25,050
like gnashing his teeth like a f---ing dog at me

151
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,698
and growling at me, like "grr."

152
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:28,410
And I just looked at him, and he did it for about,

153
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,635
it must've been at least 10 seconds, just like growling,

154
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:34,023
gnashing his teeth at me in front of everyone.

155
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:38,225
And then I just f---ing looked back, and then he just,

156
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:40,410
the growling started to just chill,

157
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,700
and then he just kept on with his work,

158
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,860
and he never mentioned it again.

159
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,860
That was it.

160
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,760
There's these brokers who kind of match the traders together,

161
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,540
and their job is to help you get deals done.

162
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,220
You know, you say, "I want to buy here,"

163
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,470
and they're supposed to find a seller.

164
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,540
But in reality, what they were doing a lot of is basically

165
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,680
taking people out.

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,671
And they had this kind of really interesting skill.

167
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,880
They know what you're like.

168
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,590
So, you know, one of the guys wanted to go

169
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,540
to like fancy restaurants and drink red wine,

170
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,620
another guy wants to get like

171
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,960
VIP tables at fancy nightclubs,

172
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,790
and another guy wants to get taken on holidays,

173
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,980
another guy wants to go to sports events.

174
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,810
But the truth is, when I got taken out by these guys,

175
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,980
even when I went to Vegas,

176
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,800
we were going to like celeb parties in LA and Vegas,

177
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,970
for me, it was work.

178
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,240
It was just work, and I was just trying to sort of

179
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,670
be the Gary that these guys wanted me to be.

180
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,600
And it was quite fun.

181
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,590
I didn't really realize.

182
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,270
Because most people that go in there now

183
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,860
come from rich backgrounds.

184
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,600
Their dad was rich, their mom was rich,

185
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,870
their friends are rich, all their mates have similar jobs,

186
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,800
all their mates go to these VIP clubs, you know.

187
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,560
They're booking tables, and they go into fancy restaurants.

188
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,150
For them, it's just part of their social scene.

189
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,610
But for me, it was totally taking me out

190
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,560
of the social scene I was from.

191
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,630
So I kind of hated it to be honest.

192
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,310
And plus, there's this weird thing that happens

193
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,250
where like brokers will take you to like,

194
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,050
I remember they took me to watch England,

195
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,573
my first England game, and then the next day,

196
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:11,430
they're like, "Oh, can you do this deal for me?"

197
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,870
And then you realize like, oh,

198
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,890
there's a kind of f---ing like

199
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,930
hidden little quid pro quo here,

200
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,670
which I wasn't really comfortable with.

201
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,161
So eventually, like I started to just like say, "Look,

202
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:22,650
I don't meet no brokers, I don't go for no dinners."

203
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,110
I instituted "Nando's only" rule.

204
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,120
So for Americans who don't know what Nando's is,

205
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,793
Nando's is a popular grilled chicken chain.

206
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,550
I said, if you want to meet Gary,

207
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,960
you go to Nando's Canary Wharf.

208
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,910
I pay for me, you pay for you.

209
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,743
That's the rule.

210
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:38,913
But then, by then, I was like the biggest trader,

211
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:40,283
like one of the biggest traders in the world.

212
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,330
So like, so many people wanted to go to Nando's with me.

213
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,100
I was eating f---ing Nando's every day.

214
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,290
So I just sort of like cut it off.

215
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,180
I became very antisocial actually.

216
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,500
I think people realize like,

217
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,150
Gary's just not this kind of kid.

218
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:54,360
You know, the brokers,

219
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,400
the traders maybe are not socially aware to realize it,

220
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,470
but the brokers, because their job is kind of party people.

221
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,380
And also, a lot of the brokers come from poorer backgrounds

222
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,130
and come from my neck of the woods.

223
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,620
They realize very quickly Gary is just here pretending

224
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,480
to have a good time so that other traders have a good time,

225
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,700
because that's exactly what they're doing.

226
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,020
And they realize like, listen,

227
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,970
Gary just doesn't really want,

228
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,050
this is not his game really.

229
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,300
And they sort of let me away from that.

230
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,890
These guys are mainly people who couldn't cut it as traders.

231
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,750
So they tried to like climb the greasy pole.

232
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,610
And what they make their money on is basically

233
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,500
internal politics.

234
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,640
The kind of person who decides

235
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,740
to make their money managing internal politics

236
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,347
at an investment bank is usually a bit of a ----.

237
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,650
The management is just like,

238
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,390
it's just an absolute cesspool, really.

239
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,970
I remember talking my manager's manager

240
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,740
who in the book we called the Slug.

241
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,350
I remember talking to like one

242
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,390
of my mates on another trading desk,

243
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,030
and he was like, "I'll tell you what, if he was your intern,

244
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,350
you wouldn't hire him, would you?"

245
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,530
So I became the Swiss franc trader when I was 22,

246
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,970
which is really, really young.

247
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,710
And the way it happened was my boss,

248
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,020
who was a Swiss franc trader, quit, and a new boss got put in,

249
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,950
and he was a really nice guy,

250
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,030
but he seemed a little bit kind

251
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,250
of like dopey in a way.

252
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,920
And he come over once to introduce himself to me,

253
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,720
and the way he introduced himself to me was he just sat down

254
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,720
next to me and he pulled out a copy of Sports Illustrated

255
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,030
and he flicked through the magazine.

256
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,490
He opens it like that, like that to me.

257
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,897
And he's like, "Do you like that?"

258
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,742
And I was like, "Yeah, it's nice."

259
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:31,260
The whole, one at a time, just like that.

260
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,310
He didn't even say hi.

261
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,170
He didn't say his name.

262
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,160
And then I figured out this guy

263
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,510
must be the new f---ing boss.

264
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,487
But then, he stood up and he said to me,

265
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:41,550
"What's your job on the desk then?"

266
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,920
And I was thinking like, I'm the desk junior, right?

267
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,280
And I was thinking like, surely he f---ing knows what my job is.

268
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,110
And there's this kind of moment where I'm looking at him,

269
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,017
and he's looking at me, and I'm thinking, like, f---.

270
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,130
And I told him I'm the Swiss franc trader,

271
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,590
which was my old boss' job.

272
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,663
And he was just like, "All right, OK.

273
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,363
All right, fine."

274
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:04,680
I loved my second boss, but he was totally insane.

275
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,127
I remember once he sat me down just like,

276
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,770
"Gary, I really do apologize."

277
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,480
And I was like, "What for?"

278
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,730
And he was like, "We can't give you a salary increase."

279
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,140
And I'd never even asked one.

280
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,630
And the previous year, I'd been paid 400,000 pounds,

281
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,310
and he seemed genuinely worried about whether I could

282
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,750
survive on it, you know?

283
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,564
And then I just said to him, "Yeah, it's really tough."

284
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:23,525
What else can you say to these guys?

285
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:26,640
Another time, my boss threw a phone at my colleague's head

286
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,690
because my colleague had got angry,

287
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,423
and he'd thrown his phone at his screens.

288
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,170
But obviously, like now with these LCD screens,

289
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,550
they don't like smash.

290
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,880
So he was like, it didn't really, it just go ...

291
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,040
So he picked up the phone, smashing it on the desk.

292
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,990
And then he started trying to trade through the same phone.

293
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,247
So he was like hitting these like,

294
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,010
"Johnny, what's three months?"

295
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,120
But it wasn't working.

296
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,960
He was just shouting, and then he just banging his phone.

297
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,600
So then my boss shouted over to him like, "What's wrong?"

298
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,700
And he obviously wasn't listening.

299
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,600
And then he asked me what's wrong.

300
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,750
And I said, "I think JB's phone's broken."

301
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,250
So this boss just went over to the end,

302
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,010
just picked up a phone and just like lobbed it in the air,

303
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,210
landed on this guy's head.

304
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,220
The weirdest thing is it totally calmed him down,

305
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,200
totally, effectively calmed the guy down.

306
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,970
Yeah, I don't know.

307
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,440
The only thing I ever saw get escalated

308
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,620
to HR was the guy who stole money from another trader.

309
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,610
And even that, there was a general consensus on the desk

310
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,230
that he shouldn't have escalated to HR,

311
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,440
that we should've dealt with it between us.

312
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,590
Yeah, it was like that.

313
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,080
There's just like a kind of pirate ship vibe about it.

314
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:38,070
You know, it's a very masculine way of like,

315
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,050
you know, we sort it out between us.

316
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,070
We don't go to HR.

317
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,020
Because the truth is, a lot of people do do dodgy s---.

318
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,180
A lot people get away with it, because if you're making money

319
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,090
on it, management, maybe it's changed,

320
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,860
but management, they're not going to ask.

321
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,770
I was making a ton of f---ing money, tons of money.

322
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,570
Nobody ever asked how I was making it.

323
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,980
Management never asked how I was making it,

324
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,350
because if you're doing something dodgy,

325
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,760
they would rather that just slide.

326
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,490
They're going to get paid on it rather than to find out.

327
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,970
When you lose money, a lot of stress gets placed on you.

328
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,970
The worst thing from my perspective

329
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,210
and from the perspective of many traders is that you get,

330
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,190
you're no longer allowed to trade.

331
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,180
And that's what traders want to do.

332
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,013
They want to trade.

333
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:17,130
It only happened to me once.

334
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,660
I was only once ever in the red,

335
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,660
which was in my second full year as a trader in 2010.

336
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,890
So I was 23.

337
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,340
I'd put a big bet on which had some risk

338
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,750
to Swiss interest rates.

339
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,700
And the Swiss central bank suddenly cut rates

340
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,463
to negative 4.5% for some crazy reason,

341
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,900
specifically using the product that I was betting on.

342
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,820
I lost $8 million in a week.

343
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,160
The maddest thing about it was, it was the right bet.

344
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,450
If I was allowed to keep that position,

345
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,470
I would've made it all back.

346
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,520
I wasn't allowed to keep that position,

347
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,320
so you end up $4 million in the red.

348
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,820
Then you have to fight your way out of it.

349
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,436
I'm pretty sure my salary was $36K when I first started,

350
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,377
which was a good salary for the time.

351
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:03,990
I mean, it's not even a bad salary even now.

352
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,760
P&L is profit and loss,

353
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
and it's the only thing that matters in the world

354
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,150
if you're a trader, basically.

355
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,530
And every single day, every week, every month, every year,

356
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,540
your individual P&L is calculated.

357
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,640
Everyone's individual P&L is calculated.

358
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,410
And it goes around on a spreadsheet every day.

359
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,550
So every day you get a spreadsheet

360
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,460
that tells you every single trader's P&L,

361
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,140
which obviously means like if you're the best trader,

362
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,290
you're the best trader.

363
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:29,880
But if you're losing money, everybody can see.

364
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,230
It's very clear who the best is,

365
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,940
and it's very clear who the worst is.

366
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,577
And that starts to become how you interact with other people

367
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:37,027
and it starts to become how you see other people.

368
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,540
There's this kind of beautiful fairness

369
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,640
to it in a weird way.

370
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,610
And I think there's not a lot of places in the world

371
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,620
other than sort of the football pitch

372
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,700
where a kid like me from nowhere can come in

373
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,220
and compete with all of these multimillionaires from rich

374
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,223
families and be like the guy at 24.

375
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,870
Traders in my department were getting paid about 7%

376
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,150
of their P&L, but I didn't know that at first.

377
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,890
And there's this kind of idea

378
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,690
like you can't ask anyone what their bonus is,

379
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,250
so it was like really mysterious.

380
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,140
And then this thing happened

381
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,230
after my first bonus, the beginning of 2010,

382
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,540
when I got paid nearly 400,000 pounds,

383
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,570
which will be like, at the time, maybe $700,000.

384
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,430
So much more than I've been expecting.

385
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,110
And it kind of broke me a little bit

386
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,490
and I just became like, oh my God,

387
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,710
there's so much money to be made here.

388
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,543
This is it.

389
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:27,376
All we're doing now is trading.

390
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:28,350
And then, obviously, the next year,

391
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,450
I lost this $8 million in a week really quickly.

392
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,850
And that just, again, beat me, like,

393
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,920
you have to be better, you have to be more serious,

394
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,880
you have to work harder.

395
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,780
And I just became like, I became like this machine.

396
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,790
Most of the traders, in my opinion,

397
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,680
we're not making huge amounts of money from taking

398
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,940
risky positions, speculative positions.

399
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,190
They're making most of their money from the customers,

400
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,590
but they're kind of trying to

401
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,330
pretend they're making it from their bets.

402
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,330
But most traders want to be making money from betting

403
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,723
because that's sort of the glamorous side of it, you know?

404
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,920
Can you actually beat the market?

405
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,290
It wasn't really till 2011 that I started

406
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,490
to make some big bets.

407
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,380
You know, like I always remember, in 2011,

408
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,630
the Japanese nuclear disaster.

409
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,700
I made a ton of money on the Japanese nuclear disaster,

410
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,230
not because I'd been expecting it

411
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,120
to be a Japanese nuclear disaster,

412
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,670
but because I was betting on economic weakness.

413
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,410
You bet on economic weakness,

414
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,670
this crazy thing happens

415
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,870
that there's no way you could've predicted,

416
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,250
you make a ton of money.

417
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,290
Well, some people are the other way around, right?

418
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,460
You know, some people would've lost a ton

419
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,930
of money in the nuclear disaster.

420
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,677
People sometimes turn around to me and they say,

421
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:40,440
"Oh, it's terrible that you made money

422
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,190
betting on these things happening."

423
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:47,220
I made money from the Japanese earthquake, right?

424
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,022
20,000 people died in that earthquake,

425
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:50,553
in the following tsunami.

426
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,840
I didn't make that tsunami happen.

427
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,220
I think that's important to realize.

428
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,110
And these guys' job is to bet on it and to be right on it.

429
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,190
And they're very, very heavily incentivized to be right.

430
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,510
The payment structure is very weird,

431
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,740
or at least it was back then.

432
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,510
You would get paid a lot of money in a bonus,

433
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,890
but it would be like deferred.

434
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,960
So you get this money in four years.

435
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,000
Since I left banking, this rule came in,

436
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
this EU law that limited bonuses as a multiple of salary,

437
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,420
which meant that the way payment

438
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,650
happened is completely changed.

439
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,030
Now, because of that bonus cap,

440
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,320
what they will have to do instead

441
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,270
is they massively increase your salary.

442
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,850
And since then, salaries have increased massively,

443
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,740
and bonuses have decreased massively,

444
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,980
which decreases the incentivization to take risk,

445
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,340
and it also increases the incentivization to kind

446
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,340
of sit on your chair and sit around and like take the money.

447
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,620
So I won a card game.

448
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,030
I won my job in a card game.

449
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,960
I was a very good student.

450
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,510
I did math and economics, I got very good grades.

451
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,540
But turns out, and I didn't know this beforehand,

452
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,950
the way to get a job,

453
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,930
you have to get an internship in your second year.

454
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,700
So you have to apply on with CVs,

455
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,800
and people at LSE would be sending like 35

456
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,569
CVs to different banks.

457
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,670
But obviously, like, because they're from rich families,

458
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,960
they've kind of prepped for this, right?

459
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,089
So everybody has like some really quite extracurriculars,

460
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,750
like they founded the Junior United Nations or some s---,

461
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,180
or they're like concert pianist, you know?

462
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,010
And I was like working in a sofa shop

463
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,540
and like trying to become

464
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,700
like a grime rapper when I was a kid.

465
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,980
So I was like, ----, we're ----, basically,

466
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,960
because we can't get in.

467
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,150
But I had quite good reppers being like good grades,

468
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,200
and he's a smart kid.

469
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,470
A guy also in the math department from near above,

470
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,460
I didn't know who he was,

471
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,930
walked up to me in the library one day

472
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,077
and just said,

473
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:43,530
"Citibank and I want to trade you through a card game."

474
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,970
It's basically a math game.

475
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,100
You should enter that, and you'll win."

476
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,900
So I was like, "Yeah, let's just go for it.

477
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,670
Let's ourselves into this card game."

478
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,840
And that's how I got my job.

479
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,436
That card game is called the trading game.

480
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:56,340
It's a betting game, basically.

481
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,620
So there's a special deck of cards, some low cards,

482
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,990
some high cards, five players.

483
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,630
We all get a card and then, essentially,

484
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,630
we're making bets on what the total number of the cards is.

485
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,460
So if I've got a low card,

486
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,140
I should think it's going to be low,

487
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,730
and I'm betting it's going to be low.

488
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,620
I'm making sell bets essentially.

489
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,140
And it's structured to be like financial markets,

490
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,580
like a buyer price and a sale price.

491
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,560
I had the big advantage, which was this guy had explained me

492
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,150
the rules of the game before the game itself.

493
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,200
Other people going into the

494
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
event not knowing the rules of the game.

495
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,560
If you are a math or economics student,

496
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,850
when you play a game like this,

497
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,560
you are going to immediately do this thing

498
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,490
which you're taught to at

499
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,860
university in mathematical subjects,

500
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,920
calculate the expected probability, which is like, OK,

501
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,660
these are the cards in the game,

502
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,100
this is what we expect it to be.

503
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,780
Oh, but I've got a really low card,

504
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,370
so it's going to be lower, like this.

505
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,453
Everyone's going to do that.

506
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:45,330
That is the instinctive thing that like a maths

507
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,000
or an economics or a statistics student is going to do.

508
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,670
So I've got a low card, I think total's going to be 50.

509
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,220
You've got a high card, you think total's going to be 70.

510
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,866
So I start saying 49, 51, you know, I'm going to trade.

511
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:59,253
And you're going to start saying 69, 71.

512
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,610
It makes sense, but it's actually quite a stupid thing to do.

513
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,950
Because, No. 1, you immediately give away your

514
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,660
card, first thing.

515
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,280
But No. 2, if I'm there,

516
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,250
and this guy's quoting around 50

517
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,810
and you're quoting around 70,

518
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,730
I can buy at 50 and sell at 70

519
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,650
and make like 20 instant free profit.

520
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,030
And I would, just did that.

521
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,590
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

522
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,170
It's really, really stupidly easy in a way.

523
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,730
But I mean, of course, I was only able to do that

524
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,950
because I had the rules in advance.

525
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,020
That's how I won the first round, just by kind

526
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,423
of taking advantage of this kind of stupidity.

527
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,450
Second round was the national finals.

528
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,490
I developed a new strategy, which is kind of around sort

529
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,580
of bullying the price around, manipulating the price around.

530
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,720
It worked really well.

531
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,450
Then there was a final of the final, final five guys.

532
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,160
And this is like, if you win this,

533
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,720
you're getting into the big thing.

534
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,410
I came in with a really low card, really low card.

535
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,450
So I know, thought it was going to be low.

536
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,180
And my strategy was to bully the price up and to try

537
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,490
and sell at a high price.

538
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,870
So I just bullied up, bullied up, bullied it up.

539
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,890
Game finishes.

540
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,470
And I spent the whole game selling, at a high price.

541
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,750
And like mathematically, it was almost impossible for me

542
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,870
to lose, because the price was really high

543
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,820
and my card is really low.

544
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,800
But then when everyone turned their cards over,

545
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,150
the other cards in the game were the

546
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,280
seven highest possible cards,

547
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,020
which the chance of it happening

548
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,290
by chance are like one in or maybe like 15 million

549
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,270
or something, ridiculously impossible chance.

550
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,180
So I realized, I knew that the game must have been rigged,

551
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,010
but I don't think anyone else noticed.

552
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,700
And I was just thinking like, what the f---?

553
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,003
These guys have like rigged the game against me.

554
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,950
Then the guy goes to the front to announce the winner,

555
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,650
and he announced that I was the winner,

556
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,180
even though my actual score in the final,

557
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,560
the final was like negative.

558
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,620
And he said, Gary's scores in the,

559
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,140
like the warmups were so good,

560
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,090
we wanted to test him in the final

561
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,040
to see what he did if everything was against him,

562
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,350
to see if he would like really back himself.

563
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,900
And he did back himself, and that's what we like to see.

564
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,120
So we decided he's the winner of the game.

565
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,520
Even though I actually lost.

566
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,290
Tells you a little bit about the crazy

567
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,630
people that work in this world, I think.

568
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,520
The guys who did come into the card game tended

569
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,710
to end up being really good traders at the bank.

570
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,660
This CV cover letter, there's a massive amount

571
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,400
of classism in that.

572
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,650
Because everyone has the top grade.

573
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,420
Basically, it's based on extracurriculars.

574
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,470
It's based on how good you are

575
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,030
at like f---ing clarinet, basically.

576
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,010
But then, you know, kids like me will poke holes in your

577
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,320
objective methods, but they're probably going to be the

578
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,000
best traders, really.

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,940
So I was a trader, professional trader for Citibank

580
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,400
2008 until 2014.

581
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,380
I was at LSE, the London School of Economics,

582
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,910
before I went into banking.

583
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,920
Everyone at LSE is obsessed with banking,

584
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,653
obsessed with trading.

585
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:38,790
So you get a good sense of what everybody wants.

586
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,180
And back before 2008, everybody wanted to work in credit,

587
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,220
which of course is the area that, you know,

588
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,420
blew the global economy up.

589
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,310
But the guys who were working in it

590
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,200
before they blew the economy up were making a ton of money.

591
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,540
So everybody wanted to go there.

592
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,220
I went into this unfashionable area,

593
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,260
because they said you can start straight away

594
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,580
and you can start trading straight away,

595
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,710
which is really unusual, but they let me do that.

596
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,940
Trading sort of changed in the sort of

597
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:04,590
early 2000s, 2000 to 2010.

598
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,080
It became a lot more mathematical.

599
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,730
There's this cultural shift where

600
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,760
it goes away from being these kind of guys,

601
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,042
ex-rugby players,

602
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:15,090
of which there used to be a lot of that kind

603
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,530
of thing in banking, towards, you know, LSE graduates,

604
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,720
Harvard graduates, you know, maths graduates,

605
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,810
physics graduates who are very like honorable with maths.

606
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,720
I think "American Psycho" is very good, actually.

607
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,670
You know, it shows this guy's in banking,

608
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,410
and he becomes a murderer, and

609
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,360
he's really clearly a dickhead.

610
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,120
But I knew people at LSE that would memorize all

611
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,260
of his lines by heart.

612
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,390
And they loved him, and the reason is

613
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,600
because he's really handsome, he's really rich,

614
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,850
he's in great shape, he's got a really beautiful girlfriend,

615
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,890
he's got a really expensive flat.

616
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,120
And I think no matter how much you try to say,

617
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,290
but he's a dickhead.

618
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,470
If you've put that in front of a 18-, 19-year-old boy,

619
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,053
you're going to f--- a lot of 18-, 19-year-old boys up.

620
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:05,113
I had to wake up at, say, 5:30.

621
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:09,120
7:30 was like, you have to be in by 7:30, or you're late.

622
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,090
So I'd be up at 5:30, have my little Blackberry,

623
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,060
looking through the emails, digging through the prices,

624
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,520
have a bit of breakfast, have a shower,

625
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,960
cycle down through East London,

626
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,070
get to work, try to get there roughly about 7.

627
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,330
So trading floor in London is massive.

628
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,490
Massive, massive trading floor.

629
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,260
It's in a big skyscraper in Canary Wharf,

630
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,370
which is in the East End of London,

631
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,490
not far from where I grew up, not far from where I live now.

632
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,980
It's only on the second floor, it's not on the top floor.

633
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,900
The trading floors are all quite low down.

634
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,880
These are the floors that are making the most money.

635
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,300
Long, long rows of men with huge walls of screens,

636
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,580
sort of, nine monitors, 12 monitors up in a big

637
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,530
square rectangle around them.

638
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,020
And most people have that,

639
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,940
and they'll be sitting back to back in these long rows.

640
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,640
You know, it's classic skyscraper environment.

641
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,640
My trading desk was in the foreign exchange department,

642
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,600
which back then had the very sort

643
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,360
of boisterous laddish atmosphere.

644
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,620
I came in first day in a suit

645
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,800
and the guys were like, "No suits, no ties."

646
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,270
Whereas I think the European banks

647
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,650
like Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank,

648
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,273
they like you to wear suits.

649
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,565
And then I'd be checking my positions, you know,

650
00:24:17,565 --> 00:24:20,310
there was a really big rush in the morning from sort

651
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,480
of 8 a.m. to about 10:30 a.m. dealing with all the customers.

652
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,830
So between 8 and sort of 10:30,

653
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,720
11, would just be a mad rush.

654
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,710
By then, I'd be knackered.

655
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,780
I'd go and get massive Nando's, sit there,

656
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,520
smash my Nando's down.

657
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,770
Then in the afternoon, it's actually quite chill,

658
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:38,700
because Citibank offers a 24-hour pricing service,

659
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,780
which means there's a period

660
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,390
where if you call up, you get the London trader,

661
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,250
there's a period where you get the New York trader,

662
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,230
and there's a period where you get the Sydney trader.

663
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,750
By our afternoon, we've handed over to New York,

664
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,610
they're doing the business.

665
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,070
So we're sitting around, reading the newspaper,

666
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,570
sort of chatting.

667
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,070
But in the evening, yeah, you chill out,

668
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,440
read the paper, check you're making money.

669
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,383
I was making a lot of money, so sort of celebrate.

670
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,110
Then we'd finish at about 5.

671
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,510
Earlier on in my career, I'd get dragged out a lot

672
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,250
with like the senior traders drinking

673
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,990
and going to fancy restaurants.

674
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,270
And I kind of hated that, to be honest.

675
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:16,053
But by the end of my career, I'd say I was about 24.

676
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,960
You know, I'd go, I'd cycle back home,

677
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,050
I'd leave about 5, cycle home, go to the gym,

678
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,310
cook dinner with my flatmate,

679
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,070
you know, watch the football if it's on.

680
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,540
Obviously, I'm waking up at 5:30.

681
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,480
So, you know, I wasn't like big on the nightlife.

682
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,280
A lot of people were waking up at 5:30

683
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,750
and also big on the nightlife,

684
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,010
and I didn't understand how they did it,

685
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:35,843
but I think I understand more now.

686
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:38,190
The thing is, even when you're there, really,

687
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,190
there's only sort of three or four hours of hard work.

688
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,980
And that was because I was the Euro trader, which was like,

689
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,680
that was definitely the most work of anyone.

690
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,813
What you really were at the time,

691
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,140
you were the risk holder.

692
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,130
You were the risk holder.

693
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,510
Your job was to be the person

694
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,370
who made the decisions and took the risk

695
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,620
and who took the hit if you were wrong.

696
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,490
The first thing is lots of different kinds

697
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,040
of traders trading, lots of different kinds of things.

698
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,810
I was an interest rates trader.

699
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,830
It means I was borrowing and lending money.

700
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,170
Interest rates traders borrow and lend money.

701
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,850
And the idea is quite simple.

702
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,040
You want to borrow at a low interest rate,

703
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,900
and you want to lend at a high interest rate.

704
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,230
So a lot of what is done on that desk, the STIRT desk,

705
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,240
the short-term interest rates trading desk,

706
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,400
is one-day loans.

707
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,540
Corporations, pension funds, hedge funds

708
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,630
that have loans running out will come to people like me

709
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,030
and say, "We've got a loan in six months.

710
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,260
What interest rate will you give us

711
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,270
for a loan starting in six months' time?"

712
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,080
On a very, very basic level, when the economy is good,

713
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,540
sometimes just because inflation is overheating,

714
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,400
the central banks raise rates,

715
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,920
and they cut rates when the economy is weak.

716
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,810
So in a very broad sense,

717
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,800
although we are also looking at inflation, really,

718
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,990
we're trying to judge the strength of economies.

719
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,240
In my desk, there were about 10 traders,

720
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,880
and each trader's job was to look at a different currency

721
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,340
and you kind of get promoted through the ranks.

722
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,490
It's split between what you'd call rich world currencies

723
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,180
and what they call emerging market, poor country currencies.

724
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,560
So on my desk, the rich world desk,

725
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,500
we're basically doing Europe, Japan,

726
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,720
North America, Australia, New Zealand.

727
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,350
First, I was, you know, desk junior, buying the coffees.

728
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,330
Then I was New Zealand dollar trader,

729
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,740
then I was Swiss franc trader,

730
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,810
then eventually I was euro trader,

731
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,150
then I moved to Japan and I was the yen trader.

732
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,340
As interest rates traders, we make loans,

733
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,180
we borrow in money, we try to borrow cheap and lend high.

734
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,590
A lot of people do that by a variety of dodgy ways.

735
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,750
What I tried to do, and what I think is most interesting,

736
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,630
is I did that by trying to predict strength of economies.

737
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,690
So in 2011, by the time I become a really profitable trader,

738
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,730
Citibank for some reason had this big thing

739
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,160
where they wanted to become the biggest bank in the world in

740
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,660
terms of volumes traded.

741
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,590
And because we're doing one-day loans, it's massive volume.

742
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,760
Because if you borrow money for a day,

743
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,620
you have to come back every day.

744
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,720
It's stupid, but it looks like really big volume.

745
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,450
And it meant that senior management had asked me to try

746
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,790
to do as much trades as I could.

747
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,990
So I was probably lending

748
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,300
and borrowing between currencies,

749
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,660
probably not far off a trillion dollars a day of a variety

750
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,040
of currencies, which was ridiculous.

751
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,040
But it's what I've been asked to do.

752
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,440
I was in a situation towards the end of my career

753
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,790
where I was trying to get fired.

754
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,580
I was a very successful trader, but for a very short time,

755
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,590
and I quit when I was like 27, I think.

756
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,130
I was just so in the game, and I was kind of,

757
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,870
I was quite dehumanized in a way.

758
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,040
I'd done it to myself, you know?

759
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,210
But I mean, how do I balance this love for being the best,

760
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,750
but also like being a human and taking care of myself

761
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,180
and also fulfilling my responsibility

762
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,630
through a collapsing society?

763
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,350
The traders don't think it's their job,

764
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,850
because they're trying to do trades to make money.

765
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,410
The politicians are trying to win elections.

766
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,043
The academics are trying to write fancy papers.

767
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,640
The guys in media are trying to get

768
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,010
clicks and get views and, you know.

769
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,680
Actually, nobody's trying to fix it.

770
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,960
My big success was in 2011,

771
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,600
and that came from this realization

772
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,060
that the economy was never going to get better,

773
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,890
that we had a growing crisis of inequality

774
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,450
that wouldn't be resolved,

775
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,310
that the rich would get richer and the ordinary

776
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,960
people would get poorer,

777
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,810
living standards would collapse, things would collapse.

778
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,910
And I put that bet on.

779
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:37,650
I never really stopped to think, what does that mean?

780
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,330
Because my job was to bet on these things.

781
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,100
You know, if your job is to look at the economy,

782
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,660
think is it going to be strong, and is it going to be weak?

783
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,190
That's what you do.

784
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,023
You know what I mean?

785
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:51,750
And by the end of that year, 2011,

786
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,760
I've become Citibank's most profitable trader in the whole

787
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,400
world by this bet that society would collapse.

788
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,713
And everybody could see that I'd done that.

789
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,030
Nobody turned around and said, "Should we do something?"

790
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,970
There's not like a bell where you can go and ring, you know.

791
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,170
I think it's worth realizing, right?

792
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,150
The best-paid 10,000 economists in the

793
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,683
world are all traders.

794
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,130
Towards the end of my career, I decide I want to leave,

795
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,870
and I tell my boss I want to leave.

796
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,340
And my boss takes me out for this dinner,

797
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,490
and he told me a story about a trader,

798
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,160
a young trader at Deutsche Bank who, you know, nice guy,

799
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,953
good trader, wanted to leave.

800
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,480
The only problem is Deutsche didn't really want him

801
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,790
to leave, you know, so they went through all of his,

802
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,460
looked through some of his past trades

803
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,993
and his emails, you know.

804
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,180
There wasn't really anything in there,

805
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,983
but there was enough, you know.

806
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,080
You know what I mean?

807
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,580
Enough to take him to court.

808
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,280
And he rolled through court for years and years,

809
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,526
and eventually the guy was bankrupted.

810
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:51,450
And then he literally said to me,

811
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,820
you know, "I like you,

812
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,270
I think you're a good person,

813
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,650
but sometimes bad things happen to good people.

814
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,960
We can make life very difficult for you.

815
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,160
You're going to find out about that."

816
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,810
It's so obviously similar to the way

817
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,100
that, like, gangsters speak.

818
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,270
That's exactly the same kind

819
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,890
of person that goes into drug dealing,

820
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,960
exactly the same kind of person.

821
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,350
And I can't help but think that

822
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,050
a lot of the guys who become traders,

823
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,660
if they grew up on the street I grew up on,

824
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,160
would've been drug dealers.

825
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,230
And a lot of the kids selling drugs in Elford,

826
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,510
if they went to the same boarding school as Rupert

827
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,690
and if they went to LSE, they would've become traders.

828
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,523
Really.

829
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:30,090
Because it's the exact same personality type.

830
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,530
I come from a very poor background,

831
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,390
and the people are being hurt by

832
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,610
what has happened in the economy are people

833
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,950
that are exactly like me when I was a kid

834
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,050
and people that are exactly like my mom and like my dad

835
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,660
and like my sister and like my friends I grew up with.

836
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,990
But it was really a long time

837
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,970
before I ever started to explicitly think,

838
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,710
should we do anything about this?

839
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,050
And by then, I've been kind of like kicked out to Tokyo,

840
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,620
and my junior was this very, very, very posh, very rich,

841
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,233
very wealthy, but very smart Australian kid.

842
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,387
And I said to him,

843
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,990
"You know, do you think we should do something?"

844
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,147
And he was like, "About what?"

845
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,160
And I was like, "You know, about like

846
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,007
a collapsing global economy."

847
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,700
And he was like, "Yeah, we put that trade on.

848
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,860
We bought the green euro dollars."

849
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,503
And I was like, "Well, yeah, yes,

850
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,200
but, you know, do you think we should do something?"

851
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,150
And he was like, "I don't understand what you mean."

852
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,280
You don't go into trading to save the world,

853
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,680
but you kind of assume that

854
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,900
there are people whose job it is to look after the world.

855
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,500
You know, like politicians most obviously,

856
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,850
economists at universities,

857
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,020
economists at central banks,

858
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,940
like the Fed, like the Bank of England,

859
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,770
economists in the media.

860
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,960
You kind of think these guys,

861
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,820
their job is to look after it.

862
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,370
But what was becoming increasingly clear to me was,

863
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,523
well, our job is not to fix it.

864
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,190
Those guys whose job is to fix it,

865
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,930
they're definitely not going to fix it.

866
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,640
Like, I want to leave and work for charity.

867
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,720
And the banks are just, you know,

868
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,520
the senior management is just very strongly

869
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,140
implying, "Well, we're going to sue you."

870
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,633
And at that point, they have no reason to sue you.

871
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,170
They're just going to like, "Well, you do that,

872
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,003
we're going to sue you."

873
00:33:05,003 --> 00:33:07,080
And I think, to be honest, that high levels of banking

874
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,510
and probably high levels of a lot of other industries,

875
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,590
that's how it works.

876
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,413
Like the law is an arm of power.

877
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:15,806
Like, they're like, "OK, if you piss us off,

878
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:17,480
we're going to find a way to sue you."

879
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,830
And I think that is kind of how it works.

880
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,470
So I suspect that a lot of the people who get actually sued

881
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,720
by banks are not the people who did bad s---.

882
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,520
They're the people who pissed off the wrong people.

883
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,410
So I get 18 months like wandering around Tokyo,

884
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,600
like studying Japanese and like learning to draw.

885
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,010
They make me sit in the corner.

886
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,450
So I'm just sitting in the corner of the office like

887
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,860
studying Japanese and drawing pictures

888
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,110
of the Beatles and stuff.

889
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,510
In a way it was nice, it was nice,

890
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,640
because it gave me a bit of time to sort of

891
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,960
think about what I was doing.

892
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,330
You know, I played that final game pretty well,

893
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,130
despite the fact that I was in terrible

894
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,990
mental health condition at the time.

895
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,600
And I got them into a position where, I think,

896
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,490
first of all, I think they thought,

897
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,200
because I was kind of a young kid from kind

898
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,120
of a rough background making a lot of money,

899
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,070
I think they thought that if they dug far enough,

900
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,960
they'd find some dodgy s--- in there.

901
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,000
But really, I was just betting on like the world

902
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,260
collapsing every single year.

903
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,370
That's what I was f---ing doing.

904
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,990
And in the end, two things happened simultaneously,

905
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,840
which is I start sending these mad emails every day

906
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,540
to like the CEO and the global head of HR.

907
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,540
And one guy got fired, and then I get let out.

908
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,230
So I didn't really know whether it was

909
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,300
because I started getting mental and causing big problems

910
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,830
or if it was because this guy got fired.

911
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,370
And I'll never know which one of those things.

912
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,980
But eventually, I got out, which is why I'm here

913
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,960
and not stuck in a skyscraper.

914
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,130
It's all a big game.

915
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,000
It's all a big game.

916
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,020
It's all a big power game.

917
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,989
And like, you can kind of get away with whatever you want,

918
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:39,389
as long as it's not in the bank's interest to go for you.

919
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:42,150
You know, and it's horrible, but, you know,

920
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,889
this is the world that we've built, you know,

921
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,070
where if you're very, very rich and very, very powerful,

922
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,070
you can get away with a f---ing lot.

923
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,290
I don't hate rich people.

924
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,429
I am a rich people.

925
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,900
I don't blame rich people.

926
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,180
I'm an economist that makes millions of pounds

927
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,530
by predicting the f---ing future

928
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,870
and I've got a f---ing good track record.

929
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,250
These guys will get richer and richer,

930
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,780
and they will eat the middle class alive.

931
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,310
And it's not because they're bad, and it's not

932
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,143
because they're evil,

933
00:35:09,143 --> 00:35:12,420
it's because that's what f---ing compound interest does.

934
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,700
If you are a guy who's worth $100 million,

935
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,340
you're going to make $5 million a year passive income,

936
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,520
and you are going to use that money to buy the assets

937
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,430
that ordinary families, kids need.

938
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,080
That is the direction of travel.

939
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,920
That is we're heading up.

940
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,540
We will lose the middle class.

941
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,490
There's obviously that one scene in "The Big Short,"

942
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,440
couple of guys make a lot of money by betting on like the

943
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,270
collapse of the American economy.

944
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,536
And they're going to make a ton of money,

945
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:35,520
and they're really like, they're really happy,

946
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,530
and they're dancing, and there's this Brad Pitt character

947
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,960
turns around and he's like, "Stop f---ing dancing."

948
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,793
And they're like, "Why?

949
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:41,626
We just made a load of money."

950
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:43,110
He's like, "You made money betting on the

951
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,580
collapse of the economy.

952
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,720
You know what that means?

953
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,070
That means people losing their homes,

954
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,390
that means people committing suicide,

955
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,060
that means families breaking down."

956
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,100
And obviously, for me, as someone who's done the same thing,

957
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,660
like, you feel that.

958
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,710
My free market rate is $2 million a year.

959
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,100
For three years, I was out here in the media on YouTube

960
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,140
for free, telling people exactly

961
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,190
what was going to happen in COVID.

962
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,960
You can go back and look at my early videos,

963
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,870
my early articles in 2020 predicting COVID.

964
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,210
Everything I said was going to happen exactly happened.

965
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,890
Nobody's f---ing listening.

966
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,790
It was hard.

967
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,460
It was hard, because you're used to getting up, you know,

968
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,163
I was trading nearly a trillion dollars a day,

969
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:20,220
you know what I mean?

970
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,990
And you're used to getting up and coming to the desk

971
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,490
and bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,

972
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,810
smashing all that money through.

973
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,100
And I would wake up in the morning

974
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,550
and you just have this like energy, you know, this energy.

975
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,410
You know, of course I made millions of dollars,

976
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,870
but then once you quit, your income is zero, you know.

977
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,150
I just had this really strong feeling like you're

978
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,800
being unproductive, you're wasting your time.

979
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,250
And I went to like, I went to like psychiatry on the NHS,

980
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,810
and then she gave me like a little timetable

981
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,878
to fill in, put in everything you're doing on here.

982
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:48,750
And she looked at it and she was like,

983
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,370
you're really, really f---ing busy.

984
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,700
But I'd become so used to this hothouse environment

985
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,900
where you just feel like you have

986
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,790
to be 100% all of the time,

987
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,460
that anything other than like working 120%

988
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,650
felt like doing nothing to me.

989
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,830
In the beginning of COVID,

990
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,910
I picked up trading again,

991
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,110
because there was a lot of money on the table.

992
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,880
So I still do do a bit of trading.

993
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,380
It just sits in investments, you know.

994
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,680
Obviously, I quit my job, and the work I do now,

995
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,700
it's educational work,

996
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,580
trying to explain to people the importance of inequality.

997
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,003
I don't get paid a lot of money for it.

998
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:17,760
You know, in fact, very often,

999
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
I get paid no money for it.

1000
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,420
So it funds my work, it funds my life.

1001
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,210
Hopefully one day in the future it'll pay for me to

1002
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,490
have a family with a bit of financial security.

1003
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,160
You know, who reads articles in The Guardian about economics?

1004
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,270
Rich people, basically.

1005
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,650
And I want to talk to all the new people.

1006
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,500
So I moved to YouTube, started making a YouTube,

1007
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,360
made a load of videos, but of course,

1008
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,590
nobody was watching them.

1009
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,330
And you know, I've got a degree from LSE,

1010
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,530
I've got a degree from Oxford,

1011
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,503
I'm a multimillionaire, a very successful ex-trader.

1012
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,147
I put videos out about economics and people say,

1013
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:49,980
"Who the f--- is this guy?

1014
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,000
He's not an economist."

1015
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,140
You know what I mean?

1016
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,120
Somebody called me up and, "I've read one your articles.

1017
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,860
You've thought about writing a book?"

1018
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,930
And I was like, "No, not really."

1019
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,190
But then I thought, you know,

1020
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,600
if I could use this story,

1021
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,310
this f---ing good story, you know.

1022
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,640
Expelled from school, wins a job in a card game,

1023
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,920
top trader the world by betting on the collapse of society,

1024
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,110
you know, bank tries to stop him from leaving.

1025
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,010
It's a good story.

1026
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,810
I thought, if I could tell that story well,

1027
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,093
then hopefully you'll know with the confidence I have

1028
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,280
that this is going to go down the toilet.

1029
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,613
And if enough people know that, then we can stop it.

1030
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,940
I'm not allowed to answer that question, unfortunately.

1031
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,640
Legal reasons, I'd love to tell you, but I can't answer it.

1032
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,290
Yeah, yeah.

1033
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,123
It's quite bizarre.

1034
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:40,350
You might think I'd be able to say,

1035
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,130
I did sign an NDA, but I can't talk about these things.

1036
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,260
But unfortunately, I cannot discuss whether

1037
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,970
I signed an NDA or not.

1038
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,620
I'm a producer on Authorized Account.

1039
