1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,019
- T. rex is definitely weird, even compared to all the other

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,920
giant tyrannosaurs that are very closely related to it,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,700
because it is by far, ludicrously by far, the largest carnivore in its ecosystem.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,340
- So it doesn't really have competition, actually.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,270
- I mean, this is a Velociraptor skull. There are some carnivores

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,000
that are a bit bigger than this, but not enormously

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,560
so which were knocking around as T. rex. The skull's the same type.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,420
...toothed crap. But, like, you think about that.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,490
And that's like going to Africa and

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,960
going, "Okay, there are lions. What's the next biggest

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,440
predator? And it's like, well, there's a weasel about this big.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,460
Like, it's that kind of size difference and

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,640
you don't get that normally in ecosystems.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,870
- It would eat those, the juvenile of the herbivores, but not...

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,320
- Oh yeah, it's gonna be eating Triceratops and Edmontosaurus and Parasaurolophus.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,420
There's even a couple of giant sauropods knocking around.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,449
- Got it.

18
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,300
- In some places it's gonna be hoovering them up, but like,

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,300
how often is it gonna eat... Again, Velociraptor isn't there, but how often

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,760
is it gonna eat something the size of an adult Velociraptor?

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,980
I mean, they're a fraction of our size and we're probably too small.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,990
This is like lions hunting mice. Like, you're just not gonna bother,

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,560
unless one, like, virtually runs into your mouth, you're not gonna try and eat it.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,820
- The following is a conversation with Dave Hone, a

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,830
paleontologist, expert on dinosaurs, co- host of

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,840
the Terrible Lizards podcast, and author of many scientific

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:42,080
papers and books on the behavior and ecology of dinosaurs. This was truly a fun

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,480
and fascinating conversation. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,900
here's Dave Hone. Let's start with the T.

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,240
rex dinosaur, possibly the most iconic predator in the history of

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,160
Earth. You have deeply studied and written about their evolution, biology,

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,800
ecology, and behavior, so let's first maybe put

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,800
ourselves in the time of the dinosaurs and imagine we're standing in front of a T.

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,820
rex. What does it look like? What are the key features of

37
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,500
the dinosaur in front of us?

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,780
- It's gigantic. It's almost trite now

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,600
because everyone knows T. rex is massive. But yes, if you actually

40
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,600
stand in front of one, you would be seriously impressed just how

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,480
absolutely vast they are. So I've got a copy of a T. rex

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,400
skull in my downstairs from my office and yeah, I could fit comfortably through its mouth.

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,769
So it would be just about capable of swallowing me whole, and I'm a pretty big guy.

44
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,140
- Your body, you could fit- ... in it's, its mouth?

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,810
- I can fit through, I can fit through it.

46
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,329
- Wow.

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,320
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's not even a particularly big one. It's a copy of the one that's

48
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,900
in the Smithsonian, and they get bigger than that.

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,760
- You have a to-scale copy.

50
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,710
- Yeah, it's a cast, so it's just a giant mold made and then-

51
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,489
- Nice.

52
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,390
- ...pulled out like the dentist do your teeth, but very, very big. So yeah,

53
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:14,480
they are 12-ish meters long, so what's that? 14 yards. Four and a half, maybe five

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,730
to the top of the head, standing up. So another six yards high.

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,609
And then seven-ish metric tons. What's that?

56
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,320
About eight and a half short tons. So a colleague of mine, Tom Holtz,

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
described them as an orca on land, but that's it. It is a

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,640
killer whale-sized animal but on legs, on

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,450
land. And those are massive predators. So you're

60
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,200
looking at something absolutely colossal, and I think that is what will

61
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,040
stun you. I think people don't realize how big a lot of

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,070
animals are, which sounds weird, but I used

63
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,850
to work in a few zoos, and something I think you notice is when you go and see things like

64
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,800
elephants or giraffes or rhinos, everything's built to the scale of

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,420
the animal. The elephant house is huge. The doors are huge. The

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,160
bars are huge. The food is huge. And so you don't

67
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,100
see them in the context of something that you have a good

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,800
frame of reference for. And I learned this, yeah, when I was at London

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,860
Zoo and was going into the basement of the

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,760
old elephant and rhino pavilion, and a rhino stuck its head out from like this gap in

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,660
the wall, and the head was twice the size I thought it was

72
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,240
once you stood next to it. And the same with an elephant. I once stood next to an

73
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,160
elephant closer than you are to me now, and you go, "Oh, they

74
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,680
are so much bigger than I thought." And I think it's similar in

75
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,520
museums. Like even when you get up relatively close to a T. rex

76
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,260
skeleton, there's a bit of space between you and it, and then some

77
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,940
bars. And then it's usually raised up a little bit on a mount, on a little mount

78
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,680
to hold the platform. And then you stand back from that, and you don't

79
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,620
actually get to stand like under them. And when you do

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,540
that, you realize that, yeah, the foot finishes at my knee.

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,800
- So is a T. rex bigger than an elephant? That'd be fair to say?

82
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,860
- Yeah, I mean, a very large savanna African

83
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,440
elephant is five to six tons, and we're looking at seven plus.

84
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,600
And a biped and a carnivore. So

85
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:23,870
yeah, you know, a big lion. A big lion is 200 kilos. So 430 pounds. Yeah.

86
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,740
- Well, that's what, that's why I mean, it's why they consider it to be probably the

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,220
most epic predator in the history of Earth.

88
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,060
- Yeah, I mean, and I think more than that, it's I think it's one of the most iconic animals

89
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,300
period. I mean if you, if you're listing things that the average person has

90
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,020
heard of: lion, elephant, giraffe, tiger, hippo,

91
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,960
rhino. There's a few more, but T. rex is coming somewhere up in that

92
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,030
list. That, that's how prominent it is as an animal.

93
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,520
So yeah, it's, it, it's almost inescapable as a

94
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,420
paleontologist. And then doubly so for me, who works on dinosaurs, and doubly so again,

95
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,195
'cause I do work on tyrannosaurs. But yeah, it just dominates conversations.

96
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:07,276
- Well, some of the other features, maybe we can go through.

97
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:07,664
- Yeah, sure.

98
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:10,885
- So big skull, big head, small hands.

99
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:17,385
- Massive head. Very kind of boxy. It's very robust. Big forward-facing

100
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:21,445
eyes. Massive eyes. Massive. I mean, tennis

101
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:25,086
ball-sized eyes. These things had amazing eyesight.

102
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:28,756
Yeah. Giant teeth. There's a cast of a-

103
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:29,206
- What?

104
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:30,456
- ...Tyrannosaurus rex tooth.

105
00:06:30,476 --> 00:06:30,676
- What?

106
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:31,496
- Yeah, I know. So-

107
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:32,126
- How...

108
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:36,106
- It, it looks a bit bigger than it is. So this is all root, so this would be stuck in the jaw. This would be supporting it.

109
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:37,496
- Right. But that tip part is-

110
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:37,626
- But that-

111
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:38,195
- ...that's the tooth?

112
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:39,976
- The tip, as you call it.

113
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:45,286
And, yeah, you know, so that would comfortably go through pretty much any part.

114
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:46,026
- Wow.

115
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:49,906
- And then you realize just how thick it is. So this is a cast of a

116
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,746
thing called Carcharodontosaurus from Africa. You get it down in

117
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:55,635
Niger and a few other places like that.

118
00:06:57,036 --> 00:07:00,895
And they're very, very big. Not as big as T. rex, but not a

119
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:04,426
million miles away. And then if you look at the teeth in profile, they're a

120
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:08,296
surprisingly similar shape and not far off in size as

121
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:11,776
well. And then you look at them that way on, and you realize it's

122
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:16,436
a third of the width. So this isn't just massive,

123
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,486
it's thick. And of course, being thick, it makes it strong. And with

124
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:24,296
that giant head, with all that extra bone and then all the extra musculature

125
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:27,916
attached to that giant head, they've got this uber-powerful

126
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:36,076
bite and the ability to just chomp through basically anything it wants to.

127
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:40,116
So yeah, they are truly unusual in that regard, even actually compared to a lot of the

128
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:43,895
other very big tyrannosaurs, they're often a kind of step above

129
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:45,515
in their proportions.

130
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:47,536
- So, incredible crushing power in the jaw?

131
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:51,216
- Yeah. And then, as you say, like this really short, bull neck, 'cause you've got this

132
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:54,316
massive weight of this head up front that you need to hold it up and not tip

133
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:58,036
forwards. Really quite a massive body. Again,

134
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:01,895
there's two or three other big carnivorous dinosaurs which

135
00:08:01,936 --> 00:08:05,765
people argue, oh, maybe they're a little bigger than T. rex, maybe they're a little smaller, but it's

136
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,656
always in terms of length, which is one way of looking at things. You know,

137
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:11,135
pythons are very long but

138
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:15,596
they're nothing like as massive as, yeah, a lion or a tiger. Same

139
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:19,345
thing. T. rex is massive. It is built. So really

140
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:23,316
big kind of barrel-shaped chest, making the body very, very big

141
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:27,196
as well. And so that's why, yeah, there's things like Giganotosaurus and

142
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:30,876
Mapusaurus from South America. Maybe they get a bit longer, another

143
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:34,796
meter or so in length. But in mass, we're talking about maybe

144
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:38,336
only two-thirds, three-quarters. So T. rex is just massively bigger

145
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:42,345
than basically any other big carnivore we know of.

146
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:47,056
And then, yeah, little arms, as you say. So this is a, not great, but

147
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:51,016
it's a cast of a T. rex arm. It's not the biggest animal.

148
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:54,896
They do get a bit bigger than this. But as I love showing, it's not a

149
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:58,736
million miles off the size of my own. And

150
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:03,415
I could do with a diet, but I don't weigh seven tons. So

151
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:07,246
yeah, it really is really pretty small.

152
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:08,516
- Two claws, two fingers.

153
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:12,456
- Yeah, so two fingers. You will see sometimes that they say there's a third.

154
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:15,976
This is a slight misnomer. So you do see this extra little bone here?

155
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:20,356
This doesn't turn up in all of them, and it's an extra hand bone.

156
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:24,016
So it's these, the metacarpals. But it's not supporting an extra digit.

157
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:27,016
- So mostly functionality-wise, it wasn't very functional.

158
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:30,836
- They're not doing very much at all. This is what's called the

159
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:34,456
deltopectoral crest. It's really important for big

160
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:38,456
arm movements because it's deltoids and pectorals. The radius and

161
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,456
ulna are really quite thin, thinner than ours. The fingers are pretty stocky.

162
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:46,156
The claws look big and curved, and they are, but

163
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:50,576
other tyrannosaurs, and indeed other carnivores generally,

164
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:54,415
have much more curved claws. And then they have these

165
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:58,396
little things, oh, where can I say it? There, there you can see there's a little mark.

166
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:02,236
That's a ligamentous pit. And so what you can imagine is,

167
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:06,996
if you're trying to hold onto something and something's wriggling, you want grip.

168
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:11,486
And there's a risk that you'll just dislocate your fingers. So we have

169
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:15,516
ligaments that hold bone to bone. And if you just put it

170
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:19,376
flat to flat surface area, there's only so much you can attach. Whereas if you turn

171
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:25,036
that into a little hemispherical dip, you get a lot more surface area for your area.

172
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:25,815
If that makes sense.

173
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:26,704
- Yeah.

174
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:30,636
- So if you have a really big ligamentous pit, it means there's a really big ligament,

175
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:34,336
which means your fingers are really strong and they're really resistant to being

176
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:38,116
wiggled around and pulled, as if you've grabbed something that doesn't want you to kill

177
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:41,435
it. Well, T. rex has probably the smallest ligamentous pits of any

178
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:45,316
tyrannosaur. So that kind of suggests it's not doing very

179
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:49,226
much. And again, when you look at the claws, proportionally, they're not that big and

180
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:52,756
they're not that curved. So even though it looks like quite a wicked

181
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:56,675
thing to us, remember, put this on a seven-ton animal

182
00:10:56,716 --> 00:11:00,296
whose individual teeth are the size of entire fingers.

183
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:03,256
Suddenly that arm doesn't look like it's doing very much.

184
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,435
- What about the feet?

185
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:08,236
- So massive. Again, not surprisingly, you're supporting a

186
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:12,156
colossal amount of weight. But they have this beautiful

187
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:15,556
adaptation in the foot. So the equivalent bones in the foot, the

188
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:19,536
metatarsals, for us make up the flat of the feet. But these animals walk

189
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:23,396
like birds. They got three toes on the ground and then the metatarsals stick nearly

190
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:27,376
vertically. That overall extends the length of the leg, so you can walk a

191
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:31,296
little bit faster. You get a slightly bigger stride length. Don't worry,

192
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,336
I've got the right bone here.

193
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:34,816
- Nice.

194
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:38,826
- But they also have... Yeah, there's a good one. That one's a great one. But

195
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:42,716
they also have this really neat adaptation in the middle bone. So you

196
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:46,336
can see it on this one quite well, and that this is actually not a

197
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:50,116
tyrannosaur, this is an ornithomimosaur. So one of the really

198
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:54,096
ostrich-like ones, Gallimimus from the first Jurassic Park. It has the

199
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:57,695
same thing. You can see the normal bones would be really quite long and

200
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:01,435
square and then flat at the top. And instead, this thing shrinks in the

201
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:07,175
middle and turns into this kind of flattened diamond shape. And what that means

202
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:11,256
is... the bones either side kind of lock it. In

203
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:15,316
fact, at the top end, it actually tends to wiggle a bit. So it actually goes left and

204
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:19,026
then right. And of course, what that really does is then help these things

205
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,826
lock together. And so this is an adaptation to basically lock the

206
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:26,596
foot and make it stable, and we see it in a whole bunch of things,

207
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:30,316
independently evolved. Early tyrannosaurs don't have this. Early ornithomimosaurs don't have

208
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:33,646
this. The oviraptodiraurs, the early ones don't have this, and the later ones

209
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:38,116
acquire it, and a couple of other groups as well. And it's about making the foot

210
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:41,816
stable. And what that really does is make the foot energy

211
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:45,616
efficient. So you can imagine, as an animal, you know,

212
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:49,596
we have some cartilage and we've got some ligaments and tendons joining all the bones

213
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,606
together and holding joints stable. When you push down,

214
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:57,625
that's going to compress them to a little degree, and when you lift that weight off, they're

215
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:01,456
actually going to spring back. You're going to get a tiny little energy return. It's the

216
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:05,036
idea of those air soles they put in all the trainers and

217
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:08,476
stuff in the 90s. It's that same principle.

218
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:13,276
And you will. You'll get a little bit of energy return, but of course, big

219
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:16,616
force, particularly for a big, heavy animal, it's going to take the path of least

220
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:20,156
resistance. And so if your bones are all kind of loose in the

221
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:24,136
foot, what they're going to do is they're going to tend to splay out, and you're actually going to lose

222
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:28,116
that energy. But if you lock the feet together, the bones can't

223
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:32,106
move and instead, that's going to further compress those

224
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:35,636
soft tissue bits and give you a bit more spring.

225
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:39,556
- And this is all about... I mean, this is about the mobility, about the dynamics of the

226
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:40,116
movement.

227
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:43,436
- It makes you more efficient. It means you're putting less energy in to

228
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:47,996
walk, because you're just getting a little bit of spring of every single step.

229
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:51,936
- I should say that I deeply admire people like Russ Tedrake, like the Boston

230
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:55,536
Dynamics teams, like the Tesla Optimus robot teams

231
00:13:55,556 --> 00:14:00,496
that look at bipedal and quadruped robot movement.

232
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:04,256
And they try to make human-like movement to, you know, basically

233
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:08,196
efficient movement. And so the question here is, how the hell is a

234
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:16,116
T-Rex its size, bipedal, able to move as a predator? It's a weird body shape,

235
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:16,816
is it not?

236
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:20,696
- I mean, the big head makes it look more odd, but you

237
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:27,675
look at dinosaurs as a whole, and over a third, probably 40, 45% is the group called

238
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:31,675
theropods, which were all bipeds, so T-Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor,

239
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:35,596
Spinosaurus, many, many others that people may have heard of, they're all bipeds

240
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:39,436
built in this way. There's a whole bunch of ancestral groups which were doing something very

241
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:43,376
similar, including various crocodiles or relatives of crocodiles,

242
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:47,016
and then the birds are bipeds. Birds are actually doing it in a much

243
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:54,256
weirder way than theropods are. Theropods are basically a lizard on its back legs.

244
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:59,336
I'm oversimplifying a lot. I can hear paleontologists screaming, as I've just said,

245
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,276
"It's a lizard standing up." It's not a lizard standing up, but they're doing a lot of the same

246
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:07,236
stuff in the same way, and that is really functionally about where

247
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:11,036
you put muscles, because what you really want to do to walk

248
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:14,996
forwards is you want to basically pull the leg back

249
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:17,576
so that you're pushing the body off.

250
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,826
And the way they do that is the musculature on the tail. We don't have a

251
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:25,656
tail, and indeed, mammals that even do have a, you know, elephants and even

252
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:29,136
lions, it's a piddly little thing. There's not a lot of muscle there.

253
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:32,956
But if you look at a lizard, particularly if you look at something like a crocodile, you see this

254
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:36,456
massive, massive block of muscle sitting on the first

255
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:41,156
third to half of the tail. And that's what dinosaurs

256
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:45,175
are doing. It's the same thing as lizards and crocs. They have this giant set of muscles on

257
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:49,165
the first half of the tail that's anchoring on the femur, so the thigh bone, on the

258
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:52,716
back of that, and muscles contract. That's the one thing they

259
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:56,596
do. But now you've got a giant muscle. And T-Rex, this muscle is

260
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,436
like two and a half, three meters long.

261
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:03,896
It's going to be like this wide in the middle. So when that contracts,

262
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:07,836
the leg goes back, the foot's stationary on the ground, so the animal goes

263
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:08,306
forwards.

264
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,276
- So the tail is...

265
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:11,596
- integral to movement.

266
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:14,116
- ...so it's a huge part of the biomechanics of the movement.

267
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:18,116
- Yeah, we do it with the butt. So we're kind of weirdly how

268
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:21,956
we organize our muscles. But this is

269
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:25,815
generally probably a better way of doing it, because you can get a really long

270
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:29,586
muscle. And of course, the longer the muscle, the more contraction you can have.

271
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:33,466
The hyper version of this is kangaroos. So kangaroos supposedly get more

272
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:37,195
efficient the faster they move. They get so much energy return

273
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:41,556
that when they're moving faster, they get more compression from the

274
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:44,216
landing, meaning they get more spring.

275
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:48,736
- So we should be imagining this gigantic thick tail, big body,

276
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:49,116
- Oh, yeah.

277
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:49,806
- ...big head.

278
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:50,695
- Yep.

279
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:56,316
- ...and biped. And how fast does it move?

280
00:16:56,396 --> 00:17:00,185
- So this is one of those things that's gone backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards.

281
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,106
There was a paper arguing that we'd probably been overestimating various

282
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:08,086
speeds, primarily based on footprints. There's been I don't

283
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:12,056
know how many papers trying to do T-Rex speed. The most

284
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,675
recent one that was pretty detailed I think had it clocked

285
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:23,296
at... So I think it was 25 miles an hour, so 40 kph was the very

286
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:27,776
upper end of the estimate. So probably a bit less than that.

287
00:17:27,816 --> 00:17:29,636
- Well, that means it can move.

288
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:33,496
- Yeah, so that's the thing.

289
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:37,325
Big things move quick. I've seen rhino and hippo going at

290
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,286
full tilt, and yeah, they're a lot quicker than you'd

291
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,936
think. And at least part of it is simply stride length. When

292
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:48,776
your legs are three-ish meters long, it's hard

293
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:51,656
not to cover a lot of ground with a single

294
00:17:51,816 --> 00:17:55,796
step. And yeah, big theropods, T-rex is going to

295
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:59,526
be a power walker. It's not going to run in the conventional

296
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,106
biomechanical sense, where both feet are off the ground at once.

297
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:03,336
- So it's not running. It's power walking.

298
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:07,116
- Yeah. But when you've got a four or five meter long stride,

299
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:10,936
it doesn't really matter whether you're airborne or not.

300
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:15,272
- Power walking, so you're never... So, or running,

301
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:19,092
there are moments in time when both feet are off the ground, and you're

302
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:22,392
saying likely here one foot is always on the ground.

303
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,392
- Yeah, pretty much has to be for loading.

304
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:27,752
- Oh, just because of the mass of the thing? Okay. All right.

305
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:30,292
- You know, that's the origin of cinema?

306
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:30,962
- What's that?

307
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:34,692
- It's where... This is Eadweard Muybridge. So the

308
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:38,672
origin of cinema was a bet as to whether or not,

309
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:42,032
while running, a horse had all four feet off the ground.

310
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:45,952
And no one really knew this for sure. And a guy called Eadweard Muybridge,

311
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,832
he was British, but he was living in the States. He was a keen

312
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:52,862
photographer, and he basically did what people have

313
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:55,722
seen the Wachowskis do for The Matrix. He set up a whole row of

314
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:59,622
cameras and set up a whole bunch of triggers and had a horse run through

315
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:03,512
them, so it took loads of photos. And lo and behold, in one of them, the

316
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:07,522
feet were off the ground. The guy won his bet. But he also realized that we already had things

317
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:11,812
like zoopraxiscopes, you know, the little thing you spin with a slit?

318
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:16,552
So you see the... Right. So he did that with horses. And now you have

319
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:21,192
a moving photograph. And that's pretty much the origin of cinema, was...

320
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:22,812
a bet about biomechanics.

321
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:26,312
- Yeah, it's always a good question and a bet, and there you go.

322
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,072
You're off to the races.

323
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:30,892
All right, all right, so we're standing in front of this thing.

324
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:31,642
- Yes.

325
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:34,752
- How screwed are we, you and I? We're back in the time of the

326
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:38,212
dinosaurs. What's the probability of our survival?

327
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:42,252
- There's two big things to weigh up, which are going to be interesting, which is,

328
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:46,352
would they even consider us a potential meal?

329
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:50,512
Because we know that animals have never encountered things. Animals have to

330
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:55,302
learn stuff. And so animals that have never encountered things before are often...

331
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:59,852
They don't have a response because they don't know what their response should be.

332
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:03,292
- We should say during that time, there was not something that looked like primates.

333
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:05,502
- No. Absolutely nothing. We, we-

334
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:06,102
- So we would look very weird, right?

335
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:12,552
- We would look weird, yeah. So, you know, there's lots of really cool records of,

336
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:16,632
particularly you've got down in Indonesia and stuff,

337
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:20,392
where you've got these insane volcanic spires, and it leads to these tiny little

338
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:24,412
valleys. And people go in there, and they go, "Yeah, the animals walk up to us."

339
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:28,132
They've never seen a human. They don't know what it is.

340
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:32,052
So it might look at us, and... Animals are fundamentally

341
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:35,732
cautious. It doesn't know if we're a threat.

342
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:39,432
So maybe it might just find us weird or in some way,

343
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:43,412
shape or form off-putting, and so we may not even

344
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:47,332
be considered on the menu. The other thing

345
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:54,892
is we might be too small. My suspicion is we're not.

346
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:58,612
So animals, carnivores typically take stuff that is much, much smaller than them,

347
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:02,552
despite basically every dinosaur documentary movie

348
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:06,592
ever shows T-rex hunting an adult Triceratops, which is, like, the same size as

349
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:10,432
it. And every documentary, you gotta have lions taking down a wildebeest or even a

350
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:14,352
buffalo. Like, these are weird and rare outcomes. These

351
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:18,472
don't usually happen. The vast majority of active predation

352
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:22,472
is on stuff much, much, much smaller than you. I totted some of this up

353
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:26,612
for a paper I did on Microraptor, this really small gliding dinosaur from

354
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:30,492
China, where we actually have a bunch of specimens with various stomach contents in them.

355
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:34,252
And we were coming up with numbers of about, like, 5 to 20% of the mass being

356
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:38,192
typical, so prey versus predator. And that's

357
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:42,152
actually very similar to what we see with modern carnivores, and it's not

358
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:45,592
far off what we've seen even with things like tyrannosaurs, where you occasionally

359
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:49,532
find consumed bones from prey. So,

360
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:53,392
if we put the lower end of that as 5% of the mass of a T-rex, we might actually

361
00:21:53,512 --> 00:22:00,132
be okay. If it doesn't consider us worth the hassle, then

362
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:05,012
assuming you're encountering a big adult and not a half-size one

363
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:09,402
that maybe only weighs a ton, then we might be all right.

364
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:13,192
- What would be the survival strategy? So there's a thing that you criticized

365
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:17,772
as not being true that I, I guess in Jurassic Park, not moving.

366
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:21,392
- Yeah, it's nonsense. They can see really well. Like I said, like,

367
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:25,232
T-rex has giant eyeballs. People don't realize

368
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:29,132
that 'cause, like whales and like elephants, it looks small compared to

369
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:33,092
the size of the animal, but what you're saying. And really important for vision is

370
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:38,732
absolute size, not proportional size. And absolutely, their eyes are gigantic.

371
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:40,382
- Probably the biggest on Earth at that time.

372
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:44,092
- Yeah. A guy called Kent Stevens did a paper, and he's got a really nice

373
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:48,412
graphic of it. If you just put Stevens T-Rex,

374
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:52,262
there, it's the one with the... There we go.

375
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:55,592
It's the one with the googly eyes. That's a baseball or a tennis

376
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:59,442
ball-sized eyeball. And when you think about the

377
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:03,412
incredible visual acuity of something like an eagle, which has eyes

378
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:07,072
not much bigger than ours, think about what that's going to

379
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:10,682
do. And we absolutely know, there's been loads of studies on this

380
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:14,002
in mammals and birds and other things as well.

381
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:17,972
that basically eyeball size correlates with visual

382
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:21,762
acuity. And that can fold in two different ways. It can be like general

383
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:25,772
sharpness. Like, how well can you see a long way away?

384
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:30,812
So eagles and vultures, it's really important. Or it can be good in low light.

385
00:23:30,832 --> 00:23:34,762
- And I now discover that there's a Nature Was Metal- ...subreddit-

386
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:35,752
- On Reddit, yeah, for-

387
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:36,622
- ...which is looking at-

388
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:39,912
- ...gnarly, gnarly paleo things. Yeah, I come across it occasionally.

389
00:23:39,972 --> 00:23:44,232
- For dinosaurs, let's see what's the top post of all time.

390
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:45,772
- Oh, that's a glyptodontid.

391
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:51,282
- An Argentinian farmer recently found a 20,000-year-old fossilized glyptodont.

392
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:55,092
- So these are giant armadillo-like animals with club tails.

393
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:56,192
- Interesting. Wow.

394
00:23:56,252 --> 00:24:00,192
- Oh, that's Black Beauty, and that's at the Royal Tyrrell Museum. So giant

395
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:04,152
eyeballs, they can either see very well, they can see a very long way in daylight, or they

396
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:08,032
can see very well at night. And my suspicion is it's the latter. I think they're

397
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:11,852
probably primarily nocturnal, when they get that size.

398
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:15,792
- Well, not moving might be a good strategy because it's cautious because it doesn't understand

399
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:17,032
what these- ...primates are.

400
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:20,552
- Yeah. But I think if it starts coming towards you,

401
00:24:21,432 --> 00:24:25,404
...if you're truly in the open, then you're in real trouble

402
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,884
and I'm not sure what you do.

403
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:31,824
I mean, the one thing, the one advantage humans have over almost

404
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:36,344
anything else on Earth, there's a handful of exceptions, is we have

405
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:39,584
range. I can pick up a rock and hurl it with reasonable

406
00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:43,624
accuracy. Most things can't do that, and

407
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:47,644
animals probably don't like being hit in the face or hit in the eyes with a rock

408
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:51,924
at a range because, again, they're not going to know how it's happened or how to

409
00:24:51,944 --> 00:24:54,384
respond to this. All they know is they're taking damage-

410
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:58,624
...and that's bad. And that might genuinely be enough to do it. I

411
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,624
wouldn't want to try, but again, if I was

412
00:25:02,504 --> 00:25:06,364
dumped on a plain or a prairie with nothing else but a T-rex that was interested in

413
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:10,113
me, it's worth a shot. If you're in the

414
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:14,104
forest, I would try and get behind a tree. They're quite good at

415
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:18,124
turning. There's been a couple of nice papers looking at the mechanics of the foot

416
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:21,894
and the ankle and how quickly they could pivot.

417
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:26,293
But we're much better because we're just so much smaller. So it

418
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:29,884
would be very kind of Looney Tunes, but I think you could go round and round a big

419
00:25:29,924 --> 00:25:34,844
tree- ...yeah, but much faster than it could. And so,

420
00:25:35,854 --> 00:25:39,184
...it's going to get bored or lack interest sooner or later.

421
00:25:39,244 --> 00:25:42,184
- So let's zoom out. What did it eat?

422
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:45,944
- I mean, you could go for the classic joke of whatever it wanted, but the

423
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:51,164
reality is the relatively big herbivores that are around at the time,

424
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:56,064
it's probably largely leaving them alone because, again,

425
00:25:56,124 --> 00:25:58,004
just the classic dynamics of

426
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,924
predators even like, quote, super predators, like Tyrannosaurus, they're still

427
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:07,844
real animals. If you get injured and you can't hunt,

428
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:11,704
that's probably the end of you. So you don't want to

429
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:15,374
tackle an adult Triceratops that weighs the same as you and has

430
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:19,894
meter, a meter and a half long horns on its head and

431
00:26:20,804 --> 00:26:24,284
it's potentially pretty aggressive, and then even the

432
00:26:24,304 --> 00:26:28,104
big, so the Hadrosaurs, the kind of classic duck-billed dinosaurs, they're

433
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:31,613
not, they're not present with any like obvious defensives. They don't have armor.

434
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:35,604
They don't have horns or spikes or anything like this, but they're simply massive.

435
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:39,624
Again, you know, yes, T-rex has got the teeth and the bite and

436
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:43,644
even if they're a bit rubbish with the claws on the hands, but like just grappling another

437
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:47,543
animal which is the same size as it, there's a risk you're going to get a foot trodden

438
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:51,484
on, that it's going to get off some kind of body slam or whatever. And then even if you

439
00:26:51,604 --> 00:26:55,594
do bring it down, you're never going to eat it. Like if you,

440
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:59,184
you bring down an animal that weighs five tons, it's nearly your own

441
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:03,024
mass. You're not going to eat it before it goes rotten. That's a huge amount of kind

442
00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:06,984
of, not like wasted energy, but you've probably put a lot of effort into this and

443
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:10,804
you're not getting that much reward out. And again, there are,

444
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:14,704
again, there are exceptions. You've got things like lynx are the classic one. Lynx are not

445
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:17,543
very big cats and yet they'll hunt adult deer

446
00:27:17,864 --> 00:27:21,364
way bigger than them. Lions hunt things like

447
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:25,324
buffalo, but they're operating in a group, so it's a bit of a cheat. So

448
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:29,164
there are some things that do this, but fundamentally, the vast majority of carnivores

449
00:27:29,244 --> 00:27:33,004
tackle stuff that's way, way smaller than them, and that's what we see.

450
00:27:33,104 --> 00:27:36,924
Every record we have of basically any large carnivorous

451
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:40,464
dinosaur where you have stomach contents, whether it's like

452
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:44,184
consumed something or healed bite marks, we get quite a, we get a

453
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:48,264
quite a few. There's a handful of them where there's an obvious damage to a

454
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:52,004
bone, in more than a couple of cases with a tooth broken off in the

455
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:55,944
bone, and then the bone has healed over it, so you know, it

456
00:27:56,024 --> 00:28:00,344
got away. They're, they're juveniles. They're relatively young animals.

457
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:04,654
And that's what they're targeting. It makes

458
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:09,064
ecological sense. It's what modern animals do for very good reason.

459
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:12,754
Juveniles are relatively small and weak. They don't have the horns or

460
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:17,004
frills or armor or shields and other stuff. They're naive. They

461
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:20,284
don't, they have, you often have to learn what predators are or you have to

462
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:24,043
learn how to avoid them or to check the wind

463
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:28,064
or even physically see them before you know, see them kill

464
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:31,844
something else before you know that they're a threat. And juveniles forage

465
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:35,904
badly. They're relatively inefficient, so actually they need to eat

466
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:40,063
more for their size than an adult does. And on

467
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:43,934
top of that, they're not very experienced at foraging in the right areas. And even if they can

468
00:28:43,944 --> 00:28:47,184
find a good patch, the adults will often beat them up and chase them off.

469
00:28:47,244 --> 00:28:49,714
- You're talking about juveniles across various species?

470
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:53,464
- Everything. This is just a universal pattern of being a smaller animal versus a

471
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,554
larger, or a younger animal versus a larger animal.

472
00:28:55,624 --> 00:28:58,104
- So, so hunting young, uh-

473
00:28:58,124 --> 00:28:58,684
- Young things.

474
00:28:58,764 --> 00:28:59,944
- ... young things is easier.

475
00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:00,354
- Yeah because-

476
00:29:00,354 --> 00:29:01,024
- Because they're dumb.

477
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:02,714
- Right. They're dumb, but they're inexperienced.

478
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:03,344
- Inexperienced.

479
00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:07,354
- But they're often feeding in suboptimal areas. So this

480
00:29:07,404 --> 00:29:11,144
is the place with all the best food. The adults will kick you off, so now you have to feed somewhere

481
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:15,084
else. Maybe the food isn't as good, in which case you need to eat more of it, so it takes

482
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:18,534
longer, or maybe it's the one next to the edge of the forest where the

483
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:22,404
T-rexes hide. But either way, you're stuck there and then you

484
00:29:22,424 --> 00:29:26,264
don't really know what you're looking for and you haven't got the armor, so guess

485
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:28,764
who's getting eaten? Like this is,

486
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,844
again, there's lots of exceptions. You can't have nature without things like that.

487
00:29:32,864 --> 00:29:36,754
But this is the absolute rule of thumb for how foraging and

488
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:40,104
growth and predation operate across everything from

489
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:44,604
fish to starfish, fish as predators, starfish, praying

490
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:48,444
mantis, all the way up to things like big cats via stuff like crocodiles.

491
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:52,354
It's how it works, so it'd be very weird if it didn't also

492
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:56,144
operate for dinosaurs. And as I say, we've actually got the direct evidence for this

493
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:59,864
from bite marks and stomach contents. They're taking small stuff.

494
00:29:59,904 --> 00:30:04,244
- Bite marks give a lot of information. That's a powerful signal in paleontology.

495
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,644
- Yeah, absolutely. I've done really quite a lot of work on it and they can

496
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:13,964
tell you an awful lot if you've got the right understanding of the burial conditions,

497
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:17,944
because you, weird thing that I think a lot of people don't appreciate is

498
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:21,924
you basically can't take fossils at face value, particularly when you're trying to

499
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:27,632
get into stuff like behavior and ecology. So between the animal

500
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:31,412
dying and the paleontologist digging it up, potentially

501
00:30:31,472 --> 00:30:35,252
quite a lot has happened, and that's where it's really

502
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:39,142
easy to start misinterpreting things because if you just go...

503
00:30:39,152 --> 00:30:43,052
I had one like this not too long ago where I was an editor on a paper, and the authors had

504
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:46,732
done a pretty good job, to be fair, but it was this discussion of

505
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:50,412
whether or not several animals were together at the time of their death.

506
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:54,742
So multiple theropods together in this

507
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:58,712
quarry, and it's like, right, but there was loads of debris, and you had loads of

508
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:02,572
things like fish scales and other small bones, and it's like, okay,

509
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:06,432
but this looks like these animals potentially died somewhere

510
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,392
else, and then a flood or a river washed them into

511
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:14,192
this bay or a channel or the water level dropped and they ended up

512
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:18,432
together, but that doesn't necessarily mean they were together when they

513
00:31:18,472 --> 00:31:23,722
died. And so just 'cause you've got three animals together,

514
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:27,312
what is potentially the story of how they got there?

515
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:30,811
- So you have to consider multiple explanations and then try to figure out what is the most

516
00:31:30,912 --> 00:31:31,352
likely.

517
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:35,342
- Yeah, or what can you test with various bits of evidence? So there were

518
00:31:35,372 --> 00:31:39,052
some tyrannosaur-inflicted bite marks on a duckbill

519
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:43,072
from Mongolia that I worked on years ago.

520
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:47,052
The specimen was from Mongolia, but it was held in Japan in a Japanese museum.

521
00:31:47,092 --> 00:31:48,492
I was working with the Japanese on it.

522
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:53,312
I'm not a taphonomist or the study of decay and the history of specimens.

523
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:56,972
I am in no way, shape, or form a geologist. I did zoology for my degree,

524
00:31:57,492 --> 00:32:01,252
but the guys I was working with, they were really hot on

525
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:05,682
erosion and damage, and they were looking at some of the

526
00:32:05,752 --> 00:32:09,652
way the bones had been damaged, and they're like, "Okay, we're pretty confident that

527
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:14,332
the bite marks are sitting on top of erosion."

528
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:15,292
- What does that mean?

529
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:19,212
- So it means that the animal had died, and it was found in a it was

530
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:22,992
found in sand-covered, but in what would have been a river channel.

531
00:32:23,492 --> 00:32:26,232
So this animal has died, washed downstream, ended up on a

532
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:30,662
sandbank. The sand is whipping past 'cause I've been in a sandstorm in-

533
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:34,881
in China. It is not fun, and that's starting to etch some of the

534
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:36,252
bones and damage them.

535
00:32:36,312 --> 00:32:37,752
- And after that, there's a bite mark?

536
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:40,942
- After that, you're getting bite marks coming in. So that

537
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:41,122
- Oh, man.

538
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:44,812
- can only be scavenging. That thing has been dead and sitting out for

539
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:48,972
days, possibly weeks, before something came along and chewed on it.

540
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:49,112
- Wow.

541
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:51,152
- It pretty much can't have happened any other way.

542
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:54,812
- And you have to take these really subtle signals to-

543
00:32:54,852 --> 00:32:54,921
- Yeah.

544
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,022
- to reconstruct the story.

545
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:59,541
- But then you can start piecing some other stuff together. So in this

546
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:03,092
case, the skeleton is pristine. It's one of the best hadrosaur

547
00:33:03,212 --> 00:33:06,962
skeletons out there. It's certainly the best from Mongolia I've ever seen.

548
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:10,992
And all the bite marks are on one bone, the humerus, the upper arm bone.

549
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:14,292
Every mark- we went over the rest of the skeleton, nothing. And then the humerus is

550
00:33:15,312 --> 00:33:19,072
chewed to bits. There's bites all over it, but when you look,

551
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:23,452
there are two really distinctive patterns. There are deep

552
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:28,662
circular punctures. Remember what the shape of this thing looks like, at the ends.

553
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:33,682
And then along the deltopectoral crest, okay, it's much, much bigger in a hadrosaur,

554
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,592
but this bit, remember, that's where all the big muscles attach. There are all of these

555
00:33:37,652 --> 00:33:41,492
types of- this is from a different bone, but a different animal, but all these types of close

556
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:47,892
parallel scratches. And so that looks like selective feeding because it's using its

557
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:51,852
giant crunchy teeth at the ends to get the bone

558
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:55,732
off, and this is off a buried skeleton.

559
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:59,632
then it's got these- actually, T. rex has really small teeth at the front of

560
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:02,932
its mouth, right in the front where our incisors are. They're called

561
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:06,812
incisiform teeth. They look like incisors. They're a fraction of the

562
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:11,092
size of the big ones, and they've got a really weird flat back.

563
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:17,911
And that's what these are. It's hidden this with the front of the mouth and pulling.

564
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,351
- And that's mostly for eating?

565
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:23,292
- Yeah, and that's why it's just on the deltopectoral crest, 'cause that's where all the muscles are.

566
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:27,661
So I always liken it to getting something like an Oreo, and you take the

567
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,541
top off and then you scrape the cream out with your teeth.

568
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,992
I think most people have done that.

569
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:37,112
Right, but that's what it's doing. So it's got this little row of teeth-

570
00:34:37,402 --> 00:34:41,351
...and everywhere you get lots of muscle, you get little rows of

571
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:42,552
teeth together, pulling.

572
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:46,492
- So there's different bite marks for sorting, fighting, killing, and

573
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:48,371
then there's different bite marks for eating.

574
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:51,052
- Yeah, so it kills and dismembers with the big teeth up the side-

575
00:34:51,362 --> 00:34:52,962
...and then it feeds with the little front teeth.

576
00:34:52,992 --> 00:34:55,661
- And all of that has evidence? In the bones?

577
00:34:56,462 --> 00:35:00,112
What hunting strategy does it use? Can we figure that out?

578
00:35:00,212 --> 00:35:04,522
- So that comes down to that foot stuff. Um,

579
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:09,222
they're relatively efficient compared to a lot of other things.

580
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:12,852
And particularly compared to the herbivores, so that means they're probably looking at long

581
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:16,832
distance rather than speed, and that makes sense 'cause even though the kind of stuff

582
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:20,692
we're talking about, like I said, maybe they get into 20, 25 miles an hour. That's

583
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:24,592
pretty quick, but some of the smaller stuff is going to be a lot faster than

584
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:28,612
that. And remember, that's a real upper estimate. They're- they're probably not that

585
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:30,872
quick, but yeah, almost-

586
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,552
- They're just jogging after you.

587
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:37,582
- Right, but they've got the distance, so yeah, so it's much more, uh-

588
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:41,972
...hyena or wolf-like strategy than like a

589
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:45,912
cheetah going for hyperspeed or a lion going for a relatively quick

590
00:35:45,952 --> 00:35:49,832
burst, and it either gets you or it doesn't. And then people

591
00:35:49,872 --> 00:35:53,812
kind of then just go, "Well, like, but that's ridiculous. Like, they're not even that quick," and it's like, yeah,

592
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:57,492
but if you're hunting something big that's not that

593
00:35:57,552 --> 00:36:01,192
quick either, and so that's a misconception. Like when I'm talking about juvenile

594
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:04,512
dinosaurs, I don't mean just out of the egg and weigh a

595
00:36:04,552 --> 00:36:08,472
kilo. Like a juvenile Triceratops can still weigh a ton-

596
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:13,112
...and be the size of a rhino. They're not that fast, and

597
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:16,492
again, if you get a head start on them because, as I said, I suspect they're

598
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:22,072
nocturnal. That's the other thing, it's really hard to hide a T. rex, even

599
00:36:22,212 --> 00:36:25,091
lions and tigers struggle to kind of hide in long

600
00:36:25,372 --> 00:36:31,436
grass. When you're three and a half, four meters tall, you can't

601
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:35,296
hide. Maybe in a forest, but even then, you're probably going to stick

602
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:39,316
out, and it's going to be hard to maneuver between the trees. We've got big tyrannosaurs

603
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:43,336
living in what we know to have been relatively open environments. Maybe there's some

604
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:47,216
stands of trees, but it's not a woodland or a forest or anything

605
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:51,256
like that. So they're living in the open and surviving in the open, so they've got to have a

606
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:57,376
way of doing this. I think it's either some combination of being nocturnal, so it's

607
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,956
relatively easy to... "sneak" isn't quite the wrong word, but

608
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:05,716
approach things to cut the distance down for your initial

609
00:37:05,796 --> 00:37:08,956
strike and then just running them down. Because, yeah,

610
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:12,826
maybe a one-ton Triceratops or one-ton Hadrosaur is rather

611
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:16,496
faster than you, but if you've covered the first couple of

612
00:37:16,516 --> 00:37:19,476
hundred meters to get up to your top speed before they start

613
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:23,086
running, then you're probably much closer to

614
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,936
them. Then will they exhaust faster than you'll keep

615
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:30,635
going? Probably not 100% of the time. No predator's that

616
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:34,546
effective. But I suspect that's what they're doing, and it fits with what we know of

617
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:38,516
their size, their vision. They have a very good sense of smell. Again, that

618
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:42,496
makes sense at night. It makes less sense if you're diurnal and operating primarily

619
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:46,316
in the day. You've got to hide this thing, and then we know they're

620
00:37:46,356 --> 00:37:52,356
pretty efficient versus relatively fast but not that efficient prey.

621
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,516
- Well, there's a bit of a debate of scavenger versus hunter.

622
00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:59,196
- They're obviously both. A, because we've got things like the bite marks I just

623
00:37:59,216 --> 00:38:02,756
described, which is pretty much definitive scavenging. Then we've got

624
00:38:02,836 --> 00:38:06,776
the healed bite marks with T-rex teeth buried in bones, which is pretty much

625
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:11,976
definitive active predation. So we've got evidence of it doing both.

626
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:15,436
- But can we possibly figure out what was the primary strategy?

627
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:18,876
- That gets much harder. My guess is they're probably still

628
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:22,836
primarily actively carnivorous. Because if you look at

629
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:26,696
stuff that's reliant on being a

630
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:30,606
scavenger, I mean, the true scavengers, like the vultures and

631
00:38:30,696 --> 00:38:34,036
condors and stuff like this, you have to be ultra-long

632
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:37,836
distance, very energy-efficient travelers. They're

633
00:38:37,976 --> 00:38:41,656
soaring in thermals. They're barely using any energy to

634
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:45,656
fly. It's really hard to get very far.

635
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:49,356
- How far were they spread? Where did they live?

636
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:53,296
- So the ones we've found, you've got them from Alberta

637
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:57,336
down to probably New Mexico. There's

638
00:38:57,516 --> 00:39:01,416
some... I want to say there's some tyrannosaurine, so

639
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:05,316
very close to T-rex, teeth that may or may not be T-rex in New

640
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,816
Mexico. There are similar teeth in Mexico proper, down in

641
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:12,196
Coahuila, so about halfway down Mexico.

642
00:39:12,236 --> 00:39:13,416
- Mongolia also, or no?

643
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:17,496
- So Mongolia, you have a thing called Tarbosaurus, which is a very, very close relative of T-rex.

644
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:21,216
It's the nearest species, or nearest genus, that we have.

645
00:39:21,256 --> 00:39:25,216
genus, that we have. But T-rex is probably

646
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,096
occupying almost all of western North America.

647
00:39:28,656 --> 00:39:31,596
So at times, the east was kind of split off and separate.

648
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:35,836
- But the entire surface of Earth had dinosaurs on it. Well, most of it.

649
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:39,816
- Yeah, we've got them in Antarctica. We've got them in Antarctica even close to the mass extinction event.

650
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:41,276
the mass extinction event.

651
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:45,156
- Just an insane number of dinosaur species all over the Earth,

652
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,176
just the same kind of variety we have in the animal kingdom today, you just have

653
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:50,496
in the dinosaur.

654
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:54,366
- I mean, this is, like, how many dinosaur species were there? I- I mean,

655
00:39:54,396 --> 00:39:56,876
I basically wrote an entire book chapter about this

656
00:39:57,316 --> 00:40:01,276
because there's so many. But this would make the number high, but this would make the number lower,

657
00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:05,276
this would make the number high, but this would make the number

658
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:07,916
lower, counter versus counterarguments,

659
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:12,776
that you can guesstimate almost any number and probably be very accurate or very far out.

660
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:15,096
very accurate or very far out.

661
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:18,716
- Yeah, but we should say that a large number of dinosaur species are constantly being

662
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:19,356
discovered.

663
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:23,216
- Yeah, so we've named, give or take, in the realm of

664
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:26,976
1,500, 1,600 valid species. Though that is, not everyone agrees on every species,

665
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:30,696
not everyone agrees on every species, but most people would be satisfied with that number.

666
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:31,216
number.

667
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:36,356
But we also name in the realm of 40 to 50 a year, and we've been doing that for at least

668
00:40:36,756 --> 00:40:39,976
the last 10, 12 years. That number is rocketing

669
00:40:40,056 --> 00:40:44,036
up. Shows no signs of slowing down. There's loads of are-

670
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:48,006
Like, we still never really explored India very much. We're starting to find entirely new beds in places

671
00:40:48,056 --> 00:40:52,036
new beds in places like Ecuador. Argentina we know has a ton of stuff, but we've never

672
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,056
we know has a ton of stuff, but we've never excavated there very much. Australia,

673
00:40:56,096 --> 00:41:00,046
we know there's a ton of stuff and we haven't excavated there very much. So there's

674
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:05,226
lots of places, even now, to still go through.

675
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:09,016
- This is a good moment to take a brief tangent and look at paleontology. So how do we,

676
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:13,016
how do we find these fossils? What's the magic? What's the science? The art?

677
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,116
the science? The art?

678
00:41:14,176 --> 00:41:18,016
- The same way, more or less, that people did in the

679
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:21,956
1750s or whenever you first start getting them. There's...

680
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:25,856
There's... For dinosaurs in particular, but this is true of the vast majority of stuff,

681
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:29,886
there's essentially two ways of doing it. The simple one is where you have

682
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:32,826
The simple one is where you have

683
00:41:32,936 --> 00:41:36,796
quarries of particularly things like lithographic limestone, so the printing limestones,

684
00:41:36,816 --> 00:41:40,336
the printing limestones, or stuff that's very similar to

685
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:44,296
that sometimes it's often volcanic you get

686
00:41:44,356 --> 00:41:48,296
these super, super, super fine layers of sedimentation. And that's where you get these places of exceptional

687
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:51,446
get these places of exceptional preservation. Whenever you see, like, the feathers, or almost

688
00:41:51,536 --> 00:41:55,476
feathers, or almost always, whenever you see feathered dinosaurs, it's like, "Oh, we

689
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:59,116
got the skin, we got the claws," and the whole skeleton's laid out. So

690
00:41:59,196 --> 00:42:03,056
Archaeopteryx being the first bird is an absolute classic example.

691
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:06,756
it's from these beds. And there you find them by basically splitting limestone. We don't

692
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:10,666
splitting limestone. We don't usually dig for them. It's because there are

693
00:42:10,716 --> 00:42:14,516
quarry workers and people who are already doing this because the

694
00:42:14,596 --> 00:42:18,476
stone is useful, because there might be one decent

695
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:22,456
fossil for every, you know, few hundred tons of rock you shift. In which

696
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:26,336
case, you could get every paleontologist in the world there for a couple of

697
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:29,746
years and you wouldn't find very much. You rely on the fact that hundreds of guys are doing this

698
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:33,126
constantly. And then sooner or later, they'll find something, and then you've got

699
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:40,780
it. That's the super easy way. The only slightly more complicated way is you go to

700
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,700
somewhere where geologically we know it's the right age and it's the right

701
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,300
kind of rock and ideally fossils have been reported from there

702
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,940
before. And again, you know, geologists mapped all the world's

703
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,860
geology years ago in quite a lot of detail. There are gaps, there are

704
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,740
places where we don't have the details, but in general we know. And then you

705
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,060
go there and then you walk around and you look. And that's basically it.

706
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,500
- And you're looking for something that's sticking out of the rock.

707
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,060
- Yeah. So you always get the... So there's

708
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,560
this constant, and I think, you know, borderline

709
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,580
myth of the idea that dinosaurs and mammoths and lots of

710
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,240
other fossil things, like, entered lots of indigenous cultures

711
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,940
because it's impossible that the guys were wandering around,

712
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,380
say, Dakota, and the Native Americans didn't come across

713
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,280
some dinosaur fossils. That I'd agree with. It's pretty much impossible they

714
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,260
didn't come across some dinosaur fossils. Did they come across a whole

715
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:43,200
skeleton laid out on the ground? No, because those don't usually exist

716
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,140
because even if they're tougher, or it doesn't matter if they're tougher or weaker

717
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,590
than the surrounding rock, dinosaur bones

718
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,600
are, you know, in some way, shape, or form, they're lithified. They turn to

719
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,480
rock and they will absorb some of the minerals from

720
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,400
whatever they've been buried in. And so even in places like

721
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,420
Mongolia and Northern China where I've been to, where actually the

722
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,320
fossil bone is quite a lot tougher than the sandstone that it's embedded in.

723
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,280
You can find a bit of bone and pull it out, almost like rub it with your hands and the

724
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,520
sand comes off and there's your bone. They will decay pretty quickly. You know,

725
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,480
sandstorms, you know, sand just etches stuff. The

726
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,440
tiniest bit of moisture, particularly in winter, gets into the cracks. Bones are incredibly

727
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,080
porous. That freezes, that expands, that cracks, bones just

728
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,940
shatter. And yeah, you find shattered bone on the

729
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,730
surface everywhere. What you rarely find is a

730
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,509
decent bone on the surface, let alone a skeleton.

731
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:46,150
- So there has to be something that's sticking out just a tiny bit-

732
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:51,840
- so that you can see it, but it's still buried. Right. And it happens. The

733
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,730
greatest one that I saw, or that I didn't see, it happened

734
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,140
with a friend of mine when we were in Northern China

735
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,740
and he went, "Yeah, I can see a bit of a claw sticking out of a hill." And it was

736
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,820
like this much. You could see

737
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,220
you know, less than a centimeter coming out of a hillside. And

738
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,540
it's like, so you know,

739
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,470
- That's the dream, right?

740
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,320
- Dig a little bit, and there's a little bit more. Dig a little bit, there's a little bit more. Okay.

741
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,100
And then the system we were running there is some guys were searchers and some

742
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,889
guys were diggers. So he and I were searchers. We're told, "Okay, you guys have..."

743
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,000
He found it. "You found something, go and look for something else. We'll dig it out."

744
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,990
And so we come back a couple of days later and check in on the digging team.

745
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,680
"So what is it then?" "Oh, it's a complete skeleton." And it was a thing,

746
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,800
a very, very close relative of Velociraptor. Ended up

747
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,960
naming it Linheraptor, so the raptor from Linher, which was the nearest

748
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,860
town. And it was, yeah, the legs were a little messed up

749
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,590
because water had got to them and the end of the tail was missing and that was about

750
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:56,560
it. So like 90-plus percent complete skeleton, and it had been found

751
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,520
with, you know, five mil, a couple of sixteenths of an

752
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,440
inch of bone sticking out of a hill. And that's what you want, because every

753
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,400
so often behind that is a whole skeleton. If you're looking for skeletons

754
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,310
on the surface, they're going to be gone before you get to them.

755
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,590
- And when it's a near-complete skeleton, you, you did a show of,

756
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,200
Terrible lizards on Stan.

757
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:18,830
- Oh, yeah.

758
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,910
- the T-Rex fossil that sold for $31.8 million.

759
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,330
- Sight and some of them.

760
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:29,980
- So that, that's a nice sort of big adult T-Rex. So looking at a fossil like this...

761
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,980
...so for $31.8 million, what's the excavation process

762
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,320
for when you have a claw sticking out, like you were mentioning, and getting that

763
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,720
whole thing out without damaging the bones? What can you say about that process?

764
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,550
- So it depends where you are. It depends how many people you've got.

765
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,120
It depends on your budget and it really depends on the rock.

766
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:53,120
So again, like going into China or Mongolia, where this little guy's

767
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,500
from, the bone tends to be relatively strong

768
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,200
compared to the sandstone that it's in. That

769
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,960
also, that means that, A, it's fairly tough and resistant,

770
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:07,880
but it also means that it's really easy to

771
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,800
dig. Like again, I've dug stuff by almost like pulling it with my hands or

772
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,540
like getting my fingers in. Getting something like a chisel or a

773
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,280
hammer, you can just cruise through this rock.

774
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,370
- But like, you have to be really careful not to touch the bone, I guess?

775
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,260
- So it depends how strong it is. So again, some bone

776
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,660
is incredibly strong, some isn't because they've all fossilized

777
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,440
differently. What we're usually doing is applying glue to it though.

778
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,320
There's this wonderful stuff called Paraloid, and it's a special glue

779
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,420
for fossils. And I said bone's super porous, so

780
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,590
it's really good at sucking up liquids.

781
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,150
- Oh, so you're basically filling it with glue so it like makes it stronger.

782
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,860
- Yeah, and Paraloid's really great because you can dissolve it with acetone,

783
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,880
and it basically doesn't react with anything. So you can fill your fossil with

784
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,650
glue, but then if you want to take all that glue out, you can pretty much just

785
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,550
dissolve the glue back out again.

786
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,220
- Very cool.

787
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,100
- So, yeah, what you would normally do is for something, say in China,

788
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:13,000
where the rock is relatively soft and the bone's relatively

789
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,930
tough, and where we don't have any, like,

790
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,950
manpower and shipping problems, which is a real issue in other

791
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,200
places, you basically map out where you think the skeleton's

792
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:29,880
going. So in the same way that you were doing it, like, you know, if you can imagine

793
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,730
like a cake or something and someone said, "Oh, put a toy dinosaur in there."

794
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,660
And you've got to find it without damaging it. Sort of like, well, you'd stick your finger in the

795
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,520
cake and just kind of dig until you hit the edge of it and then you go in somewhere else and go in.

796
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,430
And that's what we're doing. We're just going in from kind of all sides. And once you've

797
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,284
hit three or four bones, you kind of know which way it's going into the

798
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:53,564
hillside, usually. Sometimes they're very weird and mixed up.

799
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:57,524
And then you can just almost trace the outline of it. And

800
00:48:57,564 --> 00:49:00,984
then you'll just dig all the way around that, which might involve

801
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:04,764
taking the top off a mountain, depending on where you are.

802
00:49:04,844 --> 00:49:08,834
In the desert, it tends to be a bit easier. But yeah, we've had stuff where,

803
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:12,744
like the first three days is just ten people with pickaxes just

804
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:15,164
digging a hole to get down to the right level.

805
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:18,844
- But sometimes the excavation requires like large equipment, right?

806
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:22,724
- Yeah, we've used jackhammers and stuff. We've used a backhoe and we've just

807
00:49:22,824 --> 00:49:26,804
literally driven it into the desert and just dug a big hole next to the

808
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:30,404
fossil. And then the classic thing of covering it in

809
00:49:30,444 --> 00:49:34,424
a plaster of Paris jacket. Strips of burlap sacking,

810
00:49:34,464 --> 00:49:38,284
plaster of Paris and some water, wooden beams if you want to

811
00:49:38,304 --> 00:49:42,104
make something really big and really solid, and just

812
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:45,504
basically wrap it all up and then take it out.

813
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:50,144
And that's, again, that's what they were doing 150, 200 years

814
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:53,723
ago, that hasn't changed. Where it gets more

815
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:57,754
complicated is if you've got really hard rock that's very hard

816
00:49:57,764 --> 00:50:01,564
to get through, particularly if the bone is fragile. Then it becomes difficult

817
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:05,584
because if you want to get a jackhammer in, the vibrations mean you're

818
00:50:05,604 --> 00:50:08,114
going to shatter your bones before you've even

819
00:50:08,114 --> 00:50:11,554
cut through the rock. So then you might be down to doing it manually.

820
00:50:12,364 --> 00:50:13,464
- And manual is like-

821
00:50:13,504 --> 00:50:19,464
- Yep, hand-chipping it out. Yeah, the other way you end up with that is

822
00:50:20,424 --> 00:50:24,184
like the classic Jurassic Park thing, like, was it the

823
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:28,344
second scene where they're digging in the desert and there's the whole skeleton

824
00:50:28,444 --> 00:50:32,264
laid out and five or six guys all digging around it and exposing

825
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:35,944
it. And that's actually quite common in the States. And the

826
00:50:36,004 --> 00:50:39,824
reason is huge amounts of those excavations are being done

827
00:50:39,984 --> 00:50:43,814
on government land, their national parks or whatever, or protected land.

828
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:48,664
And very often the rules are, you're not allowed wheeled vehicles,

829
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:53,484
full stop, at all, to protect the environment. You can walk in and walk out, but you

830
00:50:53,544 --> 00:50:54,344
can't drive.

831
00:50:55,164 --> 00:50:58,814
And it's like, well, when we're in the desert in Mongolia or in China or

832
00:50:58,844 --> 00:51:02,504
Mongolia, and we're allowed to do this, literally, yeah, my boss drove into

833
00:51:02,544 --> 00:51:06,304
town, hired a guy with a JCB. He drove

834
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:10,244
out, picked it up with a bucket and drove it back into town and put it on the back of

835
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:14,144
a flatbed and we drove it to Beijing. If you're out in a

836
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:18,144
protected area and you can't, you've got two choices. You

837
00:51:18,164 --> 00:51:21,724
can take it out by hand, but that means it's got to be light enough.

838
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:24,194
that half a dozen people can lift it.

839
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,484
Which if it's a block of stone the size of this desk, you know, a couple of meters by a couple of

840
00:51:28,524 --> 00:51:32,424
meters by a meter high, is basically impossible. So that means

841
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,324
you've either gotta carve chunks off, so take the head off, take the

842
00:51:36,444 --> 00:51:40,124
arm off and whatever, and you can get it out that way, but it's not

843
00:51:40,204 --> 00:51:43,624
ideal. There's always the risk of breaking, you're losing some information,

844
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:48,184
and if you wanna make a really spectacular display, you don't wanna join

845
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:53,064
through every big bit of bone. You want to show the public one piece.

846
00:51:53,784 --> 00:51:57,024
So the alternative is to get rid of every bit of rock you

847
00:51:57,084 --> 00:52:01,104
possibly can to make it light enough to helicopter it out.

848
00:52:02,224 --> 00:52:02,234
- Wow.

849
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:06,184
- And so normally... So in China, if we hit that bit of bone

850
00:52:06,204 --> 00:52:09,874
going in, we're just like going in round the sides until we've hit

851
00:52:09,904 --> 00:52:13,544
Take the top off, take the bottom off, and just take it so the

852
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:17,564
skeleton is completely encased in rock and it's as safe and secure as it can

853
00:52:17,624 --> 00:52:21,024
be. And then we'll do the preparation work back at the lab.

854
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:21,984
- That's heavy though.

855
00:52:22,004 --> 00:52:22,113
- But-

856
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:22,884
- That's real heavy.

857
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:26,844
- If you're going to have to lift it with a helicopter and they've got a weight limit of only a

858
00:52:26,904 --> 00:52:30,824
couple of tons or if it's not, then you need to pay twice as

859
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:34,784
much more expensive helicopter, then you take off every gram of

860
00:52:34,824 --> 00:52:36,464
rock that you think you can-

861
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:40,594
... to get the weight down so you can ship it. So it, so it varies

862
00:52:40,904 --> 00:52:44,844
massively. Yeah. Something the size of Stan, that's, that's months of work.

863
00:52:44,884 --> 00:52:48,704
You're, you're probably doing that across three or four years with a team of half a dozen

864
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:49,134
people.

865
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:52,884
- So can we just talk through? Because just using Stan as a case study,

866
00:52:53,024 --> 00:52:58,924
Stan was first discovered in the spring of 1987 by amateur paleontologist, Stan-

867
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:03,324
Skekanson in Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota.

868
00:53:03,364 --> 00:53:06,984
- Yeah. But it was the Larson brothers from the Black Hills Institute who dug it up.

869
00:53:07,004 --> 00:53:10,943
And so they're, they're a commercial outfit, so they dig stuff up

870
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:14,474
to sell it. But they also make casts and sell them.

871
00:53:14,564 --> 00:53:19,804
This, oh, I brought my other... I do have a cast, a cast of one of Stan's teeth.

872
00:53:19,884 --> 00:53:20,004
- Oh.

873
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:24,034
- So like you can buy casts of Stan's teeth. You could buy casts of the head.

874
00:53:24,064 --> 00:53:25,114
you could buy the whole skeleton.

875
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:26,313
- So it's a famous skeleton.

876
00:53:26,313 --> 00:53:30,184
- You see Stan in a whole bunch of different places. There's a Stan just up the

877
00:53:30,224 --> 00:53:32,764
road from here at Oxford. Oxford's got a cast of Stan.

878
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:33,364
- Oh.

879
00:53:34,364 --> 00:53:38,184
- I was just at Lyme Regis the famous fossil locality in the south of the

880
00:53:38,264 --> 00:53:41,864
UK a couple weeks ago. One of the fossil stores has a skull of Stan in the window.

881
00:53:42,164 --> 00:53:45,064
Stan turns up again and again and again.

882
00:53:45,104 --> 00:53:48,504
- So the process as written here involved removing the overlying rock.

883
00:53:48,594 --> 00:53:50,124
...using heavy equipment like a Bobcat.

884
00:53:50,164 --> 00:53:54,084
- Yeah, so we call that the overburden, the extra stuff that's all

885
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:57,744
the rock that's sitting above the layer with our fossil in.

886
00:53:58,244 --> 00:54:02,204
And when you're lucky, that's a foot of sandstone, and you shovel it out in an hour.

887
00:54:02,214 --> 00:54:05,704
And I've seen guys in South America. There was a team in

888
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:09,064
Argentina, I think it was my old boss, Ollie Rowhurst, showed me this.

889
00:54:09,144 --> 00:54:16,564
And they took like 20, 30 feet off the top of a hill to get down to this

890
00:54:16,604 --> 00:54:20,564
fossil, you know. Something, you know, it was

891
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,484
probably half an acre in size, 20, 30 feet of rock.

892
00:54:23,544 --> 00:54:24,964
- This is incredible.

893
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:28,764
I wonder if you could speak to some of these other components: Carefully extracting each fossil bone by

894
00:54:29,024 --> 00:54:32,544
hand with picks and brushes, plotting and diagramming the bones...

895
00:54:32,734 --> 00:54:36,384
...using a grid system at the dig site, wrapping the bones in burlap and

896
00:54:36,404 --> 00:54:40,114
plaster for safe transport to the BHI lab. Some of this stuff you've

897
00:54:40,184 --> 00:54:42,654
spoken to. What's with the diagramming? What's with the plotting and the diagramming?

898
00:54:42,664 --> 00:54:46,444
- So yeah, you may well have seen something like this for

899
00:54:46,504 --> 00:54:50,484
archeology shows or something like that. Nowadays, again,

900
00:54:50,544 --> 00:54:54,536
tech's getting better; people are using drones and stuff for this,

901
00:54:54,896 --> 00:54:58,676
or taking hundreds of photos and then building photogrammetry models.

902
00:54:58,816 --> 00:54:59,976
You just get a 3D model in the computer.

903
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,666
- Or just kind of modeling what we're looking at here.

904
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:05,476
- Yeah, but where you found everything. So it goes back to that stuff we were saying

905
00:55:05,516 --> 00:55:08,676
about the process of fossilization or the process of what's happened to that

906
00:55:08,716 --> 00:55:16,396
animal from death to discovery. A classic thing is bones being in a line.

907
00:55:17,016 --> 00:55:20,516
So you can imagine if, you know, bones are lots of weird shapes,

908
00:55:20,896 --> 00:55:24,286
but mostly, or at least certainly lots of bones, ribs, arms, and

909
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:27,736
legs, things like this, they're quite long bones.

910
00:55:27,816 --> 00:55:31,716
So if they're in a current, they will tend to spin in the axis so that they

911
00:55:31,736 --> 00:55:34,836
are facing the current. So if you're finding all the bones are in a

912
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:38,676
line, that probably tells you that this thing has had quite a lot of

913
00:55:38,716 --> 00:55:40,016
water washing over it.

914
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:40,726
- Mm-hmm. Got it.

915
00:55:40,756 --> 00:55:44,646
- You're then probably going to be missing most of the small bones because the big heavy bones won't

916
00:55:44,656 --> 00:55:48,076
be shifted by that current, but maybe the small ones will.

917
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:52,116
- Oh, so you actually model where the bones, where you're likely to find the bones,

918
00:55:52,176 --> 00:55:52,826
the big bones, the small bones...

919
00:55:52,836 --> 00:55:56,536
- So it might tell you where to go and dig further down the hill, quite

920
00:55:56,595 --> 00:56:00,476
literally, but it can also just tell you, "Okay, this thing, there's

921
00:56:00,616 --> 00:56:04,596
no way this thing died here. It absolutely got moved,

922
00:56:04,676 --> 00:56:07,476
so we need to factor that in when we're trying to interpret it."

923
00:56:07,516 --> 00:56:07,606
- Okay.

924
00:56:07,696 --> 00:56:11,276
- Or we've got this one weird bone and we can't work out what on earth it

925
00:56:11,356 --> 00:56:15,216
is. Well, maybe it's from something else because if we know a whole bunch of stuff washed

926
00:56:15,256 --> 00:56:19,076
together, maybe that's a random bone from a different animal.

927
00:56:19,116 --> 00:56:22,316
- Yeah. Maybe that was eaten or there might be a different story if it was washed

928
00:56:22,996 --> 00:56:23,926
like you were describing.

929
00:56:23,936 --> 00:56:27,836
- Any of that kind of thing. So that's where you want to have as much

930
00:56:27,896 --> 00:56:29,636
information as possible.

931
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:33,316
- It says here, "Once at the lab, the bones underwent more than 30,000 hours of

932
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:36,786
cleaning, preservation, restoration, and documentation." And,

933
00:56:36,856 --> 00:56:40,596
Stan's skeleton is notable for its high degree of completeness,

934
00:56:40,676 --> 00:56:44,536
about 70% by bulk, 63% by bone count, and the

935
00:56:44,576 --> 00:56:48,296
exceptional preservation of its skull, which has become a scientific standard for the

936
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:49,046
species.

937
00:56:49,116 --> 00:56:52,576
- Yeah. So there's this unbelievably beautiful skeleton,

938
00:56:52,596 --> 00:56:58,776
Borealopelta. This is a helicopter lift. Absolutely.

939
00:56:58,796 --> 00:56:58,806
- It's awesome.

940
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:00,396
- Phenomenal preservation from

941
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:00,736
- What?

942
00:57:00,756 --> 00:57:01,625
- Northern Alberta.

943
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:02,656
- What is this thing?

944
00:57:02,696 --> 00:57:05,956
- Its full name is Borealopelta markmitchelli, and it's called

945
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:09,625
markmitchelli, named after Mark Mitchell, the preparator, who

946
00:57:09,816 --> 00:57:13,136
basically spent, I think Mark spent the thick end of two years on

947
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:17,076
this. This was his job. And he did other stuff as well. He's doing some

948
00:57:17,136 --> 00:57:20,976
other prep, he's doing some fieldwork. But Mark basically went in

949
00:57:21,776 --> 00:57:25,616
every day, nine to five, cleaning the rock because the rock was

950
00:57:25,656 --> 00:57:30,056
hard and the bone was soft, and it's extraordinarily well-preserved.

951
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:33,816
- Borealopelta is a genus of plant-eating armored

952
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:37,876
dinosaur. Sure as hell looks armored. This is an incredibly preserved specimen.

953
00:57:37,896 --> 00:57:38,006
- Yeah.

954
00:57:38,076 --> 00:57:41,916
- from the early Cretaceous period, about 112

955
00:57:41,956 --> 00:57:46,296
million years ago, found in what is now Alberta, Canada. Amazing.

956
00:57:46,356 --> 00:57:46,386
- Yeah.

957
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:47,086
- Look at this thing.

958
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:50,876
- So Borealopelta is one of the ones where we've even got some of the evidence

959
00:57:51,016 --> 00:57:54,956
of patterning, and it suggests that it's darker on top and lighter underneath. So this

960
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:58,916
illustration, I think that's, yeah, that's Julius Chattoni did that. He's a Canadian

961
00:57:58,956 --> 00:58:03,576
paleo artist, and so that color pattern is roughly accurate.

962
00:58:03,636 --> 00:58:05,616
- Oh, wow. So this is true to color.

963
00:58:05,676 --> 00:58:05,856
- Yeah.

964
00:58:05,876 --> 00:58:06,926
- And so we can figure out the colors that—

965
00:58:06,936 --> 00:58:11,336
- Well, give or take some very large uncertainties—

966
00:58:11,356 --> 00:58:11,426
- Look at this thing.

967
00:58:11,426 --> 00:58:13,556
- it's going to be something like this.

968
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:14,776
- That's so awesome.

969
00:58:14,796 --> 00:58:16,136
- Yeah. So these guys are—

970
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:17,376
- That's hard to eat, that thing.

971
00:58:17,386 --> 00:58:21,136
- nearly armored pine cones. Yeah. Though it's very much the

972
00:58:21,216 --> 00:58:25,196
adult condition. The juveniles seem to be far less, if not unarmored.

973
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:26,536
- We're back to the juveniles thing.

974
00:58:26,556 --> 00:58:27,756
- Right. So, right, so—

975
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:31,256
So, but that's why we... That armor is absolutely going to be effective

976
00:58:31,316 --> 00:58:35,185
as anti-predator, but it's probably evolved primarily for

977
00:58:35,636 --> 00:58:39,596
combat and display between members of the species because otherwise if

978
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,676
they stopped you being eaten, the babies would have it.

979
00:58:42,316 --> 00:58:46,156
- This fossil is considered one of the best- preserved dinosaur specimens ever

980
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:50,156
found, with armor, skin, keratin sheaths, and

981
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:53,125
even stomach contents all intact. Incredible.

982
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:55,326
And so for that, he really did the work.

983
00:58:55,376 --> 00:58:59,246
- And also found miles and miles and miles out to sea, or

984
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:03,196
the, the paleo sea. So this is from a site which normally gives us big marine

985
00:59:03,236 --> 00:59:06,936
reptiles. So predatory plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs and

986
00:59:07,016 --> 00:59:10,916
and then mosasaurs and stuff like that.

987
00:59:10,956 --> 00:59:14,616
And then it turned up an Ankylosaur. Well, Nodosaur in this case.

988
00:59:14,736 --> 00:59:16,816
- Yeah. Wow. This is incredible.

989
00:59:17,376 --> 00:59:21,256
So, okay. Let's complete the journey of Stan to the museum

990
00:59:21,296 --> 00:59:25,156
to, like, you get, you get to the process of cleaning everything, stitching it all together.

991
00:59:25,196 --> 00:59:28,436
- Yeah. Like Mark suggested, you know, this can be

992
00:59:29,256 --> 00:59:32,896
even with an animal that size. Borealopelta is, you know, four or five meters long.

993
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:36,006
We've only gotten the front two-thirds of it. Yeah. This can be, like,

994
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:37,556
needle-level stuff.

995
00:59:37,596 --> 00:59:39,286
- That's how you get to the 30,000 hours.

996
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:43,096
- Yeah. Exactly that, if it's that quality and you want to get everything

997
00:59:43,316 --> 00:59:46,776
open. And then something like Stan, actually really complicated

998
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:50,216
skull. The skull's full of lots of little bones. The bones are really

999
00:59:50,276 --> 00:59:54,226
fragile. So that just adds to the time. I mean, at least with the Ankylosaurids,

1000
00:59:54,236 --> 00:59:58,216
the skull is just this giant solid block of bone, which makes life a little bit

1001
00:59:58,276 --> 01:00:02,316
easier. So yeah, they're going to put those hours in, and that's really going to help them

1002
01:00:03,196 --> 01:00:06,876
sell the animal, which is ultimately what happened. I mean, Stan sat in the Black Hills

1003
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,636
Institute for decades. I mean, '87, and they sold it in like

1004
01:00:10,676 --> 01:00:14,516
2020, so they had it for 30

1005
01:00:14,536 --> 01:00:18,376
years sitting in their kind of little museum. And then my

1006
01:00:18,436 --> 01:00:22,316
understanding was basically the brothers broke the company up and that's why

1007
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:23,316
they sold it.

1008
01:00:23,356 --> 01:00:26,816
- Yeah. But it was still incredibly surprising that it was sold for 31 million.

1009
01:00:26,876 --> 01:00:31,116
- Yeah. I mean, far more than I think anyone thought it was going to. I mean,

1010
01:00:32,536 --> 01:00:36,496
I, I liken... Well, you know, if you're not buying, like, teeth or an ammonite in

1011
01:00:36,556 --> 01:00:40,406
some small fossil shop, you know, when you're talking about things like whole dinosaurs and whole

1012
01:00:40,496 --> 01:00:44,376
tyrannosaurs, I think it's a bit like the art market in it's worth

1013
01:00:44,396 --> 01:00:47,376
what people will pay for it. And so, you know-

1014
01:00:47,966 --> 01:00:51,796
... plenty of T-rexes had sold for a few million dollars and therefore everyone thought it

1015
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:55,696
would, might be five. You know, ten would be an absurd

1016
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:59,436
sum of money. And then yeah, it, it went for

1017
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,466
30 and it's like, "Okay, well... Two." I was going to say, someone

1018
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:07,206
wanted it that bad, but clearly not two people wanted it that bad, because if only one guy is

1019
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:13,306
prepared to bid 30, then it goes for, you know, a million more than the

1020
01:01:13,346 --> 01:01:17,226
next highest bidder. But presumably, two people, if not three, bid

1021
01:01:17,286 --> 01:01:18,426
it to get that high.

1022
01:01:19,086 --> 01:01:22,686
- Yeah, it was anonymous at the time, but now it's Abu Dhabi's Department of

1023
01:01:22,856 --> 01:01:24,686
Culture and Tourism came out that they were the ones.

1024
01:01:24,696 --> 01:01:25,306
- I know they've got it.

1025
01:01:25,346 --> 01:01:29,406
- And that record has since been beaten, apparently, by, uh...

1026
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:33,326
- by Apex, the Stegosaurus, which I still haven't

1027
01:01:33,406 --> 01:01:36,466
seen, though a friend of mine has sent me some photos of this thing.

1028
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:37,746
- Is it impressive to you, this thing?

1029
01:01:37,846 --> 01:01:41,486
- No, not especially. That's why I can't imagine that it sold for that much. It's a

1030
01:01:41,645 --> 01:01:46,086
really nice Stegosaurus. It's a pretty big Stegosaurus.

1031
01:01:47,026 --> 01:01:47,546
- Well preserved.

1032
01:01:47,555 --> 01:01:51,406
- I've seen other very good Stegosaurus, and I don't understand why that's worth

1033
01:01:52,526 --> 01:01:56,266
that much more than something like Stan. But it shows you the

1034
01:01:56,306 --> 01:02:00,266
market. So, we're here in London. There's a Stegosaurus called Sophie in the

1035
01:02:00,306 --> 01:02:04,125
Natural History Museum in London. Sophie is a young

1036
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:08,136
animal, so she's not very big. I mean, it's a sizable specimen. I'd

1037
01:02:08,246 --> 01:02:12,106
say five-ish, six meters, off the top of my head, total length.

1038
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:15,946
But Sophie's truly exceptional. There's a couple of

1039
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:19,946
plates missing, a handful of ribs, a couple of bones in the tail. I

1040
01:02:19,966 --> 01:02:23,926
think a couple of toe bones. This is, by far, the most complete

1041
01:02:23,946 --> 01:02:24,906
stegosaurus out there.

1042
01:02:25,066 --> 01:02:25,645
- Wow.

1043
01:02:25,686 --> 01:02:28,846
- That sold for, I think, 250,000 pounds, so maybe

1044
01:02:28,886 --> 01:02:35,446
$400,000, about a decade ago. So this has now gone up, like, 100-fold

1045
01:02:36,346 --> 01:02:42,706
for an animal which is quite a bit bigger but is way less complete.

1046
01:02:42,786 --> 01:02:46,266
So, for me, those two things kind of balance out

1047
01:02:46,746 --> 01:02:50,645
because size is always impressive, and that's what the public likes, but also a complete

1048
01:02:50,665 --> 01:02:54,596
one is better than a half a one or two-thirds of one. So yeah. So how has

1049
01:02:54,606 --> 01:03:01,125
the price gone up 100 times, or from 400,000 to 40,000,000 in 10 years

1050
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:03,606
for roughly the same thing?

1051
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:06,286
- A T-rex is a little bit more epic than

1052
01:03:06,296 --> 01:03:06,726
- Well, that's the thing.

1053
01:03:06,736 --> 01:03:06,776
- a Stegosaurus.

1054
01:03:06,776 --> 01:03:08,526
- T-rex has a massive premium on it,

1055
01:03:08,556 --> 01:03:11,836
because it's, yeah, a Stegosaurus is one of those

1056
01:03:11,886 --> 01:03:15,496
top-tier, you know, it's... You can virtually do the list.

1057
01:03:15,526 --> 01:03:22,906
You know, T-rex, Triceratops, Diplodocus, Brontosaurus, Stegosaurus. It's

1058
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:26,746
in that first six or seven. Okay, these days, Velociraptor, thanks to

1059
01:03:26,806 --> 01:03:31,606
Jurassic Park. But it's... Right, there's the list of seven

1060
01:03:31,685 --> 01:03:35,286
or eight things that any random human

1061
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:39,746
who doesn't care about dinosaurs and doesn't know anything about dinosaurs, but they've probably heard of them.

1062
01:03:39,786 --> 01:03:42,886
You know, Stegosaurus is in that list and would have an idea of what it looked like.

1063
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:46,546
Oh yeah, it's got like the big stuff stuck along the back. You'd get that answer

1064
01:03:46,566 --> 01:03:49,926
from almost any, you know, 99% of people on the

1065
01:03:49,986 --> 01:03:57,056
street. But yeah, it's not a T-rex. So how it's worth, yeah, 50% more

1066
01:03:57,746 --> 01:04:00,796
So how is it worth 50% more, and it's not even a particularly complete skeleton, to my

1067
01:04:00,826 --> 01:04:05,056
understanding? I don't get it.

1068
01:04:05,056 --> 01:04:08,935
- Actually, since we're on the topic of money, if I gave you, let's

1069
01:04:08,966 --> 01:04:12,886
say, $10 billion, how would you spend it? I'd force you to spend it

1070
01:04:12,906 --> 01:04:16,645
on dinosaur-related things. How would you spend it?

1071
01:04:16,706 --> 01:04:22,755
- I mean, I'd probably drop half a billion or so on the best museum you'd ever seen.

1072
01:04:22,766 --> 01:04:26,206
- So, put together a museum. You're like one of the great communicators.

1073
01:04:26,236 --> 01:04:31,846
One of the great scientists, and so you would want to push forward the whole field.

1074
01:04:31,886 --> 01:04:31,916
- Yeah.

1075
01:04:31,916 --> 01:04:33,766
- And one of the ways to do that is a great museum, actually.

1076
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:37,625
- Yeah, but you want to... So it's twofold because,

1077
01:04:37,645 --> 01:04:41,506
yeah, there's the communication and the education part of it, which is something I'm massive on,

1078
01:04:41,546 --> 01:04:45,106
and I think research is pointless if you don't communicate it at some

1079
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:48,866
level. I'm not saying everyone needs to communicate everything. If you're working on the

1080
01:04:48,906 --> 01:04:52,666
nuances of a calculation of the volume of a black hole or something,

1081
01:04:52,706 --> 01:04:56,246
yeah, it probably doesn't need a press release or a new museum exhibition. But

1082
01:04:56,286 --> 01:05:00,106
fundamentally, we should be talking about our work. But also, you've got to

1083
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:03,946
store this stuff. Many fossils are fragile. They need to be kept

1084
01:05:04,086 --> 01:05:07,986
not necessarily in climate control, but at least you want a basement

1085
01:05:08,026 --> 01:05:11,706
that is much more even than, you know,

1086
01:05:12,006 --> 01:05:15,926
just sticking it in a box in a warehouse somewhere. So you've got to be able to

1087
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:19,846
store this stuff to be able to study it, or it's kind of pointless.

1088
01:05:19,926 --> 01:05:26,226
But with the rest of that money, I'd buy a ton of land, like the

1089
01:05:26,926 --> 01:05:30,756
quarries that gave us Archaeopteryx in Bavaria and have given us a ton of

1090
01:05:30,806 --> 01:05:34,645
other stuff. I've worked on a load of pterosaurs, the flying reptiles from there.

1091
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:35,836
These stuff are mostly

1092
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:40,326
commercially run or just straight-up privately owned and not being

1093
01:05:40,366 --> 01:05:43,666
commercially run. Someone's just inherited it, and is just sitting on this stuff.

1094
01:05:43,726 --> 01:05:46,926
- So if somebody's building stuff on land, does that threaten the possibility

1095
01:05:47,046 --> 01:05:50,895
of discovering something on it?

1096
01:05:50,926 --> 01:05:55,416
- It's more that they're not necessarily exploiting it with fossils in mind.

1097
01:05:55,426 --> 01:05:59,645
- Presume you have to balance the search efforts and then the land by-

1098
01:05:59,726 --> 01:06:03,446
- Yeah, but you know, one billion on its own would go a

1099
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:07,206
very, very long way, almost infinitely, if you're just creaming off the

1100
01:06:07,286 --> 01:06:11,166
interest and then funding excavations and supporting scientists

1101
01:06:11,206 --> 01:06:15,046
who are already embedded in other museums or other universities or other

1102
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:16,125
research institutes.

1103
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:18,966
- So the rest is for buying up land so that those people can do their work.

1104
01:06:18,986 --> 01:06:22,946
- Yeah, you look at somewhere like, you know, Brazil, and there's... I can never remember the name

1105
01:06:23,006 --> 01:06:26,866
of it, but there's, again, one of these zones of exceptional preservation where

1106
01:06:26,946 --> 01:06:30,866
superlative pterosaurs, fish... We've had a handful

1107
01:06:30,906 --> 01:06:34,746
of dinosaurs and a whole bunch of other stuff has come out, and it's just a giant

1108
01:06:34,806 --> 01:06:38,766
commercial mining operation. And yeah, when they hit a fossil when

1109
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:42,766
they think they're close to it, yeah, they stop and pull it out and they'll send it to

1110
01:06:42,806 --> 01:06:46,306
a museum, and more often they'll sell it to a museum, and museums only have so much

1111
01:06:46,346 --> 01:06:48,826
money. Whereas what if I owned that quarry

1112
01:06:49,645 --> 01:06:53,526
and then I made sure everyone who worked there was trained and got a bonus every

1113
01:06:53,566 --> 01:06:57,486
time they found anything and then I just handed everything they dug

1114
01:06:57,526 --> 01:06:59,046
up straight into a museum?

1115
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:01,956
- So there would be some element of a crowdsourced paleontology or...

1116
01:07:01,986 --> 01:07:05,732
- Yeah, but it's more that like no researcher ever needs to...

1117
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:09,482
spend money to access that. No museum needs to go and find a new

1118
01:07:09,522 --> 01:07:13,332
donor to give them half a million to go and buy this

1119
01:07:13,422 --> 01:07:18,752
one specimen, knowing that it might still go, yeah, to some Silicon Valley

1120
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:22,982
billionaire's foyer or whatever. It's like, "Well I own the land,

1121
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:27,761
so it's mine, so problem solved." Like, that's what's in my head.

1122
01:07:27,902 --> 01:07:31,682
- It just would be wonderful to scale up the effort to where we can map

1123
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:35,542
out the whole, sort of, story of this time, because it's such a fascinating

1124
01:07:35,582 --> 01:07:37,761
time in the history of Earth.

1125
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:40,761
- I've jokingly written a couple of times about

1126
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:44,862
how all science funding in the world should go to paleontology.

1127
01:07:45,702 --> 01:07:49,542
And the idea being that, like, if you want to investigate black

1128
01:07:49,582 --> 01:07:56,511
holes or neutrinos or chemical crystallography or

1129
01:07:57,802 --> 01:08:00,982
panda genetics or whatever it is, you can do that

1130
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:05,682
any time you want. That's not gonna

1131
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:10,642
change a million years from now as it will from tomorrow.

1132
01:08:11,562 --> 01:08:15,122
But fossils are in places that erode, and if we don't dig them up,

1133
01:08:15,662 --> 01:08:19,642
they're gone. So we should dig all the

1134
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:23,562
fossils up now and then we've got forever to study them.

1135
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:27,402
But if we don't dig them up now, who knows, maybe there's something twice the

1136
01:08:27,421 --> 01:08:31,202
size of T-Rex and it sat on a hillside for six months and then the wind

1137
01:08:31,242 --> 01:08:35,082
got to it and it's gone and that was the only one that ever preserved. Well,

1138
01:08:35,122 --> 01:08:38,392
we'll never know now. To be clear, this is a joke.

1139
01:08:38,392 --> 01:08:42,062
I'm not suggesting we should stop doing cancer research and physics and other

1140
01:08:42,162 --> 01:08:45,822
things, but it is, we're in a fundamentally different field

1141
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:48,862
where our science is literally disappearing.

1142
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:52,182
- Yeah. I mean, I know it's a joke, but there's some truth to it. And,

1143
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:56,211
on the flip side, one of the things, one of

1144
01:08:56,242 --> 01:09:00,022
the hopes is that technology will somehow ease the search and discovery

1145
01:09:00,122 --> 01:09:03,022
process, but as you said, so far most of it...

1146
01:09:03,032 --> 01:09:03,822
- It hasn't. Yeah, I mean...

1147
01:09:03,841 --> 01:09:04,202
- So far.

1148
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,082
- Yeah. You know, Jurassic Park '93, you've got that little scene where they've

1149
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:12,022
got the, like, thumper or something they call it, and it hits the ground and seismic,

1150
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:15,242
and then they go, "Look, look! Here's the whole

1151
01:09:15,301 --> 01:09:18,421
skeleton." They tried it. It doesn't really

1152
01:09:18,682 --> 01:09:21,862
work. We've tried looking for stuff with

1153
01:09:21,921 --> 01:09:25,341
drones. That helps you getting into some inaccessible

1154
01:09:25,482 --> 01:09:29,022
areas, but until the resolution is probably better,

1155
01:09:29,622 --> 01:09:33,242
you've still got that problem of, like, looking, you know, with human

1156
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:37,192
eyes which are binocular, and being able to, you know, just tilt

1157
01:09:37,192 --> 01:09:40,412
your head completely changes how you see something in a way that flying

1158
01:09:40,482 --> 01:09:44,412
over just won't. I know they've

1159
01:09:44,442 --> 01:09:48,182
tried looking... So because the bones are porous, they tend to suck things

1160
01:09:48,261 --> 01:09:52,381
up, so actually dinosaur bones can be really radioactive if they're in areas

1161
01:09:53,202 --> 01:09:53,881
where there are

1162
01:09:55,182 --> 01:09:59,142
things like uranium. So yeah, there are drawers which have lead boxes

1163
01:09:59,222 --> 01:10:02,862
around them and stuff like this for dinosaur bones, or just signs saying, "Do not

1164
01:10:02,942 --> 01:10:05,422
handle." They're very low-level radioactive.

1165
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:09,372
Like, you'd have to stick it in your pocket for six months to run any real risk.

1166
01:10:09,402 --> 01:10:12,952
But they're radioactive, much more so than the background. So can we do

1167
01:10:13,022 --> 01:10:19,562
that? Hmm, turns out, not really. So again, maybe tech will advance.

1168
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:20,782
- But for now-

1169
01:10:20,822 --> 01:10:20,982
- Right, and-

1170
01:10:20,992 --> 01:10:22,322
- ... humans are quite incredible.

1171
01:10:22,402 --> 01:10:25,722
- Yeah, we are. But also, paleo's kind of at the bottom of the

1172
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:30,452
pile, you know. There's not many of us. We don't have a lot of funding.

1173
01:10:30,462 --> 01:10:34,402
It takes real money to adapt stuff. So, you know, like, we're scanning stuff

1174
01:10:34,422 --> 01:10:38,282
with MRIs and things like that in hospitals, but it mostly doesn't

1175
01:10:38,322 --> 01:10:42,242
work very well because the problem you've got is, like I said, the bones

1176
01:10:42,501 --> 01:10:45,902
take on some of the properties of

1177
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:49,682
the minerals in which they're embedded, which means their

1178
01:10:49,722 --> 01:10:53,522
density is really similar, and things like MRIs or

1179
01:10:53,602 --> 01:10:57,562
seismic activity is basically looking for differences in density. What if it's the

1180
01:10:57,602 --> 01:11:01,362
same density as the- you know, it's like I put some green plasticine in some

1181
01:11:01,402 --> 01:11:05,282
blue plasticine, there's gonna be a bit of a join and they're gonna be very, very

1182
01:11:05,322 --> 01:11:09,302
slightly different. But ultimately, you're not gonna be able to detect

1183
01:11:09,382 --> 01:11:14,222
that through most means if you're looking for density or mass or anything like that.

1184
01:11:14,262 --> 01:11:17,922
- Well, I personally think that there's few things as important to

1185
01:11:17,962 --> 01:11:21,762
understand as the history of life on Earth.

1186
01:11:21,802 --> 01:11:24,611
There's like books, right? There's like a-

1187
01:11:24,632 --> 01:11:28,562
or maybe you could think of it as chapters, and then one of the chapters is the time of the

1188
01:11:28,622 --> 01:11:31,212
dinosaurs- and then there's a great extinction, so it just goes up and up.

1189
01:11:31,222 --> 01:11:35,182
- I mean, that's not a million miles off. I think Darwin had an analogy like

1190
01:11:35,262 --> 01:11:39,342
that of we've got a few words on a few pages

1191
01:11:40,482 --> 01:11:44,242
spread out, but between them you get an idea of what the

1192
01:11:44,302 --> 01:11:45,802
story is and where it's going.

1193
01:11:45,842 --> 01:11:49,802
- I think what humans don't quite realize is we may end up

1194
01:11:49,822 --> 01:11:53,482
being just a chapter in a book. It might be our

1195
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:57,041
extinction event, self-created, perhaps a nuclear war,

1196
01:11:57,082 --> 01:11:59,762
perhaps robots take over, perhaps we don't know.

1197
01:11:59,802 --> 01:12:03,662
- Well, or dumb luck. I mean, the dinosaurs were doing absolutely fine until

1198
01:12:03,742 --> 01:12:06,982
a dirty great rock hit them and you

1199
01:12:07,102 --> 01:12:11,082
can't, you know, Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis movies aside, there's

1200
01:12:11,162 --> 01:12:13,652
only so much you can do about that.

1201
01:12:13,652 --> 01:12:14,842
- Hey, you take that back.

1202
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:20,702
There's nothing they can do wrong. All right. Quick pause. Bathroom break?

1203
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:27,502
We've taken a few tangents, but let's continue on the thread of T-Rex.

1204
01:12:27,722 --> 01:12:33,372
Go to the skull. So the skull of T-Rex is iconic. You describe it as

1205
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:36,302
being incredibly robust and overbuilt.

1206
01:12:36,362 --> 01:12:40,202
- Yeah. There's a lot of bone on there. So we mentioned a couple of other

1207
01:12:40,242 --> 01:12:44,102
things, like Giganotosaurus, is this, you know, giant carnivore. If you put

1208
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:47,818
Giganotosaurus T-Rex in- That's the one. So that's, yeah, that's from my old blog.

1209
01:12:47,858 --> 01:12:49,487
It's not my image. Um...

1210
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:50,918
- What are we looking at, on the left and the right?

1211
01:12:50,928 --> 01:12:54,718
- So you've got T-Rex on the left, in orange, and Giganotosaurus on the right, in red.

1212
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:58,117
As I said, they're pretty similarly sized, but just look at the

1213
01:12:58,157 --> 01:13:01,458
robusticity. Like, the front of the snout of T-Rex is all

1214
01:13:01,518 --> 01:13:05,378
bone. And yet, the major openings, there's a thing called the antorbital fenestra,

1215
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:09,098
the opening in front of the orbit, is absolutely massive in Giganotosaurus. It's like

1216
01:13:09,178 --> 01:13:12,718
half the skull. The opening at the back of the skull is much

1217
01:13:12,758 --> 01:13:16,407
bigger. The opening in the lower jaw is much bigger. And actually, the

1218
01:13:16,518 --> 01:13:20,358
jaw, what you can't see, side to side, is much thinner. So

1219
01:13:20,418 --> 01:13:23,847
their heads are the same size, and as animals, they are about the

1220
01:13:23,918 --> 01:13:27,798
same linear dimensions. But you can just see, there's just way

1221
01:13:27,878 --> 01:13:30,518
more bone in the T-Rex.

1222
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:31,027
- It's incredible.

1223
01:13:31,038 --> 01:13:34,998
- So it's not overbuilt; it's obviously evolved that this is the

1224
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:38,898
right amount of bone for the stresses and strains, for what it's doing and how it's acting.

1225
01:13:38,918 --> 01:13:42,077
But you compare it to anything that's not a very large

1226
01:13:42,098 --> 01:13:45,818
tyrannosaur, and suddenly you see just how much bone

1227
01:13:46,038 --> 01:13:49,818
has gone into it. It is a very large... It's an absolutely

1228
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:53,737
large head, but it's a very heavy head with a lot of bone. And a lot of that bone

1229
01:13:53,778 --> 01:13:57,378
is there to resist all the forces of all the muscles, because it has this giant,

1230
01:13:57,438 --> 01:13:59,958
super-powerful bite. Which again, you can see in the teeth.

1231
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:02,197
- So the bone and the muscles kind of evolve together...

1232
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:03,068
- Yeah, yeah.

1233
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:06,987
- ...to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. So you need this kind of structure for the power that,

1234
01:14:07,348 --> 01:14:07,898
...the crush has.

1235
01:14:07,918 --> 01:14:11,878
- So one of the big things tyrannosaurs have... And this goes all the way

1236
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:15,858
down to the earliest tyrannosaurs were like our size. Like little diddy

1237
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:19,818
things, like two, three meters long, be a meter and a half tall.

1238
01:14:19,898 --> 01:14:23,798
But they have fused nasals. So the pair of bones that,

1239
01:14:23,878 --> 01:14:27,518
in us there's not a lot there, but obviously in something like a dog or something like a baboon with a long

1240
01:14:27,577 --> 01:14:31,438
nose, it's like the whole top of the snout. And there's two, one each side.

1241
01:14:31,478 --> 01:14:35,157
In tyrannosaurs, they fuse together, so it forms a solid bit of

1242
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:38,918
bone. So the whole top of the nose is solid. And then that makes the

1243
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:42,947
skull just fundamentally more rigid and able to take

1244
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:46,858
more power through it. The very early ones weren't super biters, I suspect,

1245
01:14:46,878 --> 01:14:50,638
but they do also have the little flattened teeth at the front, so

1246
01:14:50,758 --> 01:14:54,638
I strongly suspect the fused nasals, at least originally, is

1247
01:14:54,697 --> 01:14:58,577
for resisting that. If you've got a long nose and you're pulling with quite a lot of

1248
01:14:58,617 --> 01:15:03,098
force at the very tip, that's going to bend your snout. So, strengthen that.

1249
01:15:03,378 --> 01:15:06,918
- Can you speak to the evolution from the smaller to the bigger of the

1250
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:10,668
T-Rex? What were some of the evolutionary pressures? What's the

1251
01:15:10,778 --> 01:15:11,327
story of the evolution?

1252
01:15:11,338 --> 01:15:15,327
- So tyrannosaurs go back to the Middle Jurassic. Tyrannosaurs were around

1253
01:15:15,338 --> 01:15:18,697
for a hundred million years, so from about 160-ish,

1254
01:15:18,998 --> 01:15:22,888
165-ish million years till the extinction, 66.5 I

1255
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:26,838
think is the current dating on that. So yeah, you've got a hundred million years of

1256
01:15:26,878 --> 01:15:30,638
them. And the Middle Jurassic, annoyingly, is probably the bit of the

1257
01:15:30,678 --> 01:15:34,648
Mesozoic, so the whole dinosaur period, that we know the least of.

1258
01:15:34,718 --> 01:15:38,468
Just by chance, we just don't have many rocks exposed of the right age that

1259
01:15:39,218 --> 01:15:43,098
are fossil-bearing. But we've got two or three tyrannosaurs from

1260
01:15:43,157 --> 01:15:46,898
that time. And yeah, they're really quite diddy. They'd

1261
01:15:46,938 --> 01:15:50,858
be chest-high to us, two or three meters long, including the tail.

1262
01:15:50,878 --> 01:15:54,138
Probably more like three, a lot of them. Little

1263
01:15:54,197 --> 01:15:57,678
heads, long arms. They look every other

1264
01:15:57,718 --> 01:16:01,418
carnivore going. There's not a lot special to them,

1265
01:16:01,518 --> 01:16:05,237
at this point. They've only just separated from their

1266
01:16:05,298 --> 01:16:08,938
nearest groups, which is actually something like the ancestors of Giganotosaurus,

1267
01:16:09,018 --> 01:16:12,918
actually. They do have the fused nasals early on. They do

1268
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:16,697
have these special little teeth at the front of the jaw very early on. They're

1269
01:16:16,758 --> 01:16:19,688
feathered early on, definitively. We have

1270
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:24,858
skeletons with feathers on them that are early tyrannosaurs,

1271
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:28,718
at least until the Early Cretaceous.

1272
01:16:28,737 --> 01:16:32,278
But yeah, they're knocking around as relatively small animals in Europe and Asia.

1273
01:16:32,298 --> 01:16:36,188
We have a couple from the UK. We have a whole bunch from China. There's stuff from

1274
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:39,708
like Kyrgyzstan and places like this. I think there's one, a relatively early one from

1275
01:16:39,737 --> 01:16:43,697
Russia. And then when they get into the

1276
01:16:43,778 --> 01:16:47,678
Early Cretaceous, they start getting quite a bit bigger. So someone like

1277
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:51,168
Yutyrannus, if you want to... There you go. So Yutyrannus is

1278
01:16:51,218 --> 01:16:56,958
fuzzy. We have three specimens definitively feathered. It gets

1279
01:16:57,548 --> 01:16:59,418
to six, seven meters long.

1280
01:16:59,798 --> 01:17:03,538
- There's something funny-looking about the sexy, smaller, earlier version of the

1281
01:17:03,617 --> 01:17:03,998
T-Rex.

1282
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:07,518
- But again, this is seven, eight meters, maybe weighs half a ton or a

1283
01:17:07,598 --> 01:17:11,478
ton. Like, we are very much on the menu for an animal that size.

1284
01:17:11,518 --> 01:17:15,358
And it's massive and dangerous. Quite what triggered

1285
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:19,258
them... There are general patterns in evolution of size change, and one famous one

1286
01:17:19,298 --> 01:17:23,258
called Cope's Rule, I've worked on a fair bit, which is the idea that over time, things tend to

1287
01:17:23,298 --> 01:17:27,288
get bigger, and they do for various different reasons, one

1288
01:17:27,318 --> 01:17:30,898
of which is just pure, almost, like, diffusion. If you start small and you

1289
01:17:30,978 --> 01:17:34,678
evolve, well, you can't get much smaller, but you can always get

1290
01:17:34,718 --> 01:17:38,678
bigger. So you'll naturally kind of diffuse away. Whereas if you're a

1291
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:42,418
blue whale, you probably can't get much bigger, and its descendants will probably end up

1292
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:46,418
being smaller. But there are reasons that bigger things do better. You

1293
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:49,558
can hunt more stuff. You are more energy-efficient. You can move more

1294
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:53,298
efficiently. You're dominant in contests,

1295
01:17:53,318 --> 01:17:57,278
particularly with conspecifics. If you're trying to win a territory or win mating

1296
01:17:57,338 --> 01:18:01,178
rights, bigger things usually beat up smaller things. So there's going to be

1297
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:04,918
selection favoring them. But then big things don't usually do well in

1298
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:08,848
extinction events, so that tends to reset the clock by killing off the big stuff, and

1299
01:18:08,878 --> 01:18:10,458
then smaller stuff does better again.

1300
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:12,598
- So mostly, there's evolutionary advantages, but-

1301
01:18:12,608 --> 01:18:16,157
- But a fairly big one. So yeah, it's the classic thing of there's a

1302
01:18:16,278 --> 01:18:20,117
day-to-day advantage of being bigger, and that might last for a few million

1303
01:18:20,138 --> 01:18:24,117
years, right up to the point that suddenly there's the biggest drought the Earth has encountered

1304
01:18:24,178 --> 01:18:27,727
in five million years, and then all the big stuff just gets nailed.

1305
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:31,678
- Oh, so we should probably say, is this accurate to say that the bigger you get, the fewer of

1306
01:18:31,758 --> 01:18:33,197
you there are?

1307
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,938
- There are, yeah. There's just less fundamental space, you know? There's

1308
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:40,498
more mice than there are elephants. There are more elephants than there are

1309
01:18:40,558 --> 01:18:45,657
whales. Like, there is only so much biomass that an ecosystem can support.

1310
01:18:45,697 --> 01:18:50,378
- And bigger things are just worse at repopulating in extinction events-

1311
01:18:50,407 --> 01:18:54,197
- Right, so they're less likely to survive because they need more fuel. You

1312
01:18:54,237 --> 01:18:58,098
know, what would feed a mouse for a year won't feed an elephant for a week. So

1313
01:18:58,157 --> 01:19:02,154
if... And, of course, the mice are going to have an easier time finding a few

1314
01:19:02,193 --> 01:19:05,824
little seeds than an elephant's going to find tons of food, and then they've got less

1315
01:19:05,894 --> 01:19:09,794
genetic diversity. There might be 5,000 mice, there might be 200

1316
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:13,794
elephants, so who's likely to have more genes or who's likely

1317
01:19:13,834 --> 01:19:16,794
to have selection acting on those genes to produce a

1318
01:19:16,834 --> 01:19:20,494
survivor? Well, the one with five or ten or a thousand times the

1319
01:19:20,534 --> 01:19:23,954
population. And then, on top of that, you've then got the very slow

1320
01:19:23,994 --> 01:19:27,834
reproductive cycle which then, again, gives evolution not a

1321
01:19:27,894 --> 01:19:31,754
lot to work with if, as an elephant, you're breeding once every five

1322
01:19:31,794 --> 01:19:34,594
years, and as a mouse you're doing it once every eight weeks.

1323
01:19:34,634 --> 01:19:40,754
- What can we say about the evolution of just the massive bone-crushing power of-

1324
01:19:40,834 --> 01:19:46,934
- So that starts kicking in seriously, kind of Eotyrannosaurus up. So

1325
01:19:47,094 --> 01:19:50,914
that's when you start getting not just bigger animals that are getting to a

1326
01:19:50,974 --> 01:19:54,934
comparable size to the other big dinosaur carnivores of the time, you start

1327
01:19:54,974 --> 01:19:57,974
getting those bigger heads. But even then,

1328
01:19:58,494 --> 01:20:02,423
relatively late in tyrannosaur evolution, so getting into the middle part of

1329
01:20:02,454 --> 01:20:06,313
the Late Cretaceous, you see a split and we have a group called the

1330
01:20:06,354 --> 01:20:10,294
Alioraminous which have really, really long, thin

1331
01:20:10,374 --> 01:20:14,354
skulls and they look much more like a kind of, here's a Velociraptor,

1332
01:20:14,394 --> 01:20:18,374
they look much more like a giant Velociraptor-ish than a

1333
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:22,114
tyrannosaur. Still relatively small arms but

1334
01:20:22,434 --> 01:20:26,414
it's a very long snout. And so this is a fast-biting animal with a

1335
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:30,054
relatively light bite, so it's probably taking really quite small stuff

1336
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:33,134
proportionally. And then the other side you've got the

1337
01:20:33,174 --> 01:20:36,874
tyrannosaurines which are the really big-headed

1338
01:20:36,974 --> 01:20:40,884
ones. And so that is few ancestral things like Albertosaurus and

1339
01:20:40,974 --> 01:20:44,834
Gorgosaurus, both from Alberta, but then

1340
01:20:44,894 --> 01:20:48,874
Daspletosaurus, a thing I named called Jiuchengtyrannos in China, and

1341
01:20:48,914 --> 01:20:52,834
then Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. And you've really only got three or four

1342
01:20:52,874 --> 01:20:56,534
of these ultra-giants, which are all kind of 10 meters

1343
01:20:56,674 --> 01:21:03,614
plus in size and then have the really broad skull with a real kind of excessive bite

1344
01:21:03,654 --> 01:21:07,594
force. But even things like Albertosaurus, which

1345
01:21:07,693 --> 01:21:10,904
is, I mean, a big animal, seven, eight meters, yeah, a ton or

1346
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:14,773
so. They're not quite T-rex but they're definitely more robust

1347
01:21:14,874 --> 01:21:18,854
than the other contemporaneous carnivores. So

1348
01:21:18,914 --> 01:21:22,744
there is this progression of getting bigger, getting a bigger

1349
01:21:22,834 --> 01:21:25,554
head, the teeth get bigger but there's fewer of them,

1350
01:21:26,354 --> 01:21:30,313
building up the bone biting and the power. But

1351
01:21:30,354 --> 01:21:34,233
with some interesting evolutionary offshoots, in the way that, yeah, cats

1352
01:21:34,273 --> 01:21:38,114
are largely much of a muchness but then you get things like, well, like bobcats and

1353
01:21:38,174 --> 01:21:39,273
lynx which are actually

1354
01:21:40,154 --> 01:21:43,974
quite bulky, stocky little cats that don't have the long tail and are doing something

1355
01:21:44,014 --> 01:21:45,334
quite different.

1356
01:21:45,374 --> 01:21:49,294
- Can you just speak almost more generally? Because T-rex is

1357
01:21:49,514 --> 01:21:53,094
sort of one of the great apex predators of history on

1358
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:56,794
Earth. How does an apex predator evolve? Why did T-rex

1359
01:21:56,934 --> 01:22:00,914
win? Why isn't everybody, why isn't there, like, a vicious race to the top

1360
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:01,224
and everyone's-

1361
01:22:01,224 --> 01:22:05,684
- I have a problem with the term apex predator because

1362
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:13,383
ecologically, apex predators are generally defined as things that eat other

1363
01:22:13,394 --> 01:22:17,313
predators. So a great white shark is because it's

1364
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:20,764
eating stuff like tuna and sea lions which are themselves

1365
01:22:20,874 --> 01:22:24,134
predators, so it's a predator of predators. Whereas

1366
01:22:25,233 --> 01:22:28,773
people love saying lions are apex predators and they love saying T-rex is an apex

1367
01:22:28,813 --> 01:22:32,773
predator. They're eating herbivores. This is not some weird and unusual thing.

1368
01:22:32,874 --> 01:22:35,874
They're the largest predator in their

1369
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:39,894
ecosystem and they are a giant one. My friend, Darren Naish, has

1370
01:22:40,494 --> 01:22:42,934
moved to using the word arch predator, so it's like some kind of

1371
01:22:43,974 --> 01:22:47,854
massive thing but avoiding the term apex because I think that

1372
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:52,074
leads into a... It's a subtle terminology thing, but like-

1373
01:22:52,094 --> 01:22:55,804
- An important one. I just learned something new today. I didn't understand, I thought I

1374
01:22:55,894 --> 01:22:58,804
was using the word apex predator as meant that, but that's what

1375
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:01,874
- But that's because everyone keeps using it when I don't think they should.

1376
01:23:01,914 --> 01:23:01,964
- All right.

1377
01:23:01,964 --> 01:23:05,834
- And now you're getting into linguistics and it's like, well, if everyone uses it to mean that,

1378
01:23:05,874 --> 01:23:09,744
does it now mean that rather than what it should mean? And then I'm probably losing that argument

1379
01:23:09,834 --> 01:23:13,733
because actually you'll probably find way more stuff calling it an apex predator than you will

1380
01:23:13,773 --> 01:23:16,134
an arch predator, but here we are.

1381
01:23:16,174 --> 01:23:18,693
- Arch predator, beautiful. I learned something today.

1382
01:23:18,714 --> 01:23:18,724
- It's-

1383
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:22,094
- But that you're saying T-rex didn't eat other predators?

1384
01:23:22,103 --> 01:23:25,834
- Well, it's probably not going to. So we can get

1385
01:23:25,874 --> 01:23:29,693
into, though I'd prefer not to 'cause it's tedious, the argument of whether or not there's

1386
01:23:29,733 --> 01:23:33,284
these small things which some people have said is a different group called Nanotyrannus, or a

1387
01:23:33,434 --> 01:23:37,004
different species called Nanotyrannus. But fundamentally,

1388
01:23:37,034 --> 01:23:40,754
T-rex is definitely weird, even compared to all the other

1389
01:23:40,824 --> 01:23:43,674
giant tyrannosaurs that are very closely related to it,

1390
01:23:44,534 --> 01:23:51,554
because it is by far, ludicrously by far, the largest carnivore in its ecosystem.

1391
01:23:52,214 --> 01:23:52,794
So-

1392
01:23:53,134 --> 01:23:54,733
- So it doesn't really have competition actually?

1393
01:23:54,794 --> 01:23:57,494
- I mean, so this is a Velociraptor skull.

1394
01:23:58,023 --> 01:24:01,634
There are some carnivores that are a bit bigger than this,

1395
01:24:02,164 --> 01:24:05,894
but not enormously so, which we're knocking

1396
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:09,693
around as T-rex. The skull's the same type-

1397
01:24:09,784 --> 01:24:13,193
tooth. Right, but, like, you think about that.

1398
01:24:13,464 --> 01:24:17,244
And that's like going, that's like going to Africa and

1399
01:24:17,273 --> 01:24:20,693
going, "Okay, there are lions. What's the next biggest

1400
01:24:20,834 --> 01:24:24,074
predator?" And it's like, well, there's a weasel about this big.

1401
01:24:24,733 --> 01:24:28,553
Like, it's that kind of size difference and

1402
01:24:28,733 --> 01:24:31,114
you don't get that normally in ecosystems.

1403
01:24:31,174 --> 01:24:34,114
- So it didn't have some of the other big dinosaurs around it?

1404
01:24:34,174 --> 01:24:36,934
- Not carnivores. There's huge herbivores.

1405
01:24:37,394 --> 01:24:37,483
- Oh, there-

1406
01:24:37,494 --> 01:24:38,624
- But there's no huge carnivores around.

1407
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:41,724
- Oh, I see. It would eat those juvenile herbivores, but not-

1408
01:24:41,733 --> 01:24:45,314
- Oh, yeah. It's gonna be eating Triceratops and Edmontosaurus and Parasaurolophus.

1409
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:48,644
There's even a couple of giant sauropods knocking around in some places.

1410
01:24:48,674 --> 01:24:48,974
- Got it.

1411
01:24:49,014 --> 01:24:52,094
- It's gonna be hoovering them up, but, like, how often is it gonna

1412
01:24:52,154 --> 01:24:56,094
eat... Again, Velociraptor isn't there, but how often is it gonna eat something the size of an adult

1413
01:24:56,154 --> 01:24:56,773
Velociraptor?

1414
01:24:57,074 --> 01:25:00,976
I mean, they're a fraction of our size and we're probably too small. That, that,

1415
01:25:00,986 --> 01:25:04,786
this is like lions hunting mice. Like, you're just not gonna unless

1416
01:25:04,826 --> 01:25:09,506
one virtually runs into your mouth, you're not gonna go and try and eat it.

1417
01:25:09,566 --> 01:25:13,425
- So the question still stands about arch predators then, like how

1418
01:25:13,446 --> 01:25:16,476
does it, how do you win in evolution?

1419
01:25:16,476 --> 01:25:20,146
- Yeah. Well, I mean, so I mean, there's no real

1420
01:25:20,186 --> 01:25:24,135
winners, there's just, you know, turnover because ultimately the birds, you know, it,

1421
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:28,146
it's still lost out when things went wrong. And as we were just talking about, you

1422
01:25:28,186 --> 01:25:31,885
know, things do tend to lose out when they're big. They're just so much more

1423
01:25:31,925 --> 01:25:37,885
vulnerable to extinction. But clearly, dinosaurian ecosystems

1424
01:25:38,686 --> 01:25:42,646
had much bigger herbivores, and therefore by extent, much

1425
01:25:42,686 --> 01:25:46,306
bigger carnivores than any system we've seen

1426
01:25:46,346 --> 01:25:50,226
before or after. Even in relatively sparse

1427
01:25:50,286 --> 01:25:54,186
ones like bits of the late Triassic, so when the dinosaurs were really just

1428
01:25:54,226 --> 01:25:57,786
getting going, or the very early Jurassic, but you've still got

1429
01:25:57,806 --> 01:26:01,116
some like multi-ton herbivores and then you've got

1430
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:04,976
some multiple 100-kilo predators, so about as

1431
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:08,996
big as elephants and lions get today. And then

1432
01:26:09,066 --> 01:26:13,246
once you're in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, it is entirely normal to have

1433
01:26:14,046 --> 01:26:17,486
multiple species that are 10, 20, 30 tons plus as

1434
01:26:17,526 --> 01:26:21,306
herbivores and anything up to five tons as a carnivore. I

1435
01:26:21,406 --> 01:26:29,036
mean, T-Rex is probably the biggest of them, but carnivores that exceed terrestrial-

1436
01:26:29,066 --> 01:26:32,686
fully terrestrial carnivores that exceed a ton, there's

1437
01:26:32,965 --> 01:26:34,646
dozens of species of dinosaurs.

1438
01:26:34,686 --> 01:26:37,385
- Is it interesting to you that no other carnivore

1439
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:42,646
predator was able to develop in that environment over millions of years?

1440
01:26:42,686 --> 01:26:46,186
- I mean, they're probably just ecologically dominant in the way that mammals are

1441
01:26:46,286 --> 01:26:50,246
now, you know. Crocs get bigger than lions and tigers,

1442
01:26:50,266 --> 01:26:54,206
but they're fundamentally tied to the water. But you don't see crocs roaming

1443
01:26:54,346 --> 01:26:58,336
the Serengeti or anything like that. But

1444
01:26:58,366 --> 01:27:01,826
yeah, big, I mean the really big crocs even now get to over a

1445
01:27:01,885 --> 01:27:06,346
ton, so those are very serious animals. And I think big polar bears

1446
01:27:07,346 --> 01:27:11,206
are in the, like, 500 kilo range, though again, they hunt a lot of stuff in water.

1447
01:27:11,286 --> 01:27:15,826
And then things like grizzlies are at least partially herbivorous or omnivorous.

1448
01:27:15,846 --> 01:27:19,126
- Well, so there was a very large marine reptile,

1449
01:27:19,266 --> 01:27:22,526
Mosasaurus. Did T-Rex ever come across that?

1450
01:27:22,566 --> 01:27:26,086
- In theory, at least, the really giant Mosasaurs

1451
01:27:26,206 --> 01:27:29,936
are much bigger, in the same way that unsurprisingly whales are much bigger than

1452
01:27:29,965 --> 01:27:33,446
terrestrial carnivores now. Um, Jurassic Park

1453
01:27:33,465 --> 01:27:37,226
unsurprisingly has rather exaggerated it so the one from I think Jurassic World

1454
01:27:37,906 --> 01:27:41,456
is like twice the size it should be. But some of these things were still,

1455
01:27:41,486 --> 01:27:45,465
like, you know, 15, 20 meters. But yeah, some of them are absolutely

1456
01:27:45,506 --> 01:27:49,106
giant. We, we had one dug up in the UK just a couple of years ago and I got to

1457
01:27:49,146 --> 01:27:53,066
see the skull of it, or a cast of the skull, and yeah, it's about

1458
01:27:53,086 --> 01:27:54,506
the same size as a T-Rex skull.

1459
01:27:55,026 --> 01:27:57,786
- If we take a ridiculous detour before we get back to

1460
01:27:57,846 --> 01:28:01,686
science, what creature in the history of Earth would

1461
01:28:01,746 --> 01:28:03,856
challenge a T-Rex in a fight, would you say? What-

1462
01:28:04,026 --> 01:28:04,626
- On, on land?

1463
01:28:04,706 --> 01:28:05,686
- On land.

1464
01:28:05,726 --> 01:28:11,946
- I mean, nothing reasonable. The really big ones are gonna be...

1465
01:28:13,446 --> 01:28:17,146
The only other thing you can really add is, so, this might be a very

1466
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:20,996
British adage of it's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the

1467
01:28:21,086 --> 01:28:25,076
fight in the dog. So yeah, maybe there's something a bit smaller

1468
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:29,156
which is just hyper-aggressive and that would be enough to win. Like, the classic

1469
01:28:29,206 --> 01:28:33,146
honey badgers chasing off lions. It's not that a honey badger would win in a fight,

1470
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:37,486
but if the honey badger is prepared to put up that much of a fight and the lion really doesn't want to get

1471
01:28:37,526 --> 01:28:40,866
hurt, then, then he kind of technically wins.

1472
01:28:40,946 --> 01:28:44,866
- You can't imagine, like, any of the cats? Like, tigers, none of them...

1473
01:28:44,936 --> 01:28:48,766
can do, I mean, the size difference, the power of the jaw, all of that kind of stuff.

1474
01:28:48,826 --> 01:28:52,786
- Yeah, but going to T-Rex, like, what could reasonably challenge it?

1475
01:28:52,806 --> 01:28:56,726
There's a couple of other giant tyrannosaurs, there's a couple of giant Carcharodontosaurs from

1476
01:28:56,766 --> 01:29:00,406
South America that I would say are comparable in linear

1477
01:29:00,446 --> 01:29:03,946
measurements, but are probably rather smaller and rather

1478
01:29:04,026 --> 01:29:07,686
lighter. In which case, your money is gonna be on the bigger guy with the bigger

1479
01:29:07,766 --> 01:29:10,925
bite. And that simply is T-Rex.

1480
01:29:10,986 --> 01:29:12,666
- And the bite is important.

1481
01:29:12,726 --> 01:29:15,306
- Yeah, I think it is, because, yeah, these guys,

1482
01:29:16,126 --> 01:29:19,146
the Carcharodontosaurs, they're much more cutting.

1483
01:29:19,885 --> 01:29:23,686
And they're really killing stuff probably by

1484
01:29:23,706 --> 01:29:27,206
grappling with the arms, because they do have big, muscular arms with big claws.

1485
01:29:27,686 --> 01:29:31,466
And then slashing away at stuff. So I think they're probably

1486
01:29:31,505 --> 01:29:35,186
doing something more like almost like wolves or hyenas or a hunting...

1487
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:39,146
dog, where they're harrying stuff and slashing at

1488
01:29:39,186 --> 01:29:42,966
it and you're basically bleeding them out. ...And wearing them down.

1489
01:29:43,005 --> 01:29:46,826
- So what about that strategy? So maybe you could speak to biting

1490
01:29:47,166 --> 01:29:48,726
strategy. So a T-Rex

1491
01:29:49,546 --> 01:29:53,286
is a, I guess, a relatively slow bite but extremely powerful. What about

1492
01:29:53,526 --> 01:29:56,286
animals that have very fast bites?

1493
01:29:56,326 --> 01:30:00,186
- So it's very simple mechanics, you know. If you have a very long

1494
01:30:00,346 --> 01:30:04,146
jaw, you're going to close faster but with less power at the tip than if you

1495
01:30:04,186 --> 01:30:08,126
have a really short one that's deep. And so that really

1496
01:30:08,206 --> 01:30:12,186
is it. But yeah, let's say there are things like the Aramins and then there are

1497
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:16,126
things like, you know, Velociraptor and a lot of its relatives, really very

1498
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:19,826
small but, you know, narrow. It is narrow-snouted. There's not going to be a lot of

1499
01:30:20,226 --> 01:30:23,346
fundamental strength here. The teeth, very numerous, very

1500
01:30:23,466 --> 01:30:26,746
small so they're much more about grabbing

1501
01:30:26,826 --> 01:30:30,416
something tiny, you know. Velociraptors eating rat-sized

1502
01:30:30,526 --> 01:30:33,925
stuff, that's going to be probably its primary diet or-

1503
01:30:34,385 --> 01:30:35,546
- So I wonder if there's a bunch-

1504
01:30:35,556 --> 01:30:35,936
- ...kind of diet.

1505
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:40,066
- ...of smaller, fast-biting things that could just bleed a T-Rex to death.

1506
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:44,026
- They're going to struggle though. I remember doing some work for

1507
01:30:44,066 --> 01:30:48,026
one documentary and they literally wanted Velociraptor fighting a T-Rex

1508
01:30:48,126 --> 01:30:50,836
and I was sort of like, "You do know this is, like-"

1509
01:30:51,166 --> 01:30:55,086
"...we're going to shoot some meerkats killing a lion." And it's like, well, you can film it

1510
01:30:55,226 --> 01:30:58,796
but no one would believe it because, you know, these

1511
01:30:58,806 --> 01:31:02,546
ankle-high things trying to, like, savage a

1512
01:31:02,606 --> 01:31:06,486
shin bone are, yeah, I'm sure they'll make some holes and it'll lose some

1513
01:31:06,546 --> 01:31:12,076
blood and it may not be very happy but I don't think they're going to win.

1514
01:31:12,106 --> 01:31:16,326
- The size of a Velociraptor was exaggerated by Jurassic Park.

1515
01:31:16,336 --> 01:31:18,656
- Oh, enormously. I mean, they get a bit bigger than this.

1516
01:31:18,769 --> 01:31:22,469
...in terms of the skull. But yeah, they're kind of thigh-high,

1517
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:27,269
to me, like a meter or so to the top of the head, two

1518
01:31:27,309 --> 01:31:30,960
meters long, whereas in the movies, they're, like, standing

1519
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:33,830
taller than guys who are six feet. So it's just

1520
01:31:34,929 --> 01:31:38,769
massively, massively scaled up, and then these kind of big, domey heads, and

1521
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:41,960
they're not the really long, narrow snout.

1522
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:45,820
- Maybe we could take that, change it. What does Jurassic Park and Jurassic World

1523
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:46,599
franchise get right and wrong?

1524
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:48,139
- I mean, they get wrong a hell of a lot.

1525
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:51,969
- What are some of the really definitive things to you that are interesting that it

1526
01:31:52,009 --> 01:31:57,349
gets wrong, and also what are the things it gets pretty close to right?

1527
01:31:57,450 --> 01:32:01,389
- I mean, I just want to preface my answer 'cause I always get asked

1528
01:32:01,429 --> 01:32:04,849
about this, understandably. It's like, I get that it's a

1529
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:08,370
movie. But if someone's going to ask me, "What does it get wrong?"

1530
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:11,730
I'm going to give them an answer. But I do get people going, "Ah, you're just nitpicking."

1531
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:15,269
"Ah, you know it's fiction. Ah, you know it's made up." Yeah, I do know.

1532
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:16,080
But someone asked the question, so here's the answer.

1533
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:19,089
- I should say that some of the things that I've heard you

1534
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:22,870
describe, I feel like it's the responsibility of those folks to get it

1535
01:32:22,928 --> 01:32:26,710
right. I think there's something I really

1536
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:30,570
deeply admire. There's a show called Chernobyl.

1537
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:34,370
It's like they don't need to be that accurate,

1538
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:40,129
but they really... the detail of the kitchenware-

1539
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,379
in a room, just to get the tiniest detail right. Who's

1540
01:32:44,429 --> 01:32:48,509
that for? I don't know who that's for, but that's for great art.

1541
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:53,809
That's for the spirit of the thing. And if you

1542
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:58,429
focus on getting those tiny details right, some magical thing

1543
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:04,419
happens about the bigger story. If you don't care about the details, it...

1544
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:08,370
the story gets corrupted. So I just wanted to say that some of the things you describe,

1545
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,690
like how many fingers-

1546
01:33:10,259 --> 01:33:14,179
it's important to get that right 'cause if you do, some magical stuff can really emerge.

1547
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:17,089
And it could become a legendary film as opposed to just a-

1548
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:18,160
- Yeah, I mean, that-

1549
01:33:18,169 --> 01:33:18,669
- a summer hit.

1550
01:33:18,679 --> 01:33:22,469
- that's my take. Again, I've worked on documentaries where they're

1551
01:33:22,509 --> 01:33:26,389
claiming that accuracy is absolutely critical and 100% important,

1552
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:29,710
and they won't put anything on screen that I haven't told them to, and-

1553
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:33,730
then many of those things turn out not to be quite as true as advertised,

1554
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:36,700
once you get around to it. So I'm aware that

1555
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:41,410
even documentaries will take massive liberties,

1556
01:33:41,509 --> 01:33:48,750
you can't be too harsh on what is popular fiction. On the other hand,

1557
01:33:48,769 --> 01:33:55,610
I am also aware that it is by far, by a ludicrous degree, the most popular

1558
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:59,690
bit of any kind of media that includes my work,

1559
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:03,929
as it were, or something that I'm actively engaged in and know about,

1560
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:08,089
and so whether or not it should have that influence or the filmmakers should have

1561
01:34:08,169 --> 01:34:11,910
responsibility, it does. It does have that knock-on.

1562
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:16,129
So I mean, it's simple as stuff as a T-rex can't see if you can't move. Yeah, it

1563
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:19,530
could. I don't know where that came from. As far as I can tell, Crichton just dreamed it

1564
01:34:19,629 --> 01:34:23,389
up. In The Lost World, his sequel book, he

1565
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:27,290
hints that there's a research paper that says it, and that's where he got it

1566
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:30,730
from. There's a second paleontologist character

1567
01:34:31,469 --> 01:34:35,330
who's advising Dodgson, the evil InGen guy, and he

1568
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:38,929
says, "Oh, no, well that's from such-and-such's research." And I tried looking it up.

1569
01:34:38,969 --> 01:34:42,669
As far as I can tell, it doesn't exist and never did. So I think it's just straight

1570
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:46,589
fiction. And it's like, it works for the book and it works for the movie, but

1571
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:50,570
as far as I can tell, it's straight fiction and Crichton just made it up.

1572
01:34:50,629 --> 01:34:54,570
If it's buried in some bit of literature, he's done better finding it than I have,

1573
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:58,509
and I've had a really good look and I know how to look. And I've never come across anyone

1574
01:34:58,570 --> 01:35:02,280
who's found it either. But it just warps the

1575
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:06,139
perception, you know. Velociraptor, cheetah speed, pack hunters,

1576
01:35:06,210 --> 01:35:09,830
super intelligent, giant-sized animals and... okay, 1993, it's a bit more forgivable,

1577
01:35:09,929 --> 01:35:13,759
but even then, we were pretty confident they had feathers.

1578
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:15,250
confident they had feathers.

1579
01:35:15,269 --> 01:35:17,599
- Is any of that true? Wait, so...

1580
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:19,219
- Probably not.

1581
01:35:19,219 --> 01:35:21,040
- The pack hunter aspect of it?

1582
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:24,830
- So that's something I've written quite a lot about. The evidence for pack hunting in any dinosaur at all

1583
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:32,809
is almost nonexistent. It basically doesn't exist. And that's going exactly back to, again,

1584
01:35:33,049 --> 01:35:36,830
basically doesn't exist. And that's going exactly back to, again, that

1585
01:35:36,849 --> 01:35:40,330
that stuff we were talking about, bite marks and taphonomy and, like, the history of specimens and how you interpret stuff.

1586
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:43,980
history of specimens and h- and how you interpret stuff.

1587
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:47,830
- So, so what kind of evidence would show, like, maybe bite marks from multiple sources?

1588
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:51,709
- So it's really, really tough. So the main one which was put forward is... there's this famous

1589
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:55,400
forward is... there's this famous association

1590
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:59,070
association in Montana of Deinonychus, which is often confused with Velociraptor, including in the books

1591
01:35:59,089 --> 01:36:02,959
and movie. Basically a bigger version of this that's rather older, from the early Cretaceous,

1592
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:05,990
version of this that's rather older, from the early

1593
01:36:06,049 --> 01:36:09,429
and a thing called Tenontosaurus, which is kind of iguanodontian. So an iguanodon with spiky thumbs.

1594
01:36:09,469 --> 01:36:13,230
Basically, otherwise, a fairly run-of-the-mill herbivore. And there are two sites, I believe, for this,

1595
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:17,089
fairly run-of-the-mill herbivore. And there are two

1596
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:21,049
but there's one that's much more important, where you have a Tenontosaurus carcass with Deinonychus carcasses.

1597
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:23,309
a Tenontosaurus carcass

1598
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:27,929
with Deinonychus carcasses. And so the interpretation of this

1599
01:36:28,009 --> 01:36:31,860
And so the interpretation of this is, well, this is a group that brought down the herbivore.

1600
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:35,769
And of course, the immediate kind of counterargument to that is, "Well, why did they all die there?"

1601
01:36:35,809 --> 01:36:37,240
all die there?"

1602
01:36:37,259 --> 01:36:40,769
Like, when, you know, when lions kill a wildebeest, they eat it. They don't all just die next to it.

1603
01:36:40,849 --> 01:36:43,009
it. They don't all just die next to it.

1604
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:47,730
Or even if they did kill it and start eating it, and then, like, if they got into a fight and killed

1605
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:51,589
each other, well, lions as a species are not gonna hang around for very long if every time they kill

1606
01:36:51,629 --> 01:36:55,570
something they get into a mortal fight and kill half their pride. There's nothing obvious that killed them,

1607
01:36:55,629 --> 01:37:02,250
half their pride. Um, there's nothing obvious that killed them but it's at

1608
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:06,009
but it's at least possible that this was something like a predator trap. So predator traps are really neat.

1609
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:10,049
So La Brea Tar Pits is a classic example. The idea is a herbivore stumbles into something

1610
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:14,089
example. The idea is a herbivore stumbles into something like

1611
01:37:14,129 --> 01:37:17,589
like tar. You've got your deer or wildebeest or mammoth or whatever it is, waist deep in tar and going,

1612
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:21,379
"I'm dying, I'm dying," and making horrible noises, and, you know, Smilodon walks over and goes, "Great,"

1613
01:37:21,389 --> 01:37:24,809
horrible noises, and, you know, Smilodon walks over and goes,

1614
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:27,809
and wades out after it, and he's now stuck. And then the next one, and then the next one,

1615
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:31,509
and the next one, and the next one. And then, lo and behold, you now have something like La Brea where they've got,

1616
01:37:31,549 --> 01:37:35,179
And then lo and behold, you now have something like La Brea where they've got,

1617
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:39,170
like, the numbers are something absurd. Like I think they've got, like, three mammoths and one ground sloth,

1618
01:37:39,210 --> 01:37:43,170
and then it's like a hundred dire wolves and 40 Smilodon because it's just sucking the carnivores in.

1619
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:47,379
and 40 Smilodon because it's just sucking the carnivores in.

1620
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:48,290
- Wow.

1621
01:37:48,309 --> 01:37:52,269
- And you get these really distorted ratios. I don't think that's the case with the

1622
01:37:52,309 --> 01:37:56,089
Deinonychus-Tenontosaurus stuff because there's ways that you can probably...

1623
01:37:56,110 --> 01:38:00,009
because there's ways that you can probably rule that out. But there are probably

1624
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:04,059
places like this where it's happened. Again, the other one is the toxin one,

1625
01:38:04,089 --> 01:38:07,860
whose name— Yeah, Cleveland-Lloyd, so it's just coming up on your screen.

1626
01:38:07,969 --> 01:38:11,940
That's another one with loads of dinosaurs. There's Allosaurus.

1627
01:38:12,009 --> 01:38:15,490
But we've definitely seen it with... I think this has come up with something

1628
01:38:15,629 --> 01:38:19,490
like lions or wolves. Like, they found loads of them dead by a

1629
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:23,170
lake and it turned out... or this pond. And this pond had got some really sort of

1630
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:26,969
nasty algal bloom toxin in it, and the interpretation was the

1631
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:29,830
same kind of thing, is that, like, a couple of deer were

1632
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:33,589
drinking. This stuff's toxic and kills you within minutes. Keels

1633
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:37,670
over, dies. A wolf smells dead meat, comes over,

1634
01:38:37,769 --> 01:38:41,740
starts eating it, has a drink, keels over and dies. So it's not

1635
01:38:41,769 --> 01:38:44,790
getting— you're just dying from the toxicity rather than being, like,

1636
01:38:45,809 --> 01:38:49,780
physically sucked in and trapped. But the same effect can happen, and so you just end up

1637
01:38:49,809 --> 01:38:51,190
with a pile of dead bodies.

1638
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:55,150
- So I'm pulling up some stuff here. First of all, shout out to Perplexity.

1639
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:59,150
Super awesome. It'd be great if you fact-check some of this

1640
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:02,929
stuff. So, fossil discoveries, including parallel trackways and bone

1641
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:06,450
beds containing multiple tyrannosaurs suggests these large predators

1642
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:10,349
sometimes moved and possibly hunted in groups. You as a person who wrote

1643
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:12,549
a book about the behavior of dinosaurs.

1644
01:39:12,589 --> 01:39:15,210
- Yep. Let me deconstruct that almost instantly.

1645
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:19,299
So it's... because it's really easy, cause this is... My book on dinosaur

1646
01:39:19,349 --> 01:39:23,120
behavior, this is just the kind of thing I'm talking about.

1647
01:39:23,809 --> 01:39:27,549
So the tyrannosaur trackways of a group of tyrannosaurs is, I think,

1648
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:31,330
four or five tracks total. So it's, like, two from one

1649
01:39:31,429 --> 01:39:35,210
animal, two from a second animal, and one from a third animal. That's not the end of the world.

1650
01:39:35,230 --> 01:39:38,950
That's somehow how trackways form. Like, you know, the rock's

1651
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:41,690
broken up. They stood on mud, and then they didn't, whatever.

1652
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:46,929
- Just to clarify, trackways means footprints of multiple, maybe, steps?

1653
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:50,969
- Yeah. One of them has got a left and right, and the other two don't. It's very

1654
01:39:51,049 --> 01:39:54,809
fragmentary, but I have no... That's not a problem with the interpretation.

1655
01:39:54,849 --> 01:39:57,790
The problem is this is interpreted as a group of them moving

1656
01:39:57,809 --> 01:40:01,690
together. Well, why? Because

1657
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:05,030
they're going in roughly the same direction. Okay. And they're roughly equal

1658
01:40:05,049 --> 01:40:11,650
sizes. Okay. But, like, I've seen solitary animals moving in

1659
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:15,699
groups. A guy I know quite well in South Africa...

1660
01:40:15,769 --> 01:40:19,620
I go to South Africa regularly for my teaching, actually, and he's one of

1661
01:40:19,629 --> 01:40:23,549
the big guys at South Africa National Parks, and he gives me the skinny on all kinds

1662
01:40:23,589 --> 01:40:27,330
of weird stuff. And he was telling me a few years ago that one of his park

1663
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:31,170
rangers had observed leopards hunting together in a group. Now, leopards are

1664
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:35,089
basically not just solitary, they're like antisocial. Like, they beat the hell

1665
01:40:35,110 --> 01:40:38,750
out of each other if they come near each other. But I've also seen...

1666
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:42,990
you know, you get... Game trails are a thing, paths that single

1667
01:40:43,089 --> 01:40:49,230
animals take. If a female is in heat, like, males will track her down and follow her.

1668
01:40:50,309 --> 01:40:54,049
So you'll get one set of footprints, and then a couple of hours later a male will come

1669
01:40:54,089 --> 01:40:58,030
past, and a couple of hours later another male will come past. And now you've got three sets of

1670
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:01,990
footprints all traveling in the same direction on the same bit of path, but they live

1671
01:41:02,009 --> 01:41:09,089
on their own. Let alone hunting together, which is a massive step above this.

1672
01:41:09,929 --> 01:41:13,450
And then the one I've talked about quite a bit in my book is spotted hyena, Crocuta

1673
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:17,080
crocuta, which is the one... There's a whole bunch of hyenas, but this is the one everyone knows.

1674
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:21,089
They're the big laughing hyena. And you can see plenty of

1675
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:25,129
Attenborough-type documentaries of them, seven or eight of them, or even

1676
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:28,969
10 or 12 of them going into a herd and ripping apart wildebeest or zebra or whatever it

1677
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:32,969
is. But actually, if you read the scientific literature, this is really rare. They

1678
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:36,670
mostly hunt on their own. Now they do live in these social

1679
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:40,750
clans with hierarchies and complex social interactions. They

1680
01:41:40,769 --> 01:41:46,950
are very social animals. But they mostly hunt on their own. So

1681
01:41:47,070 --> 01:41:50,879
even if you find loads of trackways of them moving together or as ...

1682
01:41:50,889 --> 01:41:54,670
Again, there's one, if not two, for tyrannosaurs, where we've got multiple tyrannosaurs

1683
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:58,650
together, and that's been argued for pack hunting. At best, that argues

1684
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:02,619
they might have lived together, but it doesn't tell you whether or

1685
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:05,170
not they hunted together.

1686
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:08,610
- So, how can we make a decision on one way or the other?

1687
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:12,210
- So, I mean, I tend to be ultra

1688
01:42:12,269 --> 01:42:15,990
conservative in this context, and I think we should probably avoid

1689
01:42:16,089 --> 01:42:19,969
saying things that we're not quite confident about. I don't want to

1690
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:23,619
ever go down the, "We must have really definitive, 100% convincing evidence," because this is

1691
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:26,250
paleo and we don't have that kind of data.

1692
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:30,059
But just as I talked about with things like the predator prey

1693
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:34,089
size ratio stuff, there is data we can start to use on living

1694
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:37,049
species about what tends to trigger

1695
01:42:37,809 --> 01:42:41,530
hunting in groups or living in groups, and what data there might be from

1696
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:45,389
stuff like brain sizes or other trackways. Or again, we do

1697
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:49,389
have bite marks indicating prey size. If you start finding

1698
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:53,639
repeated attacks on big prey from relatively small

1699
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:57,389
predators, that would be quite convincing. As you said, maybe we

1700
01:42:57,450 --> 01:43:01,330
had bite marks of multiple different sizes. Now, that on its

1701
01:43:01,429 --> 01:43:07,150
own, it comes hard, because obviously scavenging, you know,

1702
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:11,170
tyrannosaurs are an exception. Most dinosaurs, most carnivorous dinosaurs have pretty

1703
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:14,150
similarly shaped teeth. So, how easy is it to tell

1704
01:43:15,450 --> 01:43:19,170
an adult from a juvenile from an adult from a different species that's

1705
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:24,710
just a bit smaller? Probably pretty tricky. I mean, for me, I think

1706
01:43:24,809 --> 01:43:28,719
the kind of gold standard, which I don't think we're ever going to find

1707
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:34,030
but you never know, like, you could, in theory, get a trackway of something like a

1708
01:43:34,070 --> 01:43:38,201
herbivore with a whole bunch of carnivore tracks coming

1709
01:43:39,142 --> 01:43:42,962
by it. We do have a couple like this, but they don't have what I really want to see, which

1710
01:43:43,022 --> 01:43:46,982
is if you trace the footprints of the individual carnivores,

1711
01:43:47,022 --> 01:43:50,201
and if A's in... Early on, A's footprints go on top of

1712
01:43:50,241 --> 01:43:54,041
B's, but later on, B's go on top of A's, they

1713
01:43:54,081 --> 01:43:58,001
must have been there at the same time because there's no way they

1714
01:43:58,041 --> 01:44:01,501
could have been even minutes or hours apart. So, if you had

1715
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:05,462
that, then those two must be together, or at least within sight of

1716
01:44:05,501 --> 01:44:09,382
each other and one's not turning around and roaring or having a fight. If you can do that,

1717
01:44:09,422 --> 01:44:13,281
If you can do that with seven or eight, all converging on one herbivore,

1718
01:44:13,322 --> 01:44:18,522
and then everything goes manic, well, that's really pretty convincing.

1719
01:44:18,562 --> 01:44:22,182
- It is so fascinating and awesome, the like the Sherlock

1720
01:44:22,222 --> 01:44:25,621
Holmes aspect of paleontology, like figuring out, because you have

1721
01:44:26,102 --> 01:44:27,071
very little signal-

1722
01:44:27,411 --> 01:44:30,781
very little signal and you have to figure out the puzzle of it from that.

1723
01:44:30,802 --> 01:44:34,781
And like, that's it's, it's just you're brilliant. You're giving so many brilliant examples of,

1724
01:44:34,802 --> 01:44:38,672
yeah, if A steps on top of B, and then B steps on top of A, that's a strong signal that they were walking

1725
01:44:38,682 --> 01:44:39,352
together.

1726
01:44:39,462 --> 01:44:42,612
- I am a bit of a Sherlock Holmes fan, and he references

1727
01:44:42,642 --> 01:44:46,331
Cuvier. So Cuvier was this legendary French anatomist,

1728
01:44:46,422 --> 01:44:50,161
Baron Cuvier. He was the first guy to posit that things went extinct,

1729
01:44:50,222 --> 01:44:53,942
working on mammoths. And he said, "Well, there's nothing like this alive today, so extinction

1730
01:44:53,982 --> 01:44:57,862
happens." Which before that, we didn't really know. And Holmes has a

1731
01:44:58,001 --> 01:45:01,942
line about, "Just as Cuvier can restore

1732
01:45:01,982 --> 01:45:05,661
an animal from the smallest bone, so I can restore the events from

1733
01:45:06,161 --> 01:45:07,661
the smallest detail," or I-

1734
01:45:07,682 --> 01:45:07,822
- Damn.

1735
01:45:07,831 --> 01:45:09,522
- I'm paraphrasing, but I'm not far off.

1736
01:45:09,581 --> 01:45:10,592
- Yeah, there's truth to that.

1737
01:45:10,592 --> 01:45:16,522
- You, you have used an analogy that Conan Doyle specifically used for Holmes

1738
01:45:16,562 --> 01:45:17,802
going back to paleontology.

1739
01:45:17,842 --> 01:45:20,081
- I mean, it's obvious. It's clear. It's right there, yeah.

1740
01:45:20,102 --> 01:45:22,762
- That, that's how on the nose you are with that one.

1741
01:45:22,802 --> 01:45:26,342
- So, okay. So basically you clarified and showed all the things in

1742
01:45:26,402 --> 01:45:27,692
Jurassic got it wrong.

1743
01:45:27,701 --> 01:45:30,701
- Yeah, we, we, yeah, we got off-topic before we even got onto Jurassic Park.

1744
01:45:30,712 --> 01:45:34,501
- Uh, and just Velociraptor, you said that the, you know, the, yeah, the size, the

1745
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:35,982
pack hunting, all of that.

1746
01:45:36,262 --> 01:45:40,001
- The pack hunting, just to round off on that, like, I don't know.

1747
01:45:40,081 --> 01:45:43,642
Maybe there's actually been some more recent stuff on Deinonychus looking

1748
01:45:43,741 --> 01:45:47,642
at things like isotopes in the teeth and feeding traces and some

1749
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:51,722
other stuff that's hinting that maybe there is more going on there,

1750
01:45:51,802 --> 01:45:55,642
which is great. I'm, I'm not anti the idea that this exists,

1751
01:45:55,741 --> 01:45:59,182
but you absolutely get this build up of the idea that

1752
01:45:59,201 --> 01:46:03,121
velociraptors are a pack hunter comes from Deinonychus and I think the

1753
01:46:03,161 --> 01:46:06,432
evidence from Deinonychus is really weak, in exactly the way that...

1754
01:46:06,462 --> 01:46:10,161
Okay, lions are group hunters. We know they are. Does that mean

1755
01:46:10,201 --> 01:46:13,642
that leopards are? And tigers and

1756
01:46:13,842 --> 01:46:17,501
puma? No. So why on earth do you think that just because, even if

1757
01:46:21,522 --> 01:46:25,262
Velociraptor. Group hunting has all kinds of

1758
01:46:25,781 --> 01:46:29,621
more complicated dynamics going on it than just close relatives tend to do

1759
01:46:29,661 --> 01:46:31,121
it. You can flip that around, you know.

1760
01:46:32,022 --> 01:46:35,962
African hunting dog, wolves, things like bush dogs. There's

1761
01:46:35,982 --> 01:46:39,802
various canids that all hunt in groups, but then you've got things like

1762
01:46:39,842 --> 01:46:43,241
maned wolves which are effectively solitary. The hyenas.

1763
01:46:43,302 --> 01:46:47,201
Spotted hyenas are, yeah, these super social animals, but the brown

1764
01:46:47,222 --> 01:46:50,501
hyena, the striped hyena and the aardwolf are solitary. So you just

1765
01:46:50,602 --> 01:46:54,501
So you just can't do group versus solitary off close relatives or anything like that. I am very sure

1766
01:46:55,922 --> 01:47:01,142
close relatives or anything like that. I am very sure a ton of dinosaurs were aggregates, lived in groups to some degree,

1767
01:47:02,062 --> 01:47:05,922
a ton of dinosaurs were aggregates, lived in groups to some degree, and I'm very sure some of them were social with complex lives

1768
01:47:05,982 --> 01:47:09,602
and I'm very sure some of them were social with complex lives and hierarchies and even pack hunting. Which ones, I

1769
01:47:09,621 --> 01:47:13,462
and hierarchies and even pack hunting. Which ones, I have very little idea because I think the data is so sparse

1770
01:47:13,541 --> 01:47:16,882
have very little idea because I think the data is so sparse that we can't really say it with any confidence for

1771
01:47:17,482 --> 01:47:21,022
that we can't really say it with any confidence for anything, in my opinion. I think that can be gotten at.

1772
01:47:21,121 --> 01:47:25,031
anything, in my opinion. I think that can be gotten at. I think we need to start getting at it with the sort of stuff I'm talking about.

1773
01:47:25,062 --> 01:47:28,962
I think we need to start getting at it with the sort of stuff I'm talking about. Like get a better understanding of what drives sociality in lions

1774
01:47:29,001 --> 01:47:32,922
Like get a better understanding of what drives sociality in lions versus tigers versus leopards. You know, relatively close relatives

1775
01:47:32,982 --> 01:47:36,501
tigers versus leopards. You know, relatively close relatives who overlap. Don't forget in India, leopards and tigers

1776
01:47:36,602 --> 01:47:40,371
who overlap. Don't forget in India, leopards and tigers overlap with lions. The Asiatic lion is still there.

1777
01:47:40,402 --> 01:47:44,092
overlap with lions. The Asiatic lion is still there. So you can talk about ecosystem structure and prey size

1778
01:47:44,142 --> 01:47:47,982
So you can talk about ecosystem structure and prey size and prey type and all this stuff. Maybe we can start

1779
01:47:48,001 --> 01:47:52,411
and prey type and all this stuff. Maybe we can start piecing that together a bit better and then apply that to stuff

1780
01:47:53,321 --> 01:47:56,891
piecing that together a bit better and then apply that to stuff like the track ways and the isotopes and all the rest of it.

1781
01:47:56,942 --> 01:48:01,121
Bite marks and these mass mortality sites. So I think it can be done, but personally like what were pack hunters? No idea.

1782
01:48:02,062 --> 01:48:05,142
but personally like what were pack hunters? No idea.

1783
01:48:05,182 --> 01:48:09,062
No idea. I don't think any of them were in the sense that I don't think we've got good evidence for any of them.

1784
01:48:09,102 --> 01:48:10,942
I don't think we've got good evidence for any of them. But there probably exists on Earth definitive evidence one way or the other.

1785
01:48:10,982 --> 01:48:16,852
- But there probably exists on earth definitive evidence one way or the other.

1786
01:48:16,862 --> 01:48:20,722
- Yeah, probably for some of them. I mean, I think it's well within their scope. One of the papers writing about this,

1787
01:48:20,741 --> 01:48:24,402
One of the papers writing about this, ironically, arguing against pack hunting in Deinonychus, said that, "Well,

1788
01:48:24,562 --> 01:48:28,462
against pack hunting in Deinonychus, said that, "Well, it's probably not the case because you don't really see pack hunting

1789
01:48:28,602 --> 01:48:32,541
it's probably not the case because you don't really see pack hunting in birds. And so if you don't see it in birds, then dinosaurs

1790
01:48:32,581 --> 01:48:36,322
in birds. And so if you don't see it in birds, then dinosaurs being their ancestor, well, if birds can't evolve it,

1791
01:48:36,362 --> 01:48:39,892
being their ancestor, well, if birds can't evolve it, then maybe dinosaurs couldn't have evolved it." Which

1792
01:48:40,942 --> 01:48:44,862
I'm not sure is a great logical argument because of the complexities of social behavior anyway. But then there are a couple of birds

1793
01:48:44,942 --> 01:48:48,621
of social behavior anyway. But then there are a couple of birds which actively hunt in groups. Things like the giant ground hornbills.

1794
01:48:48,701 --> 01:48:52,661
which actively hunt in groups. Things like the giant ground hornbills. Ethiopia and South Africa are a really good example of that.

1795
01:48:52,762 --> 01:48:56,302
Ethiopia and South Africa are a really good example of that. So that point is incorrect. And then we see if not true

1796
01:48:56,382 --> 01:48:59,862
So that point is incorrect. And then we see if not true sociality, we see cooperation in crocodilians and we're

1797
01:49:00,022 --> 01:49:03,972
sociality, we see cooperation in crocodilians and we're seeing degrees of social behavior in things like iguanas.

1798
01:49:04,001 --> 01:49:07,701
seeing degrees of social behavior in things like iguanas. So the idea that, "Well, birds are super advanced

1799
01:49:07,781 --> 01:49:11,762
So the idea that, "Well, birds are super advanced and dinosaurs can't do it 'cause the stupid reptiles are too stupid,

1800
01:49:11,802 --> 01:49:15,581
and dinosaurs can't do it 'cause the stupid reptiles are too stupid, and therefore dinosaurs are more like them," which isn't quite

1801
01:49:15,642 --> 01:49:19,522
and therefore dinosaurs are more like them," which isn't quite what they're saying, but it's sort of the unwritten idea, "Well, we have

1802
01:49:19,581 --> 01:49:23,281
what they're saying, but it's sort of the unwritten idea, "Well, we have social behavior and cooperation behavior in crocs and in lizards.

1803
01:49:23,342 --> 01:49:27,322
social behavior and cooperation behavior in crocs and in lizards. So that really gives you the impression that dinosaurs, theoretically,

1804
01:49:27,382 --> 01:49:31,378
So that really gives you the impression that dinosaurs, theoretically, at least, are perfectly capable of that. So there's pack hunting,

1805
01:49:31,438 --> 01:49:35,337
- at least, are perfectly capable of that. So there's pack hunting, but there's also sociality, which is such an interesting idea.

1806
01:49:35,398 --> 01:49:39,258
but there's also sociality, which is such an interesting idea. It's how did they live? And this is something you look

1807
01:49:39,338 --> 01:49:43,778
It's how did they live? And this is something you look at that paleontology doesn't often touch, is like, the lives.

1808
01:49:43,838 --> 01:49:47,698
- Yeah, because, you know, animals are doing complicated things. So, in the case of lions, a large part of this is down to

1809
01:49:47,738 --> 01:49:51,378
So, in the case of lions, a large part of this is down to territoriality in that the males ultimately are defending the territory,

1810
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:54,938
territoriality in that the males ultimately are defending the territory, and that's effectively protecting the females. But, of course,

1811
01:49:54,998 --> 01:49:58,958
and that's effectively protecting the females. But, of course, what they're mostly protecting them from is other males.

1812
01:49:58,998 --> 01:50:01,898
what they're mostly protecting them from is other males. So there's a ludicrous bit of self-interest. But that's

1813
01:50:02,038 --> 01:50:05,318
self-interest. But that's effectively how it's

1814
01:50:05,398 --> 01:50:08,018
operating as a system. But it could just

1815
01:50:08,058 --> 01:50:11,698
be predatory type. Cheetahs are my go-to example for

1816
01:50:11,758 --> 01:50:15,558
this. So cheetahs are the weird ones compared to the other cats because

1817
01:50:15,577 --> 01:50:18,598
females are solitary, but males are social. So brothers

1818
01:50:18,858 --> 01:50:22,778
will... when, you know, if the female has five or six cubs, the

1819
01:50:22,818 --> 01:50:26,118
brothers will stay together in a group and then the girls will go off on their own.

1820
01:50:26,158 --> 01:50:30,028
And if you're the only brother or the only survivor, you will usually hook up,

1821
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:34,198
hook up with a gang of other males. So cheetahs are pack hunters if you're male

1822
01:50:34,218 --> 01:50:38,018
and a solitary hunter if you're female. So it's not about

1823
01:50:38,118 --> 01:50:42,158
territory defense or occupation for them. It's about prey type.

1824
01:50:42,198 --> 01:50:46,178
- Is it possible to know the sex of a T-Rex or any of the

1825
01:50:46,218 --> 01:50:48,758
other dinosaurs? What can paleontology show us?

1826
01:50:48,838 --> 01:50:52,778
- So in theory, yes. In practice, it's way more complicated.

1827
01:50:52,838 --> 01:50:56,698
So unless you get very lucky, we have a handful of specimens that still have

1828
01:50:56,708 --> 01:51:01,718
eggs inside them, instant giveaway. But this is like two or three. Um,

1829
01:51:02,538 --> 01:51:06,518
what you can look for is both reptiles and birds have a thing

1830
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:09,858
called medullary bone, and when you're laying

1831
01:51:09,918 --> 01:51:13,858
eggs and you need a lot of calcium very quickly because the egg

1832
01:51:13,878 --> 01:51:17,778
shell goes on basically, like, the last minute during egg development.

1833
01:51:17,798 --> 01:51:21,788
So you need a lot of calcium very quickly. So during the laying season, these

1834
01:51:21,838 --> 01:51:25,798
animals grow this really weird kind of bone texture on

1835
01:51:25,858 --> 01:51:28,718
big things like the femur and the humerus, like really big bones in the

1836
01:51:28,738 --> 01:51:32,478
body. And that's... It's got a weird texture because it's full of blood

1837
01:51:32,538 --> 01:51:36,418
vessels, and it's full of blood vessels so that you can basically apply a lot of blood

1838
01:51:36,458 --> 01:51:40,367
supply to it quickly, suck up some of the calcium from that bone,

1839
01:51:40,398 --> 01:51:44,358
take it through the system, put it on the eggs, lay your eggs. We

1840
01:51:44,398 --> 01:51:48,138
can find that. So if you have a dinosaur

1841
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:52,058
bone and it's the right kind of thing, so you can't do it on like a finger

1842
01:51:52,098 --> 01:51:56,038
or a claw or a bit of rib, but nice big bone, you could cut a chunk of that out,

1843
01:51:56,058 --> 01:51:59,418
grind it down to the point that it's virtually transparent, a fraction of a millimeter thick,

1844
01:51:59,958 --> 01:52:04,118
put it under a microscope and have a look. And if you see the right bone texture,

1845
01:52:04,958 --> 01:52:08,738
that's... there are some exceptions, but that's very probably medullary

1846
01:52:08,778 --> 01:52:11,158
bone, and you have yourself a female.

1847
01:52:12,438 --> 01:52:16,278
So the instant assumption is, okay, so you can tell female from male. No, we can tell

1848
01:52:16,358 --> 01:52:20,168
laying female from everything else. So males

1849
01:52:20,218 --> 01:52:23,738
won't have medullary bone. Young females won't have them. Females

1850
01:52:23,898 --> 01:52:27,668
outside of the breeding season won't have it. Females inside the breeding season, but

1851
01:52:27,718 --> 01:52:31,638
maybe they've been really sick this year, don't have it. Or they laid their eggs early

1852
01:52:31,678 --> 01:52:35,538
and now they don't need it anymore, won't have it. So

1853
01:52:35,638 --> 01:52:41,038
occasionally, if you cut up a bone, which of course we try not to do that much,

1854
01:52:41,898 --> 01:52:45,838
you can get the signal of medullary bone and infer that you have a female in the

1855
01:52:45,858 --> 01:52:46,577
breeding season.

1856
01:52:46,638 --> 01:52:50,278
- But so there's no like large bone structure differences?

1857
01:52:50,718 --> 01:52:57,838
- Well, maybe there is, but we haven't seen it. You look at things like kudu or

1858
01:52:57,878 --> 01:53:01,658
blackbuck and all kinds of antelope or even most deer,

1859
01:53:02,218 --> 01:53:06,028
and the males have horns or antlers and the females don't.

1860
01:53:06,178 --> 01:53:10,077
And then you look at something like Triceratops and all the ceratopsians.

1861
01:53:10,098 --> 01:53:13,858
There's a big clade of... oh, must be 40 species by

1862
01:53:13,958 --> 01:53:17,538
now. And every single one of them has the frill and has

1863
01:53:17,818 --> 01:53:21,077
some kind of horn somewhere. You don't

1864
01:53:21,138 --> 01:53:25,518
have the hornless ones or the frill-less ones in the way that we do with

1865
01:53:26,438 --> 01:53:27,678
a lot of these.

1866
01:53:27,718 --> 01:53:31,218
- I'm trying to figure out, is there, how many of the species is it

1867
01:53:31,418 --> 01:53:35,568
obvious that there's like, like pelvis differences, all that kind of stuff?

1868
01:53:35,568 --> 01:53:39,018
- So pelvis differences works on like humans and apes and

1869
01:53:39,378 --> 01:53:43,368
maybe a couple of other mammals, but it's mostly not very good because we are...

1870
01:53:43,378 --> 01:53:47,057
It's because we give birth to such a gigantic baby with a gigantic head

1871
01:53:47,098 --> 01:53:51,458
compared to our sizes that women have different pelvises to men.

1872
01:53:51,468 --> 01:53:54,928
- And then there's size differences, like the skull is not as reliable as the pelvis.

1873
01:53:54,928 --> 01:53:58,648
- It's, it's not. And then again, you just need to look at, you know, humans are always

1874
01:53:58,678 --> 01:54:02,378
slightly dodgy with this because of, you know, our evolutionary and cultural history.

1875
01:54:02,398 --> 01:54:06,358
But like, you know, there's population differences. You know,

1876
01:54:06,418 --> 01:54:10,298
you, you... There are, there are maned female lions in places. There

1877
01:54:10,318 --> 01:54:13,258
are maneless male lions in places. Um,

1878
01:54:13,558 --> 01:54:16,938
reindeer, female reindeer have antlers in winter.

1879
01:54:17,638 --> 01:54:21,598
So Rudolph was a girl, because every illustration of Santa and his reindeer

1880
01:54:21,638 --> 01:54:25,768
ever, they all have antlers, and that's that's a female reindeer, not a male if it's winter.

1881
01:54:25,818 --> 01:54:31,118
- So basically, we don't know much about the dating and the sex lives of T-rexes.

1882
01:54:31,158 --> 01:54:38,848
- Well, not much, but you can make some inferences. So for example, all tyrannosaurs

1883
01:54:38,978 --> 01:54:42,498
have at least some kind of crest on the head. The early ones have like this

1884
01:54:42,598 --> 01:54:46,378
midline crest. It really doesn't work on a human. They have like a midline crest

1885
01:54:46,438 --> 01:54:49,938
running along the top of the nose that sticks up. The later ones

1886
01:54:50,018 --> 01:54:53,818
largely don't, but they do have this weird armored structure

1887
01:54:53,898 --> 01:54:56,938
along those fused nasals and then they have little horns over the

1888
01:54:57,018 --> 01:55:00,898
eyes. Those as far as we can tell, don't really have any

1889
01:55:00,938 --> 01:55:06,918
kind of obvious mechanical function and loads, like outside of the feathered

1890
01:55:06,978 --> 01:55:10,758
dinosaurs, the vast majority of carnivorous dinosaurs

1891
01:55:10,898 --> 01:55:14,098
have some kind of crestal display feature on the head.

1892
01:55:14,138 --> 01:55:17,258
- When you say display feature, meaning for sex appeal to attract mates?

1893
01:55:17,338 --> 01:55:20,798
- Or something like that. So I've always favored the term

1894
01:55:21,058 --> 01:55:24,918
socio-sexual selection to cover both sexual

1895
01:55:25,038 --> 01:55:28,658
display and sexual dominance and communication, but also

1896
01:55:28,718 --> 01:55:32,118
social ones, because those two things are hard to tell apart. Female

1897
01:55:32,178 --> 01:55:36,146
lions find males with darker manes sexier, but

1898
01:55:36,306 --> 01:55:39,186
male lions find males with darker manes more

1899
01:55:39,206 --> 01:55:43,186
intimidating. So one of them is sex, but one of them is social.

1900
01:55:43,226 --> 01:55:43,686
- Nice.

1901
01:55:43,706 --> 01:55:44,266
- And then-

1902
01:55:44,276 --> 01:55:47,176
- I mean, I guess it goes hand-in-hand, sure. Yeah.

1903
01:55:47,226 --> 01:55:50,966
- It can, but then you get things like the other one I go for is black

1904
01:55:51,046 --> 01:55:54,706
swans, these beautiful Australian birds. They have these really weird curly

1905
01:55:54,746 --> 01:55:58,566
feathers on their wings. And males and females both have them, and

1906
01:55:58,706 --> 01:56:02,546
males prefer females with curlier feathers, and females prefer males

1907
01:56:02,626 --> 01:56:06,546
with curlier feathers. There's an obvious sexual link, but then females fight

1908
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:10,576
too. Females fight over the best nesting spots, and

1909
01:56:10,606 --> 01:56:13,486
the females with the curliest feathers tend to win those fights.

1910
01:56:13,506 --> 01:56:14,966
- How does that make sense?

1911
01:56:15,036 --> 01:56:18,786
- This gets into classic sexual selection theory. It's what's called an honest

1912
01:56:18,906 --> 01:56:23,966
signal. You couldn't have those curly feathers if you weren't able to support them.

1913
01:56:24,216 --> 01:56:28,166
Because they're the primary feathers on the wings, and what it actually does is it

1914
01:56:28,206 --> 01:56:34,966
makes it harder to fly. So you're basically going, "Look how tough I am. I've grown

1915
01:56:35,036 --> 01:56:39,366
this big and I can fly and carry on with my giant curly feathers

1916
01:56:40,485 --> 01:56:44,226
because I'm really tough and I'm in good shape." And it's the same with the lion.

1917
01:56:44,346 --> 01:56:48,296
The reason you get pale lions in the south is because it's close to the

1918
01:56:48,306 --> 01:56:49,426
equator, because it's too hot.

1919
01:56:50,366 --> 01:56:54,226
So there's the trade-off, because if you have a really black mane, all the

1920
01:56:54,266 --> 01:56:58,206
males know you're rock and all the females know you're super sexy, but

1921
01:56:58,246 --> 01:57:02,126
you just die of overheating. The trade-off is if the heat's

1922
01:57:02,166 --> 01:57:05,706
going to kill you, you're probably better off being a bit paler

1923
01:57:06,606 --> 01:57:10,446
and surviving in order to reproduce than you are being

1924
01:57:10,486 --> 01:57:13,856
jet black but just dying instantly as soon as it gets hot.

1925
01:57:13,866 --> 01:57:15,296
- So there's trade-offs there, okay.

1926
01:57:15,296 --> 01:57:17,946
- Yeah, and that's probably what's happening with the

1927
01:57:17,966 --> 01:57:21,516
theropods. All the little crests and

1928
01:57:21,546 --> 01:57:25,386
horns, Ceratosaurus, Dilophosaurus, tyrannosaurs, allosaurs

1929
01:57:25,426 --> 01:57:29,396
have big crests over the eyes, and all kinds of others. I've

1930
01:57:29,406 --> 01:57:32,856
written about this, I think this is the trade-off. You're going for the

1931
01:57:33,006 --> 01:57:34,106
sexiest look,

1932
01:57:34,316 --> 01:57:37,826
and the sexiest look is the biggest horns or the biggest spikes and whatever's on the

1933
01:57:37,866 --> 01:57:41,086
head, probably also then with the brightest colors and the most display

1934
01:57:41,106 --> 01:57:44,966
patterns, but also this gives you away to

1935
01:57:44,986 --> 01:57:48,656
your prey. If you're trying to hide or you're trying to sneak up on something,

1936
01:57:48,686 --> 01:57:52,626
being brightly colored or having stripes or all this extra stuff on your head,

1937
01:57:52,666 --> 01:57:56,406
you get spotted. But then that's the trade-off.

1938
01:57:56,906 --> 01:58:00,706
is if I'm this big and my horns are, if my horns are this

1939
01:58:00,766 --> 01:58:04,726
big and this red and yellow and I can still, whoop,

1940
01:58:04,806 --> 01:58:08,186
I can still run those guys down and hunt them and kill them and eat them.

1941
01:58:08,876 --> 01:58:12,866
Then look how great I must be. Whereas that little guy, he's

1942
01:58:12,926 --> 01:58:16,286
only got weedy little crests and they're really dark

1943
01:58:16,726 --> 01:58:20,526
because he's so bad at catching stuff he doesn't have the extra

1944
01:58:20,586 --> 01:58:24,526
energy to grow big crests. And that's why. But when you're a

1945
01:58:24,566 --> 01:58:28,496
herbivore, you don't have that pressure, particularly something like, this

1946
01:58:28,526 --> 01:58:32,406
is Protoceratops, but somebody like Triceratops and these guys, they're living in big groups.

1947
01:58:32,446 --> 01:58:36,146
You can't hide from a predator when you're a group of 20 animals that are 10 tons

1948
01:58:36,186 --> 01:58:40,056
each, so who cares? You just grow the biggest

1949
01:58:40,126 --> 01:58:43,886
signal you can possibly grow, and lo and behold, they have giant frills and

1950
01:58:43,986 --> 01:58:45,166
giant horns.

1951
01:58:45,266 --> 01:58:49,086
- What can you say about beauty in evolution?

1952
01:58:49,146 --> 01:58:53,126
Something that's, maybe you can educate me, but something that's not quite an

1953
01:58:53,166 --> 01:58:56,526
honest signal that's just pure beauty like peacock feathers?

1954
01:58:56,566 --> 01:59:00,226
- So there are things which we think operate closer to that. So there

1955
01:59:00,326 --> 01:59:04,026
are, these are the two classic ideas of sexual selection, and both are

1956
01:59:04,106 --> 01:59:08,046
probably true to certain degrees in various different species. One is the honest

1957
01:59:08,086 --> 01:59:12,046
signal or the, it's the kind of handicap hypothesis because you're holding

1958
01:59:12,086 --> 01:59:15,026
yourself back whilst proving you can still do it. I ran the

1959
01:59:15,066 --> 01:59:18,876
marathon, you know, carrying a couple of weights. You're

1960
01:59:18,926 --> 01:59:22,786
obviously stronger than the guy who ran the marathon without. And so

1961
01:59:22,826 --> 01:59:26,286
that's why it's an honest signal and it's why it's a handicap. But the other one is what's called the

1962
01:59:26,526 --> 01:59:32,086
But the other one is what's called the sexy sons hypothesis.

1963
01:59:32,886 --> 01:59:35,406
The idea is a female might just find a male attractive for no other reason than random.

1964
01:59:36,426 --> 01:59:40,406
There is some component of her brain, or whatever it may be, that just

1965
01:59:40,466 --> 01:59:43,846
looks cool, and you can actually sort of get this as a

1966
01:59:43,926 --> 01:59:47,896
human. Forget human beauty, you can look at a bottle and

1967
01:59:47,946 --> 01:59:51,456
go, "That bottle's kind of nice, and that bottle's kind of ugly."

1968
01:59:51,486 --> 01:59:54,726
- Where do you put birds? Birds are interesting with this.

1969
01:59:54,786 --> 01:59:56,006
Where do you put peacock feathers?

1970
01:59:56,066 --> 01:59:59,806
- So they're probably more of a handicap hypothesis because the

1971
01:59:59,886 --> 02:00:02,486
colors that go into them and the sheer size and shape—

1972
02:00:02,496 --> 02:00:03,646
- Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1973
02:00:03,655 --> 02:00:07,986
- ...and these things basically can't fly. They're really vulnerable to predators.

1974
02:00:08,046 --> 02:00:12,546
- Can the handicap hypothesis explain just how beautiful peacock feathers get?

1975
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:12,845
- So-

1976
02:00:12,866 --> 02:00:14,826
- They go extreme with it.

1977
02:00:14,836 --> 02:00:18,786
- So, probably not entirely. There's almost certainly randomness going on in

1978
02:00:18,826 --> 02:00:22,626
there as well. And then the eye spots. We know that eye spots are attractive

1979
02:00:22,666 --> 02:00:26,446
are probably encoded in some way. But yeah, going back to the sexy sons, the idea

1980
02:00:26,486 --> 02:00:30,326
is females prefer something different for whatever reason, and there

1981
02:00:30,366 --> 02:00:34,166
might actually be some reasons females prefer things that are different.

1982
02:00:34,286 --> 02:00:38,026
Different usually means separate and outside,

1983
02:00:38,106 --> 02:00:43,086
and that usually comes with variation inherently.

1984
02:00:43,156 --> 02:00:46,406
- Oh, so variation is an evolutionary turn-on?

1985
02:00:46,466 --> 02:00:48,226
- Yeah, basically.

1986
02:00:48,266 --> 02:00:51,215
- Wouldn't it? Man, you're rolling the dice, though, aren't you?

1987
02:00:51,226 --> 02:00:52,566
- Yeah, well, you...

1988
02:00:52,606 --> 02:00:52,866
- Right.

1989
02:00:52,886 --> 02:00:56,586
- You've got to remember, again, it's really easy to look at that sort of thing with a

1990
02:00:56,646 --> 02:01:00,206
human perspective where, at maximum, reproductive

1991
02:01:00,266 --> 02:01:04,206
output, I think the record — there's some obscure record — it's something

1992
02:01:04,246 --> 02:01:08,086
like 66 children, which is probably apocryphal for a

1993
02:01:08,146 --> 02:01:11,166
Russian woman who had loads of triplets and quads. But,

1994
02:01:11,186 --> 02:01:15,966
humans don't have many offspring, but most animals

1995
02:01:17,266 --> 02:01:23,306
lay dozens of eggs or hundreds of eggs or thousands of eggs at a time.

1996
02:01:23,386 --> 02:01:24,706
- So, diversity pays off more there.

1997
02:01:24,746 --> 02:01:28,506
- So diversity can pay off. We think that's probably a major part of the reason that sex

1998
02:01:28,566 --> 02:01:32,106
evolved in the first place: it gives you

1999
02:01:32,166 --> 02:01:35,676
resistance to a changing environment and it gives you resistance to parasites and

2000
02:01:35,686 --> 02:01:39,676
diseases which often reproduce way faster than you do.

2001
02:01:39,726 --> 02:01:43,396
bacteria can divide in a few hours. We reproduce every 20 years.

2002
02:01:43,396 --> 02:01:47,282
That's quite a difference. If we were all asexual clones and

2003
02:01:47,322 --> 02:01:51,302
you're vulnerable to some disease, you're probably going to get wiped out.

2004
02:01:51,322 --> 02:01:54,562
Look at the Irish Potato Famine, or something like that.

2005
02:01:55,382 --> 02:01:59,342
So different may be appealing simply because it is different.

2006
02:01:59,402 --> 02:02:03,302
variation. And there's at least some evidence for

2007
02:02:03,362 --> 02:02:07,222
that. There's swordtails. So anyone who keeps

2008
02:02:07,262 --> 02:02:11,202
little fish — if anyone's a tropical fish keeper,

2009
02:02:11,282 --> 02:02:15,202
swordtails are really quite common little tropical fish that you can get in

2010
02:02:15,222 --> 02:02:19,182
all kinds of aquarium shops, and they're a very boring fish shape.

2011
02:02:19,242 --> 02:02:23,142
their tail has a big spike on it, and that's the name. They're really

2012
02:02:23,182 --> 02:02:26,962
close relatives of a group called the mollies, which basically don't have

2013
02:02:27,022 --> 02:02:30,662
that. In the wild, these are Amazonian fish; they don't usually

2014
02:02:30,682 --> 02:02:34,562
encounter each other, but even if you go and get not even the domesticated form,

2015
02:02:34,572 --> 02:02:38,342
because these things have been bred for, you know, decades at this point, you can go and get some wild

2016
02:02:38,382 --> 02:02:41,862
mollies and give them a wild male swordtail, and they

2017
02:02:41,922 --> 02:02:45,682
think he's so much better than all the male mollies. They

2018
02:02:45,742 --> 02:02:49,621
will go for that one, and they will preferentially mate with that one. We don't know the exact

2019
02:02:49,661 --> 02:02:53,202
mechanism, but it appears to be, he looks similar enough that I

2020
02:02:53,242 --> 02:02:58,182
recognize it as a potential mate but different enough that this is exciting.

2021
02:02:58,802 --> 02:03:02,762
And then this is where the sexy sons kick in because the females are now assuming

2022
02:03:02,802 --> 02:03:06,712
those animals are successful, and they can hybridize, or maybe it's

2023
02:03:06,782 --> 02:03:10,001
just a male who just happens to be a little bit blue or a little bit red or whatever it may

2024
02:03:10,041 --> 02:03:14,012
be. Well, the female offspring,

2025
02:03:14,041 --> 02:03:17,702
the daughters are probably going to inherit mother's preference, I really like

2026
02:03:17,802 --> 02:03:19,462
red, and the males

2027
02:03:20,442 --> 02:03:24,282
are probably going to have red in them because their dad had more red. So guess

2028
02:03:24,322 --> 02:03:28,262
what the next generation does? There's more red, and the females

2029
02:03:28,302 --> 02:03:32,232
like more red, and you don't have to come back much further, and suddenly all

2030
02:03:32,282 --> 02:03:35,041
the males are bright red. And that's

2031
02:03:35,902 --> 02:03:39,882
closer to beauty than I think almost anything else would be, with still a

2032
02:03:39,922 --> 02:03:41,842
naturalistic explanation.

2033
02:03:41,882 --> 02:03:46,081
- We kind of started talking about beauty from how much social life

2034
02:03:46,162 --> 02:03:47,282
- Yeah, a T-rex might have.

2035
02:03:47,291 --> 02:03:50,782
- a T-rex might have, so just to kind of

2036
02:03:51,382 --> 02:03:55,001
take that to a place of what we know and what we don't know. So can we

2037
02:03:55,102 --> 02:04:01,282
kind of know something about their social life, where they lived, how they lived?

2038
02:04:01,342 --> 02:04:05,322
- So the very fact that they have these apparently socio-sexually

2039
02:04:05,342 --> 02:04:08,222
selected signals, the little crest and stuff in the

2040
02:04:08,282 --> 02:04:11,922
head. So there's a branch of sexual

2041
02:04:11,982 --> 02:04:15,581
selection called mutual sexual selection, and the black swans are an

2042
02:04:15,642 --> 02:04:19,592
example of this. The classic sexual selection is your peacocks and your lions

2043
02:04:19,621 --> 02:04:22,982
and things like this. Males are bigger and more

2044
02:04:23,001 --> 02:04:26,722
flamboyant and whatever it is, and they're doing all the competing. But

2045
02:04:26,762 --> 02:04:30,702
mutual sexual selection, and this is really common in a whole bunch

2046
02:04:30,742 --> 02:04:34,492
of things that people are familiar with but don't know. Loads of seabirds,

2047
02:04:34,782 --> 02:04:38,422
starlings, the common starling that we have in Europe and has been introduced into the U.S.,

2048
02:04:38,842 --> 02:04:42,682
parrots, various other things, where basically males

2049
02:04:42,782 --> 02:04:46,062
and females invest similarly in rearing the

2050
02:04:46,142 --> 02:04:49,942
offspring. So the idea generally, both with handicap and

2051
02:04:49,962 --> 02:04:53,871
sexy son, but particularly with handicap, is the idea that males are proving their

2052
02:04:53,882 --> 02:04:56,922
worth. They're basically saying, "I'm the biggest, strongest, healthiest, I've got the best

2053
02:04:56,962 --> 02:05:00,791
genes, I should be the father of your offspring." They go around

2054
02:05:00,842 --> 02:05:04,691
showing off and then mate with as many females as possible.

2055
02:05:04,722 --> 02:05:08,621
While the females then do all the work and make the nest and look after

2056
02:05:08,662 --> 02:05:12,352
the chicks and, yeah, or rear them or give birth or whatever it may be, yada, yada,

2057
02:05:12,402 --> 02:05:16,162
yada. So the idea with mutual sexual selection is, what if there's not

2058
02:05:16,202 --> 02:05:17,532
much food around?

2059
02:05:18,382 --> 02:05:22,222
Things like puffins or, you know, penguins in the Arctic where the male sits with the

2060
02:05:22,262 --> 02:05:25,642
egg and the female toddles off, gets food, and then comes back two months later or whatever it

2061
02:05:25,702 --> 02:05:31,802
is. On their own, they can't rear the offspring. They have to have

2062
02:05:31,902 --> 02:05:37,782
a male investment. Well, suddenly the male's now putting loads of effort in,

2063
02:05:38,522 --> 02:05:41,702
so the male's now in the same position that a female would be in under the normal

2064
02:05:41,762 --> 02:05:45,751
conditions. You don't want to be the sexiest, toughest, biggest male,

2065
02:05:46,282 --> 02:05:50,262
and you can only mate once, all right? There are various cheats, but we

2066
02:05:50,282 --> 02:05:54,212
won't get into that just yet. You're only going to mate once and you're going to put all your effort into helping

2067
02:05:54,282 --> 02:05:58,202
rearing offspring, rather than chasing down as many girls as possible. Are

2068
02:05:58,282 --> 02:06:02,242
you going to go for the biggest, fittest female as well, or are you going to go for the small, weedy

2069
02:06:02,302 --> 02:06:06,202
one that doesn't look very well? You go for the best one. Well,

2070
02:06:06,282 --> 02:06:10,162
how do you know that? Well, because she's got a crest as well, and so

2071
02:06:10,222 --> 02:06:14,081
suddenly you now get mutual ornamentation just like the

2072
02:06:14,102 --> 02:06:17,982
black swans where the males are checking out the curliest females, and the

2073
02:06:18,001 --> 02:06:21,822
females are checking out the curliest males, and you'll see they mutually pair

2074
02:06:21,902 --> 02:06:25,602
up. This is what we see with things like starlings. Males like the brightest females,

2075
02:06:25,662 --> 02:06:29,541
females like the brightest males, they tend to form pairs. The darkest

2076
02:06:29,581 --> 02:06:33,331
and least bright ones are obviously kind of left with each other at the bottom of the pile.

2077
02:06:33,362 --> 02:06:37,322
They tend to pair up. But it means that when you've got signals in both males

2078
02:06:37,402 --> 02:06:40,242
and females, like every triceratops or every

2079
02:06:40,262 --> 02:06:44,632
tyrannosaurus, it at least hints that they're going down this route,

2080
02:06:45,541 --> 02:06:48,642
and that they might cooperate for reproduction.

2081
02:06:48,702 --> 02:06:53,791
- Wow. Another like weak signal that tells a powerful story.

2082
02:06:53,791 --> 02:06:57,602
- Yeah, and the problem is it's compromised by lots of things. So that goes back to your earlier

2083
02:06:57,682 --> 02:07:01,382
question about telling males from females apart. The vast majority of dinosaur

2084
02:07:01,402 --> 02:07:04,362
species, like 90 plus percent, are known from a single specimen.

2085
02:07:05,242 --> 02:07:08,942
And a specimen is not necessarily very complete at all. It might be a

2086
02:07:09,022 --> 02:07:11,922
couple of bones, it might be one bone, it might be a tooth in a couple of

2087
02:07:11,962 --> 02:07:17,382
cases. The actual number where we've got a decent number of real

2088
02:07:18,462 --> 02:07:21,682
whole skeletons that we can actually compare to each other,

2089
02:07:23,001 --> 02:07:25,882
less than 10. Probably more like five or six.

2090
02:07:25,962 --> 02:07:31,642
- Can I ask you a weird question? If you were to, let's say,

2091
02:07:32,541 --> 02:07:33,842
all humans died right now—

2092
02:07:34,012 --> 02:07:37,902
...press a button, poof, gone, how much of human civilization would

2093
02:07:37,922 --> 02:07:41,682
you be able to reconstruct from just the skeletons that are in the

2094
02:07:41,722 --> 02:07:45,232
ground? Like, you just start collecting skeletons. There's a lot of them.

2095
02:07:45,661 --> 02:07:49,402
There are billions of them. Would you be able to start telling a

2096
02:07:49,522 --> 02:07:52,192
story, like urban centers?

2097
02:07:52,242 --> 02:07:53,192
- Yeah, probably, because—

2098
02:07:53,202 --> 02:07:54,871
- You could probably reconstruct a lot, right?

2099
02:07:54,871 --> 02:07:58,702
- And if nothing else, just the, you know, superlative brain cavity

2100
02:07:59,202 --> 02:08:00,942
will tell you quite a lot, you know.

2101
02:08:01,102 --> 02:08:01,692
- Yeah, the intelligence.

2102
02:08:01,722 --> 02:08:04,612
- Must have been very, very smart with...

2103
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:04,732
- You could-

2104
02:08:04,732 --> 02:08:05,581
- ...a brain that big.

2105
02:08:05,621 --> 02:08:09,041
- You can probably reconstruct some of the behavior, a lot of the behavior, social behavior.

2106
02:08:09,062 --> 02:08:09,472
A lot of this stuff.

2107
02:08:09,482 --> 02:08:13,422
- And you're going to see stuff like, you know, it's the famous one of... I think it was

2108
02:08:13,442 --> 02:08:17,192
a Neanderthal. There was a famous question of like, you know, "At what point do you

2109
02:08:17,242 --> 02:08:21,102
think society exists?" And maybe one of the Leakeys but the

2110
02:08:21,161 --> 02:08:24,862
answer was basically this skeleton because it was someone with a

2111
02:08:25,142 --> 02:08:28,722
real-like a properly busted leg and then it fully

2112
02:08:28,762 --> 02:08:32,642
healed. And it's like if that person was on their own, just

2113
02:08:32,682 --> 02:08:36,382
dead, someone had to look after them for months

2114
02:08:36,702 --> 02:08:40,362
to get that level of healing. You only do that to someone you're really

2115
02:08:40,402 --> 02:08:44,382
devoted to and probably a group of people 'cause even one person can't look

2116
02:08:44,482 --> 02:08:47,791
after one other person, right? So that's your

2117
02:08:47,882 --> 02:08:51,342
society. And yet you think about the pathology of skeletons

2118
02:08:51,362 --> 02:08:55,272
in the human race. How, you know, how many of us have broken a bone?

2119
02:08:55,302 --> 02:08:59,192
Most adults have probably broken a couple of bones

2120
02:08:59,222 --> 02:09:03,132
even if it's just a finger or a nose or

2121
02:09:03,142 --> 02:09:06,982
something. But then you think about what medicine has done and you would be able to

2122
02:09:07,062 --> 02:09:10,942
see treatments of complete compound fractures of guys

2123
02:09:10,962 --> 02:09:14,642
who survived horrific car crashes and treatments of cancer, bone

2124
02:09:14,722 --> 02:09:18,642
cancers and stuff like that. You would see that. Well, how is that happening? Either

2125
02:09:18,682 --> 02:09:22,382
they're magic or they've got some kind of... In which case, they'd probably cure

2126
02:09:22,422 --> 02:09:29,282
it instantly or there's some kind of technology in society supporting that change.

2127
02:09:29,322 --> 02:09:33,161
- That just hints at the fact that the evidence collection and

2128
02:09:33,302 --> 02:09:38,422
the reasoning mechanisms that paleontology and archaeology uses is really powerful.

2129
02:09:38,462 --> 02:09:38,612
- Yeah, it is.

2130
02:09:38,621 --> 02:09:42,522
- And so it could be very effective even just with a small amount of data.

2131
02:09:42,562 --> 02:09:42,922
I mean you could-

2132
02:09:42,942 --> 02:09:46,880
- But it's the right amount of data. That's the thing. We can find dozens of skeletons

2133
02:09:46,902 --> 02:09:50,782
that we can't do very much with and then the right one that, you know,

2134
02:09:50,842 --> 02:09:54,791
things like stomach contents, you know, that's a super or bite marks is a super powerful bit of

2135
02:09:54,842 --> 02:09:58,382
data but it doesn't turn up that often. So it's not like you can get it off every

2136
02:09:58,422 --> 02:10:02,302
skeleton. And that's the thing, it's the pool of data and I think

2137
02:10:02,362 --> 02:10:08,562
that's what people miss. We, as paleontologists, we get caught up

2138
02:10:08,682 --> 02:10:12,652
on single superlative specimens and then try and

2139
02:10:12,702 --> 02:10:16,482
treat them as a... like a silver bullet almost.

2140
02:10:16,541 --> 02:10:20,291
So Microraptor, I mentioned this before, little flying dinosaur, crow-sized or

2141
02:10:20,362 --> 02:10:24,112
gliding dinosaur. Crow-sized thing from China. We've got at least a

2142
02:10:24,112 --> 02:10:27,902
dozen good specimens of it by now and multiple ones with stomach

2143
02:10:27,942 --> 02:10:31,802
contents. There's one I've described with a little mammal foot inside

2144
02:10:31,822 --> 02:10:35,772
it, there's one with a bird inside it, there's one with a lizard inside it and there's

2145
02:10:35,802 --> 02:10:39,572
one with a fish inside it. On their own, and this happened for at

2146
02:10:39,602 --> 02:10:43,581
least two of the papers describing these things, it's like, "It ate fish.

2147
02:10:43,632 --> 02:10:47,081
These are fish-eating animals." No, that one ate one

2148
02:10:47,182 --> 02:10:51,001
fish once. That one ate one bird

2149
02:10:51,081 --> 02:10:54,222
once, that one ate one mammal once and that one ate one lizard

2150
02:10:54,262 --> 02:10:58,202
once. So what have we actually got here?

2151
02:10:58,322 --> 02:11:02,172
I suspect we've got a group of generalists and we just happen to have found them eating different things

2152
02:11:02,222 --> 02:11:06,102
at different times. But equally, it's also possible, at

2153
02:11:06,142 --> 02:11:10,062
least, that, yeah, this is one of these things and it had learned to

2154
02:11:10,121 --> 02:11:14,022
eat fish when the others hadn't and actually this was mostly fish eaters and the others

2155
02:11:14,041 --> 02:11:17,682
ate whatever they could get. Maybe one caught a bird up a tree in a

2156
02:11:17,742 --> 02:11:21,302
nest. Maybe one found it dead on the ground. You don't really know what

2157
02:11:21,541 --> 02:11:29,510
one of these things on its own is fascinating, but potentially misleading.

2158
02:11:29,541 --> 02:11:32,692
- Well, the way you're describing it now, it seems like, yes, it's potentially misleading, but

2159
02:11:32,702 --> 02:11:36,581
there's... in your whole way of being and the way you've been talking about

2160
02:11:36,621 --> 02:11:37,842
this stuff I can see that

2161
02:11:38,642 --> 02:11:42,182
it's not just the direct evidence you're mentioning. It's like, it's a bunch of

2162
02:11:42,222 --> 02:11:46,121
intuitions you build up. It's like you're stitching together a bunch

2163
02:11:46,182 --> 02:11:50,041
of little things... It's the Sherlock Holmes thing. Not just this one piece of evidence.

2164
02:11:50,402 --> 02:11:51,661
this one piece of evidence-

2165
02:11:51,692 --> 02:11:55,581
... it's like, "Okay, what do I know about the general other

2166
02:11:55,602 --> 02:11:58,621
dinosaurs that are on the Earth? The different animals-"

2167
02:11:58,651 --> 02:12:02,572
... how animals usually behave about this period, about the environment?" And all of that comes

2168
02:12:02,621 --> 02:12:04,212
together, and then- ... figuring out which is true.

2169
02:12:04,212 --> 02:12:08,112
- And that's... So one thing I've definitely written about is,

2170
02:12:08,142 --> 02:12:11,951
yeah, the independent lines of evidence. Can you get

2171
02:12:12,041 --> 02:12:15,822
stuff that is as far as possible truly

2172
02:12:15,862 --> 02:12:19,742
independent from the other data and does it give you the

2173
02:12:19,782 --> 02:12:23,081
same answer? And then when it does-

2174
02:12:23,102 --> 02:12:23,451
- That's powerful.

2175
02:12:23,451 --> 02:12:27,442
- ... that's incredibly powerful. So Spinosaurus or the-

2176
02:12:27,462 --> 02:12:30,632
the spinosaurs as a whole is my go-to example for this are

2177
02:12:30,642 --> 02:12:34,442
the... guys with the famous big sail back and the weird crocodile-like

2178
02:12:34,462 --> 02:12:38,362
head, though some of them look rather different to that. And if you look across

2179
02:12:38,482 --> 02:12:42,462
all the species and specimens that we have, incredibly fragmentary and very badly

2180
02:12:42,501 --> 02:12:50,212
known, but they're all basically associated with... When you look at the gestalt,

2181
02:12:50,782 --> 02:12:54,522
you see a whole bunch of stuff for these things. So they

2182
02:12:54,541 --> 02:12:58,422
do have a surprisingly crocodile-like head and crocodile-like teeth compared to every

2183
02:12:58,501 --> 02:13:02,382
other carnivorous dinosaur. And when you do the mechanical analysis, you

2184
02:13:02,422 --> 02:13:05,642
see they function in a very similar way. And indeed,

2185
02:13:06,742 --> 02:13:10,581
teeth, here's a spinosaur tooth with very nearly circular

2186
02:13:10,642 --> 02:13:14,462
cross section, really distinctive, similar to crocodiles, similar

2187
02:13:14,501 --> 02:13:17,482
to dolphins, similar to fish-eating fish.

2188
02:13:17,922 --> 02:13:21,282
So points to fish. Crocodile-like head, points to

2189
02:13:21,302 --> 02:13:24,962
fish. Crocs eat other stuff too, but still. Um,

2190
02:13:25,242 --> 02:13:28,462
they're usually found in or near aquatic systems now.

2191
02:13:29,342 --> 02:13:33,302
Fossils in general tend to turn up in aquatic systems because you've got to be buried to become a fossil.

2192
02:13:34,001 --> 02:13:37,922
So water association is common, but even so, that's true.

2193
02:13:37,962 --> 02:13:41,402
They turn up in places where lots of other dinosaurs don't tend to turn up,

2194
02:13:42,282 --> 02:13:45,922
including carnivores, which suggests they're eating something

2195
02:13:45,982 --> 02:13:49,172
else. If you look at the isotopic signature of the

2196
02:13:49,262 --> 02:13:53,001
teeth, often it correlates with crocodiles, fish,

2197
02:13:53,041 --> 02:13:56,402
turtles, and stuff that lives in water, and doesn't correlate well

2198
02:13:56,462 --> 02:14:00,782
with other land-living dinosaurs that lived in the same time and same place.

2199
02:14:02,222 --> 02:14:06,041
So you put all of that together, and it's really hard to

2200
02:14:06,081 --> 02:14:09,522
argue... Oh, in addition to the tiny detail of Baryonyx, the British

2201
02:14:09,621 --> 02:14:13,602
one was found with fish scales inside its chest cavity. So you put all of

2202
02:14:13,662 --> 02:14:17,382
that together, and yeah, I'm not saying it only ate fish.

2203
02:14:17,441 --> 02:14:21,062
I'm sure it ate big shrimp and turtles. And we know they were

2204
02:14:21,081 --> 02:14:24,982
predating on terrestrial dinosaurs and pterosaurs because, again, stomach

2205
02:14:25,022 --> 02:14:28,642
contents and teeth and stuff. But fundamentally, this is an

2206
02:14:28,682 --> 02:14:32,662
animal or a group of animals doing something different to the other carnivorous

2207
02:14:32,742 --> 02:14:36,182
dinosaurs, and it's probably linked to water, and it's probably linked to

2208
02:14:36,202 --> 02:14:39,222
fish as a predominant way of living.

2209
02:14:39,262 --> 02:14:42,782
- We should mention that you're working on a book out in early 2026?

2210
02:14:42,882 --> 02:14:48,121
- In the UK it will be out in November. In North America, January or February 2026.

2211
02:14:48,182 --> 02:14:52,962
- It's called Spinosaur Tales: The Biology and Ecology of the Spinosaurus. And...

2212
02:14:52,972 --> 02:14:55,142
- Written with Mark Witton, who did that picture.

2213
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:55,952
- It's a beautiful creature.

2214
02:14:55,952 --> 02:14:59,942
- Which I think is in there. Mark's done a ton of new artwork. He helped write

2215
02:14:59,962 --> 02:15:01,982
the book, but he's also the artist.

2216
02:15:02,001 --> 02:15:05,862
- I mean, can you describe a little bit more about this creature? There's a bunch of stuff like

2217
02:15:05,922 --> 02:15:09,022
what you just mentioned. There's some debate. Like where-

2218
02:15:09,581 --> 02:15:13,222
Is it... To what degree is it aquatic? So what-

2219
02:15:13,282 --> 02:15:14,842
- Not very is my take.

2220
02:15:14,852 --> 02:15:16,962
- So does it live in the water? Does it-

2221
02:15:17,001 --> 02:15:20,802
- I... Yeah. So I think it's basically a big wader.

2222
02:15:20,882 --> 02:15:24,621
It's a poor analogy, but it's a very weird, giant stork.

2223
02:15:24,632 --> 02:15:24,812
- Oh. Got it.

2224
02:15:24,822 --> 02:15:25,621
- Or heron.

2225
02:15:25,642 --> 02:15:26,762
- Was giant.

2226
02:15:26,882 --> 02:15:30,501
- Yeah. So potentially bigger than T-Rex. Linearly, not in

2227
02:15:30,562 --> 02:15:34,262
mass. Again, really quite narrow chest versus that T-Rex

2228
02:15:34,862 --> 02:15:38,621
barrel. But potentially 15 meters long, so bigger than any

2229
02:15:38,662 --> 02:15:40,862
T-Rex we've found, at least in terms of length.

2230
02:15:40,902 --> 02:15:44,222
- Can you describe what it looks like? The... I mean, there's some iconic features to it, right?

2231
02:15:44,282 --> 02:15:47,621
- Yeah. So this really quite long head,

2232
02:15:47,722 --> 02:15:51,462
with a kind of wavy jawline. Like, animals have

2233
02:15:51,682 --> 02:15:55,642
You know, most carnivores have straight jaws. This one has a kind of

2234
02:15:55,702 --> 02:15:59,522
somewhat wiggly jawline. It really narrows at the front and then opens up

2235
02:15:59,562 --> 02:16:02,962
again into a like a little... It's called a rosette. So you've got like a little

2236
02:16:03,001 --> 02:16:06,702
semicircle, and then a dip, and then the jaws go back, and then the teeth

2237
02:16:06,762 --> 02:16:10,702
line waves up and down. These really conical teeth, which doesn't

2238
02:16:10,762 --> 02:16:12,822
sound very exciting, but it makes them

2239
02:16:13,782 --> 02:16:17,442
different to every other carnivorous dinosaur. No other thing has a conical

2240
02:16:17,501 --> 02:16:21,322
tooth, which is a classic fish thing, or at least biting hold of

2241
02:16:21,342 --> 02:16:25,291
something that wriggles. The nostrils are not at

2242
02:16:25,302 --> 02:16:29,282
the tip of the nose. They're pushed back, at least somewhat. It has a bunch of crests on the

2243
02:16:29,362 --> 02:16:33,242
head. It's got quite a long neck. Spinosaurus and at

2244
02:16:33,302 --> 02:16:36,882
least a couple of the other closest relatives to it, a thing called Ichthyovenator.

2245
02:16:36,982 --> 02:16:40,902
from... I can't remember if it's Thailand or Laos. I think it's Laos. It has this

2246
02:16:41,162 --> 02:16:45,101
giant elongated bit to the top of the vertebrae, so it gives it

2247
02:16:45,142 --> 02:16:48,682
this giant sail along the back. Spinosaurus,

2248
02:16:48,822 --> 02:16:52,802
at least, possibly Ichthyovenator, probably not any of the others, then

2249
02:16:52,842 --> 02:16:56,082
has this weird, thin, newt-like

2250
02:16:56,382 --> 02:17:00,322
expanse to the top of the tail, giving it kind of like a giant oar paddle

2251
02:17:00,382 --> 02:17:04,021
appearance. Mostly they have very large arms with

2252
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:08,040
giant claws on the hands. And Spinosaurus

2253
02:17:08,082 --> 02:17:11,322
at least appears to have really quite short legs, but the others

2254
02:17:11,361 --> 02:17:14,422
don't. But again, so

2255
02:17:14,781 --> 02:17:18,462
Spinosaurus is totally iconic, but if you look at something like Baryonyx from the

2256
02:17:18,502 --> 02:17:22,402
UK or Suchomimus from Niger,

2257
02:17:22,441 --> 02:17:26,422
it's still got the same head, neck, and arms, but it doesn't have this

2258
02:17:26,462 --> 02:17:29,941
sail, and it doesn't have this tail, and it probably doesn't have short legs. So Spinosaurus

2259
02:17:30,021 --> 02:17:33,922
is super weird and exaggerated version of what

2260
02:17:33,962 --> 02:17:37,892
was already a kind of super weird group of theropods.

2261
02:17:37,922 --> 02:17:41,722
So Spinosaurus is properly strange. And then, as you kind of

2262
02:17:41,762 --> 02:17:46,031
hinted at, super controversial as well, because various papers have

2263
02:17:46,861 --> 02:17:52,392
claimed it's a diver or a really good swimmer, and I think the evidence for that is

2264
02:17:53,642 --> 02:17:55,200
very weak at best.

2265
02:17:55,222 --> 02:17:59,182
- So your book is going to be... You're going to start some shit with your book. It's going to be all contro-

2266
02:17:59,370 --> 02:18:03,271
- I think... I think I already have, to be honest. I've written...

2267
02:18:03,281 --> 02:18:07,021
I've written three major papers, and one in particular with my colleague,

2268
02:18:07,082 --> 02:18:13,870
Tom Holt, where we frankly savaged the idea that it's a good swimmer. And then-

2269
02:18:13,941 --> 02:18:13,950
- Oh.

2270
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:17,781
- ...other people have since, including some of the authors who were on the original paper

2271
02:18:17,802 --> 02:18:20,932
claiming it did swim well, have now effectively reversed their position and said it

2272
02:18:20,962 --> 02:18:21,972
didn't.

2273
02:18:22,002 --> 02:18:25,302
- So the Jurassic Park 3 fight between the two-

2274
02:18:25,382 --> 02:18:25,691
- Yeah.

2275
02:18:25,691 --> 02:18:28,182
- ...who's famous. In a real-life encounter, who wins?

2276
02:18:28,222 --> 02:18:34,062
- Probably still T-Rex. I mean, the Jurassic Park Spinosaurus was pretty good for its

2277
02:18:34,162 --> 02:18:37,302
time because some of the stuff that I've just talked about,

2278
02:18:37,361 --> 02:18:41,242
particularly the short legs were suggested way back in 1910,

2279
02:18:41,281 --> 02:18:44,922
1912, but it was really uncertain.

2280
02:18:45,021 --> 02:18:48,912
Now it appears to be more likely the case than not. The tail was unknown at

2281
02:18:48,941 --> 02:18:52,790
this point, so it was just given a very generic tail. But

2282
02:18:52,842 --> 02:18:56,732
the crocodile-like head is pretty good. The neck's a bit short.

2283
02:18:56,762 --> 02:19:00,540
The sail is a bit too... It's almost just like a semicircle stuck on the

2284
02:19:00,642 --> 02:19:04,582
back, and it's a bit more complicated than that. But personally, I'm quite a

2285
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:08,492
big fan of the Jurassic Park 3 Spinosaurus. I think for its era, it's

2286
02:19:08,562 --> 02:19:15,342
really quite good. It is massive. There is this... They're from, I'm going to say,

2287
02:19:15,402 --> 02:19:18,802
Morocco, because Spinosaurus is found throughout North Africa, Morocco,

2288
02:19:18,842 --> 02:19:22,681
Algeria, Egypt. There's a massive pair of jaws or

2289
02:19:22,781 --> 02:19:26,402
snout that's in a collection in Milan

2290
02:19:27,082 --> 02:19:31,002
that's absolutely outsized. It's like an absolute giant. And that points

2291
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:34,941
to a truly monumentally sized Spinosaurus, which is where all these upper

2292
02:19:34,982 --> 02:19:38,781
estimates of 15-plus meters come from, is just this one set of jaws. But

2293
02:19:38,842 --> 02:19:42,762
yeah, it's about right, but it's just a bit too muscly and a bit

2294
02:19:42,822 --> 02:19:47,262
too bulky. But in gross appearance, it's pretty good.

2295
02:19:47,281 --> 02:19:49,302
- Does it have a chance against a T-Rex?

2296
02:19:49,382 --> 02:19:52,822
- No. Because it's got this unbelievably long, thin

2297
02:19:52,942 --> 02:19:56,202
jaw, which whilst much stronger than something like

2298
02:19:56,242 --> 02:19:59,902
Baryonyx, is fundamentally not that strong. The jaws are very long and thin, and then the teeth are...

2299
02:20:00,021 --> 02:20:03,502
The jaws are very long and thin, and then the teeth are... Yeah. They're

2300
02:20:03,542 --> 02:20:06,932
big, but they're not... big, big.

2301
02:20:06,992 --> 02:20:10,692
You know, the whole, like, it grabs the T-Rex neck and

2302
02:20:10,732 --> 02:20:14,302
then, like, snaps it. Well, Spinosaurus

2303
02:20:14,352 --> 02:20:18,272
actually, its neck is really strong going up and down and is

2304
02:20:18,312 --> 02:20:21,952
very weak rotating or going side to side. So it's got the

2305
02:20:22,012 --> 02:20:25,902
weakest kind of possible neck to, like, rotate and snap the T-Rex, and

2306
02:20:25,912 --> 02:20:29,812
then T-Rex has got, like, the strongest neck of anything. So you've got, like,

2307
02:20:29,852 --> 02:20:33,572
the weakest jaw with the weakest spin versus the strongest neck.

2308
02:20:34,352 --> 02:20:37,111
So no, I don't buy it.

2309
02:20:37,172 --> 02:20:40,912
- So that brings it back to the topic we touched on a little bit. What are... You've

2310
02:20:40,972 --> 02:20:43,592
mentioned a bunch of the stuff that the Jurassic Park...

2311
02:20:43,672 --> 02:20:47,092
...series gets wrong? Maybe you could speak to more

2312
02:20:47,152 --> 02:20:49,792
things, but also, what does it get right?

2313
02:20:49,872 --> 02:20:57,012
- So a lot of, like, very, in some level generic, but quite important things it gets

2314
02:20:57,032 --> 02:21:00,692
right. T-Rex is about the right size and shape and is

2315
02:21:00,772 --> 02:21:04,712
massive, and you don't actually see it run. You see it power walk. If you watch the Jeep chase again,

2316
02:21:04,732 --> 02:21:07,592
you'll see it only ever has one foot on the ground.

2317
02:21:07,602 --> 02:21:11,332
The weird thing for me is how much some of them vary. So, like, I'm a big

2318
02:21:11,352 --> 02:21:14,472
pterosaur guy. I do lots of work on pterosaurs, the flying reptiles. The

2319
02:21:14,512 --> 02:21:18,272
Pteranodons in Jurassic Park Two: The Lost

2320
02:21:18,352 --> 02:21:22,292
World, you see them very, very briefly in one of the last shots and they're okay, but

2321
02:21:22,332 --> 02:21:26,152
they're not great, but it's clearly a bit of a throwaway shot. The ones in Jurassic

2322
02:21:26,232 --> 02:21:30,202
Park Three, I think are mostly excellent. Really, really

2323
02:21:30,212 --> 02:21:34,122
good. And then the ones in Jurassic World are terrible. Like, a

2324
02:21:34,352 --> 02:21:38,192
massive regression. There's loads and loads of details that are right in

2325
02:21:38,232 --> 02:21:41,992
JP3 that are completely wrong in Jurassic World, and you're like, "Why did you take a

2326
02:21:42,152 --> 02:21:46,132
really good model and make it much, much worse and less

2327
02:21:46,192 --> 02:21:49,802
accurate?" I don't understand. And I...

2328
02:21:50,772 --> 02:21:56,092
Again, it's fiction. At one level, who cares? But, like, as you said, like,

2329
02:21:57,552 --> 02:22:01,352
I don't think... So, see, the weird thing for me is,

2330
02:22:01,552 --> 02:22:05,372
I don't think it would affect how they're perceived

2331
02:22:05,412 --> 02:22:09,292
by the public. Some things I get. Like, for example, in

2332
02:22:09,972 --> 02:22:13,832
Jurassic World, the Pteranodons pick people up with their feet and fly off with

2333
02:22:13,852 --> 02:22:17,812
them. Pteranodon's feet don't work like that. It would never be able to do that, and it would

2334
02:22:17,882 --> 02:22:21,592
never have the lift. But I get for dramatic purposes, you might want to show that.

2335
02:22:21,652 --> 02:22:25,552
Okay, fine. You know, this is your big sequence. You need that. But for

2336
02:22:25,592 --> 02:22:28,992
the rest of the animal, it's weirdly inaccurate,

2337
02:22:29,612 --> 02:22:33,512
and I don't think the public would know and

2338
02:22:33,552 --> 02:22:37,032
they might well care if it was much more accurate.

2339
02:22:37,972 --> 02:22:41,432
And I don't think it would be any harder to make it accurate than to make it

2340
02:22:41,532 --> 02:22:45,432
inaccurate. I've spoken to a colleague of mine who I won't

2341
02:22:45,492 --> 02:22:47,552
name, just in case I get him into trouble.

2342
02:22:47,962 --> 02:22:51,792
who's a big dinosaur nerd, but also a big creature creator

2343
02:22:51,852 --> 02:22:55,392
and designer, and has done a whole bunch of proper Hollywood

2344
02:22:55,532 --> 02:22:58,712
A-list movie stuff. And I asked him about this, and I

2345
02:22:58,732 --> 02:23:02,552
went, "Okay, but, like, is it just easier to

2346
02:23:02,592 --> 02:23:06,462
take the model that you've got and mess around with it than to, if I came in

2347
02:23:06,512 --> 02:23:10,392
and said, 'You need to fix that, and you need to fix this, you need to fix this, you need to fix that?'"

2348
02:23:10,452 --> 02:23:13,752
And he basically went, "No, it's about the same amount of effort." It's not like

2349
02:23:15,772 --> 02:23:19,692
we don't have the director or the producer or the lead designer going, "No, I want that arm

2350
02:23:19,712 --> 02:23:23,572
a bit longer. I want that tail a bit brighter. Can you add a few more bits there? I don't like

2351
02:23:23,652 --> 02:23:27,532
those scales." So he said, "We're doing that constantly anyway. So doing

2352
02:23:27,592 --> 02:23:31,372
it to one set of design specs versus another set of design specs is no

2353
02:23:31,432 --> 02:23:35,292
more hassle." In other words, he said, "It's no harder to make it accurate than to make

2354
02:23:35,312 --> 02:23:39,272
it inaccurate." And it's like, if that's truly the case,

2355
02:23:39,352 --> 02:23:43,032
then just make it right. And then you can claim a level of accuracy

2356
02:23:43,112 --> 02:23:46,942
and engagement that you can. I mean, it's interesting.

2357
02:23:46,972 --> 02:23:51,452
There's a thing called the Jurassic Foundation. After the first Jurassic Park

2358
02:23:52,572 --> 02:23:56,562
made an absolute fortune. I think it was Spielberg directly, may have been through

2359
02:23:56,652 --> 02:24:00,572
Universal, but anyway, they set up the Jurassic Foundation, and it's a small fund of

2360
02:24:00,612 --> 02:24:04,512
money for research on dinosaurs and related animals, and academics can apply for

2361
02:24:04,532 --> 02:24:07,402
it. One of my PhD students got some money from the Jurassic

2362
02:24:07,472 --> 02:24:11,292
Foundation. That's great. He didn't have to do that. He went,

2363
02:24:11,312 --> 02:24:15,122
"Paleontology's helped give me this. I'm going to give back a bit." And after

2364
02:24:15,272 --> 02:24:19,232
what must be, what, 30 years now, it's probably funded an awful lot of research and

2365
02:24:19,272 --> 02:24:23,192
helped young researchers get a start. So

2366
02:24:23,232 --> 02:24:26,951
there's a level of engagement there that I think hasn't been

2367
02:24:27,011 --> 02:24:30,992
in subsequent films, which you can kind of see

2368
02:24:31,052 --> 02:24:34,392
once it goes from being a one-off to being a

2369
02:24:34,432 --> 02:24:37,412
franchise, and it's changed hands. I mean, how many different directors has it had

2370
02:24:37,472 --> 02:24:40,802
now? You know, Spielberg did the first two, and

2371
02:24:40,852 --> 02:24:44,712
then don't know about the next five. Must be two, if not another three more

2372
02:24:44,752 --> 02:24:49,452
people, you know, and 30 years later, it's all changing.

2373
02:24:49,492 --> 02:24:52,332
- Yeah, but that's the path of creating a legendary film.

2374
02:24:52,792 --> 02:24:56,482
The depth of accuracy, and it's not that difficult to work, but it's also...

2375
02:24:56,512 --> 02:25:00,432
It does something to the whole artistic creation

2376
02:25:00,592 --> 02:25:03,102
if you create a culture where the details really, really matter.

2377
02:25:03,102 --> 02:25:06,091
- Matter. Yeah, and again, there are some oddities, so like

2378
02:25:06,632 --> 02:25:10,472
Gallimimus, I mentioned it earlier, so one of the ornithomimosaurs. The model for

2379
02:25:10,552 --> 02:25:14,422
gallimimus in Jurassic World is nearly

2380
02:25:14,532 --> 02:25:18,492
identical to that from Jurassic Park. One of the differences, which you

2381
02:25:18,532 --> 02:25:22,242
can barely see on film, but I know this is true because I

2382
02:25:22,452 --> 02:25:26,192
found it in like, a Jurassic World kids book cause I flicked through it when it came out, is a

2383
02:25:26,232 --> 02:25:30,062
closeup of the head with an arrow to the teeth. Gallimimus doesn't have

2384
02:25:30,092 --> 02:25:33,952
teeth. It's got a beak. So someone has taken the original model

2385
02:25:34,652 --> 02:25:38,472
and actively spent time adding teeth to an animal that didn't

2386
02:25:38,592 --> 02:25:42,172
have them. I would understand it. I'm not saying I agree with it, but I'd

2387
02:25:42,232 --> 02:25:46,092
understand if it was a rule of cool and like, "Yeah, but it would look so

2388
02:25:46,132 --> 02:25:50,032
much better with all these gnarly big teeth and whatever." And it's like, you can't

2389
02:25:50,072 --> 02:25:53,992
even see it in the final thing. They've got tiny little heads. In the film, all they

2390
02:25:54,032 --> 02:25:57,792
do is like, run past the camera briefly. It's not like they're a big

2391
02:25:57,812 --> 02:26:01,792
carnivore and they're engaged in like, one of the big battles. Like, why? Why?

2392
02:26:01,972 --> 02:26:05,512
It's not like... You can barely even see them.

2393
02:26:05,612 --> 02:26:09,332
- Well, yeah, again, just to linger on it. There is a lot of value to

2394
02:26:09,572 --> 02:26:12,672
authenticity in all walks of life, and one of them is

2395
02:26:13,042 --> 02:26:15,852
...accuracy. When you're talking about dinosaurs, it's so

2396
02:26:16,672 --> 02:26:23,396
valuable and so worthy, and it's respectable for the long life of a film to be

2397
02:26:23,496 --> 02:26:27,406
accurate. I just wish, I hope they do that. There are certain directors that really

2398
02:26:27,416 --> 02:26:30,976
dogmatically push that. Alex Garland comes to mind. You know,

2399
02:26:31,036 --> 02:26:36,016
he did, whenever he integrates quantum computing or AI into a film...

2400
02:26:36,036 --> 02:26:38,306
- Mm-hmm. Nolan with the black hole in Interstellar.

2401
02:26:38,496 --> 02:26:41,456
...ended up publishing a paper on the calculation to visualize that.

2402
02:26:41,466 --> 02:26:42,486
- I mean, that's legendary.

2403
02:26:42,496 --> 02:26:42,646
- Yeah.

2404
02:26:42,656 --> 02:26:44,276
- That's great. That's really...

2405
02:26:44,296 --> 02:26:48,016
And like, you think that has nothing to do with the story, the narrative of the film, but it

2406
02:26:48,056 --> 02:26:54,106
does. It, like, permeates everything. If you get that black hole right, that...

2407
02:26:54,106 --> 02:26:57,236
...everybody else steps up their game, and really,

2408
02:26:58,016 --> 02:27:01,876
really tells a story in this way that reverberates through time, and it, like,

2409
02:27:01,916 --> 02:27:03,236
really moves people. So,

2410
02:27:03,276 --> 02:27:06,706
- Yeah. I, I, yeah, I mean, as I say, I, I wish it was

2411
02:27:06,936 --> 02:27:10,596
better. I mean, the only thing I'd flip it around is a joke I've made

2412
02:27:10,856 --> 02:27:14,775
more than once, but like, just don't take it as a documentary. No

2413
02:27:14,836 --> 02:27:19,146
one watches James Bond and goes, "That's how international espionage works."

2414
02:27:19,676 --> 02:27:23,036
You know, he's got the laser watch and the exploding car, and he's like,

2415
02:27:23,396 --> 02:27:28,956
maybe treat it a bit as fiction. I've heard from a friend of mine

2416
02:27:29,836 --> 02:27:33,826
who worked at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, which I've mentioned before, in

2417
02:27:33,896 --> 02:27:37,576
Alberta, which is an absolutely phenomenal place, and

2418
02:27:37,636 --> 02:27:44,016
she said after the first one, genuinely, like, it was not

2419
02:27:44,096 --> 02:27:48,046
common, but more than once, people were annoyed

2420
02:27:48,076 --> 02:27:51,976
that they didn't have the real dinosaurs out back, because they'd seen them, and

2421
02:27:51,996 --> 02:27:55,736
they knew that the real ones were out there. Which is a testament to

2422
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:59,336
Industrial Light & Magic and Stan Winston, but also...

2423
02:27:59,356 --> 02:27:59,476
- Wow.

2424
02:27:59,496 --> 02:28:03,156
- ...slightly horrifying that anyone watched Jurassic Park

2425
02:28:03,616 --> 02:28:07,596
and literally thought that. Also, why would you go to a museum? You go to the zoo if

2426
02:28:07,656 --> 02:28:08,356
it's alive.

2427
02:28:08,396 --> 02:28:10,976
- There you will also meet what is it, King Kong and Godzi-

2428
02:28:12,336 --> 02:28:16,296
I don't think we quite touched on this. I really want to ask you

2429
02:28:16,356 --> 02:28:18,746
about intelligence. What we know about

2430
02:28:18,806 --> 02:28:22,636
...the intelligence of, let's say, T-Rex. We talked about his big head. What do we know

2431
02:28:22,716 --> 02:28:22,916
about-

2432
02:28:22,956 --> 02:28:30,656
- Not much. So there's a T-Rex brain, or at least a very rough cast of part of one.

2433
02:28:30,736 --> 02:28:32,076
- That's the actual look of-

2434
02:28:32,116 --> 02:28:32,856
- Yeah, this is

2435
02:28:34,016 --> 02:28:37,056
...so dinosaurs, in fact, most reptiles. I don't know if you can see it on the

2436
02:28:37,076 --> 02:28:40,936
velociraptor. Not really, unfortunately. Um-

2437
02:28:41,076 --> 02:28:42,356
- It's elongated.

2438
02:28:42,436 --> 02:28:46,236
- Yeah, but it's more that they have... we are weird in

2439
02:28:46,296 --> 02:28:49,936
that we have a brain that basically fills the inside of our

2440
02:28:49,956 --> 02:28:53,776
skull. What most animals have is actually a little kind

2441
02:28:53,856 --> 02:28:57,216
of sub-skull inside the main skull, which is called the

2442
02:28:57,236 --> 02:29:04,826
endocast or endocranium, and the brain is in that. And even then, it's

2443
02:29:04,856 --> 02:29:08,556
not, like, full of brain because we've packed an awful lot of brain into a limited

2444
02:29:08,576 --> 02:29:12,225
space, and they then have quite a lot of goo and fat and other stuff around

2445
02:29:12,256 --> 02:29:15,776
it. But it means for dinosaurs, and then deep reptiles and birds in

2446
02:29:15,816 --> 02:29:19,786
general, in the old days you could basically cut one

2447
02:29:19,896 --> 02:29:26,156
open, but now we'll CT scan through them, you can take an internal mold of the

2448
02:29:26,216 --> 02:29:30,036
endocranium or the brain case, and then whatever

2449
02:29:30,096 --> 02:29:34,026
filled that would've been the brain and its surrounding tissues. And that's how

2450
02:29:34,096 --> 02:29:37,816
you get something like this. In this case, someone literally cracked open an old

2451
02:29:37,856 --> 02:29:38,276
skull-

2452
02:29:38,706 --> 02:29:42,636
...and basically took an internal mold in the same way that you do an external mold for the

2453
02:29:42,656 --> 02:29:46,366
skulls. And that tells you quite a lot about

2454
02:29:46,396 --> 02:29:50,276
certain things. So for example, they've got a bulb at the

2455
02:29:50,296 --> 02:29:54,116
front, which is the olfactory bulb. So brains are very stereotyped, again, ours are super

2456
02:29:54,176 --> 02:29:58,036
weird, so you have the olfactory bulb at the front and behind that you have the optic bulb or the

2457
02:29:58,096 --> 02:30:02,046
optic lobe. So roughly how big they are will tell you roughly how

2458
02:30:02,076 --> 02:30:06,056
much of the brain is devoted to, for example, sight and smell. So if

2459
02:30:06,096 --> 02:30:09,136
it's a lot, it's pretty good. If there's not much, it's not very

2460
02:30:09,176 --> 02:30:12,966
good. That goes quite a long way already.

2461
02:30:13,056 --> 02:30:17,005
One thing we've done in the last few years is you can also get into the,

2462
02:30:17,136 --> 02:30:20,856
it's not shown here, it wouldn't be part of this, but the inner ear.

2463
02:30:21,276 --> 02:30:25,136
We can CT scan into the structure of the bony inner ear, and from

2464
02:30:25,176 --> 02:30:28,956
that you can actually get an idea of what frequency of sounds

2465
02:30:29,016 --> 02:30:32,056
the inner ear was structured ...to be pitched to.

2466
02:30:32,096 --> 02:30:32,716
- Wow.

2467
02:30:32,736 --> 02:30:36,576
- Which doesn't actually tell you very much, but it's phenomenally cool that you

2468
02:30:36,636 --> 02:30:37,436
can do it.

2469
02:30:37,475 --> 02:30:41,256
- We should say you also have quite a bit of a background in biology. So you're trying to

2470
02:30:41,296 --> 02:30:46,236
reconstruct biology from, go from paleontology to biology.

2471
02:30:46,276 --> 02:30:50,176
- Yeah, my go-to one-liner is, "I'm a zoologist

2472
02:30:50,236 --> 02:30:54,076
but I work on dead stuff." My degree was zoology. My

2473
02:30:54,116 --> 02:30:57,856
official job title now is Reader of Zoology. I teach zoology. I don't teach

2474
02:30:57,936 --> 02:31:01,896
Paleo. So yeah, living animals

2475
02:31:01,976 --> 02:31:05,416
was always actually my primary interest, and I kind of fell into

2476
02:31:05,456 --> 02:31:09,326
paleo, but then I wanted to drag that with me because I'd been

2477
02:31:09,396 --> 02:31:13,216
trained in behavior and ecology and it's what I was most interested in, so then applying that

2478
02:31:13,276 --> 02:31:16,476
knowledge and understanding to these animals.

2479
02:31:16,556 --> 02:31:19,576
- So to some degree it is possible to reach towards the biology?

2480
02:31:19,676 --> 02:31:21,006
- Absolutely, yeah.

2481
02:31:21,316 --> 02:31:23,256
- So with the ear, that's interesting. The brain.

2482
02:31:23,276 --> 02:31:23,346
- Yeah.

2483
02:31:23,346 --> 02:31:24,536
- So we can know something about the brain?

2484
02:31:24,576 --> 02:31:28,296
- Yeah, but then when you get into intelligence is when it gets really awkward

2485
02:31:28,376 --> 02:31:32,016
because working out exactly which bits of this are

2486
02:31:32,036 --> 02:31:35,736
probably linked to, like, the main fundamental processing and what

2487
02:31:35,796 --> 02:31:39,786
you'd link to actual intelligence is tough.

2488
02:31:40,076 --> 02:31:43,936
On top of that, we don't really know what's been the big challenge of the last couple of years of this

2489
02:31:43,976 --> 02:31:47,376
question, was T-Rex and other dinosaurs super intelligent? Like, neuron

2490
02:31:47,416 --> 02:31:51,376
density. How many basically nerve cells can you pack in per

2491
02:31:51,456 --> 02:31:55,236
bit of volume? Because birds have some weird tricks which means they get a lot more

2492
02:31:55,296 --> 02:31:59,236
brain per volume. Just how much of

2493
02:31:59,276 --> 02:32:03,216
the brain case was brain and how much was, like, goop around it,

2494
02:32:03,296 --> 02:32:07,186
we know varies, so you're getting kind of fairly big upper and lower

2495
02:32:07,276 --> 02:32:10,376
band, and then the other big thing we always have to do is factor in

2496
02:32:10,676 --> 02:32:14,556
size. Big animals need bigger brains to operate them. So

2497
02:32:14,616 --> 02:32:18,446
whales have really big brains, but whales weigh tens of tons. They're

2498
02:32:18,476 --> 02:32:22,336
not smarter than us. So you have the classic thing is a thing called

2499
02:32:22,396 --> 02:32:25,976
the encephalization quotient, which is at a very

2500
02:32:26,096 --> 02:32:30,900
simple level, it is the volume of brain scaled against the size of the animal.

2501
02:32:31,700 --> 02:32:35,680
We have huge brains compared to how big we are, so we're massively up

2502
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:39,700
the chart. And then you do have a few things with, like, worms. I should probably

2503
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:43,300
stick to vertebrates, because there's some stupid stuff which has a

2504
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:47,240
surprisingly small brain for its size. Most things that

2505
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:51,220
aren't primates, and things like crows and parrots, sit

2506
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:55,230
very neatly on a couple of different curves. There's a curve for reptiles, a curve for birds, a

2507
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:59,090
curve for mammals, and things like this. And

2508
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:03,000
basically that's it. But also, actually, our understanding with mass estimates for

2509
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:08,590
dinosaurs is good but not great, and so you could easily be out by,

2510
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:13,640
you could easily be out by like 20 or 30% on the volume of the

2511
02:33:13,660 --> 02:33:17,540
brain inside the brain case, and then you could be out by 20 or 30% on your

2512
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:21,560
mass estimate. Well, now suddenly, it's very

2513
02:33:21,640 --> 02:33:25,410
easy to make the brain too big and the animal too light and it's

2514
02:33:25,410 --> 02:33:29,120
super smart, or make the brain too small and the animal too heavy and it's super

2515
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:34,020
dumb. So that's awkward, unfortunately.

2516
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:37,880
- So apparently there's a, some controversial paper that suggests that T-Rex is a pri-

2517
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:39,270
has primate-level intelligence.

2518
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:43,380
- Yeah, and then that was shot down within a few months by a

2519
02:33:43,460 --> 02:33:47,360
team of paleontologists and a couple of other neurologists who really

2520
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:48,350
went to town on it.

2521
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:52,060
- Just counting the number of... Trying to estimate the number of neurons.

2522
02:33:52,120 --> 02:33:54,590
- Yeah, it was the neuron density thing, and yeah

2523
02:33:54,860 --> 02:33:58,560
I've unsurprisingly support the revised

2524
02:33:58,660 --> 02:34:02,600
one which was done by a whole bunch... Yeah, the Casper paper. I've spoken

2525
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:04,880
to Casper about it, couple of the other authors.

2526
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:08,920
- So, they scaled down the number of neurons from three billion

2527
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:12,760
down to 250 million to 1.7 billion.

2528
02:34:12,770 --> 02:34:13,160
- Yeah, much, much lower.

2529
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:14,900
- Which is similar to crocodiles and other primates.

2530
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:18,640
- Yeah, which is kind of what you'd expect. I mean, a couple of other people at

2531
02:34:18,680 --> 02:34:22,420
various times have suggested they're really smart. And again, you know, birds

2532
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:26,420
have this thing of, they have this weird thing of neuron folding, and they

2533
02:34:26,460 --> 02:34:30,140
can basically pack in a lot more than you'd expect. You know, that's why crows are that

2534
02:34:30,200 --> 02:34:31,340
smart despite having

2535
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:36,500
tiny brains, relatively even compared to their overall size. But

2536
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:41,560
I'm being obviously overly facetious, but if

2537
02:34:41,660 --> 02:34:45,560
ultimately part of your scaling is how big is the animal

2538
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:49,360
versus how big is its brain, that's most of a T-Rex

2539
02:34:49,460 --> 02:34:53,300
brain. It's a fraction of the size of a chimp brain, and

2540
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:56,220
chimps don't weigh seven tons. So,

2541
02:34:57,340 --> 02:35:01,200
you know, it's a kind of Hitchens-like extraordinary claims

2542
02:35:01,220 --> 02:35:05,000
require extraordinary evidence, but you just look at it and go

2543
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:08,690
that's about the proportion we'd expect for a croc. Now, crocs are smarter than

2544
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:12,360
people think, but they're sure as hell not monkeys. Um,

2545
02:35:12,740 --> 02:35:16,100
you're going to have to really come up with something much more

2546
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:19,820
convincing than, "Oh well, if you just pack 'em in, if you scale 'em this way."

2547
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:24,100
- A bit of a ridiculous question, but is it possible to find evidence of tool use?

2548
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:28,080
- I mean, in theory, it depends quite how you define a

2549
02:35:28,120 --> 02:35:32,380
tool, so birds building nests is arguably tool use to a certain degree.

2550
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:38,780
I'm aware of... I suspect it's turned out not to be the case. I was, I was

2551
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:44,260
shown a very rough, not very well-prepared fossil

2552
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:49,660
20 years ago now, no, 15 years ago now, where someone said, "We

2553
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:53,620
think this might be an early bird nest and therefore potentially

2554
02:35:53,660 --> 02:35:57,540
even a dinosaur nest," and nothing's ever been published, so my guess is

2555
02:35:57,660 --> 02:36:01,580
once they excavated it and had a good look at it, they went, "Nah, it's nothing

2556
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:05,160
really." I mean, I guess the question is, how would you know?

2557
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:09,690
- Yeah, it would be difficult unless it's obvious, widespread, primate-like...

2558
02:36:09,700 --> 02:36:11,340
- Yeah, but even then, like, you know...

2559
02:36:11,350 --> 02:36:12,140
- ...sapient-like almost.

2560
02:36:12,149 --> 02:36:15,700
- Chimps make loads of tools, but it's mostly made of wood, and they're mostly just

2561
02:36:15,860 --> 02:36:19,600
breaking stuff, and then the odds of that preserving are very

2562
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:23,620
low. You do get things like chimps and otters, sea otters,

2563
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:27,600
you know, they have their favorite anvil and hammer stones to break stuff open.

2564
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:32,100
But again, the reason they picked that stone is 'cause it's really heavy and good at

2565
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:36,250
breaking oysters or breaking nuts. It's not gonna leave, or

2566
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:40,300
probably not gonna leave stereotypical points on the rock. And even then,

2567
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:43,940
you could just go, "Well, maybe it, you know,

2568
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:47,040
just got bashed up in a river or something."

2569
02:36:47,100 --> 02:36:51,080
- So, in your book "Uncovering Dinosaur Behavior," you conclude that there's a lot

2570
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:54,240
we might not know. What's a particular lost behavior

2571
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:58,300
that we don't know about that you think might be out there?

2572
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:01,860
- Something like midden use, so a whole bunch of animals and

2573
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:05,680
birds who basically crap in the same spot. They

2574
02:37:05,720 --> 02:37:09,660
have their spot, and that's where they go. So, rabbits do this,

2575
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:17,220
sloths do this, aardvarks, even things like wildebeest and zebra, not zebra, impala

2576
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:20,920
will tend to go back to the same place every day.

2577
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:25,100
But the fossil record of sarcoplites, fossilized feces and

2578
02:37:25,140 --> 02:37:29,080
fossilized waste from dinosaurs, it exists, but it's extremely

2579
02:37:29,140 --> 02:37:32,680
rough because of course, this is the stuff that's already been digested and broken

2580
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:38,120
down. It's already kind of gooey and broken up and doesn't have a lot going for it.

2581
02:37:39,540 --> 02:37:43,160
If they do it in water, it's going to dissipate instantly. If it rains, it's

2582
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:47,340
probably going to fall apart. Things like dung beetles and flies will break it

2583
02:37:47,380 --> 02:37:51,220
down. Even if it gets covered by sand or whatever from a sandstorm, it's probably

2584
02:37:51,320 --> 02:37:55,200
still going to compress and separate. So, are you ever going to find it?

2585
02:37:55,340 --> 02:38:00,740
Maybe going back to our trackway stuff, but even if you do, what species

2586
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:05,560
left that? We know a big herbivore did this, but was it

2587
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:09,280
Triceratops, or was it an Ankylosaur? Those animals are very different things

2588
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:12,800
doing very different things, and it would tell you different things about their behavior

2589
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:15,850
- Yeah, so one piece of behavior I forgot to ask you about.

2590
02:38:16,070 --> 02:38:19,600
So, T-Rex engaging cannibalism.

2591
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:22,460
- Yeah, almost certainly. Well, certainly. I think we've got

2592
02:38:23,340 --> 02:38:28,700
there's a T-Rex bone with a T-Rex embedded tooth in it. With overgrowth.

2593
02:38:29,020 --> 02:38:36,132
I think it's, I want to say it's an Albertosaur rather than T-Rex, but there is

2594
02:38:36,172 --> 02:38:39,902
there is a tyrannosaur jaw in Alberta with a

2595
02:38:39,932 --> 02:38:43,592
T-Rex tooth stuck in it, and you can pull the little tooth out.

2596
02:38:43,692 --> 02:38:47,382
And then there's a T-Rex foot bone with these

2597
02:38:47,412 --> 02:38:51,062
distinctive feeding traces on them. And this actually goes back to that early

2598
02:38:51,092 --> 02:38:55,062
point about T-Rex being weird, being the only big carnivore in its environment,

2599
02:38:55,132 --> 02:38:59,112
because if this was even Mongolia at that time, but anywhere else, there's

2600
02:38:59,152 --> 02:39:03,132
three or four or five big carnivores. And so you find a bone and it's chewed

2601
02:39:03,172 --> 02:39:07,032
up by a big carnivore, we don't know who did it. But when you see a

2602
02:39:07,152 --> 02:39:10,452
big bone chewed up in a T-Rex ecosystem,

2603
02:39:10,512 --> 02:39:14,232
well, you know, if it's anything bigger than this, you know it was

2604
02:39:14,272 --> 02:39:17,672
T-Rex. And so when it's a T-Rex bone with T-Rex bite marks,

2605
02:39:19,572 --> 02:39:20,472
- Yep, it's pretty obvious.

2606
02:39:20,482 --> 02:39:23,172
- QED. Yeah, so it must have been.

2607
02:39:23,212 --> 02:39:27,852
- That's fascinating, isn't it? That they would attack themselves, their own species.

2608
02:39:27,862 --> 02:39:31,902
- Cannibalism turns up in a whole bunch of stuff. Um,

2609
02:39:32,792 --> 02:39:37,842
but it's very rare as like a fairly habitual behavior.

2610
02:39:38,092 --> 02:39:41,952
- So, but there's several reasons you might be engaging in,

2611
02:39:42,012 --> 02:39:46,342
or rather teeth marks might tell various stories.

2612
02:39:46,692 --> 02:39:48,832
So it could be just fighting for dominance, right?

2613
02:39:48,872 --> 02:39:52,822
- It, it could, but it's unlikely, and in this case, so again, we see there are

2614
02:39:52,892 --> 02:39:56,552
loads of facial injuries in tyrannosaurs, in carnivorous dinosaurs generally, but

2615
02:39:56,572 --> 02:40:00,552
particularly tyrannosaurs. They have really beaten up heads, like half

2616
02:40:00,612 --> 02:40:04,332
or even two-thirds of adults have scarring and facial

2617
02:40:04,372 --> 02:40:08,112
injuries. But you see healing on it, whereas this foot does not show

2618
02:40:08,132 --> 02:40:12,102
healing and it's got multiple different bites. The idea that

2619
02:40:12,132 --> 02:40:15,912
you'd bite a foot whilst fighting someone and then go back and bite that one

2620
02:40:16,032 --> 02:40:20,682
foot again? That's pretty unlikely.

2621
02:40:20,682 --> 02:40:22,592
- So, looks like it's eating, not fighting.

2622
02:40:22,602 --> 02:40:26,452
- Yeah, and they're more like the feeding scrape traces than they are the big puncture wounds, so

2623
02:40:26,492 --> 02:40:29,072
again, not impossible, but very weird for that to occur as a fight.

2624
02:40:29,192 --> 02:40:29,922
- So fascinating.

2625
02:40:29,922 --> 02:40:37,442
- So yeah, they're- they're fighting, they're fighting probably quite a lot, but

2626
02:40:37,472 --> 02:40:39,462
whether or not you actually eat something that you've

2627
02:40:40,512 --> 02:40:44,292
killed or that you stumble across as a body, it definitely happens occasionally.

2628
02:40:44,372 --> 02:40:48,302
Otherwise, we wouldn't have the record of that, but there's a reason carnivores

2629
02:40:48,352 --> 02:40:51,892
often don't eat carnivores, and particularly don't eat their own

2630
02:40:51,902 --> 02:40:55,692
species, which is parasitism. Carnivores in

2631
02:40:55,732 --> 02:40:58,952
general are loaded with parasites because they spend their whole

2632
02:40:58,992 --> 02:41:02,912
lives eating food which has parasites and stuff in it.

2633
02:41:02,952 --> 02:41:06,881
And so they tend to accumulate a lot of them. What's the one thing that's

2634
02:41:06,892 --> 02:41:10,652
definitely gonna have the most parasites in it that can infect you as, for

2635
02:41:10,692 --> 02:41:14,512
example, a lion? It's another lion that eats the exact same stuff

2636
02:41:14,572 --> 02:41:18,482
that you do. So whilst it is food and particularly if you've

2637
02:41:18,532 --> 02:41:21,732
just won a big fight, you might want to eat.

2638
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:26,272
In general, cannibalism's pretty rare because it's

2639
02:41:26,312 --> 02:41:30,232
generally not a good idea if there's other food available. But yeah, if

2640
02:41:30,272 --> 02:41:34,262
you're starving to death or, you know, the other guy ripped your leg half off and you

2641
02:41:34,272 --> 02:41:38,052
don't think you're gonna walk for six weeks, not that you'd think, but you know what I mean.

2642
02:41:38,232 --> 02:41:41,532
Like, and now there's a body in front of you, it's two tons of meat, well,

2643
02:41:42,052 --> 02:41:43,752
maybe you should tuck in.

2644
02:41:43,792 --> 02:41:47,672
- This is so fascinating, like, once again, figuring out this puzzle.

2645
02:41:47,832 --> 02:41:51,432
And like, what does cannibalism tell you? You're piecing together the

2646
02:41:51,492 --> 02:41:55,362
story of T-rex, their life, their hunting life, their social life from

2647
02:41:55,392 --> 02:41:59,812
their evolution to their biology to their behavior. That's so fascinating.

2648
02:41:59,872 --> 02:42:03,852
- Yeah, we try to. But the thing is, it's always getting better which is

2649
02:42:03,872 --> 02:42:07,792
So that's what I try to finish on in my book on behavior is,

2650
02:42:07,872 --> 02:42:11,572
I felt I'd written a couple of hundred pages of, "We keep

2651
02:42:11,632 --> 02:42:15,582
screwing this up, we've overstated this, I think people have misunderstood this, this-"

2652
02:42:15,612 --> 02:42:19,592
You know, like the track ways stuff, and like, this is not as confident as we think,

2653
02:42:19,612 --> 02:42:23,392
you need to look at these alternate explanations. This behavior shows that that behavior probably

2654
02:42:23,412 --> 02:42:27,292
doesn't correlate the way you said it does, yada, yada, yada. And it's like, and now I feel like I've just written a

2655
02:42:27,312 --> 02:42:30,732
book trashing my entire field and all my colleagues, or at least many of my

2656
02:42:30,752 --> 02:42:34,432
colleagues. And then, but then you flip it on its head and

2657
02:42:34,472 --> 02:42:38,012
going, "We've got techniques that were undreamed

2658
02:42:38,132 --> 02:42:42,032
of ten years ago. We've got data streams that were undreamed

2659
02:42:42,112 --> 02:42:45,912
of ten years ago. And we've actually got a much better understanding of living

2660
02:42:45,972 --> 02:42:49,832
species." And then on top of that we're just constantly finding new animals, you

2661
02:42:49,872 --> 02:42:51,351
you know, we have not just

2662
02:42:52,532 --> 02:42:56,522
new species, which are often, I think, a lot less important, but just new specimens of ones

2663
02:42:56,572 --> 02:43:00,542
we know, because again, it's building up that database. You know, we drifted off talking

2664
02:43:00,592 --> 02:43:04,472
about sexual selection, but like, yeah, if you want to know growth, one or two

2665
02:43:04,552 --> 02:43:08,232
animals doesn't tell you how an animal, a species, grows. 50 or 100

2666
02:43:08,812 --> 02:43:12,612
does. And then that reveals a hell of a lot more about things like sexual

2667
02:43:12,672 --> 02:43:16,592
dimorphism and growth rate and how vulnerable juveniles are and population structure

2668
02:43:16,652 --> 02:43:20,632
and maybe how they're reproducing. So I'd

2669
02:43:20,642 --> 02:43:24,612
like to think I knocked down, I think, a few towers that probably a few people were

2670
02:43:24,632 --> 02:43:28,371
fond of, but I think we have the raw materials to build much

2671
02:43:28,492 --> 02:43:32,172
better, stronger edifice of behavior.

2672
02:43:32,252 --> 02:43:36,212
But as you say, it's always going to be based around

2673
02:43:37,392 --> 02:43:40,072
often very piecemeal evidence and

2674
02:43:40,972 --> 02:43:44,492
like possibilities and probabilities rather than certainties.

2675
02:43:44,512 --> 02:43:47,632
- Let's talk about a sad topic: extinction.

2676
02:43:47,712 --> 02:43:49,072
- Yep.

2677
02:43:50,012 --> 02:43:52,972
- How did the dinosaurs go extinct?

2678
02:43:53,052 --> 02:43:56,392
- Mostly, probably, pretty quickly, but it really is

2679
02:43:57,532 --> 02:44:01,352
the answer that I think most people are now probably familiar with, which is, it's an

2680
02:44:01,392 --> 02:44:06,732
asteroid impact or some kind of extraterrestrial body hit

2681
02:44:07,732 --> 02:44:11,472
just off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico about 66 million years

2682
02:44:11,512 --> 02:44:15,432
ago that basically atomized the

2683
02:44:15,512 --> 02:44:19,192
asteroid, but also importantly, the bit of the ground it hit, or

2684
02:44:19,392 --> 02:44:23,032
below the sea bed that it hit, was basically the worst kind of rock.

2685
02:44:23,252 --> 02:44:27,172
And so it put up this enormous ash cloud and basically you

2686
02:44:27,212 --> 02:44:30,872
have a nearly instantaneous nuclear winter. I mean, immediate

2687
02:44:30,952 --> 02:44:34,864
devastation. You know, and anything immediately

2688
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:38,924
next to it is obviously just vaporized. But you know, this is the sort of thing that's

2689
02:44:39,004 --> 02:44:42,444
hot enough to set fire to the atmosphere. I think the one I read was,

2690
02:44:43,064 --> 02:44:46,244
it's something like a piece of rock about the size of Mount Everest

2691
02:44:46,764 --> 02:44:50,364
traveling at something like 10 times the speed of sound. So just

2692
02:44:50,724 --> 02:44:55,964
the momentum between that speed and mass thing is just, you know,

2693
02:44:56,824 --> 02:44:58,284
beyond extraordinary.

2694
02:44:58,304 --> 02:45:01,134
- But I think what does a lot of damage is the change in the climate, and-

2695
02:45:01,164 --> 02:45:04,754
- Yeah, and so every... There are five recognized mass

2696
02:45:04,804 --> 02:45:08,644
extinctions in the history of life on Earth, and all of them are ultimately some form of climate

2697
02:45:08,684 --> 02:45:11,984
change, whether it's volcanic eruptions or

2698
02:45:12,024 --> 02:45:15,434
hyper-oxygenation, or an ice age or whatever. It's climate

2699
02:45:15,504 --> 02:45:23,704
changing too quickly for things to adapt to. And that starts, you know, that

2700
02:45:23,764 --> 02:45:27,744
just cripples entire populations and entire species. And then if you do

2701
02:45:27,804 --> 02:45:31,284
enough damage to enough things, you start getting ecosystem

2702
02:45:31,304 --> 02:45:35,124
collapse. You know, this moth has died out. Well, it turns out that

2703
02:45:35,204 --> 02:45:39,084
moth is the primary pollinator of this tree. Well, that tree produced nuts, and

2704
02:45:39,124 --> 02:45:43,104
that was the entire winter survival store for this squirrel. Well, that squirrel

2705
02:45:43,124 --> 02:45:46,624
was the main food of this cat, and now

2706
02:45:46,884 --> 02:45:50,624
suddenly the moth going has killed four other things and everything that's attached to that.

2707
02:45:50,724 --> 02:45:55,544
And so that's really what did for them.

2708
02:45:56,064 --> 02:45:58,884
- And sadly, the big things... Well, everything

2709
02:45:59,664 --> 02:46:02,424
dies, but the big things have a lot of trouble recovering.

2710
02:46:02,504 --> 02:46:06,464
- Yeah. So, I mean, this is, you know, a classic

2711
02:46:06,524 --> 02:46:10,314
example. So, oh well, you know, what is paleontology good for? Well, actually, really, it's

2712
02:46:10,344 --> 02:46:14,324
extinction, which is very relevant right now in that we have a very good

2713
02:46:14,384 --> 02:46:18,344
handle on when you have extreme climate stress, what

2714
02:46:18,404 --> 02:46:22,224
tends to suffer more and what tends to suffer less. And as we say,

2715
02:46:22,384 --> 02:46:25,404
big things fundamentally do. They require more

2716
02:46:25,424 --> 02:46:29,324
resources, they require more area of land. You need to roam

2717
02:46:29,584 --> 02:46:33,344
further, which means, you know, if you're a mouse and you

2718
02:46:33,424 --> 02:46:37,204
happen to have a little bit of land and that bit doesn't get hit, you're fine; whereas if you're an

2719
02:46:37,284 --> 02:46:40,364
elephant and you need all of this land and even a chunk of it goes

2720
02:46:40,384 --> 02:46:44,184
wrong, well, that's probably maybe not enough for you to survive anymore.

2721
02:46:44,244 --> 02:46:50,924
So, yeah, big things suffer disproportionately badly from these things, and

2722
02:46:51,124 --> 02:46:54,884
mostly as well we think terrestrial things generally do worse than

2723
02:46:54,924 --> 02:46:58,264
things in water because water's a great equilibrating

2724
02:46:58,544 --> 02:47:01,724
medium, you know, it takes ages to heat up, it takes ages to cool

2725
02:47:01,784 --> 02:47:08,104
down. Yes, if you live in specific coastal conditions or something, maybe

2726
02:47:08,144 --> 02:47:11,934
you can't travel that easily, but, you know, whales can go from

2727
02:47:11,964 --> 02:47:15,944
pole to pole quite happily, and plenty of other fish do too. So if it's too hot

2728
02:47:15,964 --> 02:47:19,864
or too cold or too nasty here, you can just swim somewhere else,

2729
02:47:20,064 --> 02:47:23,964
whereas if you're an animal and you hit a desert or you hit a mountain range or you hit a

2730
02:47:24,004 --> 02:47:27,884
river, you stop moving and you're trapped, and then you die.

2731
02:47:27,944 --> 02:47:31,164
So dinosaurs were, yeah, the worst possible

2732
02:47:31,264 --> 02:47:34,644
combination. They were mostly big and they were mostly on

2733
02:47:34,724 --> 02:47:39,643
land, and yeah, it's not really surprising they did very badly out of it.

2734
02:47:39,914 --> 02:47:43,704
- And then some species did survive. I

2735
02:47:43,784 --> 02:47:47,484
guess I think you've said that it's very possible that some dinosaurs even

2736
02:47:47,524 --> 02:47:48,784
survived for a time.

2737
02:47:49,104 --> 02:47:49,154
- Oh, w-

2738
02:47:49,164 --> 02:47:51,314
- ...that we might be able to discover down the line.

2739
02:47:51,344 --> 02:47:55,304
- I'd be amazed if they didn't. I mean, there's been various reports over the

2740
02:47:55,344 --> 02:47:58,244
decades of the- the

2741
02:47:58,864 --> 02:48:02,584
K-Pg or K-T extinction, the Cretaceous- Paleogene or Cretaceous-Tertiary

2742
02:48:02,624 --> 02:48:06,584
extinction of dinosaurs surviving and none of them have held up. It's

2743
02:48:06,704 --> 02:48:10,634
usually been bioturbation, so literally things like

2744
02:48:10,634 --> 02:48:14,584
prairie dogs digging, and of course they'll dig a tooth up and then move it through

2745
02:48:14,624 --> 02:48:18,414
the layers, or things like this, or plant roots can move stuff.

2746
02:48:18,504 --> 02:48:22,404
Or just soils can get churned up. But

2747
02:48:22,484 --> 02:48:26,124
I would be shocked if they didn't. Not like, "Oh, yeah, the

2748
02:48:26,184 --> 02:48:29,624
dinosaur survived, and the Loch Ness Monster, and stuff like that." But like,

2749
02:48:30,484 --> 02:48:33,884
yes, it was a global devastation. Yes, it's what ultimately killed the

2750
02:48:33,904 --> 02:48:37,744
dinosaurs, but I'd be amazed if there wasn't some equivalent of Hawaii or New

2751
02:48:37,844 --> 02:48:41,784
Zealand or some other tucked away island or valley where

2752
02:48:41,864 --> 02:48:45,804
actually dinosaurs were fine for anything from a few hundred thousand to a

2753
02:48:45,864 --> 02:48:49,824
couple of million years. But on a global scale, it's a dot on a

2754
02:48:49,884 --> 02:48:52,564
map and the odds that we'll ever uncover

2755
02:48:53,764 --> 02:48:57,424
any rocks, fossiliferous rocks of that age that we then have

2756
02:48:57,504 --> 02:49:01,144
access to that we then find a dinosaur in that we can then date properly,

2757
02:49:02,544 --> 02:49:06,194
I think, is almost non-existent. But it would just be weird if

2758
02:49:06,264 --> 02:49:11,344
they didn't survive somewhere for a bit, or even quite a few of them in places.

2759
02:49:11,354 --> 02:49:13,464
- So a small, local population.

2760
02:49:13,504 --> 02:49:17,064
- We see it all the time, you know, the lemurs in Madagascar,

2761
02:49:17,564 --> 02:49:21,224
all the stuff in New Zealand. There's tons of weird archaic stuff hanging around.

2762
02:49:21,284 --> 02:49:25,244
in Hawaii, you know, Galapagos finches and tortoises, the

2763
02:49:25,284 --> 02:49:28,984
tortoises that you don't see anywhere else. In Australia, with the marsupials, they're

2764
02:49:29,044 --> 02:49:32,933
almost, and then the monotremes are almost unknown outside of there.

2765
02:49:32,984 --> 02:49:38,904
This is a pretty normal bit of biology. For animals that were so dominant globally

2766
02:49:39,864 --> 02:49:43,584
we know there were patches that were largely unchanged, otherwise we wouldn't have had the mammals

2767
02:49:43,624 --> 02:49:47,504
surviving and the crocodiles surviving and the birds surviving and ever- and newts

2768
02:49:47,524 --> 02:49:51,264
and frogs and everything that did survive. I'm sure a few of those

2769
02:49:51,284 --> 02:49:56,504
patches had some dinosaurs in them, but it is ultimately what killed them.

2770
02:49:56,544 --> 02:50:00,304
- What do you think is the chance that they would have survived? So you take some local

2771
02:50:00,364 --> 02:50:02,484
populations and they flourish.

2772
02:50:02,584 --> 02:50:06,504
- It's happened. Look at Australia. You know, the

2773
02:50:06,544 --> 02:50:10,064
marsupials have done pretty well there for a very long

2774
02:50:10,184 --> 02:50:12,724
time. You can imagine if the next mass

2775
02:50:12,784 --> 02:50:16,284
extinction, you know, flattens a large chunk of

2776
02:50:16,324 --> 02:50:19,884
Indonesia, for example, kangaroos could island

2777
02:50:19,964 --> 02:50:23,724
hop pretty easily, make it to mainland Asia.

2778
02:50:23,744 --> 02:50:26,784
- But then, I mean, to then lead... You take the

2779
02:50:26,844 --> 02:50:30,704
dinosaurs... a small fraction survives and then they eventually

2780
02:50:30,764 --> 02:50:32,514
repopulate the earth again.

2781
02:50:32,624 --> 02:50:36,393
- I mean, that's extraordinarily unlikely, because once your population's been crashed like

2782
02:50:36,464 --> 02:50:40,424
that, you do have the problems of things like inbreeding, or maybe you're

2783
02:50:40,464 --> 02:50:44,344
a great specialist to a certain area, or you're surviving because you're

2784
02:50:44,422 --> 02:50:47,844
isolated, you're in a valley, or you're on an island, and then

2785
02:50:47,904 --> 02:50:51,794
dispersing again becomes really, or breaking out into those areas

2786
02:50:51,844 --> 02:50:53,224
becomes much, much harder.

2787
02:50:53,264 --> 02:50:56,844
- So like the great predators like the... Even though the T-rex is such a great

2788
02:50:56,944 --> 02:50:59,214
predator, that doesn't give you...

2789
02:50:59,244 --> 02:51:02,734
- Yeah, because you still had the extinction event, and the

2790
02:51:02,784 --> 02:51:06,354
environment is no longer what it was that you evolved into.

2791
02:51:06,364 --> 02:51:06,374
- Right.

2792
02:51:06,384 --> 02:51:10,324
- And once those systems start to recover, those other animals are going to adapt

2793
02:51:10,364 --> 02:51:11,293
much better to them.

2794
02:51:12,144 --> 02:51:19,244
- How does that make you feel that, that this stupid asteroid from nowhere?

2795
02:51:19,253 --> 02:51:23,494
- Well, I mean, at one level I probably wouldn't be here if it hadn't.

2796
02:51:23,503 --> 02:51:27,404
- So, I mean, that's an interesting question. I mean, do you think... There's several ways of asking that

2797
02:51:27,484 --> 02:51:31,163
question, but if dinosaurs didn't go extinct, do you think

2798
02:51:31,224 --> 02:51:33,723
humans would still be able to evolve?

2799
02:51:33,784 --> 02:51:37,663
- I mean, my guess is probably not. I don't think it's quite

2800
02:51:37,684 --> 02:51:41,503
the... What was it? Oh, Simon Conway

2801
02:51:41,564 --> 02:51:45,204
Morris had that book. What was it? Inevitability of Man. That like even if you

2802
02:51:45,284 --> 02:51:49,194
rewound it, everything would come back. I'm not...

2803
02:51:49,264 --> 02:51:52,694
I don't think it's that far. I certainly don't think it's

2804
02:51:54,003 --> 02:51:57,934
anything quite like the butterfly effect of, you know, if

2805
02:51:58,024 --> 02:52:01,944
one mammal had been trodden on by one T-rex, then humans would never have

2806
02:52:01,984 --> 02:52:03,144
evolved either.

2807
02:52:03,163 --> 02:52:07,114
- We should say that the ancestor of the primates, or the

2808
02:52:07,144 --> 02:52:10,684
closest... There's a lot of debate around this, it's a kind of tiny

2809
02:52:11,104 --> 02:52:14,144
creature, Purgatorius, that was our

2810
02:52:14,244 --> 02:52:17,624
ancestor. Yeah, so this is us. This is what we evolved from.

2811
02:52:17,644 --> 02:52:20,604
- Yes. Scandentia, I think, is the group.

2812
02:52:20,644 --> 02:52:21,424
- Basically a rodent.

2813
02:52:21,464 --> 02:52:25,404
- Yeah, I mean there were probably primates around in the Cretaceous. Some

2814
02:52:25,424 --> 02:52:29,304
of the molecular clock stuff suggests that primates were around

2815
02:52:29,344 --> 02:52:32,904
alongside the dinosaurs, but we've never found any

2816
02:52:32,944 --> 02:52:36,804
osteological evidence of that. But yeah, there's been a

2817
02:52:36,844 --> 02:52:40,404
back and forth about were dinosaurs already on their way out, or were they a bit

2818
02:52:40,464 --> 02:52:44,083
limited by the very end Cretaceous. I think the more recent

2819
02:52:44,104 --> 02:52:47,594
analyses have shown that's probably not the case, because in other words, they were basically doing

2820
02:52:47,704 --> 02:52:51,564
fine right up to the extinction event. And so,

2821
02:52:51,804 --> 02:52:55,764
yeah, if the asteroid hadn't hit, there's no reason to think that they were on

2822
02:52:55,784 --> 02:53:01,544
some kind of terminal decline. Something else may have hit. There may have been,

2823
02:53:02,764 --> 02:53:06,404
you know, some other environmental disaster or something may have happened,

2824
02:53:06,844 --> 02:53:12,744
or maybe they're more vulnerable to stuff than we know of,

2825
02:53:12,784 --> 02:53:16,134
but there's no... I don't think there's any really good reason to think

2826
02:53:17,784 --> 02:53:21,244
they wouldn't have carried on relatively well. I mean, even

2827
02:53:21,304 --> 02:53:26,604
post-dinosaur extinction, you had a window where the mammals and the birds were

2828
02:53:27,503 --> 02:53:31,204
pretty competing. There was a lot of big birds getting going and various big

2829
02:53:31,244 --> 02:53:34,544
carnivorous, terrestrial, kind of hyper-predatory

2830
02:53:34,644 --> 02:53:38,384
ostrich-like things, like the phorusrhacids. So there's no

2831
02:53:38,424 --> 02:53:41,964
guarantee that mammals would have even taken over post the dinosaur

2832
02:53:42,024 --> 02:53:47,324
extinction, since initially they were in a fair bit of competition.

2833
02:53:47,364 --> 02:53:51,003
- So is it just going to... Based on current scientific understanding, human evolution would be

2834
02:53:51,064 --> 02:53:54,804
highly improbable if dinosaurs hadn't gone extinct 66 million years ago,

2835
02:53:55,244 --> 02:53:57,514
because dinosaurs dominated ecological niches.

2836
02:53:57,724 --> 02:53:59,503
- For everything, basically.

2837
02:53:59,524 --> 02:53:59,674
- Wide-bodied mammals.

2838
02:53:59,684 --> 02:54:03,264
- I mean, that's the thing. You look through the Mesozoic, the late

2839
02:54:03,284 --> 02:54:07,244
Triassic, dinosaurs are there alongside a whole bunch of other

2840
02:54:07,284 --> 02:54:10,144
big and unusual and interesting reptiles and some other

2841
02:54:10,224 --> 02:54:14,124
early pre-mammal-like things that are closer to mammals than the reptiles.

2842
02:54:14,163 --> 02:54:18,144
But once you've gotten into the Jurassic, you've now got a solid

2843
02:54:18,204 --> 02:54:25,724
like 120, 130 million years where almost anywhere on Earth, if you saw an animal

2844
02:54:25,784 --> 02:54:31,824
bigger than like a raccoon, it was probably a dinosaur. That's how

2845
02:54:31,884 --> 02:54:35,704
incredibly dominant they... You know, as dominant, if not more dominant than

2846
02:54:35,764 --> 02:54:36,583
modern mammals.

2847
02:54:36,604 --> 02:54:40,704
- But is it fair to say that they were mostly dumb?

2848
02:54:40,764 --> 02:54:44,464
- I don't think so, 'cause I think that comes down to

2849
02:54:44,583 --> 02:54:47,994
A) that bit of kind of classic, almost Victorian

2850
02:54:48,103 --> 02:54:51,884
speciesism, and you get these insane hypotheses

2851
02:54:51,964 --> 02:54:55,604
like dinosaurs as a species or as a lineage became senile, so they

2852
02:54:55,644 --> 02:54:59,564
forgot to breed. I know it's literally a suggested idea.

2853
02:54:59,663 --> 02:55:03,604
You know, the mammals ate their eggs and all of this kind of stuff. Dinosaurs only lived

2854
02:55:03,663 --> 02:55:07,624
alongside mammals for 100 million years. It'd be weird if they all went extinct at the

2855
02:55:07,724 --> 02:55:11,583
same time because suddenly egg eating evolved. You know, you've

2856
02:55:11,644 --> 02:55:16,564
got problems like this. But also, again, that general

2857
02:55:17,764 --> 02:55:21,524
speciesism, which, you know, even goes back to Linnaeus and his taxonomic

2858
02:55:21,544 --> 02:55:25,234
ranks, and even arguably stuff like Aristotle, you've got like, you know,

2859
02:55:25,304 --> 02:55:29,163
humans are superior in some way and we're superior to the

2860
02:55:29,304 --> 02:55:32,624
other mammals. And of course, mammals are closest to us, so they must be quite

2861
02:55:32,663 --> 02:55:36,564
good. And then they've got to be better than lizards, and then

2862
02:55:36,644 --> 02:55:39,984
lizards have to be better than frogs, and frogs have to be better than fish. So

2863
02:55:40,724 --> 02:55:47,294
that gets you into the, "Well, reptiles must be stupid." And they're not.

2864
02:55:47,364 --> 02:55:51,244
- I wonder if a human intelligence level organism could have evolved from the

2865
02:55:51,264 --> 02:55:52,114
dinosaurs.

2866
02:55:52,204 --> 02:55:55,874
- I mean, it's... That's been hypothesized plenty of times. Dale Russell, a

2867
02:55:55,884 --> 02:55:59,284
Canadian paleontologist, the famous guy who came up with this human-like

2868
02:55:59,324 --> 02:56:03,204
troodontid that was done for a TV

2869
02:56:03,224 --> 02:56:07,154
documentary. I think the one that Christopher Reeve narrated. That, I think is

2870
02:56:07,204 --> 02:56:11,064
a remake, but I've seen the original that Dale had made for his TV show

2871
02:56:11,124 --> 02:56:14,984
and it's still... It's sitting in the collections of the

2872
02:56:15,064 --> 02:56:19,034
National Museum of Nature in Ottawa, for Canada. It's really,

2873
02:56:19,074 --> 02:56:22,654
really cool. It's like this five-foot tall dinosauroid. That was it there on the

2874
02:56:22,714 --> 02:56:23,334
screen.

2875
02:56:23,344 --> 02:56:27,224
- "Model of the hypothetical dinosauroid and display at the dinosaur museum in Dorchester."

2876
02:56:27,234 --> 02:56:30,894
- Oh, Dorchester. That's in England. Yeah, I knew there were a couple of copies of it.

2877
02:56:30,914 --> 02:56:34,833
Troodon always comes back as the most intelligent dinosaur because it has really quite a

2878
02:56:34,854 --> 02:56:38,694
big brain for its size. It does have a high encephalization

2879
02:56:38,734 --> 02:56:42,654
quotient, so it's always been tagged as a very good candidate

2880
02:56:42,674 --> 02:56:46,254
for being the smartest dinosaur. And basically, he just hybridized that with a

2881
02:56:46,314 --> 02:56:49,934
human. But of course, why would these things end up as plantigrade

2882
02:56:50,034 --> 02:56:53,914
quadrupeds, and why would they go back to five fingers and... Actually, I think he's only got three, to be

2883
02:56:53,974 --> 02:56:57,904
fair, but he's got very human-like feet. Why has it got no tail? Why would those

2884
02:56:57,934 --> 02:57:01,854
things suddenly disappear? There's no real reason other than just kind of

2885
02:57:01,934 --> 02:57:10,214
human exceptionalism. But like, I mean, you could argue some parrots, some crows are

2886
02:57:10,814 --> 02:57:14,434
phenomenally intelligent and show extremely clever

2887
02:57:14,514 --> 02:57:18,314
behaviors on par with apes. So at

2888
02:57:18,354 --> 02:57:21,734
some level, some dinosaurs were extremely intelligent.

2889
02:57:21,854 --> 02:57:25,674
- I mean, yeah, this is a whole other conversation, but all the tiny details that lead

2890
02:57:26,034 --> 02:57:29,754
to the explosion that is in our evolutionary

2891
02:57:29,854 --> 02:57:33,614
tree that is Homo sapiens. Like what is it? Opposable thumbs,

2892
02:57:33,694 --> 02:57:36,894
right? Is it the invention of fire and the meat-eating? Is it-

2893
02:57:37,154 --> 02:57:37,854
... is it some other-

2894
02:57:37,894 --> 02:57:39,234
- And fighting and sociality and-

2895
02:57:39,274 --> 02:57:39,674
- So many-

2896
02:57:39,684 --> 02:57:43,254
- predation pressure, and then the changing environment. I mean, the shrinking of the

2897
02:57:43,334 --> 02:57:47,294
forest, pushing apes out of the trees into the environment, or into

2898
02:57:47,334 --> 02:57:48,474
the open environment.

2899
02:57:48,494 --> 02:57:52,424
- And probably the same kind of story could be told about the dinosaurs or about anything

2900
02:57:52,494 --> 02:57:52,934
really.

2901
02:57:52,994 --> 02:57:53,724
- Yeah, I mean, you...

2902
02:57:53,734 --> 02:57:53,964
- There's no reason...

2903
02:57:53,974 --> 02:57:57,794
- I mean, if you have 160 million years and a global

2904
02:57:57,834 --> 02:58:01,724
domination. But I mean, this is the thing. You talked about lost behaviors, but

2905
02:58:01,794 --> 02:58:05,674
like the lost lineages. I wrote about this in one of my books, and like, you want to

2906
02:58:05,714 --> 02:58:08,974
find... You want a weird animal, you go to a volcanic

2907
02:58:09,074 --> 02:58:12,434
island. You go to New Zealand, you go to Hawaii, you go to the

2908
02:58:12,474 --> 02:58:16,424
Galapagos, and yet those are the places that basically don't really form fossils.

2909
02:58:17,254 --> 02:58:21,154
So you think the dinosaurs we know about are strange. What

2910
02:58:21,254 --> 02:58:25,014
was the stuff knocking around there? We're never going to

2911
02:58:25,034 --> 02:58:28,734
know, sadly. But for everything you think

2912
02:58:28,794 --> 02:58:32,714
weird... You know, you think birds are cool. Think about penguins compared to your

2913
02:58:32,814 --> 02:58:38,294
average bird. They live on an ice shelf for six months of the year and can't

2914
02:58:38,354 --> 02:58:45,294
fly, and massively modified skeletons. You know, compared to your average bird,

2915
02:58:45,354 --> 02:58:48,894
penguins are unbelievably weird. So yeah, take an average

2916
02:58:48,904 --> 02:58:52,794
dinosaur and take it to penguin level or ostrich

2917
02:58:52,894 --> 02:58:55,284
level or hummingbird level evolution.

2918
02:58:56,294 --> 02:59:00,454
There's going to be weirder stuff out there than we've found. Much weirder.

2919
02:59:00,494 --> 02:59:05,714
- If you travel back in time, your mind will probably be blown by the weirdness.

2920
02:59:05,774 --> 02:59:06,134
- Yeah.

2921
02:59:06,204 --> 02:59:06,294
- Yeah.

2922
02:59:06,314 --> 02:59:09,774
- Because those things are almost always in small, isolated

2923
02:59:09,874 --> 02:59:13,794
places that don't preserve fossils very well, and so the odds of

2924
02:59:13,854 --> 02:59:17,814
us ever coming across them... I mean, you see it to a degree. So you've got,

2925
02:59:17,894 --> 02:59:21,774
the stuff that comes out of what is modern Transylvania,

2926
02:59:21,934 --> 02:59:25,714
what was Transylvania Hateg. That's that

2927
02:59:25,814 --> 02:59:29,414
was a series of islands in the Mediterranean at the end of the Cretaceous,

2928
02:59:29,934 --> 02:59:33,844
and some of the weirdest dinosaurs are from that chain of islands. And

2929
02:59:33,894 --> 02:59:37,674
that's not very isolated compared to, again, something like Hawaii or New

2930
02:59:37,754 --> 02:59:41,574
Zealand. But it's fitting the exact pattern. You get dinosaurs on

2931
02:59:41,654 --> 02:59:49,294
islands, they turn weird. We see that. So again, dinosaurs were real animals.

2932
02:59:49,354 --> 02:59:56,663
Again, it sounds really painfully obvious, but they weren't monsters. They followed

2933
02:59:57,474 --> 03:00:01,074
the same... Rules might be pushing it, but certainly, like, guidelines.

2934
03:00:01,154 --> 03:00:04,834
Ecology operates in certain ways. If you're bigger, you need more

2935
03:00:04,874 --> 03:00:08,754
food. But you're more efficient. You just are. That's pretty

2936
03:00:08,774 --> 03:00:12,734
much just physics and scaling. So big dinosaurs are going to follow

2937
03:00:12,774 --> 03:00:16,504
the rules of bigger animals, and small dinosaurs are going to follow the rules of smaller animals.

2938
03:00:16,514 --> 03:00:20,174
They just will. Quite how they violate it in certain

2939
03:00:20,234 --> 03:00:23,804
ways, by having unusually long necks or

2940
03:00:23,834 --> 03:00:27,634
unusual physiology, or eating an unusual diet, or because there was a

2941
03:00:27,694 --> 03:00:31,534
weird plant that was alive then that isn't now, or whatever it may be. There's

2942
03:00:31,544 --> 03:00:34,734
obviously a huge amount of variation and uncertainty. But

2943
03:00:34,814 --> 03:00:38,714
fundamentally, we know what makes animals and ecosystems

2944
03:00:38,794 --> 03:00:42,564
work, and dinosaurs were animals in ecosystems. They're

2945
03:00:42,594 --> 03:00:49,574
not that strange at some level, and therefore reconstructing their actual biology

2946
03:00:49,654 --> 03:00:53,914
is challenging, but far from impossible.

2947
03:00:54,514 --> 03:00:59,114
- Strange question. As everybody knows, dragons are obviously real.

2948
03:00:59,124 --> 03:01:06,174
- I've been asked that on live TV before. Only not with the sarcastic tone, so...

2949
03:01:06,194 --> 03:01:08,694
- Do you dare disagree? ...with this notion?

2950
03:01:08,704 --> 03:01:12,034
- Yes, I do. They don't.

2951
03:01:12,174 --> 03:01:12,464
- Well...

2952
03:01:12,494 --> 03:01:13,254
- And again, I...

2953
03:01:13,274 --> 03:01:14,664
- They're real to me, so...

2954
03:01:14,664 --> 03:01:18,494
- That's fine. But again, you know, we kind of touched on it, but

2955
03:01:18,554 --> 03:01:22,294
I think there's probably very little of any kind

2956
03:01:22,394 --> 03:01:26,264
of paleontological law that ended up in

2957
03:01:26,294 --> 03:01:30,154
things like Chinese culture, with the Chinese dragons and all of that stuff. That one comes up

2958
03:01:30,174 --> 03:01:34,014
repeatedly. The only one I do know of, again, from Alberta,

2959
03:01:34,154 --> 03:01:38,034
is buffalo stones that the...

2960
03:01:38,134 --> 03:01:41,454
apparently some of the Native Americans had, which are actually bits of

2961
03:01:41,494 --> 03:01:45,034
ammonites. So ammonites, they're curly, spiral-shelled

2962
03:01:45,374 --> 03:01:49,174
cephalopods that are related to octopus and squid. So they have all these

2963
03:01:49,294 --> 03:01:52,434
little segments to the shells, and the right species... And when they break

2964
03:01:52,554 --> 03:01:56,444
open, they have, like, two little pairs of legs and

2965
03:01:56,474 --> 03:02:00,214
then a bulge and then a little bulge, and it looks very roughly like a

2966
03:02:00,254 --> 03:02:02,654
bison. And apparently these were

2967
03:02:03,494 --> 03:02:07,354
thought to be, like, somehow miniature bison. They're very rare

2968
03:02:07,434 --> 03:02:11,414
because ironically, although the dinosaur bones are extremely common,

2969
03:02:11,454 --> 03:02:15,294
it was very swampy, so you didn't actually have a lot of sea coming in,

2970
03:02:15,314 --> 03:02:19,234
so you didn't tend to get things like ammonites and ocean-going animals. And then the shell would

2971
03:02:19,274 --> 03:02:22,714
have to break in the right way. But apparently for the local tribes, like

2972
03:02:22,954 --> 03:02:26,914
Sáptəṉilh, I don't remember who it is in that bit of Canada... But yeah, these were

2973
03:02:26,974 --> 03:02:30,762
quite valued. If you've got a buffalo stone. And I've seen a

2974
03:02:30,802 --> 03:02:34,562
couple of them, and yeah, you have to squint a bit, but as a little buffalo, it's not

2975
03:02:34,642 --> 03:02:38,422
far off. But yeah, but that whole, like, were they

2976
03:02:38,522 --> 03:02:42,482
finding mammoth legs and were they finding T-rexes, and was this inspiration

2977
03:02:42,522 --> 03:02:46,462
for this animal or this mystical animal? I don't think they were,

2978
03:02:46,502 --> 03:02:47,472
because you just don't tend to find them like that.

2979
03:02:47,472 --> 03:02:50,892
- So where do you think, like... You know, 'cause dragons show up in a bunch of different myths.

2980
03:02:50,922 --> 03:02:54,532
- Well, right. But that's the thing, they turn up in British mythology, and we've barely got any

2981
03:02:54,602 --> 03:02:58,362
dinosaurs here at all. You only find them when you start digging for

2982
03:02:58,402 --> 03:03:00,482
coal mines, which we weren't doing in...

2983
03:03:00,522 --> 03:03:05,622
- Is it basically a dramatization of like of snakes and lizards and stuff like this?

2984
03:03:05,762 --> 03:03:09,642
- Yeah, and just general exaggeration and welding stuff together.

2985
03:03:09,682 --> 03:03:12,762
I mean, that's one thing you could, I guess, potentially argue is

2986
03:03:12,822 --> 03:03:16,502
that, you know, yeah, we find tyrannosaurs in North America and in East

2987
03:03:16,582 --> 03:03:20,432
Asia. In fact, there's a whole bunch of stuff in the Early Cretaceous, which is often very common,

2988
03:03:20,502 --> 03:03:23,842
'cause it's all relatively recent in the grand scheme of things in the history of the

2989
03:03:23,922 --> 03:03:27,622
world. The fauna of East Asia:

2990
03:03:27,662 --> 03:03:31,302
China, Mongolia, Eastern Russia, is very similar to what you get in Canada or in the

2991
03:03:31,362 --> 03:03:35,202
USA and down in Mexico. And so

2992
03:03:35,262 --> 03:03:38,942
you find the same rough stuff. They may not be exactly the same, but you get

2993
03:03:38,982 --> 03:03:42,862
ceratopsians, you get tyrannosaurs, you get the big-edged archosaurs, you get

2994
03:03:42,902 --> 03:03:46,802
ankylosaurs, the armored ones, this, that, and the other. So if

2995
03:03:46,842 --> 03:03:49,202
these were influencing all those different cultures—

2996
03:03:49,842 --> 03:03:53,362
...why don't Chinese dragons look like Mexican dragons or

2997
03:03:53,442 --> 03:03:57,432
equivalent thunderbirds or whatever? Well, because it probably wasn't influencing

2998
03:03:57,432 --> 03:04:01,022
them. If they were all seeing the same skeleton, they'd probably all

2999
03:04:01,042 --> 03:04:03,262
produce the same kind of mythical animals. They all produce—

3000
03:04:03,282 --> 03:04:03,622
- Well, uh—

3001
03:04:03,632 --> 03:04:04,342
- ...different ones.

3002
03:04:04,362 --> 03:04:07,352
- You have to understand, paleontology's not perfect, so they were just misinterpreting it.

3003
03:04:07,362 --> 03:04:08,662
- Misinterpreting, yeah.

3004
03:04:09,322 --> 03:04:13,282
- I mean, dragons aside, I'm sure, like we said with weirdness, there would

3005
03:04:13,322 --> 03:04:14,142
be creatures

3006
03:04:15,462 --> 03:04:19,382
that would be remarkable, right? That you look at it and you might as well

3007
03:04:19,402 --> 03:04:20,682
be seeing a dragon. It could be—

3008
03:04:20,862 --> 03:04:23,862
And I mean, there are creatures alive in the sea today.

3009
03:04:24,302 --> 03:04:27,822
- Yeah, I mean if you dredged up a colossal squid, I think you'd have—

3010
03:04:28,402 --> 03:04:34,272
You know, or even just dugongs and manatees. I mean, they're really quite strange.

3011
03:04:34,282 --> 03:04:38,002
- And if you allow yourself to marvel at the small things on Earth, like I was in the

3012
03:04:38,062 --> 03:04:42,572
Amazon jungle, like the insects, they're just like, "What is—"

3013
03:04:42,852 --> 03:04:46,622
...happening there? There are so many things going on.

3014
03:04:46,752 --> 03:04:50,362
Oh, they're like hairy and colorful, and probably

3015
03:04:50,482 --> 03:04:53,931
poisonous, and they have teeth, and what? And they're just— And they're long and—

3016
03:04:53,942 --> 03:04:57,782
- Well, and all the little weirdos. I've, I've—

3017
03:04:57,842 --> 03:05:01,782
several times I've pitched a book to publishers where I want to write a book

3018
03:05:01,882 --> 03:05:05,842
that basically makes the point that there is almost

3019
03:05:05,882 --> 03:05:09,642
nothing— I mean, you can always dream up something totally ludicrous— There is basically

3020
03:05:09,682 --> 03:05:13,562
nothing in science fiction that doesn't already exist on Earth in some way, shape, or

3021
03:05:13,622 --> 03:05:14,342
form.

3022
03:05:14,422 --> 03:05:18,282
- Yeah, that is why I'll think about alien civilizations and aliens out there, and

3023
03:05:18,382 --> 03:05:22,222
I'm very, very certain that there are aliens everywhere

3024
03:05:22,322 --> 03:05:25,942
throughout the observable universe. It's very strange we haven't seen

3025
03:05:25,982 --> 03:05:29,642
them, but it's fun to marvel at what they

3026
03:05:29,702 --> 03:05:32,002
possibly look like, because there's a huge variety

3027
03:05:32,922 --> 03:05:37,002
of organisms and species here on Earth, and you just expand that out—

3028
03:05:37,252 --> 03:05:42,042
...to like more and more Earths, and you can just imagine there's a lot of weird—

3029
03:05:42,642 --> 03:05:45,492
- Well, that's the thing. I think most people, you know, understandably...

3030
03:05:45,542 --> 03:05:49,342
I'm a biologist, and I particularly pride myself on finding out about

3031
03:05:49,382 --> 03:05:53,342
particularly weird animals. But yeah, I think people would be stunned

3032
03:05:53,382 --> 03:05:57,222
about some of the weird stuff that's out there that they just wouldn't

3033
03:05:57,902 --> 03:06:01,262
realize are real. You know, things like velvet worms.

3034
03:06:02,202 --> 03:06:07,762
You know, it's just, it'll blow your mind. You know,

3035
03:06:07,882 --> 03:06:11,422
caecilians and stuff like this and their reproductive behavior. It's just

3036
03:06:12,382 --> 03:06:16,122
jaw-dropping. I mean, I love teaching about them. I do a class on diversity of

3037
03:06:16,182 --> 03:06:20,142
life, and it's about eight weeks of vertebrate diversity, and I love

3038
03:06:20,202 --> 03:06:24,062
just dropping things in, and the students are like, "What do you mean that exists?

3039
03:06:24,082 --> 03:06:29,922
What do you mean something like that's normal for this group?" Yeah, they do that.

3040
03:06:29,982 --> 03:06:32,792
- Well, what from that class, but everything you've studied with the

3041
03:06:32,882 --> 03:06:36,402
dinosaurs, what have you learned about the

3042
03:06:36,412 --> 03:06:39,442
evolution of life on Earth, that mechanism?

3043
03:06:39,562 --> 03:06:46,692
- It's really good. It sounds obvious, but it's... I think

3044
03:06:47,762 --> 03:06:51,682
the bit that still fries my brain is just like the raw numbers, because

3045
03:06:51,742 --> 03:06:55,702
I think we're very bad at considering... Like, I

3046
03:06:55,782 --> 03:06:59,302
regularly talk about, "Oh, this is 70 million years old, but this is 78, and this is

3047
03:06:59,362 --> 03:07:03,352
104." And people are just like, "Oh my God, how on Earth do you deal with

3048
03:07:03,402 --> 03:07:07,022
those numbers?" And I don't. They're just numbers,

3049
03:07:07,062 --> 03:07:10,542
because I can't conceive of it really any better than you

3050
03:07:10,622 --> 03:07:15,762
can. They are astronomical. Yeah, last Thursday was quite a long time ago.

3051
03:07:15,942 --> 03:07:19,442
66 million years is mind-boggling. I can't fathom it.

3052
03:07:19,502 --> 03:07:23,482
I can't fathom it. But that's it. I think

3053
03:07:23,522 --> 03:07:27,452
the evolution thing is, A, my suspicion is quite a lot of it

3054
03:07:27,542 --> 03:07:32,002
happens... It's not quite Stephen Gould's punctuated equilibrium, but I think

3055
03:07:33,602 --> 03:07:37,522
stressful events probably prompt a lot more than

3056
03:07:37,582 --> 03:07:41,382
less stressful events. You know, population crashes and all these

3057
03:07:41,402 --> 03:07:42,752
things that then...

3058
03:07:44,082 --> 03:07:47,622
Odd things survive, and then that's changing your genetic component and all the rest of it.

3059
03:07:47,642 --> 03:07:51,472
But you've just got to remember that it's almost a numbers

3060
03:07:51,622 --> 03:07:56,382
game. You know, it's that bad analogy of like, "Oh yeah,

3061
03:07:56,602 --> 03:08:00,482
evolution is just rolling dice and hoping you get all sixes." And it's like, no, a friend of mine said,

3062
03:08:00,492 --> 03:08:04,312
"No, it's rolling dice, but it gets to keep the sixes." And then suddenly getting a

3063
03:08:04,342 --> 03:08:07,992
hat full of sixes isn't that hard, but also you're in the context

3064
03:08:08,102 --> 03:08:11,822
of even rare species, you know, ultra-rare,

3065
03:08:11,862 --> 03:08:15,422
short of stuff that like we've nearly killed off, but very rare

3066
03:08:15,502 --> 03:08:19,552
species have populations in the thousands or hundreds of thousands.

3067
03:08:19,672 --> 03:08:23,582
And are probably around for hundreds of thousands of years.

3068
03:08:23,682 --> 03:08:27,472
Very few, other than a few things like whales and apes and

3069
03:08:27,542 --> 03:08:30,982
elephants, mostly have dozens or thousands of offspring at a

3070
03:08:31,082 --> 03:08:34,722
time. So a few thousand animals that have a few thousand

3071
03:08:34,782 --> 03:08:38,212
offspring aligned for a few hundred thousand years... Yeah, it's billions and

3072
03:08:38,362 --> 03:08:42,310
billions and billions of them. And that's the

3073
03:08:42,369 --> 03:08:46,179
rare stuff. You look at Mola mola, the ocean sunfish, though I

3074
03:08:46,210 --> 03:08:50,010
think Mola has just been split up into like five species. It's one of the

3075
03:08:50,050 --> 03:08:53,090
weirdest-looking animals. I love it, love it, love it.

3076
03:08:54,109 --> 03:08:58,010
I mean, what a fish that is. Swims with a giant dorsal and

3077
03:08:58,090 --> 03:09:01,550
I think it's a giant anal fin, and then they flap alternatingly.

3078
03:09:01,880 --> 03:09:03,590
- Does it have a face? Yeah.

3079
03:09:03,609 --> 03:09:07,029
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Little one at the front. Ate jellyfish. Super

3080
03:09:07,170 --> 03:09:11,090
open-oceanic. And they get really big. You can see that one with the diver.

3081
03:09:11,150 --> 03:09:14,910
But I think these are the record breeders for animals, and they have something like 100

3082
03:09:14,970 --> 03:09:16,689
million eggs at a time.

3083
03:09:16,769 --> 03:09:17,059
- Whoa.

3084
03:09:17,090 --> 03:09:21,029
- Don't quote me on that, but it is something in those kinds of numbers.

3085
03:09:21,130 --> 03:09:24,949
So yeah, you don't need a very large population of

3086
03:09:24,990 --> 03:09:28,630
sunfish to start having an awful lot

3087
03:09:28,769 --> 03:09:32,510
of numbers. Are you gonna Google it and see if you can

3088
03:09:32,590 --> 03:09:38,189
find it? Number of eggs or something? Yeah. 300 million. Oh, I under- I-

3089
03:09:38,230 --> 03:09:38,970
- A single fe-

3090
03:09:38,980 --> 03:09:39,460
- I undercut it.

3091
03:09:39,510 --> 03:09:43,210
- A single female can release up to 300 million eggs at one time during a

3092
03:09:43,250 --> 03:09:47,070
spawning event. Boy. These eggs are incredibly small, measuring

3093
03:09:47,109 --> 03:09:49,289
about 1.3 millimeters in diameter.

3094
03:09:49,330 --> 03:09:52,050
- That's still a lot of egg size when you think about it.

3095
03:09:52,070 --> 03:09:53,050
- It's not that small.

3096
03:09:53,109 --> 03:09:57,010
- Yeah. 300 million of one mil is still quite a bit.

3097
03:09:57,130 --> 03:09:58,679
- Fertilization is external.

3098
03:09:58,689 --> 03:09:58,699
- Yeah, it's-

3099
03:09:58,710 --> 03:10:02,369
- Females release their eggs into the water, where males then fertilize

3100
03:10:02,429 --> 03:10:08,300
them. Wow. Man, there's a lot of different ways to have sex, I guess. This is-

3101
03:10:08,310 --> 03:10:12,170
- Yeah. But that's the bit of evolution that I

3102
03:10:12,189 --> 03:10:15,630
think, I understand why people don't get it. We are

3103
03:10:15,670 --> 03:10:19,410
mostly talking about millions in population

3104
03:10:19,590 --> 03:10:23,029
times millions of years times thousands of offspring.

3105
03:10:24,130 --> 03:10:28,070
Yeah. It's kind of a numbers game. Well, how could this evolve?

3106
03:10:28,109 --> 03:10:32,090
With the right selective pressure, and when you've got 100 billion offspring,

3107
03:10:32,150 --> 03:10:33,630
probably a few of them have that.

3108
03:10:33,650 --> 03:10:37,130
- And when you focus in on a single species and trace its history,

3109
03:10:37,630 --> 03:10:41,500
you can see how effective evolution is, natural selection is. And then you just have to,

3110
03:10:41,590 --> 03:10:43,960
like, go across species and you're gonna realize-

3111
03:10:43,960 --> 03:10:47,630
- Yeah, but it's also a massive compromise, which is the bit that people always miss.

3112
03:10:47,670 --> 03:10:50,189
You know, it's Darwin's line, "It's descent with

3113
03:10:50,269 --> 03:10:54,070
modification." Yes, over time, you can end up

3114
03:10:54,130 --> 03:10:58,549
with extraordinarily weird things, but mostly what's happening is you're changing

3115
03:10:59,390 --> 03:11:00,630
something fairly simple.

3116
03:11:00,670 --> 03:11:01,039
- Yeah.

3117
03:11:01,070 --> 03:11:04,710
- You're making edits to the existing plan,

3118
03:11:04,789 --> 03:11:08,730
which is why you don't have animals with tentacles.

3119
03:11:08,949 --> 03:11:12,890
They have legs, which have joints, which have fingers, and they all have one bone,

3120
03:11:12,910 --> 03:11:16,830
then two bones, then a bunch of little blocky bones, and then a few more,

3121
03:11:16,869 --> 03:11:20,210
and then the little ones that make up the digits for hands and feet, and basically everything has that-

3122
03:11:20,929 --> 03:11:24,869
... because you're modifying that pattern. And occasionally you'll get something weird,

3123
03:11:24,929 --> 03:11:28,769
like most of the modern lungfish have basically reduced those down to-

3124
03:11:28,810 --> 03:11:32,750
well, they had a more simple plan to begin with, but reduced it down to a stump, and then they've got something

3125
03:11:32,789 --> 03:11:35,310
like a flaily tentacle. But

3126
03:11:36,230 --> 03:11:40,130
yeah, you know, snakes have gotten rid of them, all of the various legless lizards and things like that,

3127
03:11:40,150 --> 03:11:46,789
and again, caecilians, and all the rest. But yet, you're- you're

3128
03:11:47,630 --> 03:11:51,599
subtly changing certain things in certain ways is mostly what's going on, and then

3129
03:11:51,630 --> 03:11:55,570
those build up over time. But also, again, it's that compromise of

3130
03:11:55,609 --> 03:11:59,510
there's things that do and don't work. There's things that are interlinked, so you can't

3131
03:11:59,550 --> 03:12:03,330
modify A without modifying B. Modifying A will kill

3132
03:12:03,390 --> 03:12:07,369
you, therefore B never modifies, because the two are genetically

3133
03:12:07,410 --> 03:12:11,269
linked in some way. Or yeah, like the compromise of the

3134
03:12:11,310 --> 03:12:15,260
lion's mane. Making it darker makes you sexier, but more likely to kill you.

3135
03:12:15,289 --> 03:12:18,640
I think people think evolution is like,

3136
03:12:18,689 --> 03:12:22,570
perfecting things in some way. And they're not. They're bodge

3137
03:12:22,670 --> 03:12:26,050
jobs, you know? That's why we have a blind spot in our eye, but

3138
03:12:26,970 --> 03:12:28,590
things like squid don't.

3139
03:12:28,630 --> 03:12:32,609
- But that process, nevertheless, does have inventions in it. You have Tiktaalik. You

3140
03:12:32,650 --> 03:12:36,109
have a fish that learns to breathe, that crawls out.

3141
03:12:36,119 --> 03:12:40,090
- Yeah, but it already had a swim bladder that it was probably processing a minimal amount of

3142
03:12:40,150 --> 03:12:44,189
oxygen through, and the swim bladder evolved for a certainly different function.

3143
03:12:44,210 --> 03:12:47,090
- Yeah, but that's one of the powerful things... ...About evolution.

3144
03:12:47,220 --> 03:12:49,170
... evolution. It switches the function.

3145
03:12:49,330 --> 03:12:53,220
It develops it for one function, but once you once you get there, you're like, "Oh, okay, this

3146
03:12:53,230 --> 03:12:57,199
could be used for another function," that- that leads to something that

3147
03:12:57,230 --> 03:13:00,420
we, in retrospect, can see as a major invention, which is-

3148
03:13:00,618 --> 03:13:02,510
... a fish that's able to crawl on land, and all of a sudden-

3149
03:13:02,519 --> 03:13:03,410
- Yep, absolutely.

3150
03:13:03,429 --> 03:13:09,410
- ...we have- we have cities and... ...And rockets, and yeah. Tiktaalik specifically,

3151
03:13:09,449 --> 03:13:13,150
like, there's something really, like, mind-boggling about a

3152
03:13:13,330 --> 03:13:16,699
fish that crawls out of the sea, and you just the image of that.

3153
03:13:17,189 --> 03:13:20,779
- Yeah, but again, you've got stuff that's not a million miles away from that.

3154
03:13:20,779 --> 03:13:24,510
You have things like frogfish, which are fully marine,

3155
03:13:24,570 --> 03:13:28,349
but kinda clamber through seaweed and stuff, and they've

3156
03:13:28,390 --> 03:13:31,349
got pseudo-functional limbs. It's again, it's that

3157
03:13:33,050 --> 03:13:36,130
...Tiktaalik is not a weirdly derived frogfish, but it's not like

3158
03:13:37,230 --> 03:13:41,199
it's a fish that suddenly came on land or a fish that suddenly evolved legs. There was already

3159
03:13:41,210 --> 03:13:45,070
that selective pressure that was pushing it into a new opportunity, which gave it an-

3160
03:13:46,590 --> 03:13:50,529
and then on and on and on, and that's what keeps going. But it also brings up another thing, going

3161
03:13:50,550 --> 03:13:54,390
back to dinosaurs and the behavior stuff, which, again, I think has been a

3162
03:13:54,429 --> 03:13:58,050
problem, is the functionality thing,

3163
03:13:58,670 --> 03:14:01,250
and how there's always been, I think, this big perception

3164
03:14:01,320 --> 03:14:05,029
of single traits having single functions,

3165
03:14:05,070 --> 03:14:08,980
which isn't how a huge amount of biology works. For some, yeah. Like, eyes

3166
03:14:08,990 --> 03:14:12,938
are used for seeing. They don't really do anything else. But I

3167
03:14:12,949 --> 03:14:16,679
think there's a lot of- again, it comes down to a lot of the sexual selection stuff, but things like

3168
03:14:16,710 --> 03:14:20,519
horns on Triceratops. That's probably quite good for fighting off predators, but it's

3169
03:14:20,590 --> 03:14:23,490
also quite good for fighting other Triceratops.

3170
03:14:23,880 --> 03:14:27,869
And then things like elephants dig with their tusks as well as fight other elephants,

3171
03:14:27,929 --> 03:14:31,830
as well as fight lions, as well as stripping the bark off trees. So,

3172
03:14:31,869 --> 03:14:35,849
you've got to be very careful about how you think of functionality in

3173
03:14:35,890 --> 03:14:39,820
two different ways. One way is, what possible things

3174
03:14:39,929 --> 03:14:43,874
could that thing do and what possible things could

3175
03:14:43,934 --> 03:14:47,894
have been the main selective pressure before. So, you think

3176
03:14:47,954 --> 03:14:51,884
about elephant tusks. As I say, they do all these different things. But when an elephant's just

3177
03:14:51,934 --> 03:14:53,704
got the tiniest-

3178
03:14:53,804 --> 03:14:57,114
little nubs, like the first elephant whose teeth are growing the wrong

3179
03:14:57,174 --> 03:15:00,134
way and have pushed out of its jaw, and now it's got a couple of little

3180
03:15:00,174 --> 03:15:03,914
spikes, it can't really dig a hole

3181
03:15:03,954 --> 03:15:07,694
with them. It's certainly not digging for water. They're

3182
03:15:07,734 --> 03:15:11,584
probably not great against a predator, because you'd basically have to get on your knees to try and lean

3183
03:15:11,614 --> 03:15:15,534
over and try and stab it a bit. But you can show off to the girls,

3184
03:15:15,554 --> 03:15:19,354
and you can immediately find another elephant who's head-to-head the same height as

3185
03:15:19,414 --> 03:15:22,534
you, and you've got a massive advantage. So,

3186
03:15:22,614 --> 03:15:26,454
evolutionarily, they probably started as some kind of

3187
03:15:26,514 --> 03:15:30,154
sexually selected feature. But now,

3188
03:15:30,214 --> 03:15:34,194
functionally, they are probably compromised by the fact that

3189
03:15:34,214 --> 03:15:38,004
having the best fighting tusks, but also having the tusks that are best at

3190
03:15:38,034 --> 03:15:41,974
digging up water to keep you alive during a drought,

3191
03:15:42,034 --> 03:15:44,234
is putting selective pressure on that.

3192
03:15:44,894 --> 03:15:48,014
And those are, are those selections, sexual selection appears in both

3193
03:15:48,074 --> 03:15:51,944
ends. Those are two different things. Digging for water is

3194
03:15:51,954 --> 03:15:55,794
critical, but it's probably not what started it. And I think that's where we get

3195
03:15:55,854 --> 03:15:56,934
trapped with things

3196
03:15:57,854 --> 03:16:01,494
like, say, the paddle tail of Spinosaurus or stuff like, or you know, or T-rex

3197
03:16:01,534 --> 03:16:05,474
arms. It's like, well, why are T-rex arms like that? Well, maybe we

3198
03:16:05,514 --> 03:16:09,494
need to consider what a slightly longer arm is like or what it was being functioned for in its

3199
03:16:09,574 --> 03:16:13,254
ancestors or how it works in other species or what else it might

3200
03:16:13,274 --> 03:16:17,014
do, rather than every paper is like, "Did it do this," or,

3201
03:16:17,154 --> 03:16:20,234
"Did it do this," or, "Did it do this?" It's like, you know, it could be all of them.

3202
03:16:21,154 --> 03:16:21,844
That's-

3203
03:16:21,844 --> 03:16:25,154
a very different question to try and answer, but people don't tend to think of it.

3204
03:16:25,164 --> 03:16:28,974
And it ends up being very binary. And again, biology is not like that,

3205
03:16:29,014 --> 03:16:30,834
because it's a compromise.

3206
03:16:30,914 --> 03:16:34,794
- And it may be wiser to then look at the evolutionary origins, how it first

3207
03:16:34,804 --> 03:16:35,074
sprung up.

3208
03:16:35,114 --> 03:16:37,114
- Yeah, if you, yeah. You know, what does a

3209
03:16:37,934 --> 03:16:41,794
miniaturized version of this look like, and what might that function for? Or,

3210
03:16:41,874 --> 03:16:45,654
how does it function in ancestral forms? You know, a really good example of that is

3211
03:16:45,934 --> 03:16:49,873
giraffe necks, which have been argued about, you know, forever and a day. It

3212
03:16:49,914 --> 03:16:53,854
was, "Giraffe necks are to help them feed up high." And then in the late

3213
03:16:53,874 --> 03:16:57,614
'90s, early 2000s, there's a couple of papers coming out going, "Actually, maybe it's

3214
03:16:57,634 --> 03:17:01,374
sexual selection and competition." And then that drove down into

3215
03:17:01,394 --> 03:17:05,234
arguments about, "Well, what does a short neck look like? And the okapi is the nearest

3216
03:17:05,274 --> 03:17:09,084
relative. And what do short legs look like, and how do they work?" And plus a whole bunch of

3217
03:17:09,134 --> 03:17:12,414
other studies. And ultimately, it came out that we were right the first time. This is all about

3218
03:17:12,494 --> 03:17:17,314
feeding. But it's a really interesting way of thinking about it and looking at it.

3219
03:17:18,274 --> 03:17:23,614
- Gotta ask you the ridiculous question. We do have dinosaurs here on Earth today.

3220
03:17:23,734 --> 03:17:24,694
They're birds.

3221
03:17:24,754 --> 03:17:27,874
- Yep. 10 and a half, 11,000 species of dinosaur.

3222
03:17:27,914 --> 03:17:29,154
- Are birds dinosaurs?

3223
03:17:29,214 --> 03:17:30,133
- Yes.

3224
03:17:30,194 --> 03:17:30,984
- Yeah, there's not...

3225
03:17:30,994 --> 03:17:31,694
- It's, it's-

3226
03:17:31,714 --> 03:17:31,784
- Wild?

3227
03:17:31,784 --> 03:17:33,514
- It's just a yes. Yeah.

3228
03:17:33,534 --> 03:17:34,954
- How many people know this, by the way?

3229
03:17:35,014 --> 03:17:38,814
- So there's, there's an interesting one. I did a radio show, oh, it's probably

3230
03:17:38,854 --> 03:17:42,714
seven or eight years ago now, with a couple of prese- you know, drive time

3231
03:17:42,814 --> 03:17:46,603
afternoon, nothing serious, nothing science, or anything like that. I mentioned something like this.

3232
03:17:46,694 --> 03:17:50,684
And one presenter was, "Oh my God, what do you mean birds are dinosaurs?"

3233
03:17:50,734 --> 03:17:54,694
And the other one is, "What do you mean you don't know birds are dinosaurs?"

3234
03:17:54,834 --> 03:17:59,034
So it's hitting that tipping point of common knowledge, I think, where...

3235
03:18:00,194 --> 03:18:03,954
Does everyone know? No. But I think an awful lot of people know and are now used to it.

3236
03:18:03,994 --> 03:18:07,054
as an idea.

3237
03:18:07,134 --> 03:18:09,554
- So what's the evolutionary connection between birds and dinosaurs?

3238
03:18:09,814 --> 03:18:13,734
- They literally are, in the same way that we are apes and mammals. Birds are

3239
03:18:13,774 --> 03:18:17,654
dinosaurs. The direct, if you trace back the

3240
03:18:17,734 --> 03:18:21,464
evolution of all the birds, so hummingbirds and

3241
03:18:21,514 --> 03:18:25,374
albatross and ostrich and kiwi and parrots and pelicans and penguins

3242
03:18:25,394 --> 03:18:29,334
and whatever else, and take them down to their ancestral point, and then

3243
03:18:29,374 --> 03:18:33,354
go back quite a few more million years, the nearest

3244
03:18:33,394 --> 03:18:37,174
relatives to them is a dinosaur. It is actually something very close to

3245
03:18:37,194 --> 03:18:40,834
Velociraptor or at least a small version of Velociraptor.

3246
03:18:41,334 --> 03:18:45,174
So birds have literally descended from dinosaurs, therefore

3247
03:18:45,234 --> 03:18:49,154
they are dinosaurs. We have literally descended from other apes, we are apes.

3248
03:18:49,214 --> 03:18:52,614
It is that form of evolutionary connection.

3249
03:18:52,654 --> 03:18:56,354
- Throughout that whole process, did they have feathers, or did feathers come and go?

3250
03:18:56,394 --> 03:19:00,034
- Feathers are in tyrannosaurs. Feathers go back at least...

3251
03:19:00,254 --> 03:19:07,174
So, ironically, because the fossil record is very incomplete, most of the things

3252
03:19:07,214 --> 03:19:11,034
that are closest to birds we know from the early and late Cretaceous,

3253
03:19:11,214 --> 03:19:15,134
so the last kind of 50 million years of dinosaur evolution,

3254
03:19:15,234 --> 03:19:18,794
up to the extinction. And actually, birds almost certainly go back another

3255
03:19:18,874 --> 03:19:22,754
50 million years. So birds did not appear as a result of the dinosaurs going

3256
03:19:22,794 --> 03:19:26,714
So birds did not appear as a result of the dinosaurs going

3257
03:19:26,794 --> 03:19:30,634
extinct. Birds lived alongside the dinosaurs for 100 million years. This was, the

3258
03:19:30,694 --> 03:19:34,664
birds were not new on the scene. It's not like, "Oh, the dinosaurs died, and from

3259
03:19:34,694 --> 03:19:38,514
the ashes rose the birds." No, they've been knocking around forever.

3260
03:19:38,574 --> 03:19:39,014
No, they've been knocking around forever.

3261
03:19:39,034 --> 03:19:40,354
- They just survived 'cause they're small.

3262
03:19:40,414 --> 03:19:44,134
- In a very large part, yeah. That's almost certainly what really

3263
03:19:44,194 --> 03:19:48,134
helped them. Birds took a kicking in the KT extinction.

3264
03:19:48,154 --> 03:19:52,144
So did mammals. Loads of bird lineages went extinct, and only a handful got over the

3265
03:19:52,174 --> 03:19:56,134
line, but they did. We have feathers, as I said, we've got Middle Jurassic

3266
03:19:56,314 --> 03:20:00,114
tyrannosaurs that are 165 million years.

3267
03:20:00,154 --> 03:20:03,614
old, so 100 million years before the extinction, that have

3268
03:20:03,654 --> 03:20:07,574
feathers. Simple feathers, they'd be like those you get on most baby chicks,

3269
03:20:07,634 --> 03:20:09,214
so they're not with the big kind of

3270
03:20:10,074 --> 03:20:14,034
classic pick up a feather in, you know, in the street or on a field, the big vein

3271
03:20:14,094 --> 03:20:17,994
up the middle and then the kind of paired flat pieces. This

3272
03:20:18,014 --> 03:20:21,954
would be much more like a hair. But we have them.

3273
03:20:21,994 --> 03:20:25,674
We've got something which is very close to a bird, but might not quite be a

3274
03:20:25,714 --> 03:20:29,604
bird, with modern feathers. In

3275
03:20:29,654 --> 03:20:32,774
the Middle Jurassic, we've got definitive stuff like Archaeopteryx in the Late

3276
03:20:32,814 --> 03:20:36,494
Jurassic, and then into the early Cretaceous we have a series of fossil beds in

3277
03:20:36,534 --> 03:20:39,974
China which are just heaving with them. So yeah, and

3278
03:20:40,034 --> 03:20:43,598
tyrannosaurs have feathers. Velociraptor and the

3279
03:20:43,618 --> 03:20:47,558
Dromaeosaurs had feathers. Troodontids had feathers. Ornithomimosaurs, we've

3280
03:20:47,578 --> 03:20:51,118
mentioned, they had feathers, and so did a whole bunch of other groups as well.

3281
03:20:51,158 --> 03:20:54,838
There's about eight or nine major

3282
03:20:54,958 --> 03:20:58,858
groups, kind of the size of something like, yeah, literally like

3283
03:20:58,938 --> 03:21:02,637
carnivores or deer. You know, some

3284
03:21:02,758 --> 03:21:06,738
massive groups. About eight or nine of them were fully feathered, as far

3285
03:21:06,797 --> 03:21:10,637
as we can tell. So feathers massively predate bird

3286
03:21:10,698 --> 03:21:13,118
origins, but it was a major part of their evolution.

3287
03:21:13,178 --> 03:21:16,538
- Do I understand why feathers evolved with the function,

3288
03:21:16,578 --> 03:21:18,868
the, the sexual selection, the signaling?

3289
03:21:18,868 --> 03:21:22,658
- Yeah, it's probably a fundamental twofold one, which is feathers

3290
03:21:22,717 --> 03:21:25,878
insulate you. They keep you warm. And most dinosaurs were,

3291
03:21:26,797 --> 03:21:30,778
it's an archaic term, but it's what most people know, warm-blooded. So they were

3292
03:21:30,898 --> 03:21:34,778
much more like us and birds. They had a stable high body temperature regardless

3293
03:21:34,838 --> 03:21:38,797
of the environmental conditions. So if you're burning a lot of calories to stay warm,

3294
03:21:38,858 --> 03:21:42,818
you want to kind of keep that heat, and feathers really help you do that.

3295
03:21:42,868 --> 03:21:45,778
And then the other thing is, yeah, the obvious thing is sexual selection

3296
03:21:45,838 --> 03:21:49,598
and communication. Feathers do stuff that scales can't. You can

3297
03:21:49,717 --> 03:21:53,297
shed them in winter and change color and come back as another one. That's

3298
03:21:53,398 --> 03:21:57,358
quite a handy trick. You can change them between juveniles and adults. So baby

3299
03:21:57,418 --> 03:22:01,387
birds have one type of feather, adults have a different one. We know of dinosaurs

3300
03:22:01,418 --> 03:22:04,918
that do that, where we've got adults and juveniles with different feather types

3301
03:22:04,958 --> 03:22:08,898
preserved in the fossils. Yeah, you can produce all kinds of weird colors

3302
03:22:08,938 --> 03:22:12,558
and displays. You can erect feathers. You can hold them up and fan them out

3303
03:22:12,578 --> 03:22:16,498
like a peacock or a pheasant. Whereas scales, you can't really do that, or

3304
03:22:16,538 --> 03:22:18,797
you need a huge amount of bone like Protoceratops. So

3305
03:22:19,858 --> 03:22:23,358
there's two good reasons that they would probably evolve, and

3306
03:22:23,998 --> 03:22:27,318
exactly pulling them apart or which is more important. And again-

3307
03:22:28,198 --> 03:22:31,637
they're probably bifunctional. As soon as you start making feathers and making

3308
03:22:31,678 --> 03:22:35,518
them more colorful, well, you're staying warmer. So that's an advantage. Or as soon

3309
03:22:35,558 --> 03:22:39,458
as you start making feathers to make them warmer, it probably won't be long until

3310
03:22:39,478 --> 03:22:41,848
someone evolves them to be a bit brighter red. And then we're back to, "Oh my God, red."

3311
03:22:42,118 --> 03:22:43,758
Right? But that's what's happening.

3312
03:22:43,778 --> 03:22:46,958
And then they're probably gonna push each other potentially.

3313
03:22:47,038 --> 03:22:50,818
- I mean, it is true that the birds went real crazy with the

3314
03:22:50,858 --> 03:22:52,827
feather and the colors and the prettiness and all that.

3315
03:22:52,827 --> 03:22:54,447
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. They absolutely do.

3316
03:22:54,447 --> 03:22:58,297
- I mean, maybe there's something about feathers that allows for that efficient

3317
03:22:59,058 --> 03:23:01,338
sort of diversification of fashion.

3318
03:23:01,378 --> 03:23:04,717
- I think, yeah, I think it gives them opportunities that...

3319
03:23:04,728 --> 03:23:08,008
...scales and solid structures simply don't.

3320
03:23:08,008 --> 03:23:08,508
- Yeah, it could be a material for it.

3321
03:23:08,508 --> 03:23:12,478
- The sole ability, I mean, I say peacocks and pheasants, they are at a massive

3322
03:23:12,518 --> 03:23:16,228
disadvantage, and males have got these extra plumes because they're so big and heavy.

3323
03:23:16,238 --> 03:23:20,018
Peacocks can barely fly. But the fact is, you can still kind of fold them up into a

3324
03:23:20,078 --> 03:23:24,068
fairly neat package and kind of hide if you really wanted to. Whereas if you're

3325
03:23:24,078 --> 03:23:27,887
something like a Triceratops, that billboard stuck on the top of your

3326
03:23:27,918 --> 03:23:31,458
head is not only enormous but also

3327
03:23:31,518 --> 03:23:33,758
bone. It's massive, it's heavy, and you've got to...

3328
03:23:33,778 --> 03:23:34,047
- No hiding.

3329
03:23:34,047 --> 03:23:37,878
- ...hide it around the whole year. Whereas peacocks at least can go, "Well, all the

3330
03:23:37,918 --> 03:23:41,518
girls have settled down on their nests now, I'm just going to get rid of all this extra

3331
03:23:41,598 --> 03:23:44,378
weight and dump it."

3332
03:23:44,438 --> 03:23:48,378
- Just looking at the entire history of Earth, what has studying

3333
03:23:48,387 --> 03:23:52,208
hundreds of millions of years of evolution, studying

3334
03:23:52,258 --> 03:23:56,047
this epic age of the dinosaurs, what has that done for your

3335
03:23:56,098 --> 03:23:59,998
appreciation of what makes Earth beautiful? Do you ever just

3336
03:24:00,058 --> 03:24:03,808
like sit back and think, "Holy shit, this is incredible, this whole thing"?

3337
03:24:03,808 --> 03:24:13,858
- Yeah, yeah, I do. But I guess maybe not much more so than I would anyway.

3338
03:24:14,297 --> 03:24:20,228
As in, I already... because again, I don't really think of

3339
03:24:20,238 --> 03:24:23,828
myself as a paleontologist in a lot of ways. Um,

3340
03:24:24,637 --> 03:24:27,038
it's not that I don't love my work, but it's,

3341
03:24:27,958 --> 03:24:31,768
I'm a biologist, and this is what I'm looking at. But I'm fascinated and

3342
03:24:31,768 --> 03:24:34,967
amazed by lungfish and flying frogs and

3343
03:24:35,938 --> 03:24:39,858
caterpillars and onychophorans and butterflies and a million and one

3344
03:24:39,958 --> 03:24:43,808
other hagfish and things that I think are cool and interesting and fascinating, and I could

3345
03:24:43,838 --> 03:24:48,038
happily read about them or watch them in a zoo or a documentary or

3346
03:24:49,338 --> 03:24:53,318
whatever it may be, almost every bit as much

3347
03:24:53,378 --> 03:24:56,678
as I would with dinosaurs. I probably appreciate the dinosaurs and pterosaurs

3348
03:24:57,418 --> 03:25:01,158
in a very different way because I have such a greater intimate knowledge of the

3349
03:25:01,198 --> 03:25:05,058
science, in a way that I try and read the lion literature because I'm really

3350
03:25:05,078 --> 03:25:08,797
interested in predation dynamics, but I can't keep up with it whilst doing all the other

3351
03:25:08,878 --> 03:25:09,448
stuff as well.

3352
03:25:09,448 --> 03:25:11,038
- Predation dynamics. Awesome.

3353
03:25:11,058 --> 03:25:14,817
- Well, right, so like the difference of what prey are they taking? Why? At what

3354
03:25:14,918 --> 03:25:18,588
percentage? What influences? How are they competing with leopards and...

3355
03:25:18,598 --> 03:25:20,818
- Wait, there's a body of literature on this?

3356
03:25:21,998 --> 03:25:25,948
- Yeah, people are studying lions, what they hunt, what they eat, and where they do it, and

3357
03:25:25,948 --> 03:25:29,458
there's a whole bunch of stuff on particularly the

3358
03:25:29,758 --> 03:25:33,148
African carnivores, because there are so many of them and they're so big, and their

3359
03:25:33,238 --> 03:25:37,217
populations aren't terrible compared to like

3360
03:25:37,238 --> 03:25:40,938
South America or North America or a lot of Asia, for example. Um,

3361
03:25:42,038 --> 03:25:45,778
But yeah, going back to your question, I can appreciate all of it. It's all

3362
03:25:45,838 --> 03:25:49,828
cool. Some of it is definitely more awesome than others. I work on some

3363
03:25:49,828 --> 03:25:53,498
of the giant pterosaurs, the ones with 10-meter wingspans.

3364
03:25:54,158 --> 03:25:57,878
Yeah, and it's, it's hard. My partner's family is from Uganda.

3365
03:25:57,938 --> 03:26:01,637
We were in Uganda last year. I was watching marabou storks

3366
03:26:01,698 --> 03:26:05,358
circle overhead and you're like, "Wow, these things are huge and amazing."

3367
03:26:05,378 --> 03:26:09,198
And then I'm like, "Their wingspan is about a fifth of the stuff I work on."

3368
03:26:09,238 --> 03:26:12,738
Their wingspan is about a fifth of the stuff I work on."

3369
03:26:12,818 --> 03:26:16,578
Actually, these are quite piddly in the grand scheme, you know,

3370
03:26:16,858 --> 03:26:20,738
this thing being like an airliner going overhead. And when you think about it

3371
03:26:20,797 --> 03:26:23,717
in that context, yeah, I mean,

3372
03:26:24,637 --> 03:26:28,578
because that's it with the... you know, I know people tend to be obsessed with size.

3373
03:26:28,618 --> 03:26:29,998
You kind of get it. Like blue whales are...

3374
03:26:30,228 --> 03:26:33,868
fundamentally cooler than smaller humpback whales, even if humpback whales are cool.

3375
03:26:33,898 --> 03:26:37,858
It's hard not to be impressed by Patagotitan or

3376
03:26:37,878 --> 03:26:41,618
Tyrannosaurus or Triceratops or Quetzalcoatlus or any of these

3377
03:26:41,658 --> 03:26:45,398
ultimate giants. There's a reason we love great white sharks, there's a reason we love

3378
03:26:45,438 --> 03:26:49,168
giant squid. There's a reason we love lions and grizzly bears and stuff.

3379
03:26:49,198 --> 03:26:53,130
But the dinosaurs do kind of do it better than anyone else

3380
03:26:53,350 --> 03:26:59,230
or, you know, marine reptiles and the flying reptiles, because it's just so insane.

3381
03:26:59,310 --> 03:27:01,210
- Yeah, both size and diversity.

3382
03:27:01,250 --> 03:27:04,550
- Yeah, and longevity as well. I mean, you look

3383
03:27:04,610 --> 03:27:08,450
at, you know, elephants have come and gone, and the whales,

3384
03:27:08,470 --> 03:27:11,790
okay, the whales have reached superlative sizes, but they're relatively new on the

3385
03:27:11,870 --> 03:27:15,030
scene. Could easily have gone extinct in the last

3386
03:27:15,090 --> 03:27:18,680
century. But yeah, you know, there's truly

3387
03:27:18,810 --> 03:27:22,550
titanic dinosaurs for at least 100 million years.

3388
03:27:22,570 --> 03:27:26,290
- It's a long time. It's hard sometimes, and as you said, it's very hard to

3389
03:27:26,350 --> 03:27:31,390
load in just how long that is. They really dominated Earth for a very long time.

3390
03:27:31,410 --> 03:27:35,370
- Yeah, and almost absolutely everywhere. There's a handful of places that we've

3391
03:27:35,430 --> 03:27:39,330
found where it appears that dinosaurs didn't really get in, and something else

3392
03:27:39,390 --> 03:27:43,150
kind of took over, you know, like Australia with the marsupials versus the

3393
03:27:43,910 --> 03:27:50,459
other eutherians. But yeah, fundamentally, it was a dinosaur planet for...

3394
03:27:51,730 --> 03:27:55,570
After the Triassic, less so the end of the Triassic when they're first getting going.

3395
03:27:55,609 --> 03:27:59,250
But yeah, Jurassic and Cretaceous, yeah, it's 140-ish million years

3396
03:27:59,430 --> 03:28:02,130
of, yeah, just absolute dominance.

3397
03:28:02,350 --> 03:28:06,220
- I think it's hilarious and just perfect that there's a giant

3398
03:28:06,630 --> 03:28:10,000
dinosaur head next to you, and you didn't mention it once during this conversation.

3399
03:28:10,580 --> 03:28:14,290
- Because I thought we'd get it. Well, I mean, giant is an absolute diddy one.

3400
03:28:14,370 --> 03:28:18,300
Yeah, so this is Protoceratops andrewsi. I've done loads

3401
03:28:18,330 --> 03:28:22,070
of work on Protoceratops. It's from Mongolia. This is a latest

3402
03:28:22,170 --> 03:28:26,090
so I've got a big head, and the big head's kind of like this, but I really

3403
03:28:26,130 --> 03:28:27,270
but I really couldn't fit it in the bag.

3404
03:28:27,310 --> 03:28:29,180
- So this is a to-scale juvenile.

3405
03:28:29,190 --> 03:28:33,170
- This is a cast. This is not original, but someone

3406
03:28:33,190 --> 03:28:36,750
has molded and copied it. So it's not even, it's not carved.

3407
03:28:36,810 --> 03:28:40,720
It's a cast and a mold taken. So yeah,

3408
03:28:40,730 --> 03:28:44,710
this is 100% accurate to the original specimen, or at least extraordinarily accurate to

3409
03:28:44,750 --> 03:28:45,890
the original specimen.

3410
03:28:45,900 --> 03:28:46,970
- So it's a young guy.

3411
03:28:47,010 --> 03:28:50,370
- Yeah. But yeah, at full size, it's going to be like

3412
03:28:50,830 --> 03:28:54,490
pig or sheep size, so big but not massive.

3413
03:28:55,030 --> 03:28:58,970
But I've got it partly because it's affordable, cause I can't afford to buy the

3414
03:28:59,030 --> 03:29:02,950
big skeletons and skulls. But I've done a huge amount of work on it, and in part

3415
03:29:03,010 --> 03:29:06,240
it goes back to those earlier conversations about

3416
03:29:06,270 --> 03:29:10,210
populations. If you really want to understand animals, you need

3417
03:29:10,270 --> 03:29:14,190
an understanding of what a real population and a

3418
03:29:14,310 --> 03:29:17,580
growth of what these animals looks like. And

3419
03:29:17,750 --> 03:29:21,710
Protoceratops is, I would argue, probably the only dinosaur

3420
03:29:21,730 --> 03:29:25,639
where we can really do that, or at least as close as possible as

3421
03:29:25,670 --> 03:29:29,110
you could get to any modern animal as an analog. We've

3422
03:29:29,130 --> 03:29:32,030
got well over 100 good skeletons, though

3423
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:35,670
probably only about 70 or 80 in really accessible

3424
03:29:35,710 --> 03:29:39,630
museums, but that's still a hell of a lot. We have everything from, "Here's a tiny baby

3425
03:29:39,650 --> 03:29:42,930
one." This is a really cheap and nasty 3D print I had

3426
03:29:42,990 --> 03:29:46,870
made but that's a hatchling sized one, or not much bigger than a

3427
03:29:46,910 --> 03:29:47,950
hatchling sized one,

3428
03:29:48,830 --> 03:29:52,670
all the way up to the big adults. We've now got embryos as well,

3429
03:29:52,730 --> 03:29:56,650
which we didn't have until about 10 years ago. So

3430
03:29:56,670 --> 03:30:00,380
we've got embryonic animals all the way up to big adults. They're all

3431
03:30:00,410 --> 03:30:03,260
pretty much from one place in

3432
03:30:03,490 --> 03:30:07,470
Mongolia. And they are, as far as we can tell, from a relatively

3433
03:30:07,490 --> 03:30:11,290
narrow window in time, only about 100,000 years, which in the grand scheme of things is very

3434
03:30:11,350 --> 03:30:11,699
close.

3435
03:30:13,210 --> 03:30:17,050
So you've got one population from one place from one time, with 100 animals from

3436
03:30:17,250 --> 03:30:18,810
embryos up to big adults.

3437
03:30:18,830 --> 03:30:19,290
- That's okay.

3438
03:30:19,350 --> 03:30:22,699
- So now if you want to look at, as I do, something like sexual

3439
03:30:22,770 --> 03:30:26,250
selection, and when does growth of the signal kick in and at what size,

3440
03:30:26,290 --> 03:30:30,180
and what evidence for dimorphism, well, suddenly you've got a population. You've got

3441
03:30:30,210 --> 03:30:33,930
something you can work with. And that's why

3442
03:30:33,950 --> 03:30:37,890
Protoceratops is so important, and I think way more important

3443
03:30:37,950 --> 03:30:41,890
than even a lot of my fellow paleontologists realize, and I genuinely think

3444
03:30:41,910 --> 03:30:45,590
we should be pouring a lot more research into them, because they can tell us

3445
03:30:45,670 --> 03:30:48,070
stuff that pretty much no other dinosaur can.

3446
03:30:48,110 --> 03:30:50,010
- Because you have the population data, so you can...

3447
03:30:50,180 --> 03:30:50,800
...you can ask them a lot more questions.

3448
03:30:50,800 --> 03:30:53,830
- And we can treat it as a population. So going way, way back to a

3449
03:30:53,870 --> 03:30:57,750
conversation about telling males and females apart, and I said the big

3450
03:30:57,790 --> 03:31:01,360
problem is population data, or at least the number of

3451
03:31:01,410 --> 03:31:05,050
specimens that you have when mostly you've only got one, two, or three.

3452
03:31:05,910 --> 03:31:09,490
I did a big study on this a few years ago on gharials, the really long-snouted

3453
03:31:09,570 --> 03:31:13,190
crocodilians from Nepal, India, and Pakistan with a giant

3454
03:31:13,310 --> 03:31:17,050
bulge on the end of the nose. And even though the males are all bigger than the

3455
03:31:17,070 --> 03:31:20,890
females, and the males all have this weird nose growth

3456
03:31:20,950 --> 03:31:24,870
that's mostly soft tissue, but they have a weird depression in the jaw, in the

3457
03:31:24,910 --> 03:31:28,870
end of the snout where the nostrils sit. We got a sample size

3458
03:31:28,910 --> 03:31:32,880
of something like about 110 animals. So these are very,

3459
03:31:32,950 --> 03:31:36,740
very rare animals, so we had to ransack every museum worldwide.

3460
03:31:36,770 --> 03:31:40,030
I was sending my students sending emails to huge numbers of

3461
03:31:40,070 --> 03:31:44,010
people, "Have you got one sitting in your collection lost? Can you get

3462
03:31:44,070 --> 03:31:47,990
it for us? Can you take these photos or these measurements? We can measure it." We put the dataset

3463
03:31:48,030 --> 03:31:51,890
together, and then we found that actually, apart from

3464
03:31:51,900 --> 03:31:55,590
the very biggest males, it's really hard to tell males and

3465
03:31:55,650 --> 03:31:59,510
females apart, and this actually really closely matched

3466
03:31:59,610 --> 03:32:03,010
some modeling data that I'd done with a colleague, Jordan Malin in Ottawa,

3467
03:32:03,770 --> 03:32:07,630
looking at this for alligators and trying to compare it

3468
03:32:07,670 --> 03:32:12,850
to dinosaurs. Because we talked about mutual sexual selection before,

3469
03:32:13,910 --> 03:32:17,410
neutral sexual selection in particular, you tend to get things that are extremely similar.

3470
03:32:17,450 --> 03:32:20,270
Males and females are very hard to tell apart. But there's

3471
03:32:20,350 --> 03:32:24,170
also a gradient, you know, all the way up to things like

3472
03:32:24,210 --> 03:32:27,230
peacocks, all the way down to you can't tell them apart, like parrots.

3473
03:32:28,390 --> 03:32:31,930
And for some features, when they take time to get growing,

3474
03:32:32,030 --> 03:32:35,690
or because dinosaurs grow over a very long window and are

3475
03:32:35,730 --> 03:32:39,600
sexually mature over a very long window, you run into the problem that

3476
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:42,630
a big female will look like a small male.

3477
03:32:43,150 --> 03:32:47,110
And we can't sex them, and lo and behold, this is what you get with the gharials.

3478
03:32:47,170 --> 03:32:50,970
The really big males are obvious because they're so much bigger and they've got this big depression in

3479
03:32:51,010 --> 03:32:57,998
the snout, but medium-sized and big females look like medium

3480
03:32:58,118 --> 03:33:04,798
sized, or smaller males and very small males. And so, yeah,

3481
03:33:04,878 --> 03:33:08,798
that's basically what we have with dinosaurs. Even with Protoceratops, where

3482
03:33:08,838 --> 03:33:10,638
we've got a dataset of like a hundred,

3483
03:33:12,358 --> 03:33:16,268
papers have come out saying there's very mild sexual dimorphism or there isn't

3484
03:33:16,278 --> 03:33:20,108
sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism could

3485
03:33:20,138 --> 03:33:24,028
be very strong in Protoceratops, but we can't find it because

3486
03:33:24,058 --> 03:33:27,958
we can't tell the males from the females because we haven't ID'd

3487
03:33:28,018 --> 03:33:30,578
enough through something like medullary bone.

3488
03:33:31,458 --> 03:33:35,358
And so you're in this horrible situation where, because going back to the T-Rex thing, is like

3489
03:33:35,458 --> 03:33:39,307
well, maybe it's mutual sexual selection and therefore they're cooperating, and

3490
03:33:39,358 --> 03:33:43,018
that would be cool. But also, maybe males are much bigger

3491
03:33:43,618 --> 03:33:46,008
but we can't tell because our dataset's too small.

3492
03:33:46,038 --> 03:33:46,468
- Oh, that's frustrating.

3493
03:33:46,498 --> 03:33:50,358
- In which case, they're not under mutual sexual selection, and we've got it all wrong.

3494
03:33:50,478 --> 03:33:53,698
Argh! It- It's maddening because it's so

3495
03:33:54,698 --> 03:33:58,598
if these were living animals, you'd just watch them or you'd just genotype them

3496
03:33:58,778 --> 03:34:02,678
or you'd sex them and you'd just know, and we just

3497
03:34:02,998 --> 03:34:06,958
don't. But on the other hand, we do have the mechanism to do it. There

3498
03:34:06,998 --> 03:34:10,718
are a handful of places where you get a bunch of Protoceratops together, where it's a mass

3499
03:34:10,778 --> 03:34:14,578
mortality site. Well, let's go and drill every bone, because if that's the

3500
03:34:14,598 --> 03:34:18,278
breeding season, we might find seven or eight females, and then the others are

3501
03:34:18,338 --> 03:34:22,318
pretty much by default males if we know it's the middle of the breeding season because all the

3502
03:34:22,358 --> 03:34:26,488
middle of the breeding season because all the others have medullary bone.

3503
03:34:27,198 --> 03:34:29,358
Now, let's analyze those two data sets.

3504
03:34:30,178 --> 03:34:32,298
And then maybe we'll see a difference and maybe we won't.

3505
03:34:32,338 --> 03:34:35,568
- I love how that frustration is a catalyst for figuring it out.

3506
03:34:35,678 --> 03:34:42,708
You're searching for a place, a piece of evidence that just shows you clearly.

3507
03:34:42,738 --> 03:34:43,658
- There are ways in.

3508
03:34:43,758 --> 03:34:44,408
- Yeah, there's ways in.

3509
03:34:44,418 --> 03:34:45,518
- This is the thing.

3510
03:34:45,538 --> 03:34:45,548
- There's always ways in.

3511
03:34:45,558 --> 03:34:49,538
- Yeah, there are ways in. And maybe we got to get lucky

3512
03:34:49,558 --> 03:34:50,358
because maybe it's not the breeding season.

3513
03:34:51,358 --> 03:34:55,178
Or maybe that was just a group of all males, and therefore

3514
03:34:55,198 --> 03:34:59,018
we're not going to get the signal we're looking for.

3515
03:34:59,078 --> 03:35:02,998
But there's enough of them, and they're common enough, and yet, still digging in

3516
03:35:03,038 --> 03:35:06,948
Mongolia, we keep finding new species. We keep finding new, cooler stuff.

3517
03:35:06,978 --> 03:35:10,858
But I'm like, "Can we dig up some more Protoceratops?"

3518
03:35:10,898 --> 03:35:14,358
Because actually, however cool these new things are,

3519
03:35:14,398 --> 03:35:17,618
genuinely, if you want to know what dinosaurs are and how they worked,

3520
03:35:17,658 --> 03:35:21,458
another hundred Protoceratops will actually probably tell us a lot more

3521
03:35:21,518 --> 03:35:26,298
than 50 new species, however cool 50 new species might be.

3522
03:35:26,308 --> 03:35:29,858
- Paleontology is an incredible discipline. It really is Sherlock Holmes

3523
03:35:29,898 --> 03:35:33,238
territory. This was an incredible

3524
03:35:33,338 --> 03:35:37,298
conversation. I'm really grateful for all the work you write,

3525
03:35:37,318 --> 03:35:38,198
that you put out there.

3526
03:35:38,218 --> 03:35:38,248
- Thank you.

3527
03:35:38,248 --> 03:35:42,218
- The podcast is incredible. I just, thank you for being you

3528
03:35:42,238 --> 03:35:43,258
and thank you for talking today.

3529
03:35:43,298 --> 03:35:46,838
- Well, thank you very much for having me. I hope I haven't worn out my

3530
03:35:46,878 --> 03:35:48,378
welcome with dinosaur...

3531
03:35:48,578 --> 03:35:48,588
- No.

3532
03:35:48,588 --> 03:35:48,868
- stories.

3533
03:35:48,868 --> 03:35:51,978
- Oh, we could talk for many more hours. Thank you, brother. Thank you, Dave.

3534
03:35:52,018 --> 03:35:53,578
- Thank you.

3535
03:35:53,618 --> 03:35:56,978
- Thank you for listening to this conversation with Dave Hone.
