1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,589
okay well

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,959
 welcome here i said

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,269
 i would try and talk a little bit about the history of physics that's particularly

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,750
 pertinent to me right now because for the last several months i've been very busily working on physics

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,980
 and actually

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,020
 have some super exciting

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,449
 things that i figured out that

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,210
 i'm hoping to talk about early next week

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,609
 so this consider to say a precursor

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,490
 of some of the things that i want to talk about next week about

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,488
 sort of progress in understanding fundamental physics

12
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:33,450
 what

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,110
 i wanted to do here today was to discuss a bit some

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,940
 of the some of the history of physics as a field

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,809
 and how we've kind of got to where we are now

16
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:45,860
 so

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,050
 um

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,969
 let's start at the beginning the question is

19
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,399
 how does the world come to be the way it is and in

20
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,660
 every culture there

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,940
 have been creation myths you know

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,079
 some of the more extreme ones

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,570
 you know the world is made on the back of a turtle and

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,229
 it's turtles all the way down and so on but there are there's always a creationist

25
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,510
 and when it was written it was written in the terms of explanations

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,040
 which were available

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,990
 at the time and some of these creation myths seem to us these days mere

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,500
 analogies allegories etc actually

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,310
 they often have quite interesting things to say

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,720
 if one sort of is prepared to translate them back into the sort of explanatory

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,270
 framework of the time but

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,290
 i suppose that you know if we look at ancient civilizations the ones about

33
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,070
 which we probably know the most in terms of their thinking are the babylonians

34
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,990
 and the greeks both of them had sort of important precursors to physics

35
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,280
 and we should start off talking about those so as far as the babylonians were concerned

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,759
 but first of all you know the babylonians kind of did

37
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,950
 one thing very right which was that they wrote down things on clay tablets and

38
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,990
 those clay tablets survived

39
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,719
 and like i even see if i actually can

40
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,399
 pull it out there

41
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,140
 we go yeah sample

42
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,060
 clay tablet there we go let's

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,230
 say that's a little babylonian tablets not a very exciting one it's just

44
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,930
 what i happen to have that's a it's a it's a barley contract

45
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,129
 about somebody delivering

46
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,980
 selling barley delivering it in different months and so on but this thing is about three

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,200
 four thousand years old and what's

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,280
 what's neat about abalone e'en things is that they've survived

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,269
 and you know other civilizations that wrote another media

50
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,640
 didn't survive so what do we know about what the babylonians

51
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,379
 did in terms of physics they had astrologers

52
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:45,000
 who would try

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,700
 and predict things they would try and predict you

54
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,459
 know where planets would be at a certain time in the future whether

55
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,939
 it would rain tomorrow who would win or lose a battle turns

56
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:00,000
 out they were right that there's a systematic way for scientists in effect to predict

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,750
 where plants will be there's not such a systematic way to predict weather rain tomorrow

58
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,569
 and there's not really a good scientific

59
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,879
 way to predict weather or a king will win or lose a battle

60
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,629
 so

61
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,400
 it's kind of interesting to see that in those times

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,010
 it wasn't play which of these would be will be the relevant

63
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,099
 thing but they studied a lot astronomical phenomena

64
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,239
 and they had essentially an empirical theory of lots

65
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,540
 of things about the motion of the moon and so on they had pretty elaborate mathematical calculations that gave

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,669
 essentially

67
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:34,530
 sort of formulas in terms of what would we would today call us that were primitive version

68
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,900
 of fourier analysis that

69
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,109
 describe the motion of the moon and they they would

70
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,449
 keep data about that over the course of hundreds

71
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:43,979
 and hundreds of years and that's

72
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,819
 how we know and some of the ancient astronomers knew things about eclipses

73
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,709
 and were able to measure all

74
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:56,099
 sorts of features of of the heavens based on the records that the babylonians had kept but

75
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,120
 the real tradition i think in babylon starting

76
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
 maybe four thousand years ago was

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,260
 this kind of empirical tradition of let's

78
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,810
 observe the heavens let's fit the data let's

79
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,760
 make what amounts to a mathematical formula

80
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,590
 for what we see and that's

81
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,239
 what we talk about now

82
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,779
 maybe they had more kind of conceptual things but they didn't those those were not recorded

83
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:25,620
 so in different tradition there was kind of the the the greek tradition of

84
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,550
 thinking about things

85
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,560
 which was very much more of a philosophical tradition very much more of a theoretical we

86
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,850
 can come up with ways to understand the world just by thinking about stuff

87
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:43,320
 and you know from early times like folks like pythagoras 500 ish bc

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,030
 the was thinking about sort of can we use numbers to explore everything

89
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,580
 and you didn't really make a distinction between numbers to understand musical harmony numbers

90
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,220
 to understand kind of the soul numbers

91
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,780
 to understand the physical world it was just like there's there's an abstract framework with

92
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,650
 which we can think about the world that was kind of the the meta thing that

93
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,830
 he was thinking about well then

94
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,450
 but particularly there pre-socratic philosophers 400 bc things like that people like democritus

95
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,889
 and so on they were very big on on let's just have a philosophical

96
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,250
 foundation for

97
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,530
 how the world is made and democritus

98
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,200
 famously thought about atoms automa

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,720
 as these indivisible units from

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,530
 which the world will be made i think the most important thing that we

101
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,660
 see from some of this early philosophical thinking about the world is this idea that yes

102
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,760
 you know the world can be made of lots of for example identical objects

103
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,330
 and there's kind of a formal theory of how the world might be made

104
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,020
 now

105
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,650
 you know there were thoughts that you know maybe the world is made out of lots

106
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,750
 of little platonic solids conveniently

107
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,300
 here there are a couple of convenient photonic

108
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,789
 solids in this gets made out of wood rather than out of that the

109
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:00,400
 stuff the universe might be made out of but none of those the idea

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,720
 that you know so

111
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,690
 one of the five platonic solids might represent water

112
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,430
 one might be fire things like this and that somehow there was a way to explain

113
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,410
 how the world was made in these kind of formal

114
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,919
 essentially mathematical terms

115
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,760
 well you

116
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,500
 know i suppose the lot

117
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,910
 of kind of the wisdom of the ancients was passed down to more modern times through

118
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,900
 the works of aristotle i mean i sort of view aristotle as the great cataloger

119
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,210
 i mean he would write lists of animals

120
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,020
 and plants

121
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,840
 and causes of things structures of arguments that were turned into logic

122
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,670
 and he also had kind of a a sort of a catalogue of the

123
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,050
 way the physical world works

124
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,450
 and had sort of explanations

125
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:47,950
 based on kind of pure philosophy of how to think about them the way the physical world works

126
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,330
 so

127
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,310
 that was kind of the tradition of the

128
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:01,010
 the things that it's like we can figure out the world just by thinking about it i

129
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,500
 i think that one of the more interesting examples of that

130
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,590
 person called lucretia roman

131
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,890
 person maybe 60 bc

132
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:18,380
 who wrote a book called on the nature of things fairly fairly general sounding title but

133
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,900
 um you know he was trying to understand

134
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,740
 how the world works and

135
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,020
 how one could put together a thing

136
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,390
 like the world and he had it kind of an interesting analogy

137
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,670
 which i liked very much he said maybe the world is put together from underlying

138
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,100
 elements like atoms in kind

139
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,480
 of the way that we might put together a sentence out of words with

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,860
 a certain grammatical structure

141
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,180
 so it's kind of a way of describing a formal structure from which through

142
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,330
 which the world can be built from sort of underlying elements

143
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,500
 and i think kind of you know i think he was kind of right about the

144
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,610
 way it would work he

145
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,730
 didn't have any of the tools he didn't have computers

146
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,300
 he didn't have all these kinds of things to

147
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,520
 to to work with him to think in terms of

148
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,740
 but that was kind of an interesting idea

149
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,020
 i mean of course he at the time there

150
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,760
 were little computers there were mechanical

151
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,970
 computers like the antikythera device

152
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,970
 which

153
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,100
 you know was found in a shipwreck

154
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,790
 it's this sort of lump of things with a bunch of cogs that's

155
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,190
 a surprisingly elaborate mechanical

156
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,850
 computer actually i think cicero mentions the existence of such a thing we

157
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,780
 don't know how common or not those were in the ancient world but in a sense this clockwork

158
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,550
 computer type idea did

159
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,870
 exist in ancient times at least we have one sample of its existence

160
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,140
 so it's sort of interesting that

161
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,140
 what

162
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,240
 might have emerged if kind of computation

163
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,900
 had become more widespread in those times i mean it's it's worth understanding that

164
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,910
 this notion of sort of the clockwork way of things working

165
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:50,910
 that different from the mathematical structure of the way the babylonians thought about kind of the their

166
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,830
 explanation of for the positions of planets and the moon and things like this well

167
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,120
 okay so so in terms of ancient times i mean another kind

168
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,800
 of tradition of ancient another sort of thing in ancient times with the development of mathematics

169
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,150
 and mathematics

170
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,950
 had been partly developed as

171
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,880
 sort of a practical thing in babylon for doing commerce

172
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,040
 for computing financial kinds of things for doing land surveying that was kind of the origins of arithmetic

173
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880
 and of geometry

174
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,000
 but it kind of reached a different

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,550
 level of kind of philosophical

176
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,290
 significance through the work of people like euclid maybe 300 bc euclid

177
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,810
 tried to axiom atomics

178
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,010
 he tried to say these are just things that we can say are true that

179
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,240
 we can then build up as a purely logical matter of deduction all

180
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,820
 of the things that we might know about for example geometry

181
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,430
 and it was completely unclear at the time to

182
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,390
 what extent like physics might be axia metal

183
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,950
 and to what extent the statement that euclid makes you know two parallel lines never meet to

184
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,730
 what extent that was a statement that was sort of a a fact

185
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,170
 that must be true about the world that was somehow in you know associated with physics

186
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,340
 or something that was merely a mathematical assertion from

187
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,060
 which you could prove things and it really took a long long time before

188
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,540
 sort of this this distinction between physics things

189
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,240
 that happen to be true about the world and mathematics

190
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,410
 things that are sort of deducible pure thought could really be distinguished

191
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,040
 and in fact i i would say that in very modern times we maybe are almost

192
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,320
 back to the point where we might be able to turn physics

193
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,880
 into a branch of mathematics again

194
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,970
 but that's for for the future but in a case the so

195
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,650
 you know this this tradition of kind of

196
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,250
 geometric reasoning

197
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,700
 and

198
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,860
 so on that euclid practiced

199
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,850
 and that very

200
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,530
 much fit him with a kind of greek tradition of let's figure out everything by pure thought now

201
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,680
 there was actual physics done like archimedes 250

202
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,020
 bc he did actual physics he computed things using mathematics

203
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,830
 but i think that he wasn't really in the let's understand

204
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,410
 and how the universe is really constructed

205
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,850
 he was more like

206
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,140
 well we kind of its kind of obvious in some sort of euclidean geometrical

207
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,900
 axiomatic way that such and such a thing is true about things in the world let's just compute

208
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,680
 how it works

209
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,400
 and that

210
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,330
 he was able to compute all kinds of things about volumes of solids and things like that and

211
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:24,540
 and connect some of those things to physics with things like you know his principle of displacement

212
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,340
 of volume by you know figuring out is this gold or not by by

213
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,270
 figuring out the density by knowing that things displace their own volume of something like water

214
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,270
 okay

215
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,650
 so the

216
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,550
 into in terms of other things that

217
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,810
 sort of happened in the ancient world by

218
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,810
 the time one was approaching

219
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,340
 sort of zero ad

220
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:55,560
 there were people like cabacas´s early astronomer who made a very nice star catalog

221
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,270
 and made lots of observations and

222
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,170
 so on by the time ptolemy 120 ad ish was

223
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,390
 around ptolemy kind of put together all these observations into this think of the almagest which

224
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,730
 for many many years was kind of the standard of

225
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,940
 how astronomy worked and the almagest was in

226
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,720
 a sense not really work of physics it was a work of kind of euclidian style mathematics applied

227
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,520
 to observations of astronomy

228
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,750
 and it was something

229
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,990
 where in the end he had this idea of epicycles

230
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,480
 which were

231
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,740
 essentially came from the babylonian tradition of let's let's make something

232
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,900
 where we can work

233
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,390
 out the motions of planets and things in his case by lots of kind of lots of spheres

234
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,990
 kind of rolling around on each other with certain particular sizes

235
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:52,080
 and particular detailed elaborate structures that were essentially a representation of mathematical formulas

236
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,400
 and i think that's most of what somebody like ptolemy really

237
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
 cared about was just the mathematical

238
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,360
 formulas that allowed you to predict things rather

239
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,220
 than the interpretation in terms of

240
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,630
 you know spheres rolling on each other which i i'm not sure how much that

241
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,560
 was really thought about or

242
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,280
 how much anybody cared about that interpretation i think it was much more the practical

243
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,980
 let's see how we can make astronomical predictions

244
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,980
 well

245
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,309
 okay

246
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,410
 so so then

247
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,220
 after that i mean for a long long time the works of hipparchus ptolemy

248
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,600
 and so on most

249
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,899
 of the works of the pockets i think were lost so it was really ptolemy's almagest that

250
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:29,689
 was kind of the standard for astronomy

251
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:32,629
 / physics for more

252
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:34,129
 than a thousand years it

253
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:38,269
 finally got kind of people start cleaning it up a person called regiomontanus was

254
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:44,119
 was big on sort of doing a big cleanup of of the sort of post you

255
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,670
 know could one make the next step in physics

256
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,259
 or astronomy after ptolemy

257
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,929
 and really you

258
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:57,220
 know one of the significant next steps was copernicus all the way in 1514 i think

259
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,600
 where

260
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,860
 copernicus was kind of working in the ptolemaic british tradition in terms of epicycles

261
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,629
 and you know you can understand

262
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:08,839
 that these sort of things roll on these things and you can understand

263
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,230
 the motions of planets that way and so on and you realized well actually it's

264
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,809
 a lot simpler you can you can make a sort of technical

265
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:16,579
 change in the way things work

266
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,259
 and you can make it a lot simpler

267
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,799
 if you don't imagine that

268
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,629
 the sun goes around the earth doesn't

269
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,879
 really matter to the mathematics whether

270
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,639
 the sun goes around the earth or the earth goes around the sun but

271
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,899
 you can avoid some technical

272
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,610
 details if you assume

273
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,290
 that the sun is at the center

274
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,040
 and the earth is going round isn't the other planets going around those

275
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
 and

276
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,129
 so he kind of introduced that as largely a technical innovation very late in his life

277
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,449
 and i think

278
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:47,809
 what was interesting in a sense to me about that is that

279
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:48,589
 yes

280
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,240
 it was a technical innovation didn't

281
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,170
 even give better results

282
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,410
 didn't get better results than ptolemy actually i think he gave worse results than ptolemies

283
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,110
 way of setting things up

284
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:03,709
 but in a sense there was a a certain it started kind of a shockwave of a realization that

285
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:07,819
 what you think is true like you think the earth is stationary

286
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:11,089
 and stuff is moving around you might not be true you

287
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,939
 might be able to do something that is kind of a scientific thing

288
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:16,129
 and work out something

289
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,259
 which is completely another obvious to our senses

290
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,809
 and i think that was kind of the at

291
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:24,199
 a meta level the really significant feature of what copernicus did and

292
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:31,030
 in fact there was sort of much more philosophical runoff from what copernicus did then there was scientific

293
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:37,310
 kind of developments of what he did that came rather slowly the philosophical implications i think were

294
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,640
 in many ways much bigger they were like the you know science

295
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,900
 really knows what it's talking about

296
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,740
 and might it might be different than what you can perceive with your senses

297
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,190
 but science is going to be right and your senses are going to be wrong and

298
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,630
 that's kind of a tradition

299
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,220
 that has existed pretty

300
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,890
 much to the present day and has been sort of amplified

301
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,450
 over time i think

302
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,640
 there's some problems with that tradition actually and

303
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,360
 um

304
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,400
 which we may talk about towards the end here well anyway

305
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,960
 so

306
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,570
 after copernicus

307
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,040
 there was well

308
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,710
 i suppose the next the next sort of really big set

309
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,990
 of things that started happening were things that galileo was doing late 1500s you

310
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,080
 know really galileo's i think big

311
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,840
 initial contribution was the idea of yeah

312
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,670
 you can really use math to

313
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,370
 talk about physical kinds of things so for example the discovery that a parabola might

314
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,040
 be relevant for the motion of a projectile the

315
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,670
 the realization that they're things like things that are really mathy

316
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,080
 i mean things like parabolas had been have been discovered as algebra well

317
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,470
 they did they'd had could have precursors in in antiquity

318
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,820
 but they'd really sort of come to the fore when algebra started getting developed in the 1400s

319
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,810
 and so on um the i think the

320
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,810
 so

321
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,680
 so kind of the the the next big step was

322
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,950
 yes mathematics could sort of be directly

323
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,900
 and trained with

324
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:12,290
 with physics by the way it had already been known in antiquity that in optics kind

325
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:18,650
 of the the theory of kind of optics is very close to geometry it's all about lines

326
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,959
 and angles and things like this and even euclid for example had actually written a book about optics

327
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,640
 which is lost

328
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
 and it

329
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,680
 was it was something considered to be sort of almost a branch of mathematics so to speak

330
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,630
 so there had been tradition there of sort of mathematical things applied to ideas like optics

331
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,980
 but when it came to mechanics that hadn't really been been such a tradition

332
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,820
 and galileo was kind of the one who really really started pushing that well then the

333
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,429
 sort of the big the big surprise was 1608 when

334
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,640
 when galileo you know the telescope had just been invented

335
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,750
 and galileo

336
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,200
 sort of found out about it and improved it there's

337
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,950
 sort of a possibly apocryphal story that galileo had galileo

338
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,780
 who was kind of a rather

339
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,710
 pugnacious fellow and and quite an activist

340
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,679
 but he was also he got himself a lot lots of kinds of trouble

341
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:14,480
 but but there's a perhaps apocryphal

342
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,950
 story that he had sold

343
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,600
 the rights to his version of the telescope to the merchants of venice because

344
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,280
 they really wanted to go up that that

345
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,690
 big tower in the middle of venice that's

346
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,429
 still there and figure

347
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:26,990
 out you know whose ship be

348
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,840
 the first person to figure out whose ship had come over the you

349
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,120
 know whether whether a particular ship was was

350
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,530
 going to come home or not and look out at the horizon and having

351
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,010
 a telescope to be able to do that was really a big advantage it kind of has has

352
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,390
 a reminiscence of modern times with high-frequency trading

353
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,100
 and so on where it's you know get a better faster fiber-optic cable to know what's

354
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,830
 happening in london if you're in new york and things like this but back

355
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,510
 in those days that was you

356
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,850
 know the merchants of venice with galileo telescope

357
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,530
 running up that that

358
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,950
 big tower in the middle of venice and so on but anyway so the apocryphal

359
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,490
 story perhaps was that galileo had sold the exclusive

360
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,960
 rights to terrestrial uses of the telescope to the merchants of venice so

361
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,890
 he had no choice but to then try using it for something different point

362
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,700
 the telescope to the side sky those rights were not used were

363
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,820
 not will not sold and in 1608 that's

364
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,799
 what he did and probably

365
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,820
 the most dramatic thing he discovered was the moons of jupiter why

366
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,460
 was it dramatic to discover the moons of jupiter well

367
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,350
 because you know it had been claimed by copernicus

368
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,799
 and

369
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,640
 so on that you know the earth was going around the sun things like that this

370
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,309
 was kind of like a miniature solar system that

371
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,880
 was operating around jupiter and it kind of also gave

372
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,260
 the sense that some of these kind of principles of physics that

373
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,240
 we kind of had an idea applied

374
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,809
 and the terrestrial domain also would apply to things in the heavens

375
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,500
 and things that were like things orbiting jupiter

376
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,580
 and so on so it was sort of a big a big realization that

377
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,669
 that these kinds of

378
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:02,840
 essentially mathematical

379
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,260
 type principles that had been that

380
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,510
 was starting to be applied to mechanics in a terrestrial domain could also apply to mechanics

381
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,320
 everywhere else and it kind of was the it started to speak to kind of the universality

382
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,909
 of physics across

383
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:19,700
 the whole universe that it really wasn't any different what

384
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,070
 was going on in the heavens than what was going on on earth and

385
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,260
 and so on and that kind of started

386
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,330
 a chain of thinking that i guess we could say led to most modern mathematical science

387
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,580
 and a lot of modern technology and engineering and

388
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,519
 so on so anyway that was that was the sort of a big moment for for science

389
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,529
 um

390
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,179
 later on galileo started having

391
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:45,649
 oh i don't know principles of describing science

392
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:49,730
 and important bombers but these days called galilean invariance the

393
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,059
 idea that it's really no different if you're stationary

394
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,519
 or if you're traveling at a certain speed the

395
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,470
 laws of physics always look the same that was important

396
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,690
 if you wanted to describe look you

397
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,750
 know the earth doesn't have to be stationary the earth can just be moving at constant

398
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,029
 speed and it will seem like everything is the same as

399
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:06,019
 if it was stationary

400
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:09,080
 and that's that's why we can't tell with our sensors that

401
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,159
 the earth is moving around the sun rather than the other way around well

402
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:16,429
 okay once the moons of jupiter were discovered all

403
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:22,750
 kinds of things for example the fact that the speed of light was not infinite was discovered by

404
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,909
 1670 1680

405
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,860
 by making observations on the moons of jupiter

406
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,340
 so it was already known that light didn't travel at infinite speed i'm not sure but

407
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,570
 any great significance was

408
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,559
 put on that it

409
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,860
 was known of course that sound didn't travel at an inference speed it

410
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,399
 was came clear that light travelled much faster than sound but

411
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,440
 okay

412
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,309
 well meanwhile

413
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:49,960
 there was there was all sorts of question about sort of the nature of light for instance like

414
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,909
 snell's law which is the law that determines

415
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:55,039
 how refraction

416
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,990
 works when you when you have a light ray that goes from like air to to to

417
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,700
 water that that law of that sort of trigonometric law of of

418
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,230
 the angle that the light ray will take snell's law that was in 1620

419
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,169
 and then

420
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:13,999
 through the 1600s there

421
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,330
 were a bunch of kind of what we might say the obvious linear

422
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,519
 laws of physics that got discovered

423
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,980
 so for example boyle's law for gases mid 1600s hookes

424
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:32,029
 law for springs that the the force on the extension of a spring is linearly proportional to to

425
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:37,129
 how much you extend it there was like 16 sixties i think um then

426
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:41,480
 the friction law or the law of friction that says that

427
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,850
 the the frictional force is proportional to a constant that depends on the material times

428
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,249
 the normal force times the amount of force

429
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:51,470
 that that pushes the thing down onto

430
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,850
 the surface and that

431
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,210
 was kind of a late 1600s thing well i think leonardo davinci

432
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,799
 already had some ideas

433
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:03,409
 about how friction worked i mean it's kind of interesting that all those laws we understand boyle's

434
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:05,179
 gas law very well now we

435
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:07,789
 understand hookes law for springs very well now the

436
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:11,240
 law of friction we actually still don't understand that well it's

437
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,860
 still kind of mysterious exactly

438
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,249
 how

439
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:14,450
 and why that works and

440
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:14,990
 and

441
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,929
 so on so it's kind of interesting that these things that get discovered

442
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,730
 just like when the babylonians couldn't

443
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,720
 figure out you know which will be easier to predict the motion of planets whether

444
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,249
 it would rain tomorrow it's

445
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:29,029
 sometimes you have to have a big conceptual framework before it becomes clear

446
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,419
 what

447
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,070
 what is easy to understand

448
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,549
 and what is not easy to understand

449
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:34,549
 well

450
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,879
 okay

451
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:36,710
 so so one

452
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,080
 thing had been discovered even in antiquity was various electrical phenomena static

453
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,570
 electricity was no and there

454
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:51,049
 was also various magnetic magnetic materials were no and kind of curiosities no

455
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:55,610
 no great significance to them people then volta

456
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:01,580
 kind of started understanding that for example the you know the muscles were somehow electrical

457
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,360
 and then

458
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,320
 it became sort of it started to get more they started to be more and more interest in

459
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,399
 kind of what is electricity coulomb's law was

460
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:18,580
 late 1700s it was discovered that the force of attraction between charged objects is the

461
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,790
 is proportional to the inverse

462
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:27,440
 one over the the distance squared of the the between the objects

463
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
 and then

464
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
 so

465
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:37,400
 you know sort of slow progress on electricity magnetism things like that um i guess

466
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,540
 by this point let's see we're hitting about the 1800s

467
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,410
 so

468
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,310
 what happened then well let's see there was some

469
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,310
 so

470
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:52,400
 beginning of the 1800s people like thomas young had his wave theory for light and then as

471
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,870
 soon as that came in people

472
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,770
 were able to start

473
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,000
 doing all kinds of calculations i

474
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,930
 mean it had been very unclear

475
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:01,850
 what light was people knew about about

476
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,070
 interference of light the the for example newton's

477
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,710
 rings you know when you see a layer

478
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,950
 of oil you'll see these kind of light and dark rings

479
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,280
 and

480
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,670
 so on that are associated with the the we

481
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,340
 now know are associated with the thickness of the oil and

482
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,180
 how

483
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,420
 many wavelengths of light it corresponds to things like that i'm

484
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,280
 bill anyway there were they were kind of phenomena

485
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,890
 like that that had been seen and they were also phenomena

486
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,080
 that made it look like light was just

487
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,130
 a bunch of corpuscles

488
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,450
 a bunch of particles that

489
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,880
 would just go in straight lines kind of like a big big

490
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,680
 stream of these things and so

491
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,120
 i mean that we

492
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,870
 now know that there's sort of a duality between this light as photons

493
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,910
 and lightest waves thing

494
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,210
 but that didn't come until they until the 1900s

495
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,830
 but back in 1800

496
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,950
 pound 1801 i think thomas

497
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,580
 young was talking about you know the wave theory of light

498
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,980
 and that became a sort of more formal thing

499
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,620
 and within a decade or so people

500
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,710
 were able to do all kinds of elaborate calculations of diffraction

501
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,690
 and light and interference

502
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,750
 and so on it became kind of a thing that had been mathematics

503
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:14,440
 i mean it's it's worth mentioning that term in

504
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
 in

505
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,360
 oh

506
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,120
 yeah we forgot an absolutely critical piece of history

507
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,820
 which i i'm i'm shocked that i forgot

508
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,320
 because it's one of my kind of favorites

509
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,070
 and i'm just

510
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:30,740
 um i'm i was i was talking about kind of things in the 1600s

511
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,210
 and these kind of empirical laws of

512
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,269
 of

513
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:37,269
 of

514
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,279
 how things work before

515
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,999
 we get to the 1700s before we get to electricity before

516
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,240
 we get to light and so on we have to talk about newton

517
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,369
 and we have to talk about the the things that newton did actually the main things

518
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:55,960
 his big year was 1665

519
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,649
 which happened to be the year that cambridge university was closed

520
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:00,610
 because of the plague

521
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:07,299
 and newton went and hung out at his sort of ancestral home in lincolnshire

522
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:09,990
 i think um and ah

523
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,460
 and was thinking about stuff

524
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,659
 and came up with two pretty good ideas one was his law of gravity

525
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:17,889
 and the other was calculus

526
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:18,850
 um

527
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:25,090
 he didn't publish those things until 1687 his big book principia mathematica i

528
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,710
 mean it's the sort

529
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,019
 of the title of the book already tells you kind of something of the philosophical implications

530
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:36,220
 the title the book of the full title is translated into english mathematical

531
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,919
 principles of natural philosophy

532
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,450
 so sort of pre newton the the general thinking about

533
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,730
 how one thought about nature was

534
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,070
 as kind of a branch of philosophy as

535
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,169
 a natural philosophy the the the the basic thinking had been one

536
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:57,309
 just figures out how nature works by pure thought just like how aristotle

537
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,809
 had done it just like how democritus

538
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,090
 had done it and so on and but

539
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:06,159
 what newton was saying was no actually there are mathematical principles of natural philosophy now

540
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,320
 galileo had had some precursors to this but newton was kind of the full fledged you

541
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,499
 can figure out how the world works using mathematical principles

542
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:14,830
 and

543
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,869
 so he developed some mathematical principles particularly his laws of motion for a second

544
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:22,899
 and third law for example the you

545
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:25,330
 know the first law an object remains

546
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,200
 an object that isn't acted on by a force just remains in in motion

547
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,990
 in the same way it's been moving before at

548
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,789
 the second law it's

549
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:36,399
 you know force as mass times acceleration and

550
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,570
 so on now

551
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,830
 you know you might say in modern

552
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,090
 times the first law is obvious

553
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,110
 we know if you set

554
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,639
 something in motion it'll

555
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:47,230
 and you don't act on it by a force you know it's a it's a something

556
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:52,330
 on a on their table on a you know puck on an ice rink something like this you

557
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,810
 set it in motion we'll just keep going unless acted on by a force that

558
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,940
 seems really obvious to us today it's

559
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,020
 a lot less obvious

560
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,210
 if you don't have things

561
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,180
 where friction has been reduced to almost zero if you

562
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,970
 were dealing with kind of well we just you

563
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,920
 know you're pushing something through mud or

564
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,350
 you're just rolling something on the ground it's

565
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,380
 far from obvious that it will keep going

566
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,980
 and with

567
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,070
 if and that if a force isn't acting on it because actually a force

568
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,100
 is usually acting on it it's the force of friction and

569
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,710
 so this was a the idea that there was this sort of perfect

570
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,380
 version of this where the thing will just keep going

571
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,370
 and without

572
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,250
 if there's no force acts on it wasn't self-evidently

573
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,560
 obvious it was a it was really a mathematical

574
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,480
 idealization that was significant

575
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,020
 and that was newton's first law well

576
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,620
 newton then with his forces mass times acceleration and

577
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,070
 so on that immediately started asking

578
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,630
 well can you actually compute given

579
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,450
 that you know that forces equal the mass times acceleration what

580
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,910
 are the forces that act on things so

581
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,200
 one very important force that newton thought about when you think about astronomy was

582
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,130
 the force of gravity

583
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,050
 and then he had to work out well what is the force that gravity exerts

584
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,610
 and that's when he came up with his inverse square law of gravity this

585
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,610
 is universal law of gravity that between any two

586
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,720
 objects the force of gravity is the mass of one object times

587
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,640
 the mass of the other object divided

588
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,740
 by the square of distance between them all multiplied by some universal constant we

589
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,780
 now call capital g the

590
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,820
 so that was his kind of idea

591
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,290
 and his idea was that was gonna be the law of gravity that applied to everything whether

592
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,040
 it was the moons of jupiter whether it was the sun around the earth whether

593
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,660
 it was a comet in the solar

594
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,120
 system all these things the law of gravity would apply

595
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,030
 and

596
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,740
 the

597
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:47,280
 you know i've realized i i forgot another important term piece of this story

598
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,050
 which was let

599
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,340
 me i'm sorry to backtrack

600
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,760
 here but i just want to fill in one more one more piece which

601
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,790
 was around the time that galileo was was observing the moons of jupiter the

602
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,630
 another

603
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,180
 another important a little bit before then actually another important development was was kepler

604
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,850
 kepler was

605
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,730
 actually a very capable mathematician who

606
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,500
 had a completely wacky theory of the solar system it was kind of a an evolved

607
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,720
 version of the sort of copernican meets ptolemaic idea

608
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,420
 and his idea actually was to use the platonic solids as a representation of the of

609
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,610
 the motions of planets and to

610
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,950
 have these sort of concentric

611
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,760
 concentric platonic solids

612
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:44,980
 which happened by the mathematics the mathematical results on the on the distances of platonic solids

613
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,190
 if you threw it in estill the platonic solids inside each other it

614
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,020
 so happens that the results you would get for the ratios of their sizes agreed

615
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,730
 rather well with the known planets which went out to saturn at the time in

616
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,500
 in the solar system so

617
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,610
 so kepler was like we've derived this from mathematics we've got from mathematics we have derived

618
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,610
 what

619
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,180
 how

620
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,080
 the solar system works

621
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,520
 when the moons of jupiter were discovered

622
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,610
 he had to start having rhombic polyhedra

623
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,090
 as the way to describe those and it all got kind of kind of wacky but

624
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:20,350
 but kepler was even though his underlying theory was complete nonsense the

625
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,520
 the mathematics that he did was perfectly good and the mathematics he did both on polyhedra

626
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,660
 and more importantly

627
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,840
 the mathematics he did and realizing that the orbits of planets could

628
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,100
 be represented as ellipses

629
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,920
 and coming up with kepler's laws which

630
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,520
 were essentially empirical laws for the motion of planets derive

631
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:41,350
 from the mathematics of ellipses i had sort of forgotten to mention that i'm sorry that

632
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,220
 was something that that newton was then was

633
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,780
 then able to leverage because

634
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,870
 what newton did was to say okay given this universal law of gravity

635
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,150
 and these laws of motion then

636
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,020
 it's just a matter of mathematics to derive kepler's

637
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,470
 result that the motion of planets should be ellipses

638
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,430
 and the the just a matter of mathematics required

639
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:10,150
 some mathematical sophistication and that mathematical sophistication was the was the what originated calculus

640
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,910
 what caused newton to invent invent calculus was

641
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:19,059
 the attempt to work out given that force is equal to mass times acceleration acceleration is the

642
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:21,760
 rate of change of the rate of change of position how

643
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,549
 do you work out what the position is given that okay

644
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,350
 you use calculus to do that and

645
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,230
 so he had to invent the way to do that

646
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,610
 so that was 1687

647
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:30,970
 and

648
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,190
 and kind of what emerged from

649
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:36,070
 what newton did was some you

650
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,280
 could then just use newton's law of gravitation newton's

651
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,470
 laws of motion and calculus to compute all kinds of things one

652
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,140
 thing that was interesting was that you could compute stuff

653
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,090
 but it wasn't easy and that

654
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,870
 was kind of a new thing because it had tended to be the case that the things that

655
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,409
 one could actually compute

656
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:59,860
 from sort of first principles in a sense were kind of easy to compute

657
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,570
 i mean although the babylonians

658
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,190
 and the ptolemy

659
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,990
 and so on have had pretty elaborate empirical

660
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,859
 formulas the things were it looked it felt like you were starting from first principles

661
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:11,409
 had always been easy to compute actually

662
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:15,129
 it's sort of an interesting thing when newton was trying to compute the position of the

663
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:16,780
 motion of the moon it's

664
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,300
 kind of a kind of a good example and a lesson

665
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,600
 for those of us who do theoretical science newton

666
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,969
 had got all of his whole universal law of gravitation

667
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:28,469
 and this and that and then he tried to compute the motion of the moon

668
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:32,109
 and he has this long chapter of his principia

669
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:36,730
 where he computes it and the last sentence says but

670
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,760
 the apse of the moon is twice as great in

671
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,469
 other words newton got the wrong answer by a factor of two so you

672
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:49,449
 know one might be taught for in sort of the bacon ian tradition of experimental

673
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:53,560
 science if the experiment disagrees with your theory abandoned the theory

674
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,090
 but one

675
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,119
 thing that i've learnt in in my efforts of doing science when

676
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:01,900
 the stuff when the theory is strong enough when the theory has enough

677
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,080
 things going for it and has enough of a sort of aesthetic

678
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,740
 integrity to it keep going with the theory sometimes

679
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,359
 the experiments will turn out to be wrong

680
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,380
 or sometimes there's something wrong with the chain of deduction from the theory to

681
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,540
 the prediction for the experiments in the case of newton the problem was with the chain of deduction computing

682
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,010
 the three-body problem the problem of the earth moon and sun all having

683
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,110
 gravitational attraction to each other that's a very difficult mathematical problem

684
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,420
 in fact we now know that it isn't soluble

685
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,630
 in some sense in terms of sort of algebraic functions

686
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,840
 and things like this it's a it's a problem in which in

687
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,280
 which chaotic

688
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,270
 phenomena happen it's a very elaborate problem that's the problem where i think that

689
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,490
 it will turn out you can make any computation

690
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,410
 you can have a three body system that

691
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,590
 does any computation you want in other words the three body system is as sophisticated as any computation

692
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,230
 so the

693
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,790
 but anyway newton was

694
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,440
 able to work out sort

695
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,730
 of almost work out the motion of the moon other people later on steadily

696
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,950
 tightened that up by around 1901

697
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,850
 had really pretty good calculations of the motion of the moon one

698
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,710
 gets to test those every time there's a total eclipse it's a rather sensitive prediction of exactly

699
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,450
 where the moon is like

700
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,620
 when the most recent total

701
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,680
 solar eclipse that was visible from the us a couple years ago we

702
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,750
 were able to use sort of modern techniques to predict to the second when

703
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,520
 the when the path of totality would would

704
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,920
 hit in any particular point in

705
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,090
 on its path and i was a little bit concerned whether that would actually be correct

706
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,140
 because it involved all kinds of elaborate things including relativistic corrections

707
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,950
 and like kind of stuff

708
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,780
 so we were we had a website

709
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,260
 which lots of people used to work out when

710
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,960
 eclipse would arrive i was a little worried whether it would actually work correctly

711
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,420
 we had a person who

712
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,660
 worked at our company who happened to be on the the very western

713
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,410
 extremity of the of the us where the way they clips for sort of first touched

714
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:58,830
 and

715
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,400
 so

716
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,810
 it was was good to verify

717
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,710
 that yes at least when the eclipse first around it was indeed correct but

718
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,210
 in a case um you

719
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,050
 know back back to newton one of these sort of interesting there you

720
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:16,260
 can realized this thing about the fact that you know you can have a calculation that is

721
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,960
 where you can specify the rules for the calculation

722
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,370
 but it may be really hard to actually calculate

723
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,920
 what happens so he has a nice passage

724
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,150
 where he talks about some way he's very concerned about the the motion of the planets

725
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,580
 and things he says we don't know how the planets

726
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,230
 kind of originated in their motion and

727
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,260
 and that's kind of the hand of god to put them where they start

728
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,920
 but once they have started then we can in principle calculate

729
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,900
 where they will where they will end up but

730
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,410
 he says but to know from planets with all of their mutual effects on each other

731
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,410
 where

732
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,850
 they'll end up exceeds

733
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,170
 if i'm not mistaken he said the force of any human mind so

734
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,710
 in other words he was he was recognizing the fact that there was a computational

735
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:02,330
 difficulty in in working out the consequences of the theory that he developed well in practice

736
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,840
 lots of people

737
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
 worked

738
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,770
 on it and through the course of the 1700s into the 1800s there

739
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,770
 was more and more sophistication in the use of essentially

740
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,840
 calculus to do mechanical calculations

741
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:20,480
 i think in in ai was used both in terms of astronomical

742
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,810
 calculations celestial mechanics and also terrestrial

743
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,240
 calculations i think for some reason particularly

744
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,880
 british tradition was studying

745
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,690
 the motion of tops

746
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,550
 and these bizarre these

747
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:36,260
 the pole hoed and the hubble hood and all these all these weird phenomena about how

748
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,450
 tops move that was sort of a became

749
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,470
 i think a particularly british mathematical physics tradition an obsession

750
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,040
 but - in any case there was a increasing level of sophistication of

751
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,660
 what could be worked out using calculus

752
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,530
 and using

753
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,010
 essentially newtonian mechanics ideas

754
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:56,540
 and that was kind of the big development of the 1700s - to the early 1800s

755
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,900
 and i might say that that you

756
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,630
 know at the time of newton if you'd ask somebody

757
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,810
 what is the world fundamentally made of probably

758
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,590
 the answer that you would have got is it's made of corpuscles don't

759
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,740
 really know what those are but those are a little bit maybe like democratizes

760
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,500
 atoms we don't even know what they are um they're

761
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,300
 - somehow bound together by forces

762
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,260
 and post newton it was like well maybe they're bound together by gravitational forces

763
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,320
 but that was kind of the the meta idea for

764
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,060
 what the world might be made of although it

765
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,270
 wasn't something that was really studied in great and tremendous detail

766
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,580
 um when

767
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,680
 electrical stuff started becoming

768
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,710
 sort of a big thing in the 1800s i think

769
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,370
 people were more tended to say that there were electrical forces that were holding

770
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,030
 things together but sort of the the the thing of the 1800s

771
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:51,980
 in addition to sort of very elaborate development of of theories that were spin-offs of newton's mechanics

772
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,970
 and calculus

773
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,660
 i mean they're the main spin-offs that develops were

774
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,549
 solid mechanics and fluid mechanics

775
00:39:57,549 --> 00:39:59,079
 the theory of stresses

776
00:39:59,079 --> 00:39:59,650
 and solids

777
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,829
 and the theory of the flow of fluids stresses

778
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:04,630
 and solids turns out to be a much easier problem

779
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,410
 the flow of fluids the flow of fluids has this very complicated

780
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,960
 issue of fluid turbulence when a fluid flows rapidly

781
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,410
 a fluid is flowing slowly just sort of slides around objects

782
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,819
 and it does it in a laminar smooth layered way

783
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:22,539
 but when it moves quickly you get this kind of random turbulence that develops

784
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:23,890
 and to

785
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,970
 find a theory of turbulence is still something that hasn't been done i've tried to make some contributions

786
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,010
 to that myself and i think i understand

787
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,960
 now sort of the the the immediate answer to the question why is there randomness

788
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,630
 and turbulence i think we can now answer that question

789
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:44,319
 but in the in the 1800s as the theory of fluids was developing turbulence

790
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,369
 was sort of off the table

791
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:51,010
 it was just working out the the partial differential equations things like the navier-stokes equations that

792
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,380
 described sort of the the

793
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:59,140
 parts of fluid flow that you could work out using by solving differential equations using calculus

794
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,430
 and so on so

795
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,730
 anyway those were those were two big traditions of that time the

796
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,579
 the other the other big thing that was happening was electricity

797
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:07,839
 and magnetism

798
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,599
 i think the there were both observations

799
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:17,220
 and theories the i think the the faraday michael faraday 1830

800
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
 discovered

801
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:23,559
 electromagnetic induction the fact that when you wave a magnet around you you produce

802
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:27,579
 a voltage in a wire you can induce a current in a wire very

803
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:29,260
 critical thing for electrical machinery

804
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,859
 but that was discovered by faraday purely experimental ii then

805
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:39,520
 gradually was sort of the the idea of the notion of an electric field

806
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,680
 or a magnetic field a sort of a thing that was out there that had an effect

807
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,450
 so for example faraday was you know used to have make these do these demonstrations and

808
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,559
 so on where you have iron filings little tiny bits of iron sprinkled

809
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:57,760
 around and you put a magnet there and you'll see this actual pattern of the iron filings

810
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,559
 that is sort of produced by this thing you can't see that is the

811
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,200
 what he termed the magnetic field

812
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,119
 faraday wasn't that mathematically

813
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,770
 oriented but it sort of quickly became clear that that notion of a field was

814
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,840
 all connected with partial differential equations

815
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,130
 and then

816
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,340
 this sort of the the big thing that happened by

817
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,790
 the 1870s was was james clerk maxwell coming

818
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,260
 up with his maxwell's equations

819
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,250
 which were these sort of unified equations that described electric

820
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,330
 and magnetic fields

821
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,200
 um and it was

822
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,640
 it was very

823
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,990
 remember exactly when this was yeah

824
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,910
 so

825
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:42,400
 so it was it was actually within a decade

826
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,020
 after maxwell's equations one of one of the implications of maxwell's equations and

827
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,110
 one of the things that was sort of realized through the experiments

828
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,270
 that faraday had done was that electricity

829
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,790
 and magnetism were very closely connected that

830
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:59,410
 you could use magnets to make electricity you could use out tricity to make magnetism

831
00:42:59,410 --> 00:42:59,740
 and

832
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:06,100
 so on and those that kind of that that unification really came together in maxwell's equations

833
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:12,090
 which are four equations partial differential equations that describe the the

834
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:18,370
 the the mechanics of electromagnetic fields they tell you how charges

835
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:21,880
 and currents electric charges electric currents make electric

836
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,720
 and magnetic fields

837
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,050
 and they tell you how electrical magnetic fields fit together and you

838
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,980
 know maxwell was a good mathematician and invented

839
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,870
 vector analysis something that all those div grad curl all those things that's all maxwell's although

840
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,900
 he he originally wanted to call curl twirl

841
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,210
 which might have been charming for the calculus students of the future um

842
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,820
 but anyway he settled on on curl eventually

843
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,740
 um

844
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,500
 but the

845
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,500
 but

846
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,770
 but anyway so maxwell's equations have made these statements about

847
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:54,430
 how electric

848
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,300
 and magnetic fields would work one of the implications of those was

849
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,810
 that there will be it would be possible to produce waves electromagnetic waves

850
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:07,570
 and within a decade hertz had observed electromagnetic

851
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:11,590
 waves and had figured out and had basically created the first radio

852
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:15,190
 and it didn't take very long it took come less

853
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,240
 than a decade before there was actual real radio being used

854
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:25,510
 and people were transmitting messages the had been given done on wires with telegrams

855
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:29,230
 and so on they were using you know in morse code they were sending messages

856
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,660
 purely through electromagnetic waves

857
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,010
 so that was kind of the the realization that tim that

858
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,950
 that came out of the mathematics that maxwell had done that

859
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:42,280
 there should be a magnetic waves and by golly there actually were electromagnetic

860
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,800
 waves and they made radio

861
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,800
 so

862
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,990
 so that was kind of the big

863
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:52,920
 development of of the late 1800s was this idea of electromagnetism

864
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,480
 electrical magnetic fields things like radios

865
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,360
 and those those sorts of things

866
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,600
 so

867
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,780
 the another

868
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,070
 so another thing that was happening in

869
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:13,150
 yeah i should have somebody on livestream is commenting on discovery of the vacuum

870
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:17,500
 so that was in around the time of the french revolution right

871
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,750
 so

872
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,350
 that was some

873
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:29,310
 so that was in the the 1700s the the realization that the air that is not

874
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,500
 that there's a notion of there being nothing there

875
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,859
 so to speak that you could make things where there isn't any air

876
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:36,250
 and

877
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,780
 where there's something

878
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,140
 where there's nothing there i'm not sure i think

879
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:46,270
 for chemistry that was an important realization i'm not sure that that was

880
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,109
 well ingested by the physicists

881
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:50,109
 and

882
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:52,810
 in fact there were a bunch of issues about what you

883
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:57,310
 know what the role the notion of whether a vacuum really really had nothing there

884
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:02,109
 so one of the important ones of those was some people knew about sound

885
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:05,560
 and they knew that sound was compression

886
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,080
 waves in in the air and you

887
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,750
 could also have sound in solids it was compression waves and solids

888
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:15,490
 and things like that and and people like helmholtz i think 1860s ish had

889
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:20,320
 developed a pretty complete theory mathematical theory of sound that

890
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:20,770
 um

891
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,920
 and

892
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
 rayleigh

893
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,180
 i think had had a version of this in fact his his book as i realm

894
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,980
 holtz and raley's books on sound i certainly

895
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,650
 have copies of them and i think they're pretty modern actually

896
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,520
 and there's not a lot time you can say more with more more

897
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,030
 or techniques

898
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,700
 but they pretty much had nailed the way sound works

899
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,340
 and the mathematics of sound waves and so on um

900
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,480
 but you know there was a question come to a little bit more later

901
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,280
 but but there was a question for electromagnetic waves we know that sound waves are compression

902
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,170
 and rarefaction waves in air in a material question is what are electromagnetic

903
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,610
 waves waves in and

904
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:58,420
 so

905
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,630
 this notion developed of this thing called the ether the so

906
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,400
 called in a very victorian sounding

907
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,960
 name the luminiferous ether the light carrying ether that

908
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,860
 was the the idea was that tim there was this this uncie unseen thing that

909
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:20,560
 was the analog of what air was to sound the luminiferous ether was to electromagnetic

910
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,020
 waves and that was kind of at the time of maxwell

911
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,060
 and people like that that was kind of the way people thought things worked

912
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,060
 so

913
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,630
 um the

914
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,520
 well another another important

915
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,610
 developments in the eighteen hundred sixteen hundreds were you know there's a physics

916
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:39,100
 really started galloping along after

917
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,570
 galileo and newton you

918
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:44,260
 know physics kind of got in gear and things really started to happen um

919
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,790
 and you know there's a lot of different kinds of phenomena in the world another

920
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:54,400
 important area is heat the the theory of heat the idea of temperature the theory of heat those

921
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,510
 kinds of things there's

922
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,190
 a big debate in the 1800's

923
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,030
 what is heat

924
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:58,450
 um

925
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,730
 and

926
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,080
 so

927
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,950
 it got a little bit weird

928
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,720
 and funky i mean it was already suspected in the eighteen in the 1600s

929
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,340
 that heat was somehow associated with the microscopic motion of the

930
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:19,120
 things that made up matter and even for example one of the bernoulli's had figured out that

931
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,910
 you know gases might be little molecules

932
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,690
 or bouncing around that was in the mid 1700s

933
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,030
 but that nobody really particularly cared about that

934
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,930
 i mean people were very much concerned about heat

935
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,030
 and and then when steam engines were invented

936
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,730
 it was important to understand kind of what

937
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,600
 was possible in steam engines sadi carnot worked

938
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,350
 out the the notion of an idealized steam engine

939
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,900
 and tried to work out how much how much energy

940
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,170
 you get from an idealized steam engine these kinds of things

941
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,930
 but this notion of what is heat what is the thing that corresponds to heat wasn't clear

942
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:59,170
 and it got kind of weird a little bit like the ether there

943
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,619
 was this notion of things like for gist on this this substance

944
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:04,779
 that would suffice things

945
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:06,579
 and that corresponded to heat

946
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:07,000
 um

947
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,549
 and

948
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:17,799
 this this idea that it was a that there was that heat wasn't a substance that

949
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:22,299
 was a property it was just a property of things not its own separate sort

950
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:26,170
 of you know separated kind of substance that was

951
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,789
 that took until the mid 1800s

952
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:30,760
 before that started to become clear and there started we experiment

953
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,160
 spew like jewel who

954
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,010
 did did experiments sort of about the inter convertibility of heat as

955
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,010
 and

956
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,170
 and other forms of energy

957
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,089
 and things that were known

958
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:46,660
 from mechanics things about the the energy of motion that

959
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,920
 was understood from mechanics

960
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,250
 and

961
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,079
 and by the way following newton

962
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,779
 and so on the idea of the conservation momentum

963
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:55,299
 the conservation of mechanical energy these

964
00:49:55,299 --> 00:49:57,509
 were things that had emerged from mechanics

965
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:03,130
 but it wasn't clear sort of how heat fitted into that well then 1850

966
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,190
 ish sort of big big

967
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,339
 point the first law of thermodynamics the

968
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,880
 idea that heat is a form of energy and that the energy

969
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,339
 and mechanical work

970
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:22,059
 energy of mechanical work like kinetic energy is sort of interchangeable with the energy of heat and so

971
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:25,839
 that was that was kind of a thing of around 1850 people

972
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:31,269
 like klaus i think was involved in that um the this this notion of heat

973
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:33,339
 as a form of energy interconvertible

974
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:38,650
 with mechanical energy well the only thing was that it was clear it wasn't completely interconvertible

975
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,400
 because

976
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,150
 if you had something that was hot you couldn't immediately turn

977
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,069
 that thing that was hot you

978
00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:47,950
 know into useful mechanical work

979
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,859
 and so it was kind of like why is that you

980
00:50:50,859 --> 00:50:53,019
 know what was what's going on there and that's

981
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:55,500
 what became the second law of thermodynamics

982
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,170
 what we now often refer to as the law of entropy increase

983
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,019
 but back in those days it was kind of this this

984
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:07,210
 law that said you can't get my chemical work out of heat energy that easily

985
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:07,690
 um

986
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,349
 and

987
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:12,130
 so for example a common version of it would be the statement that heat

988
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,740
 doesn't spontaneously flow from

989
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,039
 a colder body to a hotter body that

990
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:20,589
 was one one version of the second law of thermodynamics

991
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:23,470
 but it became slowly clearer

992
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:24,339
 what

993
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:25,650
 um

994
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,299
 what the second law might be um

995
00:51:28,299 --> 00:51:29,400
 and

996
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:36,099
 and this notion that i mean we now know that the issue is mechanical work involves

997
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:38,019
 you know you take this big lump of stuff

998
00:51:38,019 --> 00:51:40,180
 and you started in motion

999
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,769
 and that means all the atoms

1000
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:44,349
 and that big lump of stuff are all going in one particular direction

1001
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:47,319
 if you just make the lump of stuff hot it

1002
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:50,230
 means the atoms are moving around they're moving around very quickly

1003
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:54,789
 but they're moving around in random ways and we can't kind of decode that randomness

1004
00:51:54,789 --> 00:52:00,760
 so that we can kind of organize it into this sort of systematic mechanical motion

1005
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,240
 and that that failure to be able to organize

1006
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,559
 it is i think the origin of the second law but we'll come to that um

1007
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:17,369
 but anyway back in those days this notion of of the second law sort of emerged

1008
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,049
 eighteen

1009
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:24,519
 sixties ish kind of it was starting to be really talked about two big things happen

1010
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,349
 so james clerk maxwell actually

1011
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:31,420
 before he'd worked on electromagnetism i worked on kinetic theory he was he

1012
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,069
 worked on a prize

1013
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:35,079
 essay about the moons of saturn

1014
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:35,440
 um

1015
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,210
 and in it he invented

1016
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:39,220
 what is now called kinetic theory he

1017
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,569
 invented kind of the mathematical

1018
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:44,079
 theory that describes you have a bunch of gas molecules bouncing around what

1019
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,490
 can you say about

1020
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:49,480
 the properties of those molecules so one big thing he said was the distribution

1021
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:55,960
 of velocities of those molecules is this gaussian like distribution e to the minus mv squared

1022
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,690
 um distribution

1023
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:00,430
 that is now called the maxwell boltzmann distribution

1024
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:06,069
 so that was a sort of a mathematics meets the kind of the mathematics

1025
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:09,039
 meets the idea that gases are really a bunch of little little

1026
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,339
 particle like things bouncing around that was a maxwell

1027
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:15,869
 idea then along came ludwig boltzmann

1028
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:18,220
 and

1029
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,119
 eighteen seventy he had

1030
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,010
 proved this thing called the h theorem

1031
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:24,580
 so

1032
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,960
 okay so they've been this idea

1033
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,550
 and trying to characterize

1034
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:30,700
 what heat was relative to other forms of energy they've

1035
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,490
 been that idea i think due to klaus s that

1036
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,400
 you could define a notion of what's called entropy

1037
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,290
 which he defined as a thing that was essentially heat divided by temperature

1038
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:41,290
 okay

1039
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:41,710
 so what

1040
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,540
 what boltzmann

1041
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,390
 proved was on the basis of little

1042
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,750
 gas molecules bouncing around he proved this thing called eh theorem that

1043
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,790
 he said meant that he'd

1044
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:56,380
 proved that the entropy as defined by classiest always increases

1045
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,970
 and that's equivalent to statements like heat doesn't spontaneously flow from

1046
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,710
 a colder body to a hotter body so

1047
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,480
 covered through a lot of other kinds of statements

1048
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,380
 um and

1049
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,220
 so boltzmann

1050
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,750
 said he proved that now his

1051
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,859
 proof was kind of a bit of a sham it's an interesting mathematical proof but

1052
00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:17,380
 because it turns out the laws of physics are reversible at least in the sense in

1053
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,430
 the sense that they whatever whatever

1054
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:22,839
 the laws of mechanics have the property

1055
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:24,609
 that if you can have two things that collide

1056
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:25,660
 like this and go

1057
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,770
 out like that you

1058
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,330
 could sort of run the movie in reverse

1059
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:32,349
 and they could come in from where they start from where they ended up and go

1060
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:35,470
 back and get back to where you started from and

1061
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:42,270
 so that reversibility was kind of boltzmann had gone from taking that a mechanical

1062
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:48,670
 just like that and it proved that something irreversible happened was the so-called reversibility objection

1063
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,170
 and that

1064
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:56,430
 was a very obscure thing in fact it's one of my sort of favorite physics misguided ness

1065
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:00,099
 things is that in textbooks modern textbooks they're

1066
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:02,500
 often talk about the second law of thermodynamics they'll

1067
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,390
 show boltzmann's proof of the h theorem they'll say well yes you can run everything backwards

1068
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:07,950
 and

1069
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:08,950
 how

1070
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,480
 can it not how

1071
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,570
 can you then conclude that entropy increases rather than decreases they'll

1072
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:19,900
 often end with statements like the last sentence being this point is often puzzling to the student well

1073
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,260
 actually been puzzling to everybody else too i think i finally figured

1074
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,030
 out in the 1990s actually

1075
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,960
 how this works

1076
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,730
 and really

1077
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,380
 the story is well

1078
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:35,110
 it's it's the story is that it's happening is the everything is reversible

1079
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:40,600
 but the dynamics of the system is effectively doing encryption on the initial

1080
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,190
 conditions of the system so

1081
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,010
 while in principle you could reverse it you

1082
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:48,400
 need to be a crypt analyst to do it so to speak and in practice

1083
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,480
 when we do experiments

1084
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,020
 or make observations we're not as computationally sophisticated

1085
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,450
 as we would need to be to do that reversal

1086
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,010
 so even though looked

1087
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:58,000
 at at a microscopic

1088
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,180
 level everything is perfectly reversible it doesn't appear

1089
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:06,030
 that way to an actual observer that that was a kind of an idea that

1090
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:12,369
 josiah willard gibbs one of the early american physicists some from the early 1900's

1091
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:17,140
 um he was big on this notion of coarse graining in statistical mechanics

1092
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,810
 which was coming his version of saying the observer can't

1093
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:22,810
 contem

1094
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,200
 can't figure out at the level sort of molecule by molecule what's

1095
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,300
 going on he didn't really have this computation

1096
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,200
 idea but he just had the idea of you can't look at the individual molecules in what's happening

1097
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,560
 i mean maxwell already had this thing called maxwell's demon but

1098
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,930
 you've had a thought experiment we said imagine

1099
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,820
 there are these two two

1100
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,970
 sides of a box and there's a trapdoor in between them

1101
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:48,970
 and there's this little very tiny creature who is watching when molecules arrive at that trapdoor

1102
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:49,750
 and is deciding

1103
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,090
 whether to send them to the left or to the right and with

1104
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:57,160
 that demon you can always get a violation of the second law of thermodynamics by

1105
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,520
 having sort of intelligence like that in the loop you can

1106
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,550
 get this violation second law and that's kind of like saying that's

1107
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,470
 a kind of the beginnings

1108
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:09,520
 of saying you sort of need a crypt analysts to figure out what how to untangle

1109
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,350
 the inexorable increase of entropy associated with the second law actually

1110
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,530
 i should mention that one feature of the second law was

1111
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,609
 that particularly late 1800s it was some it

1112
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:25,300
 was kind of there was this whole question of was there a life force was

1113
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,150
 there something about living systems about biology that

1114
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,280
 was fundamentally different from physical systems

1115
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:37,030
 and it's been a long-standing question of you know is there some spark of life that his goings

1116
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,650
 beyond the physics the chemistry and

1117
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:41,850
 so on and that was some that was what tim

1118
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:43,750
 so the second

1119
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,850
 law was often kind of invoked

1120
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,730
 you know well most things show the law of entropy increase

1121
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,350
 but living systems can

1122
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:54,010
 sort of do the opposite well they can't really they can only do it temporarily and

1123
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,290
 they can only do it in a sort of the maxwell's

1124
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,990
 diminish kind of way at the level of individual molecules

1125
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:02,800
 but doesn't really last but in a case that didn't become clear until

1126
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,760
 well into the 1900s

1127
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,300
 and

1128
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,020
 and

1129
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:09,100
 what really happened is this this notion of what were the foundations of the second law which

1130
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,300
 i think is a fascinating thing

1131
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,880
 it's one of the things got me interested in physics back

1132
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,540
 when i was about 12 years old or something in 1972 was

1133
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,820
 understanding things about the second law of thermodynamics

1134
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,940
 and it's sort of a sort of shocking that that

1135
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,070
 so little work has been done on it and when i finally figured

1136
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,990
 out how i think it actually works i don't

1137
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:27,150
 think anybody cares um

1138
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,950
 but i think it's i think it's really interesting

1139
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:33,310
 okay back to um i should

1140
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,620
 mention you know by

1141
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,420
 the way i mean by the time after

1142
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,180
 the whole life force things sort of dissipated by

1143
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,990
 probably the 1930s people had the point of view that the

1144
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:48,130
 second law was just true it was a fundamental true fact about nature we

1145
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:52,360
 sort of maybe kind of didn't maybe even need to prove it maybe or maybe boltzmann

1146
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,650
 approved it or people

1147
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:54,700
 were kind of confused about

1148
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,930
 it i mean the the idea of entropy got kind of a boost in 1940s

1149
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:01,150
 when claude shannon introduced

1150
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,190
 the idea of information as

1151
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:07,080
 a measure of sort of the compressibility of data

1152
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:13,080
 because basically his information measure is exactly - the

1153
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,780
 boltzmann's entropy measure

1154
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,780
 okay

1155
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,470
 so another big thing from the 1600s

1156
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:27,240
 from the from sorry from the 1800s was

1157
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,570
 was

1158
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:36,970
 the the whole notion of atoms really becoming real and you

1159
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:40,150
 know it had been known chemistry had developed a lot lots

1160
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:43,600
 of chemical elements were known by the 1860 mendel sixties

1161
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,270
 mendel af was sort of writing his chemistry textbook

1162
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:49,960
 and making up the periodic table all those kinds of things people

1163
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:55,330
 this this notion that there was a systematization of chemistry was becoming clear meanwhile

1164
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:57,040
 people like dalton even

1165
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,820
 the beginning of the 1800s had

1166
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:03,900
 notice things about chemical reactions they noticed that when

1167
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:09,270
 you wrote down chemical reactions you could things worked very nicely when

1168
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:13,470
 there was sort of integer multiples of things that showed up all over the place it

1169
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,300
 was like there were two units of oxygen

1170
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,040
 and one unit of hydrogen whatever

1171
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,670
 it is for four different kinds of things or or and that

1172
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,710
 but sort of it was a it was very convenient

1173
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,810
 if you could just sort of numerologically

1174
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:29,040
 arrange things by saying there's there's a discrete amount of hydrogen

1175
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,750
 and there's you know there's twice as much hydrogen as there is oxygen in water

1176
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:38,040
 and some sense and that there were these sort of simple multiples

1177
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:43,560
 and so he kind of developed this idea that there must be an atomic theory that would underlie chemistry

1178
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,150
 but it was done more at the level of sort of explaining chemical reactions meanwhile it

1179
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:53,400
 had sort of been known for a while but it kind of was was was really um became

1180
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,310
 clearer with a guy called robert brown discovered brownian motion

1181
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:02,490
 it was they'd have been known for a long time that things like this happened that

1182
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:05,850
 if you have a light enough thing he was looking at pollen grains it

1183
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,760
 would be sort of discreetly kicked around

1184
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,970
 if you

1185
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:12,780
 were looking at it under a microscope and that discreet kicking around people

1186
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,660
 sort of started identifying oh that's actual molecules

1187
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:19,380
 that are like doing the kicking discreetly

1188
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,940
 and so this notion that you know atoms that things are made of discrete stuff

1189
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,730
 um was was pretty much established

1190
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:28,380
 and by the time maxwell

1191
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:34,490
 was talking about kinetic theory there was like yeah things are made of discrete stuff discrete atom like things

1192
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,490
 what

1193
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:41,970
 were atoms people didn't know actually one of my favorite kind of theories due to william

1194
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:47,490
 thompson later lord kelvin was the idea that atoms were knots in the ether

1195
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:53,820
 so remember this ether the luminiferous ether that that was supposed to fill the universe

1196
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:57,330
 and be the thing that was the sort of carrier of light

1197
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,480
 as air is the carrier of sound waves well

1198
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,530
 so the idea was that knots you

1199
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:05,220
 know there are discrete

1200
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,100
 kinds of knots that you can time pieces of string there are different different

1201
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,320
 kinds you can classify the knots that exist

1202
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,090
 and kelvins

1203
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,220
 idea was well you

1204
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:15,270
 know it may be that

1205
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:16,050
 we know there are discrete

1206
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:17,010
 kinds of atoms maybe

1207
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:17,790
 the kinds of atoms

1208
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:21,210
 all correspond to knots and the ether a completely non stupid

1209
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,520
 theory that turns out to be basically wrong

1210
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,140
 at least in those let of that level but definitely not a not a foolish thing

1211
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,370
 to think about and

1212
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,700
 in fact the the whole the a lot of knot theory was was

1213
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,730
 produced by a childhood friend of maxwell's

1214
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,130
 no cousin called tate who started classifying

1215
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,750
 knots to try and see would

1216
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,850
 there be 92 of them just like there were chemical

1217
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,830
 elements of that that number of chemical elements

1218
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,990
 and so on

1219
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:45,990
 okay

1220
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,030
 so anyway

1221
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,110
 so this takes us some

1222
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:58,580
 let's see i think come i'm looking at questions from the live stream here this some

1223
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:04,230
 this kind of takes us to pretty much the end of the 1800s in

1224
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,520
 terms of what was happening so

1225
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,540
 a couple of things happen

1226
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:09,270
 right at the tail end of the 1800s first

1227
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:13,860
 1895 discovery of x-rays by rod caen um discovery

1228
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,620
 that you could have these these these

1229
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,420
 things that would kind of go through matter

1230
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,560
 and you

1231
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,740
 know would make nice pictures of bones and wouldn't be would

1232
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:28,260
 would not go through bones but would go through other pieces of us so to speak then

1233
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,420
 very soon thereafter becker all discovered natural radioactivity

1234
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,570
 and then 1897

1235
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:36,570
 thompson

1236
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:40,020
 discovered the electron discovered that electricity was

1237
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:44,940
 also made of discrete stuff just like matter was made of discrete atoms so electricity

1238
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,280
 was made of discrete things namely electrons well

1239
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,280
 okay

1240
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,000
 so there been a bunch of things that have been studied

1241
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,900
 one thing that had emerged in the think 1880s

1242
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,050
 or so was this notion of blackbody radiation

1243
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,050
 so

1244
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:06,060
 the question was when you heat something up it glows we know that what

1245
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:13,400
 color does it glow what is the distribution of colors that what are the distribution of of

1246
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,640
 colors of

1247
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,410
 of electromagnet of so we know that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation

1248
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:23,580
 and so

1249
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:27,450
 when something is heated up and glows what colors

1250
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,790
 does it produce as a function of temperature so there

1251
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:31,680
 was a way of calculating that based

1252
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,200
 on kind of standard based

1253
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,050
 on the fact that there might be little generators

1254
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:40,260
 little oscillators that would be like little radio transmitters

1255
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:43,230
 except for light in the at in the in the material

1256
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:46,470
 and there might be lots of these and they might all produce

1257
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,020
 a certain spectrum of electromagnetic

1258
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:53,010
 radiation problem was that calculation gave completely the wrong answer

1259
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:58,650
 and by 1900 there were pretty precise measurements of what the actual blackbody spectrum was

1260
01:04:58,650 --> 01:04:59,040
 and

1261
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,270
 so a chap called max planck decided he would fit that data

1262
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,820
 and he realized that you could

1263
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:12,750
 get a really good fit to that data if you assumed that somehow the that'd

1264
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,840
 be that whatever it was that were these little oscillators

1265
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,760
 that were producing lateral radiation

1266
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,560
 was somehow quantized were in lumps a little bit like and he got him it

1267
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:28,880
 wasn't it wasn't maxwell's distribution of of them

1268
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,700
 from kinetic theory of distribution of speeds of molecules

1269
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,660
 but was something a little like that a little bit different from that

1270
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,960
 what we now call the bose einstein distribution

1271
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,860
 that that

1272
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:44,070
 would govern if if there were if sort

1273
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:50,910
 of electromagnetic radiation was quantized it would be that would be the the form of blackbody

1274
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:52,620
 of the spectrum of blackbody radiation

1275
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:55,710
 so that was kind of the first idea of of quanta

1276
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:01,350
 of quantization of something of in this case quantization of light effectively

1277
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:06,150
 so it was already known there were discrete atoms there were discrete electrons for electricity

1278
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,930
 but

1279
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:14,010
 what about light well planck sort of had this empirical fit that said there could also be discreteness

1280
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:14,570
 in light

1281
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,570
 okay

1282
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:18,090
 there was a thing called the photoelectric effect you

1283
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:20,730
 shine light on something on some materials

1284
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:23,880
 and they emit electrons basically

1285
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,320
 they produce that the photoelectric

1286
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,370
 effect is what's used for photo cells is what you what's used

1287
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:32,400
 ultimately for the its

1288
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,680
 yes i guess it's what's used for the imaging device that is the camera that i'm waving

1289
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,470
 my arms that you guys using is that same photoelectric effect um

1290
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:49,590
 but in any case the the photoelectric effect there were things knowing about the photoelectric effect about

1291
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:57,330
 what frequencies of light would produce electrons etc etc etc 1905 albert einstein figured out that

1292
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:57,720
 um

1293
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,340
 if you believe planck's idea of discrete

1294
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,060
 discreteness in electromagnetism

1295
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:07,080
 if you had the notion of a photon a discrete particle of light you

1296
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,140
 could explain the photoelectric effect um that's

1297
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,670
 actually what einstein eventually

1298
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:15,960
 won his nobel prize for cuz well it's of it he was way too too controversial still

1299
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,660
 um was the the explanation of the photoelectric effect

1300
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,740
 so also another

1301
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,750
 thing that was happening right at the end of the 1900s

1302
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,830
 was a thing called a michelson morley experiment

1303
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:30,420
 michelson morley experiment was an attempt to detect

1304
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:35,790
 what was called the ether drift so assume that the universe is full of luminiferous ether

1305
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:41,760
 um the loomer the earth must be moving through the luminous verse ether at some speed

1306
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,010
 but that means that somehow

1307
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,860
 just like sound waves if you if

1308
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:51,120
 you're moving through the air sound waves work differently than if you're stationary in the air

1309
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:56,670
 and it should have been possible to detect that that change in the luminiferous ether as

1310
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:58,440
 a result of the earth going around the sun at

1311
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,270
 different times of year and so on you should see

1312
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:02,790
 a different term different

1313
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:05,040
 features of the transmission of light well

1314
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,510
 they didn't see that and so

1315
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,520
 that meant there was no ether drift this

1316
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,100
 idea that there was this ether that sort of filled the universe

1317
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:15,120
 and that was the carrier of light something was wrong with that idea

1318
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:21,020
 now in the one of these typical ironies of history that kind of is a luminiferous ether

1319
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:25,260
 and we kind of know that because it's

1320
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:30,689
 well in some of the fundamental physics theory that that i have you'll see there's

1321
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,569
 something it's a little bit bizarrely abstracted

1322
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:36,660
 but it's something a little bit like that luminiferous ether

1323
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,000
 but even this idea that

1324
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,359
 there's nothing in the universe that sort of addressed that we're moving through that's not true

1325
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:48,080
 the cosmic microwave background defines a rest frame for the whole of our universe

1326
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,250
 and the earth is moving through it at one thousandth of the speed of light in a particular direction

1327
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:56,960
 so this idea that there's sort of there is no ether drift it they've been incredibly

1328
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,460
 precise with their experiments

1329
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,020
 and they observed

1330
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:04,040
 you know like by a light scattering from the cosmic microwave background an effect way

1331
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,140
 below even what we can see today they

1332
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,569
 would have seen an ether drift but they didn't

1333
01:09:08,569 --> 01:09:12,859
 and so that led to a whole world how can this possibly work there

1334
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:19,220
 was a a feature of maxwell's equations for electromagnetism that implied that somehow

1335
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:22,010
 the speed of light was constant independent of

1336
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:24,020
 how fast things were moving

1337
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,050
 so however fast the object y

1338
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:29,000
 or whatever

1339
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,450
 a flashlight that's you're that you're taking on a spacecraft the spacecraft is moving rapidly but yet the

1340
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:36,260
 the actual

1341
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,750
 light that comes out of the flashlight isn't

1342
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,120
 moving relative to somebody at rest any

1343
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,839
 faster than the speed of light it's not speed of light plus meters spacecraft

1344
01:09:44,839 --> 01:09:50,270
 and you would have expected from the galilean principle that you

1345
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,330
 can't tell in your emotion you would have expected that you

1346
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:57,050
 would have something where the speed of the of the photons that

1347
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:00,170
 were coming out of the flashlight would be the speed of the thing that was that

1348
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:03,080
 you were emitting them from plus the speed of light but that isn't

1349
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,030
 what happened according to maxwell's equations

1350
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,930
 okay

1351
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:08,140
 so then 1905 einstein

1352
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,980
 and then special relativity

1353
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:14,150
 and special relativity was invented as this way to reconcile

1354
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:21,920
 what maxwell's equations said with the lack of an ether drift and to explain

1355
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,630
 how the speed of light can really be constant

1356
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:26,690
 and what einstein realized was that well

1357
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,550
 you can think about the speed of light being

1358
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:31,010
 constant if you change your notion of what's

1359
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:31,610
 how space

1360
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:36,680
 and time work if you have time dilation if if if observers

1361
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,810
 who are moving fast see

1362
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:42,080
 time moving at a different rate than observers who are at rest and

1363
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,690
 so on well actually to the observer the

1364
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:49,340
 time seems to be moving at the same rate but to somebody else observing them their

1365
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,140
 time seems to be moving at a different rate

1366
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:56,570
 i mean it's a little bit spoiler alert i think we now know exactly why that happens

1367
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:57,889
 and how that all works

1368
01:10:57,889 --> 01:10:59,750
 but that's that's

1369
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:02,179
 coming when i when i get to talk about what

1370
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:04,250
 we figured out about sort of a new fundamental

1371
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,590
 theory for physics but in the time of einstein

1372
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:10,760
 what einstein did was in a very kind of euclid style way was

1373
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,960
 to sort of write down what

1374
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,350
 essentially were axioms things like you

1375
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:18,080
 know physics is independent of reference frame in for

1376
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:23,690
 inertial reference frames for frames but it's kind of like newton's first law type type motion where whether

1377
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,820
 it's just things are just moving without

1378
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:29,679
 without being acted on by a force and similarly

1379
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,800
 and things like the speed of light is constant and given these axioms

1380
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,880
 he was able to derive in this very kind of almost greek

1381
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,119
 type way this these

1382
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:48,290
 facts about the world that were the facts of special relativity things like time dilation length contraction all

1383
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,570
 these kinds of features of special relativity people

1384
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:51,650
 were very suspicious at

1385
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:54,350
 the time they said how can you be doing this this isn't like the way physics

1386
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,850
 was supposed to be practiced it

1387
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,230
 was a very non mathematical

1388
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,210
 paper in many ways then

1389
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:02,869
 einstein wrote a very short paper to introduce special relativity

1390
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:03,980
 and people were very confused

1391
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:06,290
 and it was another kind of copernicus

1392
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:10,670
 like moment you know you can't believe what you think you see type thing now

1393
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:13,429
 actually from special relativity came

1394
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,500
 this notion that space

1395
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:20,869
 and time is somehow the same kind of thing because in the mathematical formalism of special relativity they

1396
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:23,119
 it's very clean

1397
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:24,650
 personal common makovski

1398
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:25,969
 um was

1399
01:12:25,969 --> 01:12:29,690
 kind of big on pointing this out that the equations of special relativity work

1400
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:30,710
 in a really clean way

1401
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:31,820
 if you

1402
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,310
 can kind of treat space

1403
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:38,000
 and time as being sort of just aspects of the same thing well

1404
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,920
 i actually think that particular idea was a wrong turn and i think that particular idea

1405
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,810
 kind of set back physics by

1406
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:47,540
 a long time but we'll talk about that we'll

1407
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,460
 talk about that soon this notion that

1408
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,810
 space and time are really the same

1409
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:52,040
 kind of thing i don't think it's correct

1410
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:56,270
 um they appear the same kind of thing for purposes as things like special relativity

1411
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:57,889
 but at a conceptual

1412
01:12:57,889 --> 01:13:01,400
 level they really aren't the same kind of thing and they probably don't seem to us intuitively

1413
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,260
 like they're the same kind of thing but you

1414
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,100
 have to kind of invent

1415
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,389
 all these thought experiments that

1416
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:07,760
 make them seem like they're the same kind of thing anyway

1417
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,690
 so special relativity in 1905

1418
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:16,120
 not a huge impact when it first came out there wasn't a lot of experimental

1419
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,969
 measurement that could be done based on special relativity it

1420
01:13:18,969 --> 01:13:22,000
 was just like okay that's cool type thing so

1421
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,230
 meanwhile a lot of other stuff was going on particularly

1422
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:30,219
 stuff with radioactivity a lot of things with with that um big

1423
01:13:30,219 --> 01:13:33,850
 thing 1911 i think was

1424
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,980
 the discovery of atomic nucleus

1425
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,270
 so people

1426
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:40,570
 had you know they they were beginning to think okay there are atoms they're discrete

1427
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:44,830
 units of matter but you know what's you know is there something inside those atoms

1428
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:50,560
 so rutherford took alpha particles helium nuclei a form of radioactivity

1429
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,219
 and we just was just scattering them against atoms

1430
01:13:54,219 --> 01:13:58,630
 and discovered that most of the time you know most of an atom from most

1431
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,040
 of the time you shoot now for particle

1432
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,300
 and atom it just goes straight through

1433
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:06,489
 but just very rarely it's it's deflected a long way and

1434
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:11,830
 so rather food's interpretation of that was most of the atoms kind of just empty space but

1435
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:19,270
 there's something in the middle maybe of an atom that is a hard lump a nucleus that will will

1436
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:22,980
 bounce the alpha particle back and so that was the discovery of the atomic nucleus

1437
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:25,180
 and soon

1438
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,570
 it was understood that there were protons in the atomic nucleus that

1439
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:31,660
 were sort of particles that were part of the that

1440
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:34,870
 along with electrons formed atoms it

1441
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,489
 was known that isotopes existed

1442
01:14:36,489 --> 01:14:37,630
 and it was a little bit confusing

1443
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:44,260
 how that worked and it wasn't until the 1930s that separate free neutrons were observed

1444
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:49,120
 i mean the the really weird thing about neutrons you know the tonic nucleus is made of protons

1445
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:49,630
 and neutrons

1446
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:55,870
 and in all the sort of matter that we are used to that isn't radioactive the protons

1447
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:58,570
 and neutrons just sit there in the nucleus of the atom they're

1448
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:01,239
 just completely stable they don't nothing happens to them

1449
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:01,630
 but

1450
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,690
 if you have a free neutron if you just manage to separate

1451
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:09,480
 out just a neutron on its own the neutron undergoes radioactive decay in about 15 minutes

1452
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,480
 so

1453
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,630
 if you could separate out a free neutron independent

1454
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:15,760
 of being bound into the nucleus of an atom it decays

1455
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,150
 and

1456
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,640
 and that's one of many confusing things about about

1457
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,920
 how it all works

1458
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,820
 but anyway so

1459
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:27,890
 so a tank nucleus 1910 ish

1460
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:33,810
 sort of a that was a a discovery there were another another thing that had been observed

1461
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:37,440
 and was was pretty well known was this idea of spectroscopy the

1462
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,440
 idea that when an atom absorbs light it

1463
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,750
 absorbs it different kinds of atoms absorb

1464
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:44,490
 light at different frequencies

1465
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,190
 and when you have a

1466
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:47,310
 if you

1467
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:52,230
 have a prism for example you can split the light into its constituent colors different frequencies

1468
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:55,980
 and you'll see that particular different

1469
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:59,550
 gases for example when they're excited like in a fluorescent light

1470
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,490
 bulb or something like that will produce characteristically

1471
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:07,800
 different spectra they will have discrete lines that correspond to you

1472
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,840
 know when you separate out the light in with a prism

1473
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,730
 or with the diffraction grating or something they'll have discrete lines that correspond to emitting

1474
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:17,340
 light of very specific frequencies

1475
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,350
 or absorbing by two very specific frequencies

1476
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:23,280
 so that was known and there was a whole sort of elaborate descriptive

1477
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,670
 theory of spectroscopy the question is what how

1478
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:30,000
 did that all work and it's sort of in the 1920s

1479
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,430
 this all started to become clear and that

1480
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:35,010
 was when quantum mechanics really emerged

1481
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:38,580
 and sort of the notion of quantum mechanics was ok

1482
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:44,490
 lots of things are quantized lots of things are discrete like i think 1923 the stern-gerlach

1483
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:48,270
 experiment the discovery of electron spin that electrons

1484
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,460
 can be in a sense either spinning

1485
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:56,180
 up or spinning down and it's a discrete kind of thing and the

1486
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,180
 so

1487
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,430
 there was kind of a realization

1488
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:04,740
 that these spectra these lines spectra were all associated with quantization that there

1489
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:08,930
 was a discreteness to things and then

1490
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:17,940
 debris in 1919 20s had this idea that maybe just like light could

1491
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:23,430
 be thought of in some ways like a particle like a photon in some ways like a wave

1492
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,570
 so maybe matter

1493
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:27,780
 and things like electrons could also be thought of partly

1494
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:30,030
 like a wave and partly like a like a particle

1495
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:36,180
 and that was a sort of influential underlying idea that helped launch quantum mechanics

1496
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:40,890
 so the real launch of quantum mechanics was probably the mention of the schrodinger equation

1497
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:45,020
 and heisenberg's matrix mechanics in 1925 ish

1498
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,020
 and

1499
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:47,790
 so these were both well

1500
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:51,360
 the schrodinger equation was a partial differential equation very

1501
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,810
 much in the sort of tradition of mechanics from the 1800s heisenberg

1502
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:57,540
 had a slightly more newfangled math thing that

1503
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,500
 had to do with matrices

1504
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,230
 matrices that were invented rather obscurely

1505
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:03,930
 i mean matrices are a very simple concept but

1506
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:08,250
 they've been invented in the 1800s particularly by cayley as

1507
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,060
 a results of fairly elaborate mathematical considerations

1508
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,530
 but anyway heisenberg applied those

1509
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:15,960
 and it turned out that schrodinger

1510
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,240
 and heisenberg view of

1511
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:22,680
 how things worked were were actually equivalent although the mathematics looked fairly different and

1512
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,500
 kind of the notion was that somehow

1513
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,830
 everything would be discretely

1514
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:32,780
 quantized a little bit like you know if you have a

1515
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:36,000
 so shown are just version you know you have kind of a string

1516
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,290
 and you

1517
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:39,180
 can pluck it in the middle and it'll make you

1518
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:41,280
 know a sort of single sine wave you

1519
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,340
 can pluck it in a different way and we'll make a double sine wave triple

1520
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,870
 sine wave but it's quantized

1521
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:48,750
 they if the string is is kind of held at both ends

1522
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,790
 they're only a limited number of configurations

1523
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:54,510
 that the string can be in and that's kind of what schroder just said was happening

1524
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:56,220
 for for example electrons

1525
01:18:56,220 --> 01:19:00,030
 and atoms that there are only a discrete set of possible configurations

1526
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:06,360
 that these that these electrons can be in he described the thing that was being sort

1527
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,340
 of that represented that configuration

1528
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:12,600
 as well he called the wave function of the of the electron

1529
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,250
 and

1530
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,450
 so there was so

1531
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,460
 what what chandra figured

1532
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,200
 out was you could make these equations

1533
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,320
 that would describe the kind of properties of the wave function

1534
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,820
 and from those properties

1535
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,880
 you could compute all kinds of things you could start computing atomic spectra

1536
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,520
 you can compute the spectrum of the hydrogen atom all

1537
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,110
 those kinds of things and it'll

1538
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:32,550
 work very well you

1539
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,350
 might ask well what was the wave function

1540
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:37,020
 what did it actually mean well that

1541
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,760
 was where things started getting a lot squiggly

1542
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,560
 up and it was well

1543
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,860
 the wave function is kind of related to the probability that the electron will

1544
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:46,050
 be doing this thing or that thing um

1545
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:52,440
 and there was a one interpretation of quantum mechanics which are emerge around the same time was

1546
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,080
 okay just think of it as the wave function

1547
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,020
 which is a function of complex function real

1548
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:03,090
 imaginary parts that you can work out the probability when you actually say

1549
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,580
 you want to know what happened in the atom you can

1550
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,770
 just say i'm going to measure it and then

1551
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:08,369
 what

1552
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:10,080
 happened will be governed by a probability

1553
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,110
 that is the modulus squared of the wave function

1554
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,150
 and that was kind of the the interpretation

1555
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:16,409
 that was given to

1556
01:20:16,409 --> 01:20:20,909
 two quantum mechanics it was like don't look under the covers too much you'll

1557
01:20:20,909 --> 01:20:22,889
 get confused just compute

1558
01:20:22,889 --> 01:20:23,429
 what happens

1559
01:20:23,429 --> 01:20:24,600
 and you'll get the right answer

1560
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,980
 and that's kind of been the story of quantum mechanics from the 1920s until today it's

1561
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,989
 like it's a mathematical theory don't

1562
01:20:30,989 --> 01:20:33,290
 look too closely because you'll get confused

1563
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:39,090
 and my friend dick feynman always used to say you know nobody really understands quantum mechanics

1564
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:43,670
 and i think that's i think that that that's been traditionally true

1565
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:50,940
 exciting you know spoiler alert for the new kind of theory of fundamental physics i think we actually

1566
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,199
 now understand quantum mechanics

1567
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:53,190
 and why it works and

1568
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:53,909
 how it's

1569
01:20:53,909 --> 01:20:55,770
 set up but that's that's

1570
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:58,760
 that's for the future we're talking about history of physics today

1571
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:03,060
 but in the history of physics quantum mechanics with

1572
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:06,060
 very rapid developments in the 1920s by

1573
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,409
 the end of the 1920s a

1574
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:12,750
 lot of quantum mechanics was understood a lot of quantum field theory was also have been developed

1575
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,510
 so quantum mechanics is about did

1576
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:19,260
 the electron go this way or that way and there's just a particular electron

1577
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,420
 and we're dealing with that electron

1578
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:23,639
 and we're looking at it and so on when

1579
01:21:23,639 --> 01:21:25,260
 you want to describe things

1580
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,380
 like an electromagnetic field you

1581
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,730
 have to deal with the fact that well

1582
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:32,369
 you don't really know how many photons are there a photon

1583
01:21:32,369 --> 01:21:34,679
 could be created a photon could be destroyed it's

1584
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:38,010
 a little bit of a more complicated story the mathematics is considerably more complicated

1585
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:40,440
 the quantum field theory as compared to quantum mechanics

1586
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:43,050
 but by the late 1920s there

1587
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:47,610
 was already the the the elements of quantum field theory had already been developed although the mathematics

1588
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,560
 are working out the consequences were

1589
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,500
 still still somewhat in the future ok

1590
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,750
 so that was that was kind of the idea of

1591
01:21:54,750 --> 01:22:04,610
 oh the another important thing so the schrodinger's equation was an equation for nonrelativistic

1592
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:05,610
 things

1593
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:09,210
 like electrons electrons that were traveling

1594
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:11,249
 at a speed very

1595
01:22:11,249 --> 01:22:12,960
 small compared to the speed of light um

1596
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,440
 and

1597
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,260
 the that was very

1598
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:25,050
 soon within a couple of years after chandra's equation came out paul dirac came

1599
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:29,940
 up with a thing called the dirac equation the dirac equation was an equation for a relativistic electron

1600
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:33,929
 and it was a very mathematically elegant thing that dirac did

1601
01:22:33,929 --> 01:22:38,909
 and but it had a very weird prediction it said there in addition to there being electrons

1602
01:22:38,909 --> 01:22:41,849
 there should also be anti electrons particles

1603
01:22:41,849 --> 01:22:45,479
 just like the electron same mass same properties

1604
01:22:45,479 --> 01:22:47,460
 but with the negative charge from

1605
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:50,729
 the electrons that the electron usually is said to have charge minus one these

1606
01:22:50,729 --> 01:22:52,229
 will be +1 charge

1607
01:22:52,229 --> 01:22:55,920
 particles with charge plus 1 called them positrons

1608
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,739
 and positrons were the anti particles of the electron

1609
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:03,300
 and the claim was that as soon as you put relativistic mechanics into

1610
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,030
 but as you soon you tried to put relativity into quantum

1611
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:09,150
 mechanics you would end up with the inevitable

1612
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,059
 prediction of antimatter of anti particles to

1613
01:23:12,059 --> 01:23:15,420
 all these different kinds of particles so that was sort of a prediction a mathematical

1614
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:20,880
 prediction made but basically on the basis of the aesthetics of the theory back in in the 1920s

1615
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,820
 that there would be anti particles to the electron the proton etc etc etc

1616
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:26,820
 another

1617
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:34,130
 thing from around that time was howley exclusion principle this is sort of important for understanding

1618
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:38,940
 well is it's a it's a thing that adds a great deal of mathematical complexity to

1619
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:41,550
 quantum mechanics but it's basically the principle

1620
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:45,599
 that when you have quantum mechanical things like electrons in particular you

1621
01:23:45,599 --> 01:23:48,690
 can't stuff too many electrons into the same state

1622
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,420
 and that's kind of what leads to the

1623
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,880
 fact it leads to a lot of what we see in chemistry

1624
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,659
 is we get these kind of shells of electrons and some conceptual

1625
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:59,820
 sense in different kinds of atoms because

1626
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:03,059
 we can't have electrons all sort of clumping together in the same state

1627
01:24:03,059 --> 01:24:05,880
 and that's what leads to probably leads to many

1628
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,800
 features of the stability of matter it's

1629
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,690
 a very important feature of our world

1630
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:15,030
 and that was something came in quite early as somewhat later it was understood that photons

1631
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:17,760
 the exact opposite thing from the exclusion principle they

1632
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,240
 like to come together and much later that led to the invention of things like lasers

1633
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:24,290
 and so on um that was

1634
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:25,290
 so

1635
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:26,300
 um

1636
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,730
 let's see the silicate

1637
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:35,790
 so then we're continuing our sort of trip through through quantum mechanics

1638
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:41,690
 and so on so 1930s well actually let me i mentioned something happened in the 1910s

1639
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:45,230
 so as soon as radioactivity had been discovered

1640
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:48,870
 and been discovered in things like uranium

1641
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:49,230
 and

1642
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,210
 so on there

1643
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:54,600
 was the question it was a weird thing people had balloons even

1644
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,920
 before the wright brothers did their thing there were balloons that could go out to pretty high altitudes

1645
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,660
 and it was observed that

1646
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:07,140
 if you went up to a high altitude you started seeing radioactivity just in in the air okay

1647
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:12,630
 and that was the discovery you think 1912 if i remember correctly of cosmic rays that

1648
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:15,060
 is that there are there is there

1649
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,460
 as there are particles that are streaming mostly

1650
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:20,640
 from the sun at least the low-energy ones come from the sun into

1651
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,940
 the upper atmosphere of the earth and the most of them are absorbed

1652
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,510
 by the time they reached the surface of the earth or there's still some residue on

1653
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:29,940
 the surface of the earth but as you go higher up less

1654
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:33,200
 of it has been absorbed and there's this cosmic radiation cosmic rays

1655
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,200
 okay

1656
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:38,340
 so cosmic rays were our best source of high-energy particles

1657
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,480
 and so

1658
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:45,330
 people did all kinds of experiments they have these emulsion stacks kind of like old-fashioned film and

1659
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:47,700
 and that would work when it's like don't

1660
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,920
 put your x-ray film through the don't

1661
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,530
 don't put your film high-quality film

1662
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:53,670
 through the x-ray scanner

1663
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:59,490
 because it will get the x-rays will will you know eject

1664
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:03,930
 the silver atoms in the in this in the film emulsion of its old-fashioned film well

1665
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:05,700
 that was the kind of the thing

1666
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:11,190
 that was done to detect particles back in the day in these for example balloon experiments

1667
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:12,300
 or experiments on mountains

1668
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,250
 and so on where people would have these emulsion stacks

1669
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:17,820
 and they would look for tracks of particles going through them okay

1670
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,250
 so that happened in the

1671
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:22,820
 so people did that

1672
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:25,309
 in in the 1930s in particular and

1673
01:26:25,309 --> 01:26:30,400
 um was it time trying to remember the

1674
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,119
 yeah the positron

1675
01:26:32,119 --> 01:26:38,619
 which is the anti electron discovered in 1932 the

1676
01:26:38,619 --> 01:26:39,619
 and

1677
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:40,869
 so that was

1678
01:26:40,869 --> 01:26:42,110
 so

1679
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:45,079
 dirac's prediction from the mid 1920s that

1680
01:26:45,079 --> 01:26:46,250
 just sort of on a mathematical

1681
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,230
 basis antimatter must exist there

1682
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:51,559
 must be an antiparticle for the electron that was verified by

1683
01:26:51,559 --> 01:26:56,329
 actually seeing one in a cosmic ray experiment in 1932 well

1684
01:26:56,329 --> 01:27:00,980
 there were also a bunch of other particles that was seen in cosmic ray experiments people

1685
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:04,039
 didn't know quite what they were one of my favorites 1937

1686
01:27:04,039 --> 01:27:06,980
 the muon the muon is just like an electron

1687
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,659
 but 206 times heavier

1688
01:27:08,659 --> 01:27:12,920
 and still to this day we don't really know what muons are other

1689
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,539
 than just the description i gave you

1690
01:27:14,539 --> 01:27:18,650
 um but anyway there was a kind of a zoo of particles that have been discovered

1691
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:22,489
 um that were discovered starting in the 1930s through the 1940s

1692
01:27:22,489 --> 01:27:22,880
 and

1693
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,380
 so on there's another thing that happened in the 1930s a chap called hideki yukawa

1694
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:34,309
 tried to solve the following problem so atomic nucleus is a bunch of protons

1695
01:27:34,309 --> 01:27:38,389
 and neutrons all stuck together okay it was known since coulomb

1696
01:27:38,389 --> 01:27:40,880
 and that like

1697
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,059
 charges like electric charges repel so

1698
01:27:44,059 --> 01:27:48,230
 that meant all the protons in the atomic nucleus would all want to fly apart they

1699
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:50,510
 all wanted to repel each other because they all have the same charge

1700
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:54,619
 so they were all you know trying to trying to sort of break up the nucleus

1701
01:27:54,619 --> 01:27:59,199
 so how come the nucleus stuck together well there had to be some other force

1702
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:00,199
 and

1703
01:28:00,199 --> 01:28:05,420
 so your kawa proposed that there was another force it was a little bit like the

1704
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:09,889
 force of electromagnetism but instead of being a force that was

1705
01:28:09,889 --> 01:28:15,559
 trans would go an infinite distance it was a limited length force that

1706
01:28:15,559 --> 01:28:16,849
 um would

1707
01:28:16,849 --> 01:28:20,389
 go only a fixed distance and he had the idea that

1708
01:28:20,389 --> 01:28:23,389
 that force could be associated with the exchange of a particle

1709
01:28:23,389 --> 01:28:24,110
 so

1710
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:27,679
 by the way i should have mentioned that the photon one

1711
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,610
 feature of the photon that became pretty quickly is that photons are massless they

1712
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:36,230
 have zero mass the electron has a definite mass the proton has a definite mass the

1713
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:38,199
 foe town has zero mass

1714
01:28:38,199 --> 01:28:39,800
 or zero

1715
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,229
 so far as we can tell interesting question

1716
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:46,429
 for my new theory whether it's really true that the elect the photon has absolutely zero mass

1717
01:28:46,429 --> 01:28:49,429
 that is an interesting question which i actually don't know the answer to

1718
01:28:49,429 --> 01:28:52,010
 but i can discuss

1719
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:55,219
 how to figure that out um in any case the for

1720
01:28:55,219 --> 01:29:02,050
 all practical purposes the photon has zero mass if it has a mass it's really really microscopic on

1721
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:05,320
 anyway the

1722
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,699
 so

1723
01:29:06,699 --> 01:29:11,749
 but your car was suggested that maybe there was something that was kind of like a photon

1724
01:29:11,749 --> 01:29:15,889
 but there had a pretty big mass that was a mass kind

1725
01:29:15,889 --> 01:29:19,340
 of like maybe a tenth the mass of a proton that would

1726
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:24,530
 be the the the electron as one 1800s the mass of a proton actually

1727
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:25,880
 it's very light compared to a proton

1728
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:26,440
 um

1729
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,960
 so the

1730
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:29,960
 that

1731
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,869
 there would be um this other particle i'm

1732
01:29:32,869 --> 01:29:36,050
 not sure if he named it anyway it became called the pi on or

1733
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:37,219
 the pi meson i'm

1734
01:29:37,219 --> 01:29:38,829
 not sure if your caller named it um

1735
01:29:38,829 --> 01:29:44,479
 but anyway the he suggested that there might be such a particle

1736
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:48,440
 and that the exchange of those particles between protons might

1737
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,059
 be responsible for the binding

1738
01:29:50,059 --> 01:29:54,289
 the strong nuclear force that bound the protons together into the atomic nucleus

1739
01:29:54,289 --> 01:29:58,159
 and his idea was because it's

1740
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,539
 just a feature of quantum mechanics

1741
01:29:59,539 --> 01:30:04,130
 that if it was a massive particle it has finite range it can only go

1742
01:30:04,130 --> 01:30:09,170
 those that little exchange the process of making what are called virtual particles that

1743
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:11,479
 that can sort of pop into existence

1744
01:30:11,479 --> 01:30:17,479
 and then disappear again for a for a for a photon that can happen over a long

1745
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:19,280
 distance leading to the similar square law

1746
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,449
 but for a massive

1747
01:30:20,449 --> 01:30:25,090
 particle that can happen only over a short distance and the force law has to die off exponentially

1748
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:29,449
 and that was your car was proposal well by the 1940s

1749
01:30:29,449 --> 01:30:33,139
 the pi on the carrier of the strong nuclear force had been observed

1750
01:30:33,139 --> 01:30:36,409
 and it was clear that that theory was correct then

1751
01:30:36,409 --> 01:30:39,800
 there started to be a whole zoo of other particles observed

1752
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:44,389
 now you know another thing that happened late 1930s nuclear fission was discovered

1753
01:30:44,389 --> 01:30:45,889
 and nuclear

1754
01:30:45,889 --> 01:30:51,770
 fission of course led to the development of both it of the the nuclear pile for power stations

1755
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:53,650
 but also to nuclear weapons

1756
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:55,300
 and

1757
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:58,760
 those were first tested in 1945

1758
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:03,160
 and that was it became clear that um

1759
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,160
 the

1760
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:04,850
 so

1761
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:05,360
 so

1762
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,190
 that was you know the manhattan project was

1763
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:11,390
 kind of a big triumph for physics in a sense it was a you

1764
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:14,870
 know it was take this effect that had been predicted

1765
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:17,870
 well this phenomenon of nuclear fission discovered in the late 1930s

1766
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:19,489
 and packaged

1767
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:20,750
 it up and actually

1768
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:23,780
 make a nuclear weapon out of it in a few years and it

1769
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,010
 was a i knew

1770
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:27,739
 many of the people who were involved in that term that

1771
01:31:27,739 --> 01:31:31,670
 project it was a it was a very very

1772
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:37,340
 remarkable kind of scientific achievement independent of what

1773
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:38,870
 one can say about its military uses

1774
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:43,730
 and so on as a pure matter of science it was a remarkable remarkable achievement

1775
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:47,390
 and i think one of the things it did in the u.s. particularly

1776
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:51,380
 was it really launched physics as being this is an important thing i

1777
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:53,090
 mean it also helped that radar

1778
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:54,560
 had been invented in world

1779
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,640
 war two and that

1780
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,140
 was another sort of physics related thing

1781
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,270
 although it was a little bit more on the electrical engineering side

1782
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:01,100
 but the manhattan project was

1783
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:06,200
 really front and center this is physics this is what physics can do for you and basically

1784
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:11,570
 the few billion dollars that was spent on the manhattan project sort of turned into a many

1785
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:15,520
 many millions billions of dollars spent on physics research particularly in the u.s.

1786
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,520
 after

1787
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:20,450
 the second world war that i think in many ways was sort of a a thank-you

1788
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:23,989
 for the for the for the success of the manhattan project that

1789
01:32:23,989 --> 01:32:25,910
 kind of lasted right up until the 1980s

1790
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:28,280
 it kind of lasted for a whole sort of generation

1791
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,680
 or two of physicists that

1792
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:37,150
 was and that that so the manhattan project really kind of launched the interest in

1793
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:41,030
 in in kind of applying

1794
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:43,040
 and sort of the extreme versions of physics

1795
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,650
 and particularly in particle physics and nuclear physics

1796
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:47,210
 and so on in fact um robert

1797
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:50,350
 oppenheimer the person who led the the the manhattan project

1798
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:56,660
 his his sort of other interest his other big interest was in the theory of stars

1799
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:00,410
 and in things about sort of extreme states of matter in stars

1800
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:04,300
 and so on um the

1801
01:33:04,369 --> 01:33:05,369
 okay

1802
01:33:05,369 --> 01:33:08,159
 so so coming back to by

1803
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:11,309
 the way i see people asking questions on the live stream about things like antimatter bombs

1804
01:33:11,309 --> 01:33:14,460
 and so on i'll probably do another one of these science q and a's for

1805
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:17,340
 kids and others that's a be a great topic for for

1806
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:20,280
 that but let me not to derail on that subject here

1807
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,270
 um the

1808
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:24,800
 so

1809
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,750
 the question

1810
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:27,750
 so

1811
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:34,289
 it's only way one of the consequences of the manhattan project was it really launched let's study nuclear

1812
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:40,710
 physics at the lowest possible level let's study particle physics let's study subatomic particles let's study

1813
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:46,260
 what were then often called elementary particles that study high-energy physics it

1814
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:51,090
 it launched the idea of building particle accelerators particle accelerators are big the

1815
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:54,000
 kind of a big adventure and electromagnetic come you

1816
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,599
 know they're their typical particle accelerator you've got some bunch of magnets

1817
01:33:57,599 --> 01:34:01,199
 and you're using those to accelerate particles along a track sometimes

1818
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:04,199
 those tracks are like twenty kilometers in circumference

1819
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:08,190
 and the particles go very very very fast 99.999

1820
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:13,110
 percent or more of the speed of light and it's usually either electrons positrons or protons

1821
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:15,869
 or anti protons that are accelerated in those things

1822
01:34:15,869 --> 01:34:21,110
 and they're also linear accelerators a big one of those if you drive down

1823
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:23,340
 oh gosh

1824
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,320
 what is the freeway in california

1825
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:29,190
 i'm forgetting the one that's parallel for the 101 in silicon valley -

1826
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:32,610
 ten - ten all right no forget anyway

1827
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:39,260
 if you if you're crossover the stanford linear accelerator center this big long

1828
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:43,110
 big long linear accelerator that accelerates electrons um

1829
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:50,900
 and as place where a bunch of physics discoveries were made but in any case i'm the

1830
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:56,580
 in a case the the the thing that

1831
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:59,860
 so particle accelerators started

1832
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:03,550
 sort of coming online late 1940s early 1950s lots

1833
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:07,480
 of particles got discovered in particle accelerators a whole zoo of particles got discovered

1834
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:08,350
 um

1835
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:12,780
 and so one of the big sort of challenges was what are all these particles

1836
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:13,780
 um

1837
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:14,380
 and

1838
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:17,380
 okay that was that was sort of one branch was

1839
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:21,310
 what are all these particles what's this whole zoo of particles the other branch was let's

1840
01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:25,060
 take quantum field theory the thing that sort of been invented in late 1920s

1841
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,280
 more seriously let's try in particular

1842
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:32,080
 and just nail one thing the interaction of photons with electrons

1843
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:32,830
 um

1844
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:36,219
 and let's try and figure out what was called quantum electrodynamics

1845
01:35:36,219 --> 01:35:39,340
 and so in the 1940s that

1846
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:42,190
 was a sort of a big thing figure out quantum electrodynamics

1847
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:43,660
 um well

1848
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:48,429
 a lot of things could be figured out but there was some some serious problems

1849
01:35:48,429 --> 01:35:53,800
 one might say the most important serious problem was that when you tried to compute things

1850
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:58,210
 in quantum electrodynamics the answer you usually got was infinity usually

1851
01:35:58,210 --> 01:35:59,110
 you would get integrals

1852
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:00,790
 which were of the form basically dx

1853
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:04,780
 over x and the world integrals d k over k where k is momentum

1854
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:08,830
 you would say i want to consider this sort of virtual

1855
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:13,750
 particle that had a momentum that was as large as you want and when

1856
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:18,190
 the momentum was sufficiently large the contribution to for example the probability that

1857
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:21,640
 an electron would scatter a photon was

1858
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:28,330
 proportional to this integral dk over k which which increased logarithmically as that's

1859
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:29,770
 an integral where they were the answer

1860
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:32,710
 if you take the upper limit to be infinity the answer is infinite

1861
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:33,640
 okay

1862
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,510
 so so

1863
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:36,850
 that was kind of a big downer for quantum electrodynamics

1864
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:39,840
 was the answers ended up all being infinite umm

1865
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,940
 now meanwhile i should

1866
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,469
 have said that two people

1867
01:36:44,469 --> 01:36:47,770
 had you know where there's a big wave of excitement about quantization

1868
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:55,390
 everything must be quantized you know matter is quantized protons electrons spin is quantized light is quantized angular

1869
01:36:55,390 --> 01:37:00,880
 the all sorts of other things about some the mechanics of particles are quantized everything

1870
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:05,380
 must be quantized even space people imagine mainly space is quantized well

1871
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:08,790
 they didn't manage to make work that was always a something incompatible

1872
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:12,780
 with with relativity to make space quantized coming

1873
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:15,750
 next week you might see something different there but at

1874
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,810
 least at that time it was spaces

1875
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:22,100
 is a continuous thing not something made of discrete elements in any way

1876
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:24,150
 so the

1877
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:26,660
 but in a case back in the 1940s

1878
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:32,220
 people tried to compute things about quantum electrodynamics big problem with infinities person

1879
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:37,200
 who was a good friend of mine dick feynman one of his early contributions was

1880
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,090
 to kind of explain away the infinities

1881
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,320
 and be

1882
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,260
 able to calculate even in the face of the infinities he

1883
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:46,980
 never really liked what he did okay he invented this thing called realization

1884
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:50,190
 and the idea was you get an infinity

1885
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:56,490
 but that infinity is when you actually make a measurement on an electron

1886
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:58,560
 you are really

1887
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,620
 you're measuring but let's see if you started

1888
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:02,940
 off with a bare electron

1889
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:06,870
 electron didn't have any photons around it at all then you'd

1890
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:12,780
 you'd say it has a certain mass for example but then you let the photons

1891
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:18,150
 interact with it and so on and then you get an infinite answer for things okay fine well

1892
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:20,190
 now you say well actually maybe

1893
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:24,060
 i could have taken the bare mass of the electron to be minus infinity and

1894
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,130
 so this infinite amount that

1895
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:29,130
 you're adding to it that's associated with all the photons interacting

1896
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:31,830
 with it it's just minus infinity plus infinity and

1897
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:35,580
 it's like well we can just say the answer is the mass of the electron a little

1898
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,320
 bit more satisfactorily

1899
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,810
 you would say well all of this infinite stuff

1900
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:42,030
 that's going on that's happening to every electron

1901
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:47,040
 what we really care about is the is the difference between what

1902
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,180
 happens to this electron

1903
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:52,440
 that we poked this way and this electron we didn't poke and so we

1904
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:55,890
 can just think about it as mineralization is kind of this way of saying we'll

1905
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:57,990
 just look at the difference between these

1906
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:59,760
 things ignoring the infinities

1907
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,530
 and so it turned out that there were just three infinities in quantum electrodynamics and

1908
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:07,710
 once you said okay we'll we'll just say

1909
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:11,250
 that all those three infinities are sort of factored out then

1910
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:12,960
 everything else in quantum electrodynamics was

1911
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,060
 computable it's really computable

1912
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:19,590
 i mean you can actually compute to like you know eight

1913
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:22,530
 decimal digits of accuracy you can actually compute

1914
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:26,460
 all of these things it's it's the most elaborate successful

1915
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:29,670
 calculation in all of physics is calculations

1916
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:33,450
 they used to take it used to be done with algebraic computation systems in

1917
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:36,090
 the early days and they used to take years of cpu

1918
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:37,260
 time and so on to

1919
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,180
 compute that the big thing was the anomalous

1920
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,280
 magnetic moment of the electron was

1921
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,620
 the thing which was sort of most elaborately computed

1922
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,770
 and you would you would be able to write down thus

1923
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:52,140
 essentially power series for that in powers of the so-called fine structure constant one over hundred thirty-seven

1924
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,250
 and you

1925
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:54,960
 could the computing the coefficients

1926
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,510
 was like this years of computer time thing and you

1927
01:39:57,510 --> 01:40:00,030
 could measure it and it was exactly right there's

1928
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:03,330
 very impressive result of quantum electrodynamics through

1929
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:05,550
 from the 1940s onwards after analyzation

1930
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:06,990
 had gotten rid of the the

1931
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:10,700
 kind of oh we don't know what's going on type type thing that was what happened

1932
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:12,260
 so

1933
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:13,260
 okay

1934
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:16,410
 so that was that was quantum electrodynamics

1935
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:22,590
 so another thing that came up in the 1940s was sort of a reinterpretation of quantum mechanics the

1936
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:26,700
 sort of schroeder introversion the heisenberg version these were ways to compute things in quantum mechanics

1937
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,790
 um the

1938
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:31,760
 it's some

1939
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,760
 it's

1940
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:36,480
 some this thing called the path integral also

1941
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,710
 invented by dick feynman is this way to to

1942
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:44,220
 say what is quantum mechanics really well

1943
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:49,320
 his version of it was that quantum mechanics quotes is something

1944
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,970
 where you're summing over all possible

1945
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:56,430
 paths you're saying this could happen in all these possible ways and it gives you essentially a prescription

1946
01:40:56,430 --> 01:41:02,070
 for saying the probability that the thing will happen is the sum of the paths of some

1947
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:05,610
 of all possible paths with a certain weighting factor that's mathematically determined

1948
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:06,240
 and by

1949
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,670
 the way and i know i'm this is really bad i shouldn't

1950
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:11,220
 be doing this it's like i i'm we

1951
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:14,040
 now know why the particle works it's very exciting

1952
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,710
 and it has a very beautiful correspondence

1953
01:41:16,710 --> 01:41:19,080
 to the way things work and grab it in the theory of gravity

1954
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:23,130
 but any case that's some see

1955
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:24,660
 i'm i'm actually very

1956
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:26,610
 poor at being patient and doing

1957
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:30,270
 these things but i want to get it so that i've actually got sort of more

1958
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:36,370
 or less the full story ready to say and that will happen next week but any case the

1959
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:37,880
 coming back to

1960
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,080
 what happened

1961
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:45,680
 so quantum field theory quantum electrodynamics great successes 1940s through 1960s meanwhile

1962
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,660
 1950s to early 1960s

1963
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:52,160
 this whole zoo of particles being discovered they have all kinds of exotic names you

1964
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:58,460
 know the the well they were the mesons the baryons the hyper owns the they

1965
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:00,230
 have all kinds of names i when

1966
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:01,550
 i was a kid i used to

1967
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:02,480
 really be into particle

1968
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,760
 physics and i could tell you they probably recite

1969
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:08,180
 the the names you know there were the pi ons there were the kaos

1970
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:10,880
 there was the eight a particle those amazon's

1971
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,070
 there was the there

1972
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:15,110
 were things like go there was the 5s

1973
01:42:15,110 --> 01:42:16,790
 on the f mazon then

1974
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:19,610
 there were the baryons the the lambda

1975
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:22,430
 hyper on the sigma hyper ons that i'm

1976
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:23,810
 drawing them in a picture

1977
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:25,850
 because they usually arranged

1978
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:29,570
 that these some theory of lee groups gives us a way to sort

1979
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:33,590
 of have this way of arranging these particles in these definite configuration

1980
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:35,600
 anyway lots and lots of particles discovered

1981
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,820
 so the point where there were hundreds of these things knowing

1982
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:39,130
 and the question was

1983
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:40,130
 what

1984
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:42,250
 um

1985
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:46,580
 you know what what are you know

1986
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:48,380
 what are all these particles you

1987
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:51,470
 know how can we explain them you know we this was supposed to be elementary particles

1988
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:53,480
 the world was supposed to be made of these things but

1989
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:56,270
 now we've got hundreds of them this is not you

1990
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:57,730
 know the world is made of something simple

1991
01:42:57,730 --> 01:42:58,730
 okay

1992
01:42:58,730 --> 01:43:02,900
 so there were two basic theories that developed the the first theory

1993
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:04,790
 which came out of a thing called s matrix theory

1994
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:08,030
 and another thing that sort of came out of a quantum field theory tradition

1995
01:43:08,030 --> 01:43:12,200
 so the the s matrix idea

1996
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:15,530
 which kind of emerged all that first was the following idea

1997
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:17,660
 so it was like like

1998
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:19,370
 just think about particles

1999
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:22,280
 colliding with each other and just say when

2000
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,610
 particles collide you can describe the probabilities of those collisions

2001
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:33,020
 and then you will write down essentially mathematical relations between different particle collision probabilities

2002
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:37,100
 and that was packaged up in a thing called the s matrix and there

2003
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:41,120
 were properties of the s matrix the s matrix was a function of many complex variables

2004
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:45,500
 it had all kinds of elaborate kind of consistency

2005
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:46,940
 conditions about the s matrix

2006
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:51,590
 and the idea of s matrix theory was it just said look don't

2007
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:53,870
 worry how it actually works inside just

2008
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:55,370
 know that there are these constraints

2009
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:58,400
 on the s matrix and try and compute what must happen and from

2010
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:01,280
 that came this thing called the bootstrap hypothesis for particles

2011
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,970
 which

2012
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:04,700
 was the idea that no particle is really any more elementary

2013
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:05,780
 than any other all

2014
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:08,000
 these particles just sort of emerge as

2015
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,340
 some sort of consistency condition from each other

2016
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:10,910
 okay

2017
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:13,460
 so that was theory number one okay

2018
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:15,140
 theory number two which

2019
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:18,410
 emerged in 1964 ish particularly

2020
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:21,440
 another friend of mine named murray gell-mann um was

2021
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,360
 responsible for this one together

2022
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:28,810
 with person called george reich who is also a good friend of mine i'm the

2023
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:32,290
 was this idea of of quarks

2024
01:44:32,290 --> 01:44:33,290
 so

2025
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:35,900
 the idea of course was maybe

2026
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:39,530
 these particles like protons aren't actually elementary maybe

2027
01:44:39,530 --> 01:44:43,160
 inside a proton there are actually in the case of a proton three quarks

2028
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,750
 and originally

2029
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:50,120
 marika man kind of invented that idea a little bit like the way that you know dalton

2030
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:54,380
 had done the atomic theory of just sort of counting things and looking at how

2031
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:56,150
 what constituents

2032
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:59,120
 would have to exist just to make the numbers work out although

2033
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:03,950
 murray sort of packaged that in a somewhat more elaborate theory of li algebras

2034
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:09,170
 and li groups theory of sort of fancy mathematics of symmetries

2035
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:13,700
 but in case what it really came down to was you just count if

2036
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:16,250
 there are quarks they have to have these properties

2037
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:20,150
 and then you could make three quarks would make a proton

2038
01:45:20,150 --> 01:45:22,820
 a quark and an antiquark would make a pi on there

2039
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:24,080
 will be three kinds of quarks

2040
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,630
 and up down a strange they were originally called pn

2041
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:27,140
 and lambda

2042
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:29,990
 but but in modern times they called up down and strange

2043
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:34,340
 um the in a case the the that was the idea that inside

2044
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:36,620
 the proton that we'd be three quarks now

2045
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:37,640
 there was a problem there

2046
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,460
 because it was like well why don't we seek walks out

2047
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:42,740
 and out in the wild well

2048
01:45:42,740 --> 01:45:46,520
 there would have to be some mechanism that would confine the quarks unlike

2049
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,380
 an atomic nucleus which could undergo fission

2050
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:48,770
 and

2051
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:51,320
 where the pieces of the nucleus the neutrons

2052
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:55,910
 and things like that would just sort of you know you know come out that

2053
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:59,900
 couldn't be the case with quarks because what seemed like we didn't see any free quarks

2054
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:01,790
 so that was kind of a weird feature of that theory

2055
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:02,750
 okay

2056
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:04,429
 so then that

2057
01:46:04,429 --> 01:46:07,969
 was quark theory versus the of

2058
01:46:07,969 --> 01:46:13,940
 the the s-matrix theory it seemed like the s-matrix theory was winning in the 1960s

2059
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:15,230
 it really seemed like it was winning

2060
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:19,909
 um actually one of the things that got made from from that s-matrix

2061
01:46:19,909 --> 01:46:23,540
 theory was a very elaborate piece of mathematics that

2062
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:27,350
 was string theory well at least it was the first version of string theory it

2063
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:28,880
 was a theory of strong

2064
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:33,760
 interactions that was sort of mathematically derived from the whole s-matrix setup

2065
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:34,760
 okay

2066
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:38,199
 so by the late 1960s

2067
01:46:38,199 --> 01:46:41,350
 something that was being done was the thing called deep inelastic scattering

2068
01:46:41,350 --> 01:46:45,040
 so just like rutherford discovered the nucleus by

2069
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:48,980
 bouncing by by shooting alpha particles at um at atoms

2070
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:50,210
 and noticing

2071
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,320
 that most of the time i just went

2072
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:54,320
 through but some of the times they got bounced back so

2073
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,719
 um

2074
01:46:55,719 --> 01:46:59,090
 a particular person called hofstadter father

2075
01:46:59,090 --> 01:47:05,090
 of douglas hofstadter um was was one of the main people who was involved in

2076
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:08,900
 and there was several other people involved in that um involved

2077
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:12,860
 particularly at slac actually the stanford linear accelerator center the thing that

2078
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:18,699
 you can see from the freeway whose name i've now forgotten um the

2079
01:47:18,699 --> 01:47:19,699
 that's

2080
01:47:19,699 --> 01:47:21,230
 gonna drive me crazy that i can't remember

2081
01:47:21,230 --> 01:47:22,429
 that but anyway maybe somebody

2082
01:47:22,429 --> 01:47:25,630
 can put it on the live stream i'm the

2083
01:47:25,630 --> 01:47:30,610
 in any case the

2084
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:31,630
 so

2085
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:32,989
 same idea

2086
01:47:32,989 --> 01:47:39,199
 but for protons instead of for for atoms shoot high-energy electrons at protons

2087
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:40,100
 and see what happens

2088
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:44,270
 so what happened in most of the time the electron would go straight through but some

2089
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:46,030
 of the time it would bounce back

2090
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:47,030
 and

2091
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:50,120
 so that meant that there was some kind of hard bit inside

2092
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:54,400
 the proton well at least that was one interpretation of what was observed in deep inelastic scattering

2093
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,400
 so

2094
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,340
 um

2095
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:01,540
 the that was

2096
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:02,540
 well

2097
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:05,090
 actually dick feynman was involved in in inventing

2098
01:48:05,090 --> 01:48:07,550
 this thing these things he called part ons which

2099
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:12,610
 was supposed to be the parts of protons well it became clear

2100
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:14,800
 that basically

2101
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:17,679
 that it looked like part ons might be quacks it

2102
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:21,130
 looked like in these experiments one might be seeing some sort of constituents

2103
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:24,639
 inside inside protons um ok

2104
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:30,429
 they've been another development in the 1950s a thing called the yang-mills theory was

2105
01:48:30,429 --> 01:48:35,110
 invented yang-mills theory was a generalization of the theory of electromagnetism

2106
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:38,440
 but electromagnetism can

2107
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,310
 be thought of as

2108
01:48:39,310 --> 01:48:41,560
 a so-called gauge theory a theory

2109
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:44,560
 that's associated with a local symmetry a local

2110
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,520
 and it's associated with a local symmetry group there's just rotations around a circle

2111
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:49,600
 so yang

2112
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:50,800
 and mills had

2113
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,500
 this idea well maybe there's a generalization of that that

2114
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,810
 involves not just the symmetry of going around a circle

2115
01:48:55,810 --> 01:48:59,380
 but a cemetery that would be for example essentially of going anywhere

2116
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:04,119
 around a sphere or something like this or or some slight generalizations of that um

2117
01:49:04,119 --> 01:49:04,449
 and

2118
01:49:04,449 --> 01:49:09,520
 so they invented this thing they called yang-mills theory it was a pure sort of it

2119
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,139
 was a pure sort of theoretical idea

2120
01:49:11,139 --> 01:49:14,409
 and maybe they thought it might be related to the strongly perforce

2121
01:49:14,409 --> 01:49:17,590
 some way but they didn't quite know how ok

2122
01:49:17,590 --> 01:49:21,449
 so that led in

2123
01:49:21,449 --> 01:49:22,739
 to

2124
01:49:22,739 --> 01:49:25,199
 that that theory

2125
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:26,199
 so

2126
01:49:26,199 --> 01:49:30,969
 called non abelian gauge theories led to well

2127
01:49:30,969 --> 01:49:34,780
 actually led to two things i i'm getting them see

2128
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:35,949
 this is now that

2129
01:49:35,949 --> 01:49:40,389
 this history gets more complicated for me because we're head hitting the part of this history

2130
01:49:40,389 --> 01:49:43,389
 where i was actually involved in certain ways so um

2131
01:49:43,389 --> 01:49:46,750
 by the time i got involved in particle physics around 1974

2132
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:47,320
 um

2133
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:47,770
 and

2134
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:49,030
 so it's always

2135
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:51,159
 it's always the worst is always

2136
01:49:51,159 --> 01:49:53,110
 remembering the history that involved

2137
01:49:53,110 --> 01:49:57,659
 that that one was involved in but any case the

2138
01:49:57,659 --> 01:50:00,159
 okay another little sideshow here

2139
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:03,699
 oh yeah 280 that's that that's the freeway that that

2140
01:50:03,699 --> 01:50:05,230
 i was forgetting that's

2141
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:07,540
 the one that crosses over the stefan

2142
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:12,540
 area accelerators hunter i'm the

2143
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:16,619
 in any case the

2144
01:50:16,619 --> 01:50:17,619
 okay

2145
01:50:17,619 --> 01:50:21,190
 so so back to this i'm i'm gonna try

2146
01:50:21,190 --> 01:50:23,650
 and i don't have too much more to talk about but

2147
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:24,670
 but i was gonna try

2148
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:26,079
 and get us up to modern times

2149
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:28,499
 um and then

2150
01:50:28,499 --> 01:50:29,499
 yeah

2151
01:50:29,499 --> 01:50:30,630
 okay

2152
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:32,730
 um

2153
01:50:32,730 --> 01:50:39,570
 okay

2154
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:40,570
 we're

2155
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:44,289
 still in the 1950s we're talking about some yang-mills

2156
01:50:44,289 --> 01:50:46,840
 theory i'm gonna mention one more thing that happened

2157
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:47,969
 okay

2158
01:50:47,969 --> 01:50:48,969
 so

2159
01:50:48,969 --> 01:50:56,260
 when atomic nuclei decay in radioactivity there are three forms of radioactivity that were embedded were identified

2160
01:50:56,260 --> 01:51:00,219
 pretty early alpha beta and gamma decay they're

2161
01:51:00,219 --> 01:51:04,179
 all their mechanisms are completely different alpha

2162
01:51:04,179 --> 01:51:06,999
 decay is just like throwing out a piece of helium nucleus

2163
01:51:06,999 --> 01:51:08,440
 and beta

2164
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:12,039
 decay is an interesting one beta decay involves the emission of an electron or

2165
01:51:12,039 --> 01:51:13,690
 positron from a nucleus

2166
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:16,690
 and that is a form of the way in which it decays

2167
01:51:16,690 --> 01:51:18,480
 and

2168
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,480
 many

2169
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:27,179
 famous things like carbon-14 decays that way a lot lots of things decay that way so the

2170
01:51:27,179 --> 01:51:28,179
 beta

2171
01:51:28,179 --> 01:51:31,690
 decay not really well understood i

2172
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:34,599
 talked about the strong nuclear force beta

2173
01:51:34,599 --> 01:51:37,889
 decay was often said to be associated with the weak nuclear force

2174
01:51:37,889 --> 01:51:38,889
 okay

2175
01:51:38,889 --> 01:51:43,570
 well the people didn't know that much about the weak nuclear force but one thing that was

2176
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:51,719
 observed in beta decay in 1957 i think was a very weird phenomenon called parity violation

2177
01:51:51,719 --> 01:51:52,719
 okay

2178
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:53,650
 so when

2179
01:51:53,650 --> 01:51:56,380
 you think about the laws of physics there are certain invariances

2180
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:58,449
 that are usually true like for example we

2181
01:51:58,449 --> 01:52:01,260
 don't imagine that if we

2182
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,940
 if we just turned

2183
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:07,989
 something turn some physical system upside down ignore gravity we

2184
01:52:07,989 --> 01:52:09,489
 turn it upside down we'd

2185
01:52:09,489 --> 01:52:13,030
 think it still worked the same way the laws of physics will be the same if we turn

2186
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,630
 the thing upside

2187
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:16,840
 down you might also think the laws of physics will be the same if we reflect the

2188
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:18,249
 whole thing in a mirror we

2189
01:52:18,249 --> 01:52:20,739
 would still it wouldn't be that it will be the case that just

2190
01:52:20,739 --> 01:52:23,650
 as something could happen this way if we reflect in a mirror it could

2191
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:26,230
 happen the way we would see in the reflection in the mirror

2192
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:28,180
 okay well that's all very well

2193
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:29,380
 and good except

2194
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:34,360
 that it turned out that that mirror reflection symmetry didn't apply to nuclear beta decay

2195
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:40,120
 and it was discovered in 1957 that basically the that

2196
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,620
 you could have an asymmetry

2197
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:48,270
 in nature in the emission of in the in the angular distribution of electrons in the decay of

2198
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:50,280
 of nuclei

2199
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:54,690
 there was this thing called parity violation the violation of

2200
01:52:54,690 --> 01:52:57,810
 invariants under

2201
01:52:57,810 --> 01:53:01,620
 under just sort of mirror reflection of everything

2202
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:04,570
 much later it was realized

2203
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:08,620
 so another feature of beta decay was that it seemed like something weird was happening

2204
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:13,060
 because there was a question of how momentum was conserved because electrons would come out and

2205
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:15,310
 it was like they would shoot off in some direction

2206
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:19,420
 but the nucleus wouldn't recoil the way you would expect from a momentum conservation and

2207
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:23,920
 so then pauli suggested the idea that maybe there was an unseen particle

2208
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:26,920
 and neutrino he called it and that was a particle

2209
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:30,160
 that wasn't detected that was in neutral electrically neutral particle

2210
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:34,090
 you couldn't see with a particle detector was going off the opposite direction from the electron

2211
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:35,350
 and turned

2212
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:42,940
 out the the the main result actually is that neutrinos are always left-handed there's you you well with

2213
01:53:42,940 --> 01:53:44,920
 a slight exception about neutrino oscillations

2214
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:48,550
 but let's not worry about that for the most part neutrinos are always left-handed

2215
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:52,870
 and that's why this that's a way of understanding this parity violation phenomenon

2216
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:56,950
 you don't find equal numbers of left and right-handed neutrinos you only find left-handed neutrinos

2217
01:53:56,950 --> 01:54:00,670
 and so that's the so that was the sort of explanation

2218
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:04,480
 which became clear only a number of years later for

2219
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:07,780
 parity violation but anyway that was a phenomenon discovered 1957

2220
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:11,470
 discovery of sort of features of the weak nuclear force there

2221
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:15,460
 was kind of a question of how did the weak nuclear force relate to other

2222
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:20,620
 things we knew like electromagnetism feature of the weak nuclear force it's really weak compared to electromagnetism

2223
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:21,840
 it has a really short range

2224
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,230
 so strong

2225
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:27,550
 and close force has certain range weak nuclear force has a much smaller range weakly

2226
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:31,090
 a force in some sense has a range that is about

2227
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:34,930
 2,000 times smaller than the range of the strong nuclear force it

2228
01:54:34,930 --> 01:54:38,410
 wasn't known how that worked was suggested 1967

2229
01:54:38,410 --> 01:54:40,030
 or so byam

2230
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:40,990
 steve weinberg

2231
01:54:40,990 --> 01:54:45,630
 and abdus salam that

2232
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:50,140
 that there was kind of a possible theory of the weak nuclear force

2233
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:53,260
 and a way to sort of unify it with electromagnetism

2234
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:59,050
 and in in kind of a tradition of we don't have enough particles yet typed thing they they're

2235
01:54:59,050 --> 01:55:02,380
 what came out of that was the idea that there were yet more particles just

2236
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:05,650
 like there were photons that were carriers of electromagnetism there

2237
01:55:05,650 --> 01:55:07,210
 would also be w bosons

2238
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:11,380
 and z bosons that will be carriers of the weak nuclear force

2239
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:13,930
 but they would have a very high mass which would

2240
01:55:13,930 --> 01:55:16,110
 lead to this short range for the weak nuclear force

2241
01:55:16,110 --> 01:55:17,110
 okay

2242
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:20,200
 so that was that was something that emerged that was a that

2243
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,000
 was an example of a local gauge theory

2244
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,510
 it was a local gauge theory based on the group su 2 cross u 1

2245
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:26,470
 okay

2246
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:32,200
 so then in the in the by the early 70s this idea of local

2247
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:35,830
 gauge theories was like all the rage and there was another local gauge theory

2248
01:55:35,830 --> 01:55:38,470
 that was suggested for the strong nuclear force

2249
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:40,630
 and su3 local gauge theory in

2250
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:44,620
 which the carriers of that force will be things that got called gluons like

2251
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:47,200
 quarks they would be confined inside the proton

2252
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:50,350
 but they would be another thing it

2253
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:51,280
 was kind of like a photon

2254
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,600
 except not really like a photon

2255
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:55,060
 except they were massless except unlike photons

2256
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:57,790
 which don't interact with each other directly gluons

2257
01:55:57,790 --> 01:56:00,870
 would have a an interaction glue on to glue on interaction

2258
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:01,870
 so

2259
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:05,110
 okay so that was all sort of a nice mathematical thing

2260
01:56:05,110 --> 01:56:09,280
 but honestly people didn't really believe people believed the s-matrix theory of strong interactions

2261
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:12,850
 was the way it went until 1973 1973

2262
01:56:12,850 --> 01:56:16,380
 a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom was discovered

2263
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:17,490
 the

2264
01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:19,110
 and

2265
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:23,560
 this was came out of a kind of mathematical development

2266
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:25,540
 called the renormalization group that

2267
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:28,990
 had been part of that had been sort of an offshoot of the renovation idea

2268
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:31,690
 but basically what was discovered was that

2269
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:35,680
 if you kind of looked at a strong interaction

2270
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:38,410
 if you looked at one of these gluon interactions at

2271
01:56:38,410 --> 01:56:42,160
 a very short range if you were like the

2272
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:47,500
 way that things working in quantum mechanics through the uncertainty principle is short

2273
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:51,370
 distance is kind of equivalent to high energy or high momentum transfer

2274
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:51,820
 so

2275
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:56,050
 if you kick something a lot it's like probing it at a very short distance so

2276
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:56,619
 what

2277
01:56:56,619 --> 01:57:01,540
 what this said was this asymptotic freedom idea said one could do a calculation

2278
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:06,690
 which showed that if you kick things really hard in this

2279
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:10,139
 su3 gauge theory that was called qcd quantum chromodynamics

2280
01:57:10,139 --> 01:57:12,330
 um that

2281
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:14,409
 that it would be the case that

2282
01:57:14,409 --> 01:57:17,010
 um that the um

2283
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:18,460
 the quarks

2284
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:19,989
 and the gluons would behave

2285
01:57:19,989 --> 01:57:22,150
 as if they were almost free particles

2286
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:24,790
 as if they didn't really have this very tight binding

2287
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:27,310
 the strong nuclear force associated with them um

2288
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:28,239
 and

2289
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:32,260
 so that was kind of so that was kind of a theoretical idea

2290
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:34,869
 but it became clear that these deep inelastic scattering experiments

2291
01:57:34,869 --> 01:57:36,670
 have pretty much seen this phenomenon they'd

2292
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:39,790
 seen the idea that when you kick the thing hard enough it behaves

2293
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:41,590
 like it's a very free

2294
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:44,349
 particle that can just bounce around anyway at once rather

2295
01:57:44,349 --> 01:57:46,840
 than being this this tightly confined thing

2296
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,639
 that can't do much so

2297
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:52,090
 that was in 1973 sort of big transition in physics the

2298
01:57:52,090 --> 01:57:56,290
 realization quantum field theory is it you know we can compute things with quantum field theory

2299
01:57:56,290 --> 01:57:57,610
 and there was a huge

2300
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:59,050
 sort of i was

2301
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:02,219
 involved in particle physics at that time there was sort of a huge

2302
01:58:02,219 --> 01:58:04,270
 rush of excitement about

2303
01:58:04,270 --> 01:58:06,699
 what one could do in in physics using

2304
01:58:06,699 --> 01:58:11,139
 the ideas of quantum field theory actually it was really fueled in 1974 by

2305
01:58:11,139 --> 01:58:15,460
 the fact that there was two very surprising discoveries one was electrons

2306
01:58:15,460 --> 01:58:18,489
 and positrons annihilated other they turned into two photons

2307
01:58:18,489 --> 01:58:21,340
 or into other kinds of things the

2308
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:26,770
 when you sort of crashed them into each other at high high energy it

2309
01:58:26,770 --> 01:58:29,560
 turned out the probability that they would annihilate went

2310
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:32,469
 up in a way that people didn't expect and then

2311
01:58:32,469 --> 01:58:38,170
 i think was in november 1974 i think of the japes aught jpi particle was discovered

2312
01:58:38,170 --> 01:58:40,540
 it was a new particle that had

2313
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:42,610
 a mass of 3 point 1 gev about

2314
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:43,869
 3 times the mass of the proton

2315
01:58:43,869 --> 01:58:47,730
 and nobody really expected it would be that big surprise

2316
01:58:47,730 --> 01:58:48,730
 so

2317
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:51,070
 that was that was sort of the the the beginning

2318
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:54,550
 of the sort of supercharging of particle physics which kind of lost it through the 1970s

2319
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:59,349
 and people like me i was 14 years old at the time kind of got excited about

2320
01:58:59,349 --> 01:59:01,030
 what was this particle can we explain

2321
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:04,360
 what was going on etc etc etc um turned

2322
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:08,820
 out that particle was actually evidence of a new kind of so-called charm quark

2323
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:12,670
 and that was sort of an unexpected discovery in physics

2324
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:17,830
 and that really made it clear that this whole gauge theory kind of quantum

2325
01:59:17,830 --> 01:59:20,980
 field theory thing that was really it that was kind of really

2326
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:21,940
 the thing that was working

2327
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:23,980
 so that kind of fueled

2328
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:25,540
 a lot of work another

2329
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:27,010
 sort of unexpected discovery

2330
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:28,540
 was made in 1977

2331
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:31,600
 the thing called the b quark was discovered also

2332
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,860
 a thing called the tau leptin

2333
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:34,270
 which was i mentioned the muon

2334
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:36,220
 which is kind of like just like the electron

2335
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:39,310
 but 206 times heavier there's also the tau leptin

2336
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:43,090
 which is just like the the muon

2337
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:47,520
 but gosh it has a mass of about 1.7

2338
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,270
 gev i'd

2339
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:51,850
 have to do the math which i can't immediately do in my head but it's about

2340
01:59:51,850 --> 01:59:56,940
 um it's about

2341
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:59,790
 it's about

2342
01:59:59,790 --> 02:00:05,310
 thousands of to thousand times three thousand times heavier than me i'm than the electron

2343
02:00:05,310 --> 02:00:07,120
 um anyway

2344
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:11,830
 so those things were all discovered the the other big thing that happened

2345
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:14,080
 okay i'm leaving out the thing

2346
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:19,060
 called spontaneously broken gauge theory so one of the issues have been renormalization important

2347
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:22,390
 idea let you calculate things in quantum electrodynamics question

2348
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:28,060
 was were these other gauge theories including these ones that involved things like the w

2349
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:31,060
 and z particles that were very high mass particles

2350
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:37,720
 or even just electrons that had nonzero mass were these things also realisable

2351
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:40,420
 and in the simplest way of setting things up they were not realizable

2352
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:41,950
 you couldn't i mentioned

2353
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:44,110
 that in qed in quantum electrodynamics there

2354
02:00:44,110 --> 02:00:45,370
 were just these three infinities

2355
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:47,860
 that showed up in these other theories you'd

2356
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:50,950
 compute something you get an infinity you compute something else you get another infinity

2357
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:52,870
 you just kept on getting new infinities

2358
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:56,950
 and that meant really couldn't predict anything you didn't have a finite number of infinities that

2359
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:59,290
 you had to just sort of get rid of um the

2360
02:00:59,290 --> 02:01:01,500
 so in any case then

2361
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:07,980
 it was some when was that that must have been early 70s

2362
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:10,360
 it was it

2363
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:12,250
 was realized that through

2364
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:17,370
 the higgs mechanism for generating mass you would be able to get massive particles

2365
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:20,290
 without breaking realisability

2366
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:23,560
 and it was proved that in fact these theories were renormalizable

2367
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:26,950
 the higgs particle was kind of this weird way this

2368
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:28,960
 weird thing that i always thought was a total cluj

2369
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:33,460
 and i was pretty disappointed when the hid particle was actually discovered in what 2015

2370
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,560
 or so

2371
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:35,560
 because

2372
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:39,220
 i'd really thought this cluj cannot possibly actually be right anyway

2373
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:41,710
 it was it's a way of of understanding

2374
02:01:41,710 --> 02:01:44,620
 how mass arises for particles like electrons and

2375
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:47,170
 so on and kind of the idea is well

2376
02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:52,180
 the particle doesn't really have a mass but throughout the universe we're back to ether again throughout

2377
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:53,530
 the universe there's

2378
02:01:53,530 --> 02:01:56,530
 this higgs field that sort of is

2379
02:01:56,530 --> 02:02:03,160
 spread throughout the universe and as the electron goes through this higgs field it's effectively a generating

2380
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,840
 a mass and again

2381
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:05,860
 there is no ether

2382
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:07,360
 but there is an ether but

2383
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:10,150
 and the ether is now the a recent

2384
02:02:10,150 --> 02:02:15,059
 version of the ether is the field i'm any case the

2385
02:02:15,059 --> 02:02:16,059
 okay

2386
02:02:16,059 --> 02:02:21,730
 so well that was so particle physics you know lots of good things happened by

2387
02:02:21,730 --> 02:02:25,360
 the late 1970s there was this idea maybe

2388
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:31,300
 it will be possible to unify the strong interactions that weak interaction electromagnetism everything bundled together into

2389
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:32,710
 a grand unified theory

2390
02:02:32,710 --> 02:02:36,489
 and that grand unified theory we i mentioned these gauge

2391
02:02:36,489 --> 02:02:41,860
 groups the grand unified theory might have a group that was like su v a bigger group by

2392
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:43,119
 these other groups will be subgroups

2393
02:02:43,119 --> 02:02:47,260
 and somehow there will be particles with masses of 10 to the 15 gev

2394
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:49,360
 and so on that would be associated

2395
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:52,719
 with this bigger gauge group and so on everything would be great one

2396
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:56,800
 prediction the prediction was the proton will decay with

2397
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,690
 a lifetime of 10 to the 30th years

2398
02:02:58,690 --> 02:02:59,639
 um

2399
02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:00,639
 okay

2400
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:03,280
 so people busily around 1980 were

2401
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:06,340
 looking for proton decay because it was a prediction of these grand unified theories

2402
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:08,170
 and they

2403
02:03:08,170 --> 02:03:11,800
 didn't find it no proton decay has ever been observed so

2404
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:14,260
 far as people know protons are completely stable particles

2405
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:19,869
 so that was a big downer and that kind of the energy of looking

2406
02:03:19,869 --> 02:03:23,940
 at some kind of grand unified theories decayed

2407
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:25,780
 meanwhile experiments

2408
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:29,969
 were going on you know tens of billions of dollars were being spent on particle accelerators

2409
02:03:29,969 --> 02:03:34,260
 particularly at fermilab in the us and at cern and geneva switzerland

2410
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:36,929
 and

2411
02:03:36,929 --> 02:03:41,769
 1984 the w and z particles were duly discovered actually

2412
02:03:41,769 --> 02:03:42,460
 after

2413
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:44,199
 the the b quark was discovered

2414
02:03:44,199 --> 02:03:46,630
 it was known that there also had to be a bottom

2415
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:50,349
 quark there was also t quark a top quark that must exist that

2416
02:03:50,349 --> 02:03:52,809
 was discovered in 1995 actually

2417
02:03:52,809 --> 02:03:54,639
 i had figured out with

2418
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:57,760
 a prison called david poet sir back in the late 1970s that

2419
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:59,380
 there was an upper limit on the

2420
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:04,420
 masses that courts could possibly have if the universe wasn't going to become unstable and we

2421
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:06,400
 believed the universe isn't unstable

2422
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:12,369
 right now and the the top quark actually comes pretty close to our upper bound on how massive

2423
02:04:12,369 --> 02:04:14,679
 a court could possibly be anyway

2424
02:04:14,679 --> 02:04:18,420
 so those were discovered in 2000 i guess it's

2425
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:22,590
 2012 maybe the the higgs particle

2426
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:23,590
 which

2427
02:04:23,590 --> 02:04:26,680
 was something what was predicted from this whole higgs mechanism that

2428
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:31,270
 was discovered as well there emerged this kind of standard model of particle physics

2429
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:36,870
 which allowed you to compute things and everybody just kind of the

2430
02:04:36,870 --> 02:04:41,460
 everybody just was able to go ahead and

2431
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:47,140
 compute a lot of things in particle physics in it it became sort of a thing

2432
02:04:47,140 --> 02:04:49,810
 where one didn't really have to when didn't really think about the fundamentals

2433
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:53,350
 of what was going on almost more just thinking about the the computing

2434
02:04:53,350 --> 02:04:56,020
 of things i noticed on live stream with question how can there three different infinities

2435
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:58,180
 the point is that the the mathematical

2436
02:04:58,180 --> 02:05:04,300
 formulas that generate those infinities is slightly different and the issue is they are all related to different

2437
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:07,840
 physical properties of electrons that one is right of the mass of the electron one

2438
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:10,120
 is related to a coupling of the electron to the photon

2439
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:11,640
 and

2440
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:17,520
 what's the other one self energy the vertex

2441
02:05:18,150 --> 02:05:18,900
 king polarization

2442
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:25,440
 yeah the the other one is associated with the propensity of a photon to turn into a virtual

2443
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:26,550
 electron-positron pair

2444
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:29,790
 and those are just the three independent differently

2445
02:05:29,790 --> 02:05:35,000
 computed kinds of infinities in quantum electrodynamics z 1 z 2 z 3 usually they're called

2446
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
 um

2447
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,500
 okay well

2448
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:41,940
 so particle physics kind of hit the 1980s

2449
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:44,940
 and sort of the standard model got established

2450
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:49,140
 and it was all just calculation from then on out in a first approximation so

2451
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:51,989
 particle physics kind of put it on a shelf more

2452
02:05:51,989 --> 02:05:55,560
 or less done in some sense with the slight footnote

2453
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:57,679
 oh grand unified theories hadn't worked out

2454
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:00,540
 okay there's another branch i'm gonna try

2455
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:04,320
 and go fairly quickly on this um the another

2456
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:08,150
 branch of the story of physics is gravity

2457
02:06:08,150 --> 02:06:09,320
 so

2458
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:12,350
 gravity had a much

2459
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:17,090
 so newton had this idea this universal law of gravitation 1687

2460
02:06:17,090 --> 02:06:22,320
 inverse square law pretty much nothing happened in gravity until 1915

2461
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:26,670
 and in 1915 einstein had this idea of general relativity

2462
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:29,909
 and his idea was let's try

2463
02:06:29,909 --> 02:06:34,290
 and he what he wanted to do is to generalize the sort of logical deductive

2464
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:39,360
 ideas of special relativity was sort of an axiom it ization of physics implying things to

2465
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,429
 deal with the general features of space

2466
02:06:41,429 --> 02:06:42,330
 and gravity and

2467
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:45,420
 so he had this thing called the principle of equivalence that

2468
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:50,190
 was sort of a thing that was another principle it said that the you

2469
02:06:50,190 --> 02:06:52,199
 can't kind of tell the difference between acceleration

2470
02:06:52,199 --> 02:06:57,360
 and being in a gravitational field those are those are sort of two things that seem

2471
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:00,620
 the same if you just look at mechanical properties of what's going on

2472
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:03,080
 so anyway he

2473
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:10,730
 invented this idea he used kind of very highfalutin mathematics of the time differential geometry and

2474
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:13,170
 theory of things like riemann tensors

2475
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:14,370
 and so on he

2476
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:17,580
 always used to say and i i actually in my own efforts in fundamental

2477
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:20,880
 physics now i i now deeply sympathize with what he said he

2478
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:23,969
 he would always tell people people would say you using this all this elaborate mathematics

2479
02:07:23,969 --> 02:07:25,199
 you must be very good at mathematics

2480
02:07:25,199 --> 02:07:26,699
 and he would say you

2481
02:07:26,699 --> 02:07:29,969
 know look this mathematics is kind of the outer limit of what i understand

2482
02:07:29,969 --> 02:07:31,930
 but i happen to be able to apply it to physics

2483
02:07:31,930 --> 02:07:35,050
 and then physics i've been doing recently there's wonderful

2484
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:39,880
 and beautiful mathematics that applies and i i i feel very barbaric in

2485
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:43,600
 my uses of it because i'm sure there's there's a much more elegant version

2486
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:45,580
 of it that will eventually be discovered

2487
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:48,820
 but i'm using it in a barbaric way as i

2488
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:51,370
 think einstein felt that he was using differential

2489
02:07:51,370 --> 02:07:55,690
 geometry in a sort of barbaric way but nevertheless it worked and the

2490
02:07:55,690 --> 02:07:58,720
 main thing that einstein did was to show that that

2491
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,490
 you could think about gravity

2492
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:04,930
 as corresponding to curvature in space-time so you know when you shine

2493
02:08:04,930 --> 02:08:06,130
 a laser beam it'll

2494
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:09,100
 go in a straight line what is a straight line mean well

2495
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:13,180
 a straight line if you think that space is curved a straight

2496
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:14,200
 line would be something

2497
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:17,350
 just like a straight line going on a sphere is curved a straight

2498
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:18,910
 line could be something that deviates

2499
02:08:18,910 --> 02:08:19,960
 and so

2500
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:22,390
 what einstein suggested

2501
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:27,330
 and his einstein equations is that matter mass

2502
02:08:27,330 --> 02:08:28,330
 causes

2503
02:08:28,330 --> 02:08:30,160
 deformation in space-time causes

2504
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:35,800
 space-time to be curved and that means that what you thought was a straight line isn't

2505
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:36,730
 what

2506
02:08:36,730 --> 02:08:37,900
 you would otherwise consider

2507
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:42,820
 a straight line and so that accounts for the fact that for example if you you

2508
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:44,950
 know if you something

2509
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:50,080
 that would otherwise be moving in a in a sort of newton's first law a straight line if there's

2510
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:54,580
 a piece of the massive object space-time is curved around that massive object

2511
02:08:54,580 --> 02:08:56,710
 and so the thing really is moving in a straight line

2512
02:08:56,710 --> 02:09:01,120
 but it's moving the straight line in curved space-time and that causes it to to

2513
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:05,290
 deviate its trajectory in just the way that gravity says it should evie ate the trajectory

2514
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:09,910
 so general relativity had a prediction it said that the deflection

2515
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:14,140
 of light around the sun will be twice as great as will be expected from other theories

2516
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:19,630
 essentially there was a form of gravitational magnetism a gravitational log of magnetism that

2517
02:09:19,630 --> 02:09:25,510
 essentially doubled the effect of gravity on on a photon going around the sun and then

2518
02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:28,540
 in 1919 there was sort of a big excitement

2519
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:30,910
 it's not completely clear how genuine

2520
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:35,380
 this experiment was but big sort of excitement of going to observe a total solar eclipse

2521
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:41,410
 and discovering that einstein was actually correct that term that there was twice the deflection

2522
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:45,460
 so general activity had its first big test and it worked just fine

2523
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:48,400
 okay general somebody is a very mathematically complicated theory

2524
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:49,420
 and it

2525
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:52,990
 was very hard to work out its consequences already it was known by 1916

2526
02:09:52,990 --> 02:09:56,260
 a guy called karl schwarzschild had had

2527
02:09:56,260 --> 02:10:01,390
 worked out a solution stein stein's equations they corresponded to a spherical object like a star

2528
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:06,220
 and the gravity associated with that and that solution

2529
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:11,260
 had a prediction it said that there would be four in certain cases an event horizon

2530
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:13,210
 but it was completely not understood

2531
02:10:13,210 --> 02:10:17,620
 what that meant at that time it was some see these equations are complicated

2532
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:22,000
 and there's a question of of the event horizon was sort of a similarity in the equations

2533
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,940
 and that the thing is that it's easy to get singularities

2534
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:27,130
 and equations for example let's say using latitude

2535
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:30,490
 and longitude to describe a position on the earth if you use latitude

2536
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:30,970
 and longitude

2537
02:10:30,970 --> 02:10:38,650
 what happens at the north pole you have kind of a weird singularity of of the of the longitude

2538
02:10:38,650 --> 02:10:41,830
 at the north pole because that the actual north pole is sort of all the longitudes

2539
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:43,350
 are are stuck together

2540
02:10:43,350 --> 02:10:46,270
 but that's just a mathematical singularity

2541
02:10:46,270 --> 02:10:47,110
 it's not a genuine

2542
02:10:47,110 --> 02:10:49,420
 feature it's not like there's something weird at

2543
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:51,040
 the north pole of the earth with

2544
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:54,010
 respect to it's just that that's a matter of our description

2545
02:10:54,010 --> 02:10:55,260
 so

2546
02:10:55,260 --> 02:11:00,340
 the thing that term so anyway general relativity developed quite slowly

2547
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:05,470
 um one of the things in general activity that einstein had the most simple-minded

2548
02:11:05,470 --> 02:11:07,660
 version of einstein's equations implied

2549
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:12,220
 something that einstein thought was completely on sense it implied that the universe expands

2550
02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:15,040
 so einstein put in this thing called the cosmological term

2551
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:18,400
 which was intended to compensate for

2552
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:25,180
 what would otherwise be a necessary expansion of the universe we're all needless to say in 1929

2553
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:29,620
 a guy called hubble observed that the universe is expanding einstein

2554
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:34,180
 always said that that was sort of the biggest mistake of his physics life was the cosmological term

2555
02:11:34,180 --> 02:11:35,680
 because it didn't

2556
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:38,830
 need to be there because actually the universe is expanding and really his equations

2557
02:11:38,830 --> 02:11:40,810
 if he'd really trusted them predicted

2558
02:11:40,810 --> 02:11:45,450
 that the universe should expand anyway hubble observed that galaxies were receding and

2559
02:11:45,450 --> 02:11:47,740
 actually la mettrie had already proposed

2560
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:51,910
 what is now called the big bang theory that the universe started as something small and

2561
02:11:51,910 --> 02:11:54,000
 and progressively has expanded

2562
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,970
 okay well meanwhile by the 1940s

2563
02:11:56,970 --> 02:12:02,649
 people like oppenheimer actually will looking at sort of what would happen when stars collapsed

2564
02:12:02,649 --> 02:12:04,599
 and it was slowly

2565
02:12:04,599 --> 02:12:08,739
 becoming clear that black holes were a thing it

2566
02:12:08,739 --> 02:12:11,769
 wasn't clear whether black holes will sort of have this singularities

2567
02:12:11,769 --> 02:12:16,030
 associated with them they have this event horizon actually laplace in the 1700s

2568
02:12:16,030 --> 02:12:18,010
 had already thought about what

2569
02:12:18,010 --> 02:12:22,239
 if the escape velocity of a thing is more than the speed of light does

2570
02:12:22,239 --> 02:12:24,969
 that mean that light couldn't escape from it well

2571
02:12:24,969 --> 02:12:28,059
 that was what was happening in these equations in

2572
02:12:28,059 --> 02:12:29,649
 what einstein's equations predicted

2573
02:12:29,649 --> 02:12:33,550
 but people weren't sure was that a coordinate singularity was just a piece of mathematics

2574
02:12:33,550 --> 02:12:34,389
 or was it something real

2575
02:12:34,389 --> 02:12:35,919
 but it became more

2576
02:12:35,919 --> 02:12:38,559
 and more clear that there would really be this this phenomenon

2577
02:12:38,559 --> 02:12:40,389
 there should be this phenomenon sufficiently

2578
02:12:40,389 --> 02:12:42,610
 massive stars when they collapse should

2579
02:12:42,610 --> 02:12:45,789
 undergo gravitational collapse and form these event horizons

2580
02:12:45,789 --> 02:12:48,659
 where light couldn't escape from them

2581
02:12:48,659 --> 02:12:49,659
 so

2582
02:12:49,659 --> 02:12:58,209
 that was sort of a feature of of generality that generality in a sense describes its own failure

2583
02:12:58,209 --> 02:13:00,969
 because it says that at the very center

2584
02:13:00,969 --> 02:13:04,630
 of it like a schwarzschild black hole there's a singularity in space-time

2585
02:13:04,630 --> 02:13:09,099
 and that means that the equations by their nature can't describe that singularity

2586
02:13:09,099 --> 02:13:12,519
 so it's kind of explaining its own its own limitation

2587
02:13:12,519 --> 02:13:17,229
 but nevertheless it was there was a lot of mathematical complexity around that well

2588
02:13:17,229 --> 02:13:24,669
 meanwhile the the notion of the big bang and the expansion of the universe been developed some 1940s

2589
02:13:24,669 --> 02:13:29,590
 people were talking about that and so on people didn't know whether it was really real 1964

2590
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:33,039
 some guys at bell labs were trying to do satellite communications

2591
02:13:33,039 --> 02:13:37,840
 and they observed that there was this this irreducible background radiation whichever

2592
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,130
 way they pointed their antennas

2593
02:13:39,130 --> 02:13:43,300
 and it was then realized gosh that's just a relic of the big

2594
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:45,189
 bang that's a relic of the

2595
02:13:45,189 --> 02:13:49,599
 essentially the photons that have been created in the very early universe had

2596
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:51,070
 now been sort of red

2597
02:13:51,070 --> 02:13:59,249
 shifted they'd now been cooled down to the point where they were this very low-energy

2598
02:13:59,249 --> 02:14:02,999
 2.7 degrees above absolute zero

2599
02:14:04,079 --> 02:14:05,079
 radiation

2600
02:14:05,079 --> 02:14:08,860
 that was in all directions in the universe so that was kind of evidence 1964

2601
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:12,820
 really evidence for the big bang theory of the universe

2602
02:14:12,820 --> 02:14:16,090
 it hadn't been clear whether that theory was correct or whether there was a steady state theory

2603
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:16,989
 that was really correct

2604
02:14:16,989 --> 02:14:21,730
 where you know the universe was just steadily producing new galaxies

2605
02:14:21,730 --> 02:14:23,260
 popping up in different places by

2606
02:14:23,260 --> 02:14:25,300
 the way one thing that was also a confusion

2607
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:27,340
 that lasted a long time was

2608
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:28,329
 the question of antimatter

2609
02:14:28,329 --> 02:14:30,579
 and where was the antimatter in the universe because

2610
02:14:30,579 --> 02:14:36,429
 the the most obvious theories the big bang would produce equal amounts of matter and antimatter it

2611
02:14:36,429 --> 02:14:40,260
 was discovered in 1964 a thing called cp violation

2612
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:41,260
 also

2613
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:44,590
 related to time reversal violation it's

2614
02:14:44,590 --> 02:14:48,280
 a phenomenon whereby there's sort of a difference between particles

2615
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:49,810
 most things about particles

2616
02:14:49,810 --> 02:14:52,179
 and antiparticles the same but some particles

2617
02:14:52,179 --> 02:14:56,349
 and antiparticles have a strain have some strange small differences particularly

2618
02:14:56,349 --> 02:14:59,230
 the neutral k on so the original example

2619
02:14:59,230 --> 02:14:59,820
 um

2620
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:01,380
 but

2621
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:03,849
 in any case there was still this mystery

2622
02:15:03,849 --> 02:15:06,190
 and when i was a kid still a big mystery

2623
02:15:06,190 --> 02:15:07,360
 why is there more matter you

2624
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:08,829
 know why don't we see a bunch of you

2625
02:15:08,829 --> 02:15:10,510
 know could there be antimatter galaxies

2626
02:15:10,510 --> 02:15:14,889
 could the andromeda galaxy be made of antimatter we didn't know actually

2627
02:15:14,889 --> 02:15:16,630
 i some of my early science

2628
02:15:16,630 --> 02:15:21,960
 had to do with trying to figure out what what the consequences of antimatter galaxies would be and

2629
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:26,050
 and things about separation between matter and antimatter in the universe and

2630
02:15:26,050 --> 02:15:28,770
 so on actually in the 1919

2631
02:15:28,770 --> 02:15:33,130
 late 1970s i worked on using cp violation to understand

2632
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:35,889
 what i think is now the generally accepted theory

2633
02:15:35,889 --> 02:15:38,050
 for why there isn't as much antimatter

2634
02:15:38,050 --> 02:15:39,940
 as matter in the universe that there

2635
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:42,579
 was cp violation in the early universe that

2636
02:15:42,579 --> 02:15:43,989
 caused a small difference

2637
02:15:43,989 --> 02:15:48,760
 between the amounts of matter and antimatter and all the stuff that wasn't different annihilated

2638
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:52,449
 away but we got left with a small residue one part one hundred million basically

2639
02:15:52,449 --> 02:15:54,790
 but is everything we know that's

2640
02:15:54,790 --> 02:15:57,940
 the matter in the universe so that's that's one kind of weird

2641
02:15:57,940 --> 02:16:01,300
 feature by the way they the one thing about antimatter is antimatter

2642
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:04,300
 still falls doesn't have negative mass still

2643
02:16:04,300 --> 02:16:10,540
 has positive mass i now understand why that's true but tim that was that was originally

2644
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:14,800
 kind of just a fact from quantum quantum mechanics any

2645
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,599
 case back to general tivity

2646
02:16:16,599 --> 02:16:17,139
 so

2647
02:16:17,139 --> 02:16:22,750
 what happened in relativity was some sort of progressive measurements

2648
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:31,100
 things got more accurate you know the of very nice experiments done on the effect of gravitational

2649
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:34,610
 redshift all kinds of other things predictions of general relativity binary

2650
02:16:34,610 --> 02:16:37,820
 pulsars neutron stars orbiting each other

2651
02:16:37,820 --> 02:16:45,350
 emitting gravitational waves just like you can emit electromagnetic waves when you have moving moving electric charges

2652
02:16:45,350 --> 02:16:49,719
 so you can mit emit gravitational waves when you have moving

2653
02:16:49,719 --> 02:16:53,750
 moving masses that was a prediction of einstein's general relativity

2654
02:16:53,750 --> 02:16:54,430
 and

2655
02:16:54,430 --> 02:16:55,430
 so

2656
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:59,091
 that was the that was kind of that

2657
02:16:59,091 --> 02:17:02,780
 was there was i was in direct observation of gravitational waves through

2658
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:07,219
 these binary pulsars things like that you know generalist everything was working great theory

2659
02:17:07,219 --> 02:17:11,600
 from 1915 no changes working great and in

2660
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:17,920
 fact to this day it's worked great and the big thing in one was it 2015

2661
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,980
 discovery of gravitational waves by ligo was

2662
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:25,910
 this is the merger of two black holes causing

2663
02:17:25,910 --> 02:17:28,610
 a very violent thing

2664
02:17:28,610 --> 02:17:30,350
 where about two

2665
02:17:30,350 --> 02:17:34,760
 times the mass of the sun is dissipated in energy in a matter of a second about

2666
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:36,139
 a third of the way across the universe

2667
02:17:36,139 --> 02:17:40,610
 and that produced this intense pulse of gravitational waves that

2668
02:17:40,610 --> 02:17:44,540
 was detected by gravitational waves deform space-time

2669
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:45,260
 and so

2670
02:17:45,260 --> 02:17:50,240
 what ligo does is it basically is looking at the length of a big thing

2671
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:51,530
 and it's basically

2672
02:17:51,530 --> 02:17:54,770
 saying if there's a defamation in space-time like a wave comes through space-time

2673
02:17:54,770 --> 02:17:57,770
 the length will change just a little tiny bit a tiny fraction

2674
02:17:57,770 --> 02:18:00,950
 of the distance across an atom the length will change to

2675
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:03,680
 represent the passage of the gravitational wave more or less and

2676
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:06,830
 and that was observed in 2015 a fantastic

2677
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:12,100
 um that validation of general relativity and of the existence of black holes

2678
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:12,610
 okay

2679
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:14,379
 so the one thing that

2680
02:18:14,379 --> 02:18:15,760
 you know it's like the

2681
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:20,889
 one kind of big flag that something doesn't really quite work in physics is the

2682
02:18:20,889 --> 02:18:24,580
 fact that this whole structure of quantum field theory is completely

2683
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:27,160
 inconsistent with the theory of gravity so

2684
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:29,800
 the the problem is you

2685
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:33,520
 try and make a quantum theory of gravity the most obvious way to do it is replace

2686
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:34,780
 photons by gravitons

2687
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:36,459
 and stir

2688
02:18:36,459 --> 02:18:38,650
 the pot so to speak well if you do that you

2689
02:18:38,650 --> 02:18:40,360
 get a theory that isn't realizable

2690
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:42,309
 and this big mess so

2691
02:18:42,309 --> 02:18:44,559
 people starting in the 1980s really

2692
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:47,410
 got excited about doing quantum gravity finding

2693
02:18:47,410 --> 02:18:49,959
 a way to merge kind of quantum field theory and gravity

2694
02:18:49,959 --> 02:18:53,830
 and there were these different schemes things like super gravity schemes

2695
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:57,309
 that said let's add more particles well those particles weren't observed other

2696
02:18:57,309 --> 02:19:00,730
 kinds of schemes for merging gravity

2697
02:19:00,730 --> 02:19:04,389
 and and and quantum mechanics another thing that emerged was a retooling

2698
02:19:04,389 --> 02:19:08,440
 of string theory string theory were originally invented as a well ultimately unsuccessful

2699
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:09,879
 theory of strong interactions

2700
02:19:09,879 --> 02:19:12,190
 but it was sort of re retooled

2701
02:19:12,190 --> 02:19:16,540
 and put to work as a theory that would unify quantum

2702
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:18,879
 field theory and gravity a sort of a consistency

2703
02:19:18,879 --> 02:19:21,969
 condition of string theory is is general relativity etc

2704
02:19:21,969 --> 02:19:26,950
 etc etc it had some weird predictions like the universe is really 26 dimensional

2705
02:19:26,950 --> 02:19:30,490
 but most of those dimensions are rolled up in little tiny balls and so on kind

2706
02:19:30,490 --> 02:19:32,260
 of weird things that to many people

2707
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:34,450
 might be kind of a sign there might be something

2708
02:19:34,450 --> 02:19:35,800
 unconvincing about this theory

2709
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:38,980
 but people didn't have much choice so physics

2710
02:19:38,980 --> 02:19:44,410
 community kind of barreled right along and a lot of physicists started working on string theory um

2711
02:19:44,410 --> 02:19:48,940
 and and there were some excitements in the mid 1990s there was a thing called m-theory

2712
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:54,070
 which would sort of emerge from some sophisticated theory for whatever it's done in physics

2713
02:19:54,070 --> 02:19:58,120
 and whatever it will do in physics it is spun off a lot of very nice mathematics

2714
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:01,601
 and the sort of merger of mathematics with physics that

2715
02:20:01,601 --> 02:20:03,820
 has been associated with it is really very powerful i

2716
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:05,561
 mean i might say that in the physics

2717
02:20:05,561 --> 02:20:07,540
 that i've been doing recently i think that

2718
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:11,830
 string theory it's mathematics is quite relevant although its underlying structure

2719
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:16,410
 is not the same but you know string theory has been re

2720
02:20:16,410 --> 02:20:19,840
 sort of recast once before i think it can happen again

2721
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:23,410
 and still leave the same string theory structure intact

2722
02:20:23,410 --> 02:20:28,149
 so to speak but the thing that that happened in

2723
02:20:28,149 --> 02:20:31,420
 so quantum gravity big thing in the 1980s 1990s

2724
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:31,870
 and

2725
02:20:31,870 --> 02:20:35,189
 so on one piece of that had been

2726
02:20:35,189 --> 02:20:38,200
 1974 stephen hawking worked

2727
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:42,880
 out this idea of hawking radiation which was sort of a a a rather rickety

2728
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:47,890
 kind of calculation of sort of a merger of quantum field theory of

2729
02:20:47,890 --> 02:20:51,040
 what happens to quantum field theory near a black hole and the basic

2730
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:52,540
 answer is you can have situations

2731
02:20:52,540 --> 02:20:55,479
 where virtual particle pairs are made particle-antiparticle

2732
02:20:55,479 --> 02:21:00,010
 pairs are made one of the pair falls into the black hole and the other one is emitted

2733
02:21:00,010 --> 02:21:00,580
 to infinity

2734
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:03,160
 and that leads to a black hole not really being black

2735
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:06,930
 but emitting radiation hawking radiation hasn't been observed yet

2736
02:21:06,930 --> 02:21:12,160
 but it's some it has it's a great theoretical interest

2737
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:16,439
 and actually i think we have some very interesting new things to say about it

2738
02:21:16,439 --> 02:21:23,370
 but in any case that led to a bunch of a bunch of kind of theories

2739
02:21:23,370 --> 02:21:24,569
 around

2740
02:21:24,569 --> 02:21:28,450
 kind of thinking of black holes so black holes even

2741
02:21:28,450 --> 02:21:29,950
 though they're big you

2742
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:33,370
 know kilometers across and so on or whatever it is or even bigger than that

2743
02:21:33,370 --> 02:21:36,430
 um they are in a sense very perfect there's

2744
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:38,350
 you know if you have a black hole it

2745
02:21:38,350 --> 02:21:42,250
 sort of doesn't have any hair there's a no-hair theorem for black holes actually but

2746
02:21:42,250 --> 02:21:44,590
 but it's basically like all you

2747
02:21:44,590 --> 02:21:46,960
 have to know about a black hole is its mass how

2748
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:49,660
 fast it's spinning and maybe it's electric charge and

2749
02:21:49,660 --> 02:21:52,540
 and everything else it's like a particle really

2750
02:21:52,540 --> 02:21:54,550
 but it's just a great big particle

2751
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:55,260
 and

2752
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:56,260
 so

2753
02:21:56,260 --> 02:22:00,370
 that idea of a black hole is just like a particle is

2754
02:22:00,370 --> 02:22:06,279
 something that has sort of wound its way into theories of sort of attempting to merge quantum mechanics

2755
02:22:06,279 --> 02:22:07,569
 and gravity particularly

2756
02:22:07,569 --> 02:22:12,850
 from the late 1990s a thing called the a dsc ft correspondence it's a correspondence

2757
02:22:12,850 --> 02:22:14,140
 between anti-de sitter space

2758
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:18,370
 which is a version of the solution to einstein's equations

2759
02:22:18,370 --> 02:22:19,899
 and i think called conformal field theory

2760
02:22:19,899 --> 02:22:22,569
 which is kind of a limiting case of quantum field theory

2761
02:22:22,569 --> 02:22:24,550
 and there's a very beautiful mathematical

2762
02:22:24,550 --> 02:22:27,640
 correspondence between these things which i think actually is

2763
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:30,510
 a precursor of something that we now understand much better um

2764
02:22:30,510 --> 02:22:33,939
 but that has to do with the merger of relativity

2765
02:22:33,939 --> 02:22:35,100
 and quantum mechanics

2766
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:38,940
 but anyway i think we're pretty much from

2767
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:42,090
 well that's that's kind of a well

2768
02:22:42,090 --> 02:22:43,290
 i've been talking there about fundamental

2769
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:44,250
 physics in another there

2770
02:22:44,250 --> 02:22:48,150
 are two big branches i haven't talked about maybe another time i'll talk about these -

2771
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:50,280
 condensed matter physics things

2772
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:51,840
 like theory of superconductivity and

2773
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:53,130
 so on that

2774
02:22:53,130 --> 02:22:57,000
 was a field that really really started to engage you

2775
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,670
 know really impressively in the 1980s

2776
02:22:59,670 --> 02:23:00,270
 um

2777
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:01,790
 and

2778
02:23:01,790 --> 02:23:05,490
 the other big thing i haven't talked about is quantum computing that's

2779
02:23:05,490 --> 02:23:11,690
 something i actually worked on that with dick feynman actually back in around 1981 not too

2780
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:14,760
 long before people had mostly heard of quantum computing

2781
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:21,660
 but that's a that's a thing that's sort of a way of taking the formalism of quantum mechanics

2782
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:23,190
 and trying to apply it to computing

2783
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:26,400
 they'll probably more to say about that i talked about fundamental

2784
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:27,330
 theory of physics um

2785
02:23:27,330 --> 02:23:29,220
 and there's

2786
02:23:29,220 --> 02:23:30,720
 things that um that

2787
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:35,330
 we can probably say now about quantum computing all right i'll take there is some quick come

2788
02:23:35,330 --> 02:23:38,570
 quick come

2789
02:23:38,570 --> 02:23:39,650
 [music]

2790
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:46,430
 questions here i haven't been paying attention [music]

2791
02:23:46,430 --> 02:23:51,870
 all right well there seems to be enthusiasm for you know i think

2792
02:23:51,870 --> 02:23:53,130
 what we've discovered is

2793
02:23:53,130 --> 02:23:54,060
 um

2794
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:58,979
 it's kind of a it's something i started working on thirty years ago and and for

2795
02:23:58,979 --> 02:24:00,180
 a variety of reasons stopped

2796
02:24:00,180 --> 02:24:01,109
 and stopped

2797
02:24:01,109 --> 02:24:03,120
 and then finally last

2798
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:07,020
 fall i kind of had a little bit of a breakthrough that i made and then i started

2799
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:08,880
 working with a couple other people very

2800
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:12,000
 energetically on this and it's spectacular

2801
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,149
 and i think you know these things

2802
02:24:15,149 --> 02:24:17,330
 which kind of i've known about for

2803
02:24:17,330 --> 02:24:18,330
 what

2804
02:24:18,330 --> 02:24:22,529
 kind of close to 50 years now about physics that always seemed a bit mysterious i

2805
02:24:22,529 --> 02:24:24,270
 think we really understand

2806
02:24:24,270 --> 02:24:25,529
 how they work and it's really

2807
02:24:25,529 --> 02:24:30,529
 really cool and i can't wait to talk about it and we'll have a bunch of material ready

2808
02:24:30,529 --> 02:24:32,250
 sometime next week and

2809
02:24:32,250 --> 02:24:35,340
 i'll be doing some live streams

2810
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:37,370
 i'll be doing

2811
02:24:37,370 --> 02:24:41,120
 live streams kind of explaining the main point it's

2812
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:44,069
 the main point is not that trivial to explain

2813
02:24:44,069 --> 02:24:46,290
 i mean not super surprising that

2814
02:24:46,290 --> 02:24:48,720
 if you have a fundamental theory of the universe it's

2815
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:51,149
 not like a one line thing to explain

2816
02:24:51,149 --> 02:24:55,649
 how it all works but then i'll be doing some more technical q&a a physicists

2817
02:24:55,649 --> 02:24:56,359
 and mathematicians

2818
02:24:56,359 --> 02:24:59,300
 and computer scientists later on

2819
02:24:59,300 --> 02:25:02,460
 and no it's not a cellular automaton

2820
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:04,380
 if you if you want to know what it's like go

2821
02:25:04,380 --> 02:25:07,560
 read go look at chapter 9 of my book a new kind of science

2822
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:09,630
 which you can find online that's

2823
02:25:09,630 --> 02:25:13,970
 really the that's the that's the precursor to what term to what i'm talking about

2824
02:25:13,970 --> 02:25:16,080
 okay well

2825
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:18,449
 um all right

2826
02:25:18,449 --> 02:25:22,800
 we should play wrap up here i went on a lot longer than i expected i guess there's

2827
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,540
 more in the history of physics that i then

2828
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:25,790
 i thought i remembered um

2829
02:25:25,790 --> 02:25:28,160
 but

2830
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:36,140
 thanks for thanks for joining me and i look forward to saying

2831
02:25:36,140 --> 02:25:39,500
 more about the future of physics

2832
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:42,260
 next week so thanks a lot bye
