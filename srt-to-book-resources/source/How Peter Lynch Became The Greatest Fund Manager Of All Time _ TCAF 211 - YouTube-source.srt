 >> all right.

64
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,599
 uh,

65
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,159
 there are a lot of reasons why you're on the mount rushmore

66
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,239
 of the greatest investors of all time.

67
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,560
 one of them is obviously your track record.

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,599
 another

69
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,879
 is how much wisdom you were willing to share with everyone else via

70
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,319
 books and interviews which back then was very rare.

71
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,200
 um but among your greatest achievements

72
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
 is the fact that you went out on top

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,360
 literally at the height of your popularity and your performance

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,959
 in 1990. that was 35 years ago.

75
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,519
 you were 46 years old at the time.

76
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,959
 and i wanted to start by asking you about that decision.

77
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,920
 >> well, i love the firm.

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,720
 i still love the firm.

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
 it's the best ever put together.

80
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,480
 and my father died at 46 and i was 46. i remember that number.

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,798
 and i was in the office every saturday

82
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,680
 7:00. we said fell we get up a basketball game on saturday.

83
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,240
 and in wellington they couldn't play double solitire, you know.

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,280
 sorry.

85
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,520
 so every day i enjoyed it.

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,560
 people were fantastic.

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,080
 i just

88
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,960
 we had three daughters

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
 and i just wanted to spend more time with my wife and the third daughter.

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,560
 so, and i was lucky enough to finally said just stay on.

91
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,720
 we'll give you some a role here with working with young analyst and fund manager.

92
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720

93
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,520
 great company.

94
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,320
 the best.

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,639
 >> did you ever think about getting back into the game?

96
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,120
 was there ever a moment or a temptation where you said, "you know what?

97
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
 i think i want to i think i could do this

98
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,080
 better than everyone

99
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,960
 else out there still,

100
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
 and i want to i want to go for it."

101
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,160
 i had all these offers to do a close-end fund.

102
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
 >> okay.

103
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,440
 >> 1 billion, two billion, 2% fees.

104
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,280
 the mark's up 30fold.

105
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,000
 >> yeah.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,320
 >> 30fold since i left.

107
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,800
 >> okay.

108
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,600
 >> so, if i just did average, it' be a $60 billion fund.

109
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
 >> yeah.

110
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
 >> the temptation was never great enough though.

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,360
 >> no.

112
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,080
 no.

113
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,960
 >> i'd have to i'd still be working those same hours.

114
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,360
 >> yeah.

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
 >> because one out of every hundred americans was a mellan fund.

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,320
 is that right?

117
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
 >> one of every hundred americans was a major fund.

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,440
 >> okay.

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,000
 >> these are people that $5,000, $10,000 was very meaningful.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
 >> did the weight of that

121
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
 get to you at all while you were running the fund?

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
 the the level of responsibility?

123
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,840
 okay.

124
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,639
 >> i had a perfect record.

125
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,840
 i think the market went down 10 times those 13 years.

126
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,160
 >> okay.

127
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
 >> i went down more every time than the market.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,960
 every time.

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,600
 >> okay.

130
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,520
 um but you somehow managed to get through those moments when you were down.

131
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,919
 yeah.

132
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:54,560
 how did you do that?

133
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
 in ' 87. i got letters from people saying, "hang in there.

134
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,320
 it'll be great.

135
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,280
 don't worry about it." you know, >> it was amazing.

136
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,520
 >> um, i wanted to ask you

137
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
 if there were ever moments where

138
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,319
 you looked at

139
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,919
 something that was happening in the market,

140
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,240
 whether

141
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,199
 it was a bull market

142
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,800
 or a bare market,

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
 and said to yourself, if i were at mellin,

144
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
 i know exactly what i would be doing right now with this opportunity.

145
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,319
 had you had those moments?

146
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,160
 yeah, i did have that moment when pets >> stock tom came public and >> pets.com.

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,199
 >> i says, "what?

148
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,120
 this makes no sense at all." and then went up, so i can't short.

149
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,199
 so, but there was so many companies of no value.

150
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:35,600
 >> yeah.

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,280
 >> and fortunately, fidelity

152
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
 didn't own those damn things that

153
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,840
 so, that was a period to say, "wow,

154
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,280
 what's wrong here?" you know?

155
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,080
 >> okay.

156
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
 um, i wanted to

157
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,479
 i wanted to ask you who are the professional investors

158
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,880
 or the corporate leaders or other people on wall street that

159
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,919
 you either admire most today or that you looked at and and learned from

160
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,800
 during your tenure managing the who who are your heroes or who are your mentors?

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
 >> i'd say leakoka

162
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,520
 would be

163
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,400
 really up there at chrysler, ford and chrysler and then

175
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
 >> this guy bob walter i mean so good.

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,000
 and i'm trying to think of another fell.

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,440
 there's so many great entrepreneurs that aren't that well known that i think it's al namad.

178
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,160
 he's at it's a it's amazing company in in florida.

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,479
 that's up 100fold or ben camarada.

180
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,840
 tj maxx and tj maxx is up 100fold.

181
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,759
 >> yeah, >> that's ben camarada.

182
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,840
 i mean those are great people.

183
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,960
 one of the things that you've talked about is your >> watskco is an income company.

184
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,479
 >> watcoat watskco.

185
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,680
 one of the things you've talked about is your early introduction to wall street.

186
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,199
 there was a lot of disbelief

187
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,479
 about the stock market in the house you grew up in,

188
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,039
 but then you got your first job catting

189
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,599
 on the golf course and all you heard was how much money people were making.

190
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,520
 tell us a little bit about that time in your life.

191
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,399
 well, actually, you know, people,

192
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,559
 you know, if you grew up in the 40s,

193
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,559
 you heard about the big one, the depression.

194
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,039
 >> yeah.

195
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,240
 >> there's one coming.

196
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,399
 what you think?

197
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,279
 risk averse.

198
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,000
 it was risk averse, the borrow of four.

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,839
 and but i was a caddy and people would talk about what stocks they're buying.

200
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,320
 i'd look it up and a few months later they were higher.

201
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,279
 >> yeah.

202
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,480
 >> this pretty good deal, you know.

203
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,040
 so, i didn't have money, but i

204
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,360
 addition

205
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,600
 to

206
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,320
 talking about their shots,

207
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,839
 but it was it's a great role of a caddy

208
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,080
 because

209
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,320
 you're

210
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,120
 like a

211
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,240
 an adviser to somebody.

212
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
 just tell them, you know,

213
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
 if you miss a screen,

214
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,160
 don't miss it to the right or

215
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,440
 don't be short or

216
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,080
 line of putts.

217
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,760
 it's a incredible my friends were delivering newspapers, you know, 5:00 a.m.

218
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
 i was making more on saturdays than making the whole week.

219
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,560
 so, and the president was mr.

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,560
 johnson was the ceo and and djour sullivan was the president and i caddy for him.

221
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,480
 they said, "gee,

222
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
 why don't you interview for job at fidelli?"

223
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,279
 >> how how old were you when when that offer came?

224
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
 >> 21 or >> okay.

225
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,920
 >> so, summer of 66, i was a

226
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,680
 somehow i was the only one to caddy for the president.

227
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,399
 so, i got the job.

228
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,240
 there's like

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,399
 i think there was 75 applicants for three spots, but i got the spot in

230
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,080
 ' 66. and

231
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,720
 so then i had to do one more year war and two years in the army.

232
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,640
 came back in ' 69. so i owe it all to being a caddy.

233
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,519
 >> what

234
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,920
 what did you have to do at fidelity

235
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,200
 to pay your dues

236
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,920
 to the point where they were willing to give you money to invest for other people?

237
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,440
 >> yeah, i think they forgot all my mistakes because i had the

238
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,440
 i had the textile the worst groups the textile stocks, the steel stocks, the metal stocks.

239
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,480
 i don't i don't know how he ever survived that that they were

240
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,760
 there weren't many winners ever.

241
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,800
 >> they gave you the stocks to cover that nobody else cared about.

242
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
 >> well, everybody had groups.

243
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,120
 somebody did retailers, somebody did electronics, somebody did oil, somebody did truckers, somebody did railroads.

244
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,800
 i wound up with the drags.

245
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
 >> i wanted to ask you

246
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,120
 what were some of the traits in the investors that you were learning from or

247
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,640
 the people that you admired

248
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,839
 in money management?

249
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,800
 what were some of the qualities in those people or their habits that

250
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,000
 probably still resonate for investors today?

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,920
 >> we one when i started with this person allan gray,

252
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,480
 he he went back to south africa about 10 years later, but he would work hard.

253
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,519
 he'd research companies.

254
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,680
 he'd listen to my stories.

255
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,519
 he he was probably the best role model.

256
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,279
 i remember alan gray.

257
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,760
 >> okay.

258
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
 >> and but our our my peers were all great.

259
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,760
 i mean, all the people around me, everybody in the research was really talented.

260
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,920
 so, we're loaded with skill.

261
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,560
 >> it's funny.

262
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,200
 i

263
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,640
 um i interviewed one of your colleagues yesterday.

264
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
 she's a quantitative analyst at fidelity.

265
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,200
 and it's so funny to hear you say that because she said the exact same thing.

266
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,880
 she said, "any question i have about markets or the economy,

267
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,680
 this whole building is filled with talented people who know what's going on, and

268
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,480
 >> all i have to do is

269
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
 walk down the hall and get the answer to my

270
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,480
 question."

271
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:38,800
 right.

272
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 >> you still feel that way about the organization today?

273
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,279
 >> it's unbelievable.

274
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,240
 i mean, steve wymer, john mcdow, joel tillyas, will dan off.

275
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,399
 i mean, you know, this like the the yankees were, you know, in the 1920s,

276
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,079
 >> and we're we're playing the yankees right now.

277
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,160
 i won't i won't tell you who i'm rooting for.

278
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,839
 so, i

279
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,000
 i thought it would be funny to take some of your legendary quotes and witisms.

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,160
 um, they've all been attributed to you.

281
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
 you'll tell me if they're not actually you, but

282
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
 um these have been taken from interviews

283
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,200
 you've given over the years, from the books that you've written,

284
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,639
 from the things that you've you've written and and and published.

285
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,560
 i thought it'd be fun to share some of these with the audience.

286
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,200
 the audience probably can quote some of these by heart

287
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,040
 and just have you react to them and tell and tell us

288
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,680
 where it came from or what the lesson is behind

289
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,839
 the thing that you were trying to get across.

290
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,320
 um, i've got a couple of categories for for these quotes.

291
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,800
 i kind of i did a little taxonomy.

292
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,440
 so, the first category involves the risk of investing in stocks.

293
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
 and you said

294
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,279
 the real key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them.

295
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,360
 why is that the key to making money in stocks?

296
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,639
 >> well, more important to that is i have this expression, know what you own.

297
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,440
 >> i was going to do that one later.

298
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,000
 i'll cross over.

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
 >> but that's most that's it.

300
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,639
 that's the most important lesson, >> okay?

301
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,760
 >> because you'll get shaken out if the song goes from 10 to 8.

302
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,519
 you don't know what they're doing.

303
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,399
 what are you going to do with it?

304
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,000
 and i was telling you earlier, i got a call.

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,040
 i did an ad for fidelity with lily tomlin.

306
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
 she's very close to barbara stryand.

307
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,360
 so i'm on vacation, my wife and two other couples, and

308
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
 my secretary paul says, "barbara streand's called three times.

309
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
 she'd really like to talk to you." and she's very nice.

310
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,440
 and you know,

311
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,440
 i said, "sure, i'll i got some time." so, i called him and she says,

312
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
 "i own all these stocks and i'm getting up at 5:00 a.m.

313
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,800
 and look at this stuff." and he says, "i" she said, "i never did drugs.

314
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
 i never did marijuana.

315
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,920
 i i i'm just can't sleep.

316
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,519
 what do i do?" i says, "tell me five things you own." she named five companies.

317
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,639
 i say, "okay, what did they do?" >> she didn't have any idea.

318
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,800
 here's an incredibly talented person.

319
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
 she had no idea what those companies did, >> right?

320
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
 >> so, what are you going to do if they go down 50%.

321
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,240
 >> yeah.

322
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,880
 >> if you don't understand what you own, you're toast.

323
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,720
 >> it sounds so obvious

324
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,480
 um to hear you say it, but it's it's amazing.

325
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,000
 pe you talk about people spend more time researching a refrigerator

326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,040
 they're going to buy

327
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,160
 than they do a stock they're going to invest part of their life savings.

328
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,120
 >> people are very careful.

329
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,160
 they spend hours get 50 bucks off on an airplane flight.

330
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,240
 they they look at everything, >> right?

331
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,480
 >> and they put $10,000

332
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,680
 in some crazy stock they heard on the bus, you know,

333
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
 and you know,

334
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,440
 and they have no idea what they're doing.

335
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
 and somebody invented this awful term before i got in the business called play the market.

336
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,800
 >> play the market.

337
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,920
 you don't like that term.

338
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,959
 >> that is a sometimes a noun, there's a verb.

339
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,199
 it's a very dangerous verb.

340
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,160
 play the market is not what you do.

341
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,560
 >> okay.

342
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,600
 you buy good companies and some work and you have to know what they do.

343
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,720
 there was this farm in western massachusetts, the two companies, tampax out there.

344
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
 friendly ice cream.

345
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
 he put $1,000 in a month for 10 years.

346
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,880
 brilliant idea.

347
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,800
 he says if they stop hiring, i'm i'm going to leave.

348
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,360
 >> okay.

349
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,639
 >> you made a million dollars.

350
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,160
 >> huh.

351
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
 >> i mean, people have all these edges.

352
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,120
 people in the steel industry know it's getting better before i do.

353
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
 these people have an edge >> and they

354
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,600
 they might as well go to a casino and bet on red, you know.

355
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,560
 >> so, by knowing the companies that you're invested in,

356
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
 there's a higher likelihood

357
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
 that you'll be able to stick with them

358
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,880
 when other people are scared.

359
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,199
 >> yeah.

360
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,160
 the average range for a stock on the new york stock exchange,

361
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,880
 the average high, average low every year is 100%.

362
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,839
 the stock might start at 20, sell at 28,

363
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,480
 finish at 14, finish at 20.

364
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,880
 there's a 100% move every so, it's 50% up, 50% downish.

365
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,440
 and that's how it's 100% swing in the price.

366
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
 >> that's the average stock.

367
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,680
 >> wow.

368
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,800
 >> and most stocks you're going to buy, they're probably going to go down.

369
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,880
 the odds sometimes they go up.

370
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,480
 if the story is powerful, like watskco or chrysler, you might buy it up.

371
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
 >> if you don't know what they do and it goes down,

372
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
 and i've had people say,

373
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,440
 "this stock's gone from 50 to one.

374
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,600
 how much can i lose?" and i say, "well, wait a second.

375
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,399
 if somebody put $10,000 in at 50

376
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,759
 and you put $50,000 at one, if it goes to zero, who loses the most?

377
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,279
 i mean, stocks go to zero?

378
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,759
 i've had them.

379
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,160
 you know, i wasn't buying them on the way to zero, but stocks go down.

380
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,079
 if you don't understand what they do, if you can't explain to an 11year-old

381
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,079
 in a minute or less why you own it, not this sucker is going up.

382
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,360
 i've heard that one before.

383
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,680
 why?

384
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,600
 what is what's the story of this company?

385
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,519
 they have good business, good balance sheet, they're fine.

386
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,880
 that's why i own it.

387
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,199
 >> yeah.

388
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,680
 >> if you can't do that, you should buy a fund.

389
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,000
 >> you've instructed investors to write a script for the stock they're going to buy.

390
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,800
 >> yeah.

391
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,240
 >> write the story down.

392
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,199
 why is the stock going to work or why is it undervalued?

393
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,839
 >> because i've told this to people in high school and college saying,

394
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,599
 make a paper portfolio.

395
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,240
 >> yeah.

396
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
 >> pick 10 stocks

397
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,880
 and watch them over a year or two and say why you bought them.

398
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,559
 list the reasons and see what happens.

399
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:20,959
 >> right?

400
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,160
 >> that's that's what this we're about.

401
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
 we do this.

402
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
 we have those our fund managers.

403
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,359
 they don't wait for the analysts come in.

404
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,799
 they're out researching companies.

405
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,480
 they're on the phone talking to companies.

406
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,160
 every fund manager is the highest role is an analyst, fundraiser analyst.

407
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,760
 we have analysts under that.

408
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,480
 >> we have all this information coming in.

409
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,559
 it's staggering now information.

410
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,919
 i could go back in time.

411
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,440
 we own a lot of nike.

412
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,480
 this story is amazing.

413
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,880
 i own a lot of nike and their inventories were out of whack.

414
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,559
 not a good sign.

415
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,080
 this before the internet.

416
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,480
 we we had to go to a library and get their quarterly report.

417
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,160
 our library fell.

418
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,120
 we got the came in.

419
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,280
 we open up inventories went down.

420
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,320
 we backed up the truck.

421
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,880
 i mean, the concept of,

422
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,400
 you know, they used to mail it out by mail to the shareholders.

423
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
 now they have a website.

424
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,440
 it's everybody on the planet knows what they do.

425
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,000
 >> yeah.

426
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,440
 >> information j is unbelievable.

427
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,120
 if you you can't understand they have company presentations.

428
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
 it's a lot easier to understand what you own today.

429
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,320
 >> so i think you're saying

430
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,919
 in today's day and age, you have no excuse not to know the companies you own.

431
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,559
 it's too easy.

432
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,360
 it's too easy.

433
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,400
 >> you don't need a bloomberg.

434
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,559
 it's websites.

435
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,000
 >> here's another one on risk.

436
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,360
 you said

437
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
 far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections

438
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,919
 or trying to anticipate corrections

439
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,120
 than has been lost in corrections themselves.

440
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,559
 talk about that.

441
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,320
 well, i think people, you know, they're always worried the market's going to run and

442
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
 and it does, as i mentioned.

443
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,120
 um, and

444
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,720
 you know, two years ago they were saying

445
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,520
 2024

446
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,720
 was going to be a a down year for the economy and

447
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,760
 25 has been a down year.

448
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,120
 i mean, every year >> i think economists predicted 33 of the last 11 recessions.

449
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,440
 >> yes.

450
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,919
 >> and >> with great certainty in my head.

451
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,160
 >> yeah.

452
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
 yep.

453
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,039
 and i think, you know, people are they're basically

454
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,840
 it's a you look dumb in this business.

455
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,280
 you're terrific in this business.

456
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,440
 if you write six and a half times out of 10, >> that's a great score.

457
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:25,760
 >> yeah.

458
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,960
 >> even if you're right five times out of 10,

459
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,200
 if you own costco or walmart or or

460
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,559
 i can't pronounce in the video.

461
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,640
 i'm getting close to be able to pronounce it.

462
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,480
 >> i think you i think you nailed it just there.

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,080
 yeah, >> that offsets your mistakes.

464
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
 >> yeah, >> you have to have these winners offset mistakes.

465
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,360
 and that's what we've done for 70 years at pi.

466
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,039
 >> so, you've got two more on this topic.

467
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,400
 i'll i'll read them both.

468
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,120
 um, you said you get recessions, you have stock market declines.

469
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,720
 if you don't understand that's going to happen, then you're not ready.

470
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
 you won't do well in markets.

471
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,559
 you also said people who succeed in the stock market also accept periodic losses,

472
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,880
 setbacks, and unexpected occurrences.

473
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,960
 how important is it for the average, i hate the term average investor,

474
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
 for the typical investor

475
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,320
 to go into this business understanding

476
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,400
 >> there's no way to dance around these things.

477
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,840
 they're going to take place.

478
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,720
 you're going to you're going to have to live through them.

479
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,440
 >> would you say that's the param one of the paramount things?

480
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,200
 because that's what i think.

481
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,559
 well, the point is, what if somebody has three children

482
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,440
 about to start college in two years?

483
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
 they shouldn't be in the stock market.

484
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,919
 >> that's right.

485
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,400
 >> they should be in the money market fund.

486
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,679
 but depends if you got your house, paid down your mortgage,

487
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:55,280
 then you can invest and it's been a great place to be since, you know,

488
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,600
 you're 1900. >> yeah.

489
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,960
 um, one of the more timeless things that you've said,

490
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,559
 and it comes off as sarcastic, but i think the last 15 years have really

491
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,039
 uh, proven the value of this idea.

492
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:16,400
 um, coming out of the great financial crisis, the most invogue style of investing was macroeconomic

493
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,840
 uh, hedge funds

494
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,320
 because there were a small handful of people

495
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,919
 who who determined that the housing crisis would ultimately

496
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,360
 bring about a recession.

497
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,400
 and those people were revered for a couple of years.

498
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,840
 um, >> you've never really been big on trying to outguess everyone else on the economy.

499
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,200
 and you said

500
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,440
 if you spend more than 13 minutes analyzing economic and market forecasts,

501
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,799
 you've wasted 10 minutes.

502
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,799
 >> y

503
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,559
 >> i i still quote you

504
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,559
 to this day when when clients call up and they want to talk about

505
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,360
 the latest labor report or what the fed's going to do.

506
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,320
 te tell us how long did it take you to figure that out

507
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,480
 and how much push back did you get when you said it from people that were

508
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,520
 economists or focused on the macro?

509
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,919
 >> well, i i don't remember if i ever have an economist.

510
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,280
 so, we just buy stocks and >> she's she's here tonight.

511
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,679
 >> okay.

512
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,039
 >> so, i'd love to get next next year's wall street journal.

513
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,760
 >> yeah, >> i pay at least $5 for next year's wall street journal.

514
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,720
 know that.

515
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
 and hands off to the people did the big short.

516
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,600
 i had no idea how bad the housing market was, how bad people had second mortgages.

517
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,919
 they had home improvement loans.

518
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,919
 they were underwater in their house.

519
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,039
 i had no idea.

520
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,240
 hats off to them.

521
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,640
 >> yeah.

522
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,240
 >> but and but i look at facts like what's happened to

523
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,960
 debt,

524
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,000
 credit card debt, what's you can get that now.

525
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
 what's happened to savings rate?

526
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
 what's happened to employment?

527
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,760
 i'd love to know what's happened in the future.

528
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,120
 i've been hoping i could get that in the last 81 years.

529
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,320
 it's it's not available.

530
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,559
 so i just deal with what's now.

531
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,799
 what's happened to used car prices?

532
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,640
 what's happen price of oil?

533
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,400
 you know what what's you know and you look at industries that have gone from

534
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,120
 miserable to getting better like like chrysler.

535
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,000
 i mean

536
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
 i remember people says

537
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,200
 gee you were really good on that show but how could you possibly recommend chrysler?

538
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,039
 you know that it's gone bankrupt.

539
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,799
 you know, well, they had 2 billion in cash and they

540
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,240
 they had enough money for the next three years.

541
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,200
 they weren't going bankrupt.

542
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,360
 but, you know, so i think

543
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,200
 the best talks i had, i think if 100 people did work on it,

544
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,679
 99 would say that's better than i expected.

545
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,080
 >> so, i use this for one of our great fun joel tillingast.

546
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,559
 i wrote a forward to his book and

547
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,720
 always said the person that wins the most turns of the most rocks wins the game.

548
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,760
 and i said, joel sing is a great geologist because if you look at 10 stocks,

549
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,799
 you probably find one that's mispriced.

550
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,120
 >> yeah.

551
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
 >> look at 20, you'll find two.

552
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,440
 look at 40, you'll find four.

553
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,640
 and that's what we've been doing at fidelity.

554
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,360
 we just don't look we look at everything.

555
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,919
 >> yeah.

556
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,440
 so, you're not discounting the value of economic data.

557
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,760
 >> great.

558
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,799
 >> you're you're you're saying if it's not from the future yeah.

559
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,799
 >> the market already understands this.

560
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:10,960
 >> yeah.

561
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,240
 i mean the i just i want to know facts right now.

562
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,960
 >> yeah, >> that's that's important.

563
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,120
 >> you said behind every stock is a company.

564
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,480
 find out what it's doing.

565
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,200
 some of the great stories about your big investment success

566
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
 involve

567
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 hands-on observations that you had been able to make

568
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,960
 living your real life, being in a supermarket,

569
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,159
 being in a shopping mall, looking at what people are doing.

570
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
 i think that over the years

571
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,679
 that idea has kind of been mischaracterized

572
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,480
 as

573
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,159
 >> if you use the product it's automatically

574
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,799
 a good stock which is not what you meant at all.

575
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,919
 >> could you could you explain the difference between those two ideas

576
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,440
 and and why that's so important?

577
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,559
 >> well, a lot of people i met so many nice people

578
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,000
 >> earlier tonight and

579
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,480
 a lot of them had read my book one up on wall street and

580
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,400
 i had the story about

581
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,440
 i had a great investment.

582
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,880
 my largest position was in hannes that had these pantyhoes called legs.

583
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,279
 they weren't that sheer.

584
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,799
 they really fit.

585
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,880
 but but most panty hoes are being sold in fancy department stores.

586
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,320
 this was at the supermarkets.

587
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,960
 >> yeah.

588
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,279
 >> and people go to a supermarket once a week.

589
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,400
 they go to a fancy store once every couple months.

590
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,440
 my wife went a little more often, but the the and i went with her.

591
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,039
 the so this was an incredible success, incredible success.

592
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,000
 but then a larger company called kaiser roth

593
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,279
 put the thing right next to it and it was called nononsense pant.

594
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,880
 >> so i went to two different stores about 65 different pairs of nononsense pantyos.

595
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,080
 >> now what kind of look did you get from the clerk

596
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,679
 >> in the in the process of that activity?

597
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,279
 yeah,

598
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,679
 it was an odd purchase, but

599
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,480
 i spread it over three stores, but the

600
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,559
 but i gave it out to everybody at fidel.

601
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,080
 he >> yeah, >> give me some feedback on this.

602
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,640
 >> they said it's not that good.

603
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,120
 >> okay.

604
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,240
 >> fundamentals, >> it's not that good.

605
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,799
 >> okay.

606
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,760
 so, >> and the other one the other one the first stock i bought

607
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,600
 at in mellan was taco bell

608
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,200
 and i had to say i had to say to i own this myself.

609
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,919
 is it okay?

610
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,320
 >> who was clapping for taco bell?

611
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,279
 is that it's not one of my people, was it?

612
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,000
 okay.

613
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,600
 >> and

614
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,200
 so i said, "can i buy some stock that i own myself?" said, "sure."

615
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,279
 you just can't sell it after you buy.

616
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,080
 you have to hold on.

617
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,279
 so, so that's when we had ma bell and all these bell companies.

618
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,640
 and so i called the trade room.

619
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,440
 i said, "i want to buy taco bell." they said, "what is taco bell?"

620
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,600
 and i explained what a taco was.

621
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
 they're only in southern california.

622
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,360
 >> they're going to central california.

623
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,960
 i didn't get a burrito supreme, but i get i explain a taco

624
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,080
 because it's basically a taco has very little meat,

625
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,200
 a lot of protein.

626
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,240
 you can sell a really good meal for a low price.

627
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,279
 and i got robbed on it because pepsicola

628
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,400
 bought pizza hut and they bought some kentucky by chicken.

629
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
 they bought taco to sell pepsi, right?

630
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,960
 >> this stock would have gone to 500. >> yeah.

631
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,640
 >> my largest position was 18. they bought at 30. >> okay.

632
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,960
 >> would have gone to 500, 600. but they bought it to sell pepsi.

633
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,640
 >> when chipotle came along, did you avail yourself of the opportunity?

634
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,120
 >> i did.

635
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,919
 i did.

636
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,279
 >> but how i miss starbucks?

637
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,320
 i don't get that.

638
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,960
 you know, cuz i own dunkin donuts.

639
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,000
 how did i miss starbucks?

640
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
 i mean, >> you missed starbucks.

641
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,159
 >> brain cramp.

642
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:40,880
 i didn't buy it.

643
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,320
 well, >> okay.

644
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,760
 um, you've got some great quotes about portfolio management, and here are a few of them.

645
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,480
 you said, "in the long run, a portfolio of well-chosen stocks

646
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,520
 and or mutual funds can outperform

647
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,640
 the most sophisticated investment strategy."

648
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,880
 i think there's a cottage industry

649
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,399
 today and probably there has been for a long time

650
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,600
 of people selling complexity to investors, right?

651
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,159
 >> it's one of the best sellers on wall street.

652
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,360
 >> um

653
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,200
 >> just that that that simple statement i think

654
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,960
 >> uh very much is something that most of us would associate with fidelity

655
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,000
 >> and very much is something that we would associate with you.

656
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,240
 why do people need to hear that message today?

657
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,720
 what's funny earlier on i met

658
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,080
 maybe hundred people to chat with them and somebody's in the audience they

659
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,120
 they shovel

660
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,480
 chicken poop and they use the word ronzo hit who's there's a person here with the

661
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,080
 chicken poop in new jersey

662
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,200
 >> and he

663
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,000
 waving

664
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,240
 at the top you won't be able to see >> okay

665
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,039
 >> congrats >> but but he

666
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,120
 he decided to be a serious investor do hard work he said he's done extremely well.

667
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
 >> yeah.

668
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,480
 >> so, do you think that that's still possible today

669
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
 given how armed to the teeth

670
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,080
 professional investors are with data and tools

671
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,919
 and high frequency access?

672
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,440
 is it still possible

673
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,600
 to be someone who just on a part-time basis when they get home from work

674
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,919
 reads about stocks and makes decisions?

675
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,120
 you still believe in that?

676
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,919
 >> well, i'll tell you a story personally.

677
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,200
 my daughters get me an ipod.

678
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,559
 this before the iphone.

679
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,440
 >> yep.

680
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,919
 >> and the the pc business was terrible.

681
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,320
 they're selling for 80 or 900 bucks, making $20. they had a decent balance sheet.

682
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,240
 the ipod was $200. they make 150 on it.

683
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,640
 >> yeah.

684
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
 >> the ipod financed the iphone.

685
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,679
 no, it just did some work.

686
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,480
 and the company had 300 million in cash.

687
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,919
 >> this is apple in >> 2001ish.

688
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:50,640
 >> i'm not sure.

689
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,279
 >> right.

690
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:51,919
 okay.

691
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,919
 but it, you know, things change.

692
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,200
 companies are dynamic.

693
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,919
 something comes along and things go from terrible

694
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:06,960
 or we use a term or appropriate crappy to semi crappy >> to better to terrific.

695
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,200
 >> something happened at apple

696
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,440
 and they they were now going to make a lot of money.

697
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,799
 i had no idea.

698
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,080
 i have a phone on me, an iphone, but i had no idea what's falling.

699
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,600
 the stock easily was a triple just on that alone.

700
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,360
 um, this is one of your more famous quotes and made famous by being

701
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,760
 recqued by warren buffett.

702
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,399
 you said, "selling your winners

703
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,399
 and holding your losers

704
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,080
 is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds." that's a great one.

705
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,039
 that's an all time.

706
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,679
 >> yeah.

707
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,320
 >> um,

708
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
 you were known to to hold on to winners for a very long period of time.

709
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,480
 >> y

710
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,799
 >> um,

711
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,559
 a lot of people were quick to take profits

712
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,840
 so they could say, "i won." yep.

713
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,240
 yep.

714
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,039
 >> um, tell us the warren buffett connection to that quote and and why it's meaningful.

715
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,159
 >> i don't know how i got my landline, but i got this call.

716
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,960
 >> annie, i think it was like seven, our middle daughter

717
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,360
 says there's a warren buffett on the phone here.

718
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,080
 you know, i thought >> what year what year do you think this is?

719
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,799
 if you could remember.

720
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,720
 well, what era is this?

721
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,360
 >> i don't.

722
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,440
 >> who knows?

723
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,799
 >> was way beyond the dark ages.

724
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,399
 i was >> all right.

725
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,520
 >> yeah.

726
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,679
 but the so, i pick up the phone.

728
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,080
 my end report's due in two weeks.

729
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,039
 i love a quote.

730
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,159
 can i use it?

731
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,600
 this is all in about three seconds.

732
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,279
 you know,

733
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,919
 he says, "what's the quote?" he says, "you know,

734
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,880
 getting rid of your winners and holding the losers is like, you know,

735
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,679
 wiring the weeds and cutting the flowers." i said, "it's yours."

736
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,559
 >> he said,

737
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:36,880
 >> "if

738
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,760
 you don't come to omaha

739
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,399
 and see me,

740
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,519
 your name will be mud

741
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,720
 in nebraska."

742
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,519
 >> did you do it?

743
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:41,919
 >> oh, yeah.

744
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,200
 many times.

745
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,840
 you you built a relationship with warren >> played bridge together.

746
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,039
 he's he's the best.

747
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,640
 i mean there's no imagine he bought apple

748
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,519
 like eight years after i i was that i ipod story and made fivefold.

749
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,559
 >> yes.

750
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,159
 >> and he and he had a huge position ibm.

751
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,799
 it was going down.

752
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,039
 he says i love stocks going down.

753
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,399
 i think ibm's great.

754
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,360
 he totally reversed.

755
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,880
 he got the hell out of ibm.

756
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,440
 >> yeah.

757
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,480
 >> he's the best.

758
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,120
 >> yeah.

759
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,000
 round round of applause.

760
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,960
 i wanted to ask you is there any idea from the investing realm

761
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,279
 that you once believed

762
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,919
 um you you just said i am axiomatic about this this aspect of investing

763
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:32,559
 that

764
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,360
 you no longer

765
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,919
 believe in

766
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,279
 or is there something that you've

767
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,240
 changed your mind about

768
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,559
 as

769
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,840
 time has gone on

770
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,200
 or do you still

771
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,399
 mostly believe all of the things that you did in the 70s and the 80s

772
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,080
 >> the same thing i this success of amazon.

773
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,559
 >> yeah.

774
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,480
 >> costco, walmart.

775
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,679
 i mean, forget the all the, you know, the technology companies that or oracle.

776
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,480
 i mean, that's what that's what's done well for average investors and

777
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,679
 fidelity

778
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,679
 was heavy invested in all those.

779
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,000
 >> okay.

780
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,279
 >> just using public information.

781
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,399
 you know,

782
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,200
 you know, we look at a lot of companies and we find some

783
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,919
 companies that turning around like, you know,

784
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,480
 we bought some gold stocks when people hated gold.

785
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,120
 >> yeah.

786
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,960
 so, the business doesn't change that much.

787
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,360
 this the names of the companies changed.

788
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,760
 the management changes, but the business is

789
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,640
 still very much as it was when you were >> well,

790
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,559
 i think there's one major change.

791
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,679
 >> i think 15 years ago there was 8,000 public companies.

792
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,919
 >> there's about 3,000. >> now there's three or four.

793
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:34,720
 >> yeah.

794
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,000
 so part of the upside that 10 bagger that i love that term

795
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,320
 sometimes you have this great stock

796
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,679
 if you hold on to it it's not the pepsi steel then

797
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,600
 private equity you think the stock's going to 30 it's three

798
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,159
 and private

799
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,840
 equity buys the whole damn thing out at six

800
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,360
 >> they take it away from the market.

801
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,840
 >> yep.

802
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,960
 >> yeah.

803
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
 >> that's that's painful.

804
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,000
 >> i wanted to ask you about the modern stock market.

805
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
 um specifically

806
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,600
 the ai boom that's been for the last 3 years

807
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:13,359
 arguably the the biggest driving force behind earnings growth, behind revenue growth, excitement about stocks.

808
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,079
 um

809
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,440
 what do you think about it when you when you watch it or

810
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,560
 how involved are you with ai stocks with your own money right now?

811
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,679
 i have zero ai stocks and the

812
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,440
 um >> okay.

813
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,879
 >> i i literally couldn't pronounce nvidia until about eight months ago.

814
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,480
 the u but we have people that are very tech.

815
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,960
 i >> yeah, >> i am the lowest tech guy ever.

816
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,599
 i mean, you know, my wife is mechanical, my daughter's a mechanical,

817
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,280
 i can't do anything with computers.

818
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,918
 so, >> um i just have yellow pads and a phone.

819
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,679
 yeah.

820
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,520
 from your from your position as a third party to this, do you

821
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,839
 um do you think investors have chased these ideas too far?

822
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,040
 are there echoes of the 1999

823
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,640
 2000 era to you when you look at it or

824
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,599
 are you open-minded

825
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,160
 about it and you say maybe this is not going to end as badly

826
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,800
 as that

827
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,280
 instance

828
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,720
 did?

829
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,160
 >> i have no idea.

830
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,359
 >> okay.

831
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,240
 >> don't have any.

832
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,599
 i have a lot of stocks i like but not in that category.

833
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,599
 so let's talk about your current portfolio.

834
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,440
 what are the stocks that you like today?

835
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,040
 >> fidelli doesn't let me do this anymore.

836
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,640
 so >> okay, >> in fact they don't let any any employees do that.

837
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:28,880
 okay.

838
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,280
 i remember i was on television i was saying >> how coca-cola is a spectacular company.

839
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,640
 >> but based on what they're doing right now,

840
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,040
 i think in 10 years i i think the stock will be the same price.

841
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,160
 i mean it's the stocks, you know, priced in the next 10 years of growth.

842
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,960
 >> yeah.

843
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,359
 >> and we happen to manage ko's ira.

844
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,440
 i mean, this did not go over big.

845
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,400
 >> we weren't thrilled with that.

846
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,800
 okay.

847
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,320
 >> it was not a big success.

848
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,640
 >> so, so for good reasons.

849
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,680
 um,

850
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,119
 one of the things that you talked about in your books was the necessity of not

851
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,680
 chasing glamorous stocks.

852
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,640
 and one of the things you said you like the best

853
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,839
 is when a company got itself into trouble

854
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,640
 >> where it was a salvageable situation but nobody wanted to be caught dead owning it.

855
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,560
 one of the examples that you used famously was waste management.

856
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,280
 >> you said >> nobody wants anything to do with this stock.

857
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,599
 number one, they're involved with garbage.

858
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,560
 number two, everybody thinks the mafia controls it.

859
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,160
 >> um you made a lot of money there.

860
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,480
 >> oh yeah.

861
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,640
 um, do you think that that heristic

862
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,520
 for selecting stocks that are off the beaten path still works for investors?

863
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,480
 >> well, again,

864
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,839
 under my thesis that if 10 people look at it,

865
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,240
 one nine will say this better than expected.

866
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,560
 >> yeah.

867
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,280
 >> i don't think people are looking at waste management.

868
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,400
 they just wouldn't look at it.

869
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,160
 so, stocks are mispriced when there's a lot of knowing the class of fidelity.

870
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,760
 we have a lot of good competitors.

871
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,480
 >> yeah.

872
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,680
 and and they're they're doing the same work we're doing

873
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,119
 and sometimes they're not looking at certain categories of stocks.

874
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,760
 and what i also found out, i've had companies that were losing $6 a share

875
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,839
 and things got they started getting better.

876
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,079
 the industry hadn't recovered,

877
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,320
 but they did certain things and now they're losing $2 a share, >> right?

878
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,160
 >> still not good, but not as bad.

879
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,560
 >> but i think that's $4 a share of brewing.

880
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,480
 then they went from losing two to making two.

881
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,000
 the stock quadrupled.

882
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,400
 >> yeah.

883
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,119
 >> it's the same $4. >> okay.

884
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,680
 >> why weren't people looking when they went from what were they doing?

885
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,240
 they went from losing six to losing two in a bad environment.

886
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,280
 things didn't improve.

887
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
 they were doing something right.

888
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,760
 >> can you tell us about the oxymorons of wall street?

889
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,640
 and some of us are some of us are here in the room.

890
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,000
 um you you it was very original.

891
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,800
 you went on this kind of to force

892
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,760
 i don't want to call it a tirade but this this

893
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,280
 um this sort of monologue about

894
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,359
 don't be fooled into thinking

895
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,359
 just because someone's a professional

896
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,800
 that they can do better than you or they know more than you.

897
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
 um warren's got a great quote about this.

898
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,480
 he said wall street is the only place that people take a rolls-royce

899
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,800
 to get advice from somebody who took the subway.

900
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,359
 and

901
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:23,920
 in fairness,

902
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,720
 i took the subway

903
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,280
 to my my

904
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,040
 first job on wall street for a long time.

905
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,400
 >> um but >> you you you talked about the oxymorons,

906
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,000
 people that thought they knew everything just because they were had proximity to the exchange.

907
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,359
 >> and i think you were giving a pep talk to the reader of the book.

908
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,560
 >> i'm telling them, don't think that you can't be good at this too.

909
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,599
 >> you still believe that?

910
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:45,920
 >> absolutely.

911
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,720
 i mean i just think people

912
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,359
 average people feel fidelity that if they work hard they're careful and things are not clear.

913
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,720
 i have a term like the in poker term the next card to turn over.

914
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,839
 this next card to turn over i don't know what it's going to be.

915
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,680
 it could be positive could be negative

916
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,480
 but two years from now this company is going to be better.

917
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,119
 >> yeah.

918
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,480
 >> and if the next car turns out it's positive buy it.

919
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
 but i think you should buy some now.

920
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,480
 this and i don't the next quarter maybe may not be better.

921
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,160
 i mean we don't know companies are get really tight in these quiet periods.

922
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,640
 so you're doing your best you can

923
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,440
 but there's three things going to make this company

924
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,320
 have higher earnings in two to three years.

925
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,400
 we should own it right now.

926
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,119
 >> okay.

927
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,760
 and that's and that you still think that approach

928
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,640
 is still the way people should be thinking and not think

929
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,440
 that somebody knows more than them?

930
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,560
 well, i think i think people tend to concentrate on what's hitting the new high list.

931
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,200
 >> yeah.

932
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,960
 >> and and that's a good place to operate.

933
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,000
 i mean, one point bj's was on the new high list.

934
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 one point, you know,

935
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,720
 you know, ross store is on the new high list or

936
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,480
 so or carvano is a new high list.

937
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,760
 so, >> yeah,

938
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,000
 >> companies new high list can go up, but

939
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,280
 i look at the stocks and they're on the new low list.

940
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,160
 >> okay.

941
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,040
 >> most of them are crap.

942
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,000
 it's some are good.

943
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,359
 it's fall that style of investing has fallen out of favor in recent years.

944
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,520
 do you think it'll make a comeback?

945
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,480
 >> i hope so.

946
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,320
 >> some some call it value investing,

947
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,280
 some call it bottom fishing, what whatever the term is.

948
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,920
 >> yep.

949
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,240
 >> okay.

950
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,320
 you still think there's there's something there.

951
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,800
 >> well, we get one of the great managers ever.

952
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,599
 bruce johnson.

953
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,320
 bruce, you're here somewhere.

954
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,200
 >> yeah, bruce is here.

955
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,560
 bruce johnston's in the audience tonight.

956
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,599
 >> he's a superstar buying down companies with a dividend yield.

957
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,480
 yeah.

958
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,040
 >> turned around.

959
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,720
 he worked incredibly hard.

960
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,320
 did a lot longer than i did.

961
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,480
 he's a superstar and

962
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,200
 and he's

963
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,359
 great person to boot, but he he was very thorough and careful and prudent and

964
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,200
 and just like me,

965
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,320
 he

966
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,680
 he was wrong, you know, four times out of 10.

967
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,160
 he's saying three only three.

968
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,200
 um,

969
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,839
 are you impre i so i understand you don't you're you're not particularly investing

970
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,119
 per se in the magnificent seven stocks

971
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,880
 but you've always been an admirer of great businesses.

972
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,000
 these are

973
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,160
 i i think you'd agree these are among

974
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,760
 the greatest publicly traded companies we've ever seen in america.

975
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,040
 these are companies that

976
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,760
 yes they have trillion dollar market caps and they're not cheap,

977
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,160
 >> right?

978
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,760
 >> but these are companies with 30 and 40% profit margins, 20% revenue growth.

979
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,079
 year after year after year.

980
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,599
 >> you must surely you must be impressed by these these companies.

981
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,640
 >> yeah, facebook or meta is incredible company.

982
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,240
 >> yeah, >> microsoft's a great company.

983
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,319
 google's a great company.

984
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,160
 >> amazon's a staggering company.

985
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,359
 i'm a little vague on tesla, but

986
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,119
 you know this byd is making a car now in hungary.

987
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,119
 it's a third the price and a good car.

988
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,119
 i mean, i can't get this humanoid thing about, you know,

989
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,119
 but no,

990
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,359
 but every employee at fidelity,

991
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,880
 we call in a 10:15

992
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,800
 and say, "i'd like to buy these three stocks,

993
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,960
 sell these three stocks, and they say, nope,

994
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,599
 can't do it.

995
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,560
 fidelity is buying or selling." every employee does that.

996
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,079
 >> so, i don't have a chance of buying neta or or amazon because fidel's buying.

997
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,119
 but that's fair.

998
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,040
 >> you could buy the fidelity spartan index fund if you want exposure to those.

999
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,319
 >> i own a lot of fidelity funds.

1000
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:22,400
 yeah.

1001
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,680
 yeah.

1002
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,560
 um,

1003
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,280
 one of the concerns

1004
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,599
 that

1005
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,960
 probably a lot of people in the audience

1006
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,839
 have right now,

1007
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,160
 large

1008
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,480
 cap

1009
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:28,880
 stocks

1010
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,000
 in general

1011
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,200
 are selling at some of the highest multiples we've ever seen.

1012
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,520
 >> yep.

1013
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,720
 >> um, historically high, not the highest ever, but in the decileis, let's say.

1014
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,960
 >> so, we're selling currently s&p 500 22 times, trailing 12 months earnings.

1015
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,400
 granted, earnings are growing, interest rates are falling.

1016
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,200
 it sort of makes sense when you think about this being right >> a capex boom

1017
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,400
 and low unemployment.

1018
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,839
 there are a lot of justifiable reasons for it.

1019
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,839
 do you worry about future returns

1020
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,200
 for the investor who puts a dollar or work to work today?

1021
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,680
 >> yeah.

1022
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,599
 >> uh in in the market,

1023
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:13,040
 >> i'll ask somebody in the room, do we run costco's ira or or walmart's ira?

1024
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,079
 >> is costco's like at 55 times earnings?

1025
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,400
 costco has an ai stock multiple, but they sell paper towels.

1026
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,599
 >> it's a great company, man.

1027
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,720
 >> yeah.

1028
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,680
 >> 55 times earnings.

1029
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,520
 or walmart is 70 years old.

1030
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,359
 you know, sam sam walt was at j c penney this great formula

1031
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,440
 went in small towns.

1032
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,359
 imagine here's example

1033
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,880
 of being you don't have sometimes you don't have to be in the first inning.

1034
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,280
 walmart comes public.

1035
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,560
 he said, "gee, it's a little common in southwest and southeast.

1036
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,880
 not sure about them." so, 10 years after they went public, the stock's up 10fold.

1037
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,839
 it's gone up 10 places.

1038
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,760
 i missed it.

1039
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,520
 it's now up 80fold since then.

1040
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,800
 these 10 years, they're 25 year old company.

1041
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,359
 >> yeah.

1042
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,760
 >> and they copied the kmart formula.

1043
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,119
 they're lower cost.

1044
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,240
 they went to the big cities.

1045
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,359
 they could kill kmart, kill sears.

1046
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,599
 so went up 80fold after going up 10fold because after it's a 25-y old company,

1047
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,280
 10 years in public, they're in 18% of the united states.

1048
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,440
 then they went to 19, then the 20, then the 23. >> yeah.

1049
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,319
 >> and you know, and then they had sam's club.

1050
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,560
 and i had the same example with mcdonald's.

1051
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,960
 mcdonald's was my biggest position.

1052
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,319
 people said, "it's all over for mcdonald's." i says, "well, wait a second.

1053
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,720
 why is that?" well, how many more mcdonald's can i have?

1054
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,520
 well, i think they can do really well in europe.

1055
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,079
 there's 450 mcdonald's in france.

1056
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:50,480
 >> yeah.

1057
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,200
 >> in france, germany, 380. there's over 300 in england.

1058
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,400
 there's 300 in spain.

1059
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,720
 there's more mcdonald's outside the united states.

1060
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,200
 so, mcdonald's went up 10fold after that.

1061
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,040
 people said mcdonald's is done.

1062
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,640
 >> they just didn't they didn't think it through.

1063
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,640
 is the message to that the fact that a stock has already been successful

1064
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,079
 tells you nothing about how much more successful it could be in the future?

1065
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:14,319
 >> no.

1066
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,839
 the facts were at that point they had 20 stores in france on their way to

1067
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:18,640
 400.

1068
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,920
 they had 20 in germany.

1069
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,880
 they had 20 in spain.

1070
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,760
 this was not an idea.

1071
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,800
 they were doing it.

1072
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,119
 >> yeah.

1073
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,839
 >> and people were lining up to buy a big mac everywhere.

1074
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,000
 um, i wanted to ask you

1075
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,079
 in the in the time that we have remaining

1076
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,240
 a couple of other things about the modern market

1077
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:34,720
 just

1078
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,400
 so we could all get your take on them.

1079
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,520
 and if and if you have no opinion, that's okay, too.

1080
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,200
 in the last

1081
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:48,480
 week, the sec has said they would study an idea proposed by president trump to

1082
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,000
 um ease up on the quarterly reporting burden for public companies

1083
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,760
 and allow companies to report earnings on a semiannual

1084
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,560
 basis,

1085
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,040
 which is how they do it in the uk.

1086
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,119
 do you do you have an opinion, not a political

1087
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:03,599
 political

1088
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,520
 opinion, but do you have an opinion on

1089
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,800
 what that means for investors or whether or not that's something

1090
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,680
 we should celebrate or have cause for concern?

1091
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,119
 is that is that something that you think about?

1092
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,480
 >> i haven't really

1093
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,720
 devoted a lot of attention to that, but

1094
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,440
 i think 3 months is a very short period.

1095
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,960
 >> yeah, >> very short period.

1096
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,680
 and you measured with it and maybe the year before was very strong.

1097
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,960
 so, you're up against a strong.

1098
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,760
 so

1099
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,640
 there's some merit to having a longer period to see

1100
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,960
 what's really happened to the company than just 3 months.

1101
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,400
 so i have not made a decision on that one.

1102
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,000
 >> i wanted to ask you

1103
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,440
 um about the meme stock phenomenon that took place during the pandemic.

1104
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,800
 from my perspective, and i'd love to hear if you agree with me or not.

1105
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,280
 from my perspective, obviously there were some elements of that that were reckless,

1106
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,839
 but the byproduct is

1107
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,920
 we got 25 or 30 million people to open their first brokerage account,

1108
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,400
 mostly people under the age of 30.

1109
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,560
 um, where the prior generation was very slow to embrace stocks.

1110
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,680
 so, i sort of looked at it like it had a silver lining.

1111
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,480
 yeah.

1112
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,839
 >> would you agree with that or do you have a different take?

1113
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:17,599
 >> the market bottom in ' 82 was 777. yeah.

1114
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,119
 >> not 7,000. 777. >> the dow >> dow.

1115
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:21,839
 >> yeah.

1116
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,359
 >> so, we've had a incredible bull market since 82.

1117
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:30,000
 we've had, you know, 10 or 12 declines, but maybe a few more.

1118
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,920
 so, people today,

1119
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,240
 you know, they're not used to

1120
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,520
 everybody i knew grew up, they're warned, the big one's coming.

1121
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,800
 we've had 11 recessions two.

1122
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,400
 we've never had a big one.

1123
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:44,720
 >> yeah.

1124
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,040
 but imagine in in the depression, we didn't have social security.

1125
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,400
 it wasn't social security.

1126
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,160
 what a criminal invention.

1127
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,560
 people when they retired, they got older.

1128
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,400
 they moved in with their family.

1129
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,440
 the family had to stop cut back on their spending.

1130
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,560
 they also we didn't have unemployment conversation.

1131
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,319
 we didn't have the sec.

1132
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,079
 the sec did not exist.

1133
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:08,480
 >> yeah.

1134
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,000
 >> did not exist.

1135
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 there's so many things that are better.

1136
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,400
 and we had a federal reserve that was asleep.

1137
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
 to to booth.

1138
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,160
 so i think there was a lot of things that you know this margin requirements now

1139
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,400
 i mean this 9029

1140
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,800
 no one jumped out of windows

1141
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:33,599
 >> that was fabricated you said >> 1% of americans own stocks 9029

1142
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,920
 >> i don't think a lot of people understand that

1143
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,480
 >> the losses

1144
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,760
 were very contained to a small group of people >> but we had an incredible

1145
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,599
 depression

1146
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:47,200
 >> 30% of people out of work not enough food, travel farming environment.

1147
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:54,160
 it was it was awful and and people went through that.

1148
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,079
 i've read stories about it was grim.

1149
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,599
 >> you think we have evolved

1150
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,599
 the economy and the markets

1151
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,480
 to the point where it would be very difficult to repeat the quote unquote big one.

1152
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,400
 >> well, we've had 11 tests,

1153
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,319
 >> 11 recessions since, >> and no one's ever got worse than,

1154
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,800
 you know, five, six% decline in gdp.

1155
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,400
 there's a lot of cushions now.

1156
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,160
 yeah, >> 63% of americans own their house.

1157
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,839
 >> you know, that was not true in the 1920s.

1158
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:22,720
 you know,

1159
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,680
 people have ias that if they're fidelity, they they're not they're not going to panic.

1160
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,160
 um people people are careful with their savings.

1161
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,839
 i mean, the gi bill allowed people to buy houses,

1162
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,400
 you know, with 5% down create a lot of people with wealth.

1163
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
 most wealth in america is in their house.

1164
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,119
 >> yeah.

1165
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,119
 and that was not true in the 20s.

1166
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,359
 people were renting, rent went up.

1167
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,359
 i mean, there's so many buffers now

1168
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,280
 that u you know,

1169
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,400
 i mean, it's incredible what how many positives there are.

1170
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,240
 i mean, we had a lot of tests.

1171
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,040
 we had many opportunities to have a big one.

1172
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,559
 and we've had some

1173
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:07,040
 incredibly bad presidents, some bad congresses, we've had bad economists, and we've made it through.

1174
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,319
 it's a pretty good system.

1175
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,960
 i i like i like that message for people who are overdosing on

1176
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,880
 um great depression content on their social media feeds

1177
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,960
 and constantly being fed that as a realistic possibility.

1178
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,200
 um i wanted to ask you one last question.

1179
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,319
 um this is an audience of some of the most successful,

1180
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,280
 dedicated,

1181
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,800
 self-directed investors, customers of fidelity.

1182
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,080
 first of all, give yourselves a round of applause.

1183
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:48,160
 [applause] as as someone who for decades has been the leading advocate of the self-directed investor,

1184
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,760
 um is there any

1185
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,640
 parting words of wisdom for this audience or anything that you think they need to hear

1186
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,800
 from you that maybe they haven't heard from anyone else or haven't heard in a while?

1187
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,200
 is there any encouragement that you'd like to offer?

1188
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,640
 we we'd love to hear it.

1189
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,640
 >> well, i think this is a special group of friends.

1190
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,400
 these people do hard work.

1191
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,440
 they're careful.

1192
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,559
 they're prudent.

1193
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,760
 they they buy stocks.

1194
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,160
 they they understand what they own.

1195
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,680
 you know, you know, that's not true of most people.

1196
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,760
 and

1197
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,359
 my my generation growing up, if you worked for telephone company, if you worked for

1198
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,480
 utility, a gas, whatever it was, you had a pension.

1199
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:26,800
 >> yeah.

1200
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,839
 >> didn't worry about it.

1201
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,280
 now you have an ira.

1202
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,960
 company matches it.

1203
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,440
 you've got to decide what you want to do with it.

1204
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,200
 you're responsible now for your own retirement in a way that prior generations

1205
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,400
 didn't have to think about.

1206
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,280
 >> you have to have it right.

1207
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,559
 you have to decide.

1208
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,160
 but i had a i had a son-in-law.

1209
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,960
 he he wasn't happy with the company he's working for.

1210
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,920
 and

1211
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,800
 and they were going to let's say he's going to put $5,000

1212
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,559
 in and they were going to match it.

1213
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,839
 he says, "i don't want to do that." he says, "well, could i put $5,000 in?

1214
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,040
 they'll match it.

1215
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,000
 that's a double every year.

1216
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,880
 can i participate in your ira?

1217
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,040
 you know, and i'd love to tell the story about this fear, this ai fear.

1218
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,720
 >> please, please.

1219
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,640
 >> so, in fact, i i was talking to josh earlier.

1220
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,280
 i was listening to a conference call on this company supplies semiconductor equipment.

1221
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,960
 they were in this industry.

1222
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,400
 and it was so sad.

1223
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,680
 i was so sad.

1224
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,079
 the poor ceo was talking.

1225
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,079
 and he's talking about a1,

1226
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,319
 you know, the steak sauce, you know, and my 11-year-old grandchild knows the artificial intelligence that

1227
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:41,200
 he's calling a1. and there must be people saying it's not a1, it's ai, right?

1228
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,640
 but but there's this fear that all jobs are going to go away.

1229
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,200
 so i get i get a good example.

1230
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,960
 1984 they split up at&t

1231
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,599
 >> the baby bells and created the >> nine baby bells >> including taco bell.

1232
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,960
 >> yeah, taco bell was >> that was a that was a max >> southern bell.

1233
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,680
 taco bell.

1234
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,440
 okay.

1235
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,760
 >> so they split up 1 million people work for at&t.

1236
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,480
 we had 100 million jobs.

1237
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,880
 one out of every 100 americans worked at at&t.

1238
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,359
 so it's now that was 84. so it's what 40 years later.

1239
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,440
 this industry phenomenal growth.

1240
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,040
 there were no cell phones then.

1241
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,920
 remember payoneses?

1242
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,400
 any remember payones?

1243
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,680
 there's texting.

1244
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,599
 i mean what you do on your phone?

1245
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,200
 this has been one of the greatest growth industries.

1246
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:45,440
 if you add together verizon, t-mobile, at&t, they now have 400,000 employees.

1247
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:52,079
 we went from a million to 4,000. it's 153 million americans working today.

1248
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,480
 we've gone from 100 million americans working to 153. >> yeah.

1249
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,240
 >> it's a great country.

1250
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,359
 we're creative.

1251
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:07,040
 so >> this incredible conversation, america creates, china duplicates, and europe legislates.

1252
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,040
 right.

1253
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,680
 >> so from your from your point of view, the people displaced

1254
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,640
 by ai

1255
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,440
 and other innovations to come in the future,

1256
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,040
 they'll be doing something else.

1257
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,160
 it's unlikely

1258
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,640
 they'll be sitting there saying, "i wish i still had my job that ai took away."

1259
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,119
 >> yeah.

1260
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,920
 i'm i think more importantly, you know, one job is going to go away.

1261
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,680
 >> these are good paying jobs.

1262
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,160
 >> yeah.

1263
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,200
 the people that drive a truck, a tractor trailer

1264
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,160
 from a manufacturing firm to a distribution center on highways, not through beacon hill,

1265
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,960
 they go back that night.

1266
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,559
 that should be automated.

1267
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:47,839
 >> yeah.

1268
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,000
 >> and like and likely will be, you would say?

1269
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,119
 >> i would say in 20 years they'll be we'll lose 500,000 jobs.

1270
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:55,520
 >> yeah.

 they don't need a >> sorry automation is going to have a bigger impact than ai.

1276
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,280
 you're saying >> automation has been a positive.

1277
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,800
 automation has been dramatically up.

1278
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:24,480
 it's automation has been incredible the last 50 years and we've gone from 100 million jobs

1279
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,920

00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,359
 i mean, all the growth

1283
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:40,480
 is new companies and companies with 100 to 200 employees or less.

 >> yeah.

1286
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,400
 >> the largest 500 companies have fewer employees than they did 50 years ago.

1287
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:56,480
 all the growth in this country is entrepreneurs starting a little shop, starting something else.

1288
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,319
 that makes our country great.

1289
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,200
 and the important thing is banks will lend to them.
