1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,040
i'm i'm sick of multi-millionaires

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,480
 telling

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,399
 kids who can't afford to turn the heating on you just need to be more entrepreneurial

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:06,879
 it's sick

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,640
 dan it's sick

6
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,360
 well your video

7
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,160
 where you talk about

8
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,880
 if you don't have a rich dad you're screwed

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,200
 well to me if i had have come across your content

10
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,799
 at 19

11
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,639
 20 years old i would have been screwed

12
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:16,720
 my friends

13
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,119
 can't feed their kids

14
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,199
 okay if it was that easy

15
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:19,760
 why is everybody

16
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
 not doing it i'll tell you why people aren't doing it

17
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,359
 it's

18
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,359
 because

19
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,760
 you like to say one thing back on

20
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
 that

21
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,880
 today's debate

22
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,119
 is fiery to say the least but important nonetheless

23
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,640
 as i sat down with two leading experts in wealth and entrepreneurship

24
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,600
 and the economy

25
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,480
 to discuss the state of the us the state of the uk and the western world

26
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,600
 do you think the reason

27
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,440
 the average brit american are getting poorer

28
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,280
 is because they don't know how to create wealth no the reason people are getting poorer

29
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,520
 is because of big governments

30
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,960
 record levels of taxes

31
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,600
 an outdated schooling system

32
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,160
 technology

33
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,199
 and remote working

34
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,239
 you sure about that

35
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,879
 how do you disagree with those opinions

36
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,079
 living standards are falling

37
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,480
 because of growing wealth in equality

38
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,199
 if you allow the rich to get richer

39
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,000
 they squeeze

40
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,440
 the middle class and the poor class out of things like housing

41
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,760
 let's cut tax on people who are working

42
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,080
 hard

43
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,479
 and let's raise tax on the richest

44
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:06,159
 and most powerful

45
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,439
 people in the world that's an overly

46
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,000
 simplified

47
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,960
 view of things we now have a th000

48
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,600
 millionaires

49
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,439
 a month leaving

50
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,640
 which means every ordinary

51
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:12,920
 person

52
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,320
 who pays

53
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,759
 10 grand

54
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:14,360
 a year in tax

55
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,200
 will now have to pay

56
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,479
 20

57
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:15,680
 grand

58
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,400
 a year in tax

59
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,600
 you end up cutting off your nose to spite your face

60
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,880
 if we are a country

61
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,240
 that don't try and do things which are necessary

62
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,360
 because they are hard

63
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,200
 then our kids

64
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,119
 will live in poverty

65
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,560
 what do you want people to do there's a lot of different ways

66
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,920
 backle

67
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960

 and watched many many of your videos over time i have a

95
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
 a sort of deep

96
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,000
 understanding of that but for anyone that doesn't know you

97
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
 can you give me a picture of the context

98
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,680

101
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,599
 about the things you're writing about today and running the youtube channel

102
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,760
 and speaking to the subject matter that you're speaking about today

103
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,040
 take me right back and give me as much as you possibly

104
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,920
 can

105
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,040
 okay so

106
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,760
 my name is gary stevenson

107
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,959
 i was born in a place called ilford which is in outer east london

108
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,599
 quite a poor family little terrace house by the railway

109
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,640
 you know playing football in the streets kind of stuff

110
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
 um

111
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,360
 always very good at maths since i was a kid very talented master student

112
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,879
 eventually able to get into the london school of economics

113
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,400
 which is an extremely elite university economics university

114
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,280
 in the center of london which is

115
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,840
 basically a kind of investment banking boot camp got a job as a trader

116
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,599
 started working full-time as a short-term interest rates trader at city bank in london

117
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,159
 in june

118
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,159
 2008

119
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,760
 when i was 21 obviously

120
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,080
 yeah exactly that's just before the big credit crash the big leman crisis

121
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,200
 and i watched the leman crisis happen in front of my eyes i was um

122
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,519
 short-term interest rate trading is basically like short-term loans

123
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,040
 and during the credit crisis what credit crisis is is nobody can borrow any money

124
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,439
 so like short-term loans become really really important important

125
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,560
 my desk which was like historically an unfashionable

126
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
 area of trading

127
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,120
 became like the center of the crisis or one of the centers of the crisis

128
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,560
 people started making tons of money

129
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,920
 um i was working with all these crazy

130
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,319
 people

131
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:41,959
 and you can imagine

132
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,360
 me like i turn up

133
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,760
 21 years old and then like within three months

134
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,080
 like everyone around me is making a ton of money during the credit crisis

135
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,560
 but what really interested

136
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
 me

137
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,200
 was what happened after the crisis itself

138
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,400
 which was

139
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,159
 so we're betting on interest rates

140
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,200
 long story short interest rates

141
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,920
 come down when the economy is weak

142
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,879
 and they go up when the economy is strong

143
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,280
 or when the economy is overheating

144
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,239
 from an inflation

145
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 perspective

146
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,319
 in 2018

147
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,040
 all the interest rates go to zero

148
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,959
 so suddenly

149
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,280
 our job is basically predicting and betting on

150
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,200
 when will

151
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,358
 those interest rates go back up which is when will the economy recover

152
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,040
 and this is super interesting right in

153
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 2008

154
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,560
 because all the interest rates went to zero so quickly

155
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,160
 like before

156
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,560
 2008

157
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,280
 it's important to remember

158
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,840
 rates would move

159
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,759
 from like five and a half to five and a quarter

160
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,320
 and then here in 2008

161
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,120
 everywhere in the world slashing to zero bo half a percent exactly and everybody

162
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,080
 all the economists were like wow this is going to cause a massive recovery

163
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,160
 because they thought

164
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,600
 that interest rates were powerful

165
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,960
 and everybody predicted

166
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,080
 that rates would come back up in 2009

167
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,960
 which of course we knowed they didn't

168
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,880
 then everybody predicted that rates would go up in 2010

169
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,080
 which we now know they didn't and then at the beginning of 2011

170
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,720
 everybody was predicting rates would definitely go up this year and this to me

171
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,800
 was so interesting

172
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,000
 so interesting because you know i studied master and economics at one of the

173
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,240
 best economics universities

174
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
 in the world and now i'm working with these

175
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,680
 traders

176
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,600
 who are getting paid millions of pounds a year million pounds a year to predict

177
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,360
 the economy to predict the interest rates

178
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,840
 and everybody

179
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,160
 is wrong

180
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,880
 year after year after year and this

181
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
 was

182
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,560
 i was

183
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,080
 so amazing

184
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,199
 to me for a couple of reasons

185
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,319
 first of all it's like wow

186
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:23,680
 like

187
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
 this is a big

188
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,000
 thing that we as a society should understand and like we're getting it wrong

189
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,039
 but secondly

190
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,000
 if all of the best guys in the world are getting this wrong

191
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,080
 then if i can figure this out

192
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,680
 i can make a ton of money here

193
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,639
 g how much money did you make for city bank at the age of 24 years

194
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,639
 old

195
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,880
 that year so that year 2011

196
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,319
 i put this big bet on that it would get worse forever

197
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,560
 and i was city bank's

198
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,520
 most profitable trader in the world that year

199
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,479
 and i made them just over $ 35

200
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,479
 million

201
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,240
 you made them $35 million you eventually decide to leave city bank yeah why

202
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,160
 i mean i think that's an interesting question right you know

203
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,080
 in the sense that i've just explained to you what happened which is

204
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,960
 i made a ton of money by betting on the collapse of

205
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,160
 western

206
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,400
 society

207
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,440
 i did it in 2011 i did it again in 2012

208
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
 um

209
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,919
 i would prefer

210
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,440
 for it not to collapse step

211
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,039
 and i'm trying to stop it from

212
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,039
 collapsing

213
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,800
 when you say it collapsing what exactly you're referring to that you you don't want to

214
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
 collapse

215
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,720
 so you you born in botswana right yeah do you still have family there

216
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,240
 um i've got family in nigeria

217
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,360
 which is where my my family are from i was born in botswana

218
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,080
 because we were visiting there but

219
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,599
 got family in africa do you go to nigeria much no

220
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,240
 i i've got home in cape town in south africa so i see the

221
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
 it's a great place if you want to see

222
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
 inequality

223
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,240
 i think there

224
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
 is

225
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,440
 a naivity

226
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,960
 in in in this country in places like the us that the kind of inequality

227
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,440
 the kind of broad poverty

228
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,759
 that you see in places like south africa in places like nigeria

229
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,280
 in places like india

230
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,639
 can't happen

231
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,639
 here

232
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,199
 it will happen here

233
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,879
 that is the future

234
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,520
 of this country

235
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,280
 that is the future of the us and i'm not just saying

236
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,960
 that

237
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,000
 i'm betting on it and i've been betting on it for 15

238
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,360
 years

239
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
 and i've been right for 15

240
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,720
 years

241
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,039
 that is what i'm trying to avoid

242
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,160
 daniel where did you come from yeah so i grew up in australia

243
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,680
 um and i was born to low-income

244
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,199
 family i grew up in a place that had 24%

245
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,879
 unemployment

246
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,199
 pretty much the only jobs or opportunities around me were things like

247
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,400
 the trades building construction

248
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,039
 pest control

249
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,599
 um hospitality and tourism

250
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,759
 um so

251
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,599
 at 14 i got a job at mcdonald's

252
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,560
 and then i'm

253
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,840
 got a job in a bar and pizza hut delivery driving and i discover entrepreneurship

254
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,560
 so i discover books about entrepreneurship

255
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,520
 and i discovered that some people make millions similar to yourself

256
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,840
 you saw canary wf i read a book about business ownership

257
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,280
 and as we sit here today can you give me

258
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,319
 the overview of your business success since then

259
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,879
 yeah so i now have a group of companies that i've either started or bought

260
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,039
 um there's i've just sold a company so there's seven companies in the group

261
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:12,560
 um

262
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
 i've started a couple of software

263
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,400
 companies

264
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,080
 one of our companies

265
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,879
 is now the fastest

266
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,199
 growing

267
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,639
 one of the fastest growing companies in the uk

268
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,720
 um we you know we're a software business

269
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,240
 i've got a couple of agencies i've got a education and training business

270
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,960
 and where when you think about the uk and broadly the western world today

271
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,919
 what is your assessment of where we're at as a country and what's concerning you because

272
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,399
 gary expressed quite articulately

273
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,919
 that his big concern is that because of wealth ine equality

274
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,919
 we're going to end up in a similar position to the likes of india

275
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,720
 what are you concerned about i agree that it wasn't that long ago that we had

276
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,600
 real serious wealth inequality in this country there are amazing photos from

277
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,920
 like a 100 years ago of kids working in mines

278
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,519
 and kids

279
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,640
 doing oyster shocking

280
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,959
 and all this horrible

281
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:56,680
 work and

282
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,640
 um you know

283
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,320
 there's a there's a book charles dickens wrot wrote called the tale of two cities

284
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,920
 and the opening

285
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,680
 line of the book

286
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,480
 is it was the best of times it was the worst of times

287
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,360
 and i think we've actually gotten to that point here where some people in the uk

288
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,680
 it's the best of times

289
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,600
 if you

290
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,680
 like in your situation you're you know you're booming you're a globally successful business

291
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,200
 um i've got a globally successful business and then there are a lot of people who

292
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,640
 completely

293
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,600
 cannot relate to this their you know

294
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,040
 energy

295
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,519
 prices are now the most expensive in the western world

296
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,240
 house prices are completely unaffordable

297
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,200
 it used to be

298
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,519
 used to take 3 years to

299
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,240
 for a deposit it's now 20 years if you you know theoretically

300
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
 20 years if you can save for a deposit

301
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,920
 food prices are through the roof

302
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,920
 so we're we're in a really diff like for anyone who

303
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,040
 is not tapped into digital economy fast growth and all of that sort of stuff

304
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,519
 life is getting harder and worse

305
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,079
 um and things are collapsing

306
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,600
 um if you if you would

307
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
 um go with that

308
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,240
 the

309
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,279
 there is a predictable

310
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,079
 path countries

311
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:53,680
 go on

312
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,040
 and there's this thing called the economic freedom index

313
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,680
 and the economic freedom index basically

314
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,760
 says how economically

315
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,040
 free are you how how much access do you have to free markets

316
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,000
 um do can you start a business can you scale a business

317
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,600
 um does anything inhibit your ability to run your own life

318
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,120
 countries that have high degrees of economic freedom have very low poverty they have widespread affluence

319
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,839
 and countries that have low economic freedoms

320
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,360
 have high poverty and it can be the difference between less than 10%

321
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,680
 right up to 70%

322
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,160
 poverty rates

323
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,680
 um and when countries go on a path towards economic freedom

324
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,040
 poverty

325
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,560
 just drops

326
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,120
 so india for examp example has been on that path and they announced

327
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,279
 today that they've almost

328
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,480
 eradicated

329
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,839
 abject poverty or extreme poverty

330
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,000
 um the uk went on that path of

331
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,880
 low economic freedom to high economic freedom and we saw

332
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,839
 poverty rates come right down

333
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,519
 but in 2008 when the global financial crisis happened

334
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,800
 one of the things that happened is the government said we need to step in

335
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,839
 and we need to take charge and everyone said please do

336
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:53,160
 um so

337
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,399
 they

338
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,000
 came in and they said all right we're going to ramp

339
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,440
 up debt

340
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,720
 ramp

341
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,959
 up taxes

342
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,639
 to pay for the debt and we're also going to put it all regul

343
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,959
 in and unfortunately

344
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,240
 that starts to reduce economic freedom

345
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,079
 then the pandemic happens

346
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,800
 and they say oh we're going to spend

347
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,120
 more money again through debt we're going to have more

348
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,040
 taxes more regulations

349
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,360
 less economic freedom so the uk

350
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,760
 we went from an 82

351
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,360
 when i arrived in 2006

352
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,000
 went from 82 out of 100

353
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,639
 down to 68 out of 100 so we're less economically

354
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,600
 free

355
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,760
 and predictably

356
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,480
 what we will always see happen if you lower people's economic freedom

357
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,120
 more poverty

358
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:37,160
 less affluence the millionaires and the wealth creators leave the people who are stuck in

359
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,120
 um dead end jobs

360
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
 or no jobs get incredibly frustrated

361
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,399
 everyone starts looking for someone to blame people are angry

362
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,320
 and they're like who do we blame

363
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,120
 and who do they blame

364
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,800
 it's very different because in the us we blame us blam someone different to the uk

365
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,440
 so

366
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,360
 we have a historical

367
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
 cultural memory

368
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,320
 in the uk we have a cultural memory

369
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,040
 that the people to blame are the rich

370
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,839
 so so

371
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,000
 we have landlords

372
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,680
 and aristocracy

373
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,720
 and the landed gentry

374
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,880
 those guys are to blame

375
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,720
 right so blame the rich is what we say in the uk

376
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,920
 in the us

377
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,519
 they have a very different view their cultural memory is that they're anti-government

378
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,519
 they want limited government

379
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,440
 in 2023

380
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,720
 there was this song that came out called rich men north of richmond

381
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,079
 and it was the number one song in america

382
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,519
 and the lyrics of the song basically says

383
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,560
 people in washington do not care about working people

384
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,839
 um they att taxing everything we touch you can't earn money they depreciate the dollar

385
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,800
 um they tax tax tax tax tax

386
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,680
 and they want to control

387
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,560
 our lives those are the lyrics of the songs

388
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,000
 controlling

389
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,880
 our lives and taxing us

390
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,079
 so the american

391
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,600
 reaction to this is who's to blame government

392
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,199
 so we want smaller government we want a department of government efficiency

393
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,399
 to come in we want

394
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,360
 someone as a wrecking ball who will come in and smash government

395
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,040
 the british instinct

396
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,800
 is

397
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,880
 hate the rich

398
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,600
 it must be the rich's fault so when we look for

399
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,800
 like all all of the western countries that implemented lower economic

400
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
 freedoms

401
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,000
 created more poverty less affluence and more disruption to their economies

402
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,760
 so both us and uk for example and australia as well but both

403
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
 sides of the pond

404
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,160
 want someone to blame it's just that the americans blame government and we blame the rich

405
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,000
 gary i'm sure you you have a lot to

406
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,199
 to say there i know you both use the word collapsing

407
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:27,199
 so you agree

408
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:28,199
 that there's a problem

409
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:28,639
 here

410
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,240
 but i think

411
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,040
 you from studying

412
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
 both of your sort of

413
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
 perspectives

414
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,959
 you think that

415
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,199
 this the solution and the cause of the problem is different

416
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,920
 i mean i put bets on i put bets on

417
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,000
 i put bet that's what i do i put bets on

418
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 um

419
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,079
 at the beginning of covid

420
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:47,720
 we knew the government was going to give enormous amount of money out

421
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,160
 um

422
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,079
 total amount of money now uk government deficit since the beginning of co is is1 trillion

423
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,079
 pounds

424
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:54,920
 us number is $4

425
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,959
 trillion that's you know £20,000 per uk adult

426
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,959
 my background is i understand that when

427
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,839
 the distribution gets worse when inequality gets worse living standards full

428
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,079
 so when

429
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:08,880
 when the uk government

430
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,800
 was going to give a trillion

431
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,399
 pounds out

432
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,160
 all i wanted to know was

433
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,800
 who's going to end up with that money

434
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,199
 that's all i wanted to know

435
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,560
 and um i mean the us number 13 trillion 14

436
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
 trillion

437
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,600
 is just outlandish but i think the most amazing thing i've ever seen in my whole

438
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 life

439
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,440
 was that at the beginning of co the very beginning of co we knew

440
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,519
 governments across the world we're going to be giving out tens of trillions of pounds dollars

441
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,519
 euros

442
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,360
 nobody even thought to ask

443
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,880
 who's going to get tens of trillions richer nobody in the conservatives

444
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,000
 nobody in labor nobody in the republicans

445
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,120
 nobody in democrats nobody in the media nobody in academia

446
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
 nobody the central banks nobody asked this it's

447
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
 it's

448
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,120
 it's it's almost beautiful it's it's unbelievable

449
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,759
 it's unbeliev

450
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,399
 so i i sat down and i did i did the analysis at the

451
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,399
 beginning

452
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,560
 because lockdown is essentially banning the spending of the rich

453
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,639
 and replacing that spending of the rich with printed money from government

454
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,279
 what happens is the government

455
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,519
 gives workers money

456
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,320
 they use that money to pay their bills to pay their rent pay their mortgage

457
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,800
 it goes to the rich the rich can't spend it because they're locked indoors

458
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,360
 and what you get is essentially

459
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,120
 an enormous amount of money from the government

460
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,480
 to the poor to the rich

461
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,079
 and this

462
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:18,480
 massive

463
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,160
 massive transfer

464
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,759
 of wealth

465
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,639
 um

466
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,279
 that was obviously going that was so obviously going to happen at the beginning of co

467
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,279
 nobody discussed it which i think is itself

468
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,279
 amazing

469
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,240
 let me ask you a question right if we were now

470
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,399
 to pause the economy for 2 years

471
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,040
 and during that pause

472
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,399
 massively increase wealth inequality

473
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,600
 what do you think would happen to broad living conditions when we

474
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
 unpaused

475
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,560
 see one of the things that i think happened during the pandemic

476
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,160
 is everything went digital

477
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,720
 and

478
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,079
 um entrepreneurs and investors did actually think about what would happen the investors immediately

479
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,720
 boomed stocks like zoom and microsoft

480
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,519
 and we ended up with the magnificent 7

481
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,480
 um i don't know if you you know there's seven big tech companies in the usa

482
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
 market

483
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,279
 and those big seven companies have gone from five trillion valuation to 17 tr trillion valuation

484
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,639
 in the time of the pandemic and if you think about what did the pandemic do

485
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,160
 everyone had to work from home so we all had to have microsoft subscriptions

486
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,480
 everyone went onto website so we all went to aws

487
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,920
 amazon we all started buying

488
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,440
 and learning how to buy from amazon rather than buying from from our local high streets

489
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,079
 every business in the world figured out how to run their business remotely

490
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,040
 we had this massive transformation

491
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,560
 it wasn't it was like it's actually a wholesale transformation of society

492
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,040
 that we all learned how to live and work differently

493
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,120
 um i saw a boom in entrepreneurship so what i saw as an entrepreneur accelerator

494
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,480
 um someone who runs an entrepreneur accelerator

495
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,920
 is just there was this sudden boom in people launching businesses

496
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,279

497
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,279
 businesses

498
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:04,240
 so the money really has moved from the traditional economy the 2019

499
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,720
 high street economy

500
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,480
 over to the digital economy

501
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,319
 and what we see

502
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,640
 is that the investors know what's going on and they just invest in this magnificent

503
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,720
 seven company i think

504
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,240
 50%

505
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,880
 of the gains of the s&p 500

506
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,160
 is tech companies

507
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,599
 um so all the money just goes flooding into the the technology companies

508
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,400
 my my belief is that technolog is really dividing people

509
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,640
 that essentially if you take anyone from any background

510
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,520
 if they work in technology

511
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,760
 if they're in media tech finance any of that stuff that operates online

512
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,400
 they tend to actually do pretty

513
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,120
 pretty well after the pandemic i ask you a question yeah go for

514
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,240
 do you think the average

515
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,960
 brit american australian

516
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,280
 whoever

517
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
 the person out there is watching if they quit their job

518
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,520
 and go work in tech

519
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,080
 do you think they'll be able to get financial security relatively

520
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
 easily

521
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,200
 depends when you defi define financial security the issue with house prices

522
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,840
 the ability

523
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,320
 to raise a family have a home yeah so having a home is a big issue

524
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,640
 right so

525
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,039
 here's here's what i here's what i see with houses

526
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,159
 cuz houses annoy me as well my dad bought a house for

527
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,159
 $188,000

528
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,600
 which is about £10,000 or less than £10,000 and it's probably worth over a million dollars

529
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,840
 um today so something went wrong and and this by the way is not uk specific

530
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,440
 the socialist

531
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,919
 countries

532
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,559
 had house prices go through the roof

533
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,520
 if you go to norway or sweden their house prices grew by

534
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,640
 600%

535
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,919
 in then it's happening everywhere

536
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,559
 it's not specific to anywhere it's happening everywhere but but what happened

537
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,960
 what what has definitely

538
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,679
 in the uk

539
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,720
 is we actually have

540
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,960
 um a housing traffic jam

541
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
 so

542
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,880
 in this country in the uk

543
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,480
 we have 9.5

544
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,600
 million homes that have two or more spare bedrooms

545
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,840
 big family homes

546
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,919
 have two or more spare bedrooms and when you look into who owns those houses

547
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:45,600
 78%

548
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,679
 of housing wealth is baby boomers

549
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,280
 um and now anecdotally

550
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,240
 i take my kids trick-or-treating at halloween

551
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,799
 and we go down a street that is big family homes

552
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,200
 and you go knock on the doors and it's all people over 65

553
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,039
 right and

554
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,520
 living in a big family home with empty spare bedrooms

555
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,280
 we you think the average american over 65 is living

556
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
 luxuriously

557
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
 the average american over 65

558
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,520
 so more than half of the us economy is in the hands of baby boomers

559
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,559
 right so they own all the houses

560
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,720
 the the houses got bought up cheap

561
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,520
 baby boomers

562
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,039
 still own those houses to this day the big family homes with multiple spare bedrooms

563
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,480
 are empty

564
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,240
 um and now that creates this traffic jam

565
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,159
 people my age my grandparents

566
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,720
 yeah they all owned property

567
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,679
 all four of them died with nothing

568
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,080
 um because

569
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,039
 that wealth which they had in in property was

570
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,440
 was used in equity release schemes

571
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,080
 they they it was used in paying through their retirement

572
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,720
 it was used in end of life care

573
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,440
 um do you think when those old people die young people today will be rich

574
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,400
 there is half the economy held by baby burus

575
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,640
 it's either going to be

576
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,200
 passed down or passed into the age care industry or passed into

577
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,600
 the but the issue of why we can't get homes two things

578
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,240
 government

579
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,799
 massively

580
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,080
 inflated the value of homes through debt so they just in injected

581
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,400
 like low interest rates that you involved in who who is the debt to

582
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,360
 well the debt is to anyone who can take out al loan because if a 0%

583
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,400
 interest rates or 2%

584
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,799
 interest r you think it's the debt is the ordinary

585
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,120
 families

586
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,679
 do you think ordinary families are the creditors

587
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,120
 when you say ordinary families you mean

588
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,559
 bottom third so if your average

589
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,559
 british or american

590
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,159
 family

591
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,679
 now has half a million pounds of debt

592
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,320
 crit it's anyone who could get their at that particular

593
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,760
 time

594
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,559
 anyone who could get their hands on a loan

595
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,760
 to buy a house

596
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,799
 but who has the credit

597
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,440
 who has who is on the other side of the debt

598
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,320
 so if the average british family

599
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,120
 million p banking license does the average british family have half million pound of credit

600
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,760
 well a lot of people have got a lot of equity

601
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,840
 in their home now you think the average

602
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,120
 british

603
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,360
 family

604
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,240
 is sitting on half a million

605
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,480
 pound

606
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:47,960
 cash

607
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,440
 i'd love to look at the what the actual

608
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,760
 number

609
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,720
 is but it's a couple

610
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,320
 hundred thousand

611
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,080
 worth of equity

612
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,640
 78

613
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,120
 what about the credit on the line credit on the line

614
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,400
 owns the credit on the line in mind it's disproportionately

615
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,159
 older people so

616
00:20:59,159 --> 00:20:59,799
 think the average

617
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,120
 british

618
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,320
 old person is sitting on million

619
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,640
 millions

620
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,400
 of pounds of cash

621
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,880
 not millions

622
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,480
 of cash

623
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:03,840
 no

624
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,200
 equity

625
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,679
 well someone is on the other side of

626
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,520
 just one say the difference

627
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,760
 the difference is if you inflate

628
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,720
 the value of a house

629
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
 you don't have cash you have a

630
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,919
 house that's worth a lot of money

631
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,880
 so 78%

632
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,799
 of home ownership

633
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,919
 wealth is in the hands of people over 65

634
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,960
 now it's baby boomer generation

635
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,480
 and they got a great gift from the government

636
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,039
 which is the government said we're going to just give free loans away

637
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:27,880
 if someone previously could have only afforded to take out a 200 grand loan

638
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,000
 with low interest rates they can afford a 300 grand l do you think it's okay

639
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 that the average

640
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,360
 british

641
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,919
 or american

642
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,559
 young person

643
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,159
 will never

644
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:35,480
 own

645
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,039
 any wealth

646
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,000
 the issue is not whether it's okay or not

647
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,520
 the issue is what do you do about it i do you own wealth

648
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,120
 i've got wealth yeah you own wealth

649
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,080
 but depends what you call wealth i do so do we three multimillionaires

650
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,880
 do

651
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,919
 we think it's okay

652
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,559
 that the average

653
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,360
 brit or american

654
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,880
 young person will never own any wealth

655
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,200
 that to me that's because i don't think that's okay to me that's not the debate

656
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,960
 is it okay it's not well it it's not okay no we want widespread

657
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,120
 would you rather that the people who currently are multi-millionaires

658
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,760
 would you rather that all of the world was owned by their kids

659
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,240
 i think that the way you see the world as a trader

660
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,440
 is that the world is a zero sum game

661
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,520
 and that there's

662
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,039
 basically

663
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,880
 the pi is a fixed pi and it gets sliced

664
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,320
 up

665
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,840
 how fast is the growing now there's something like this

666
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,760
 what's uk gdp growth at the moment yeah it's not it's not high right 1%

667
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
 how much did your wealth grow in the last year

668
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,640
 exponentially

669
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,679
 okay so if our weals

670
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,960
 my wealth probably grew about 20%

671
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,039
 in the last year maybe 30 okay okay

672
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,039
 if our worlds are growing 30%

673
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,360
 and the economy is growing at 1%

674
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,799
 where is it coming from if it's not coming from our viewers

675
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,880
 so i'll tell you where my wealth comes from

676
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,400
 my wealth comes from building technology companies

677
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,960
 and the way it works is pretty weird

678
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,880
 which is that

679
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,440
 i invent something out of my head

680
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
 and i go to investors

681
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,520
 and i say to the investors

682
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,400
 here's what we're going to create and i give them a spreadsheet

683
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,320
 and then they say we'll give you a couple hundred grand to get started

684
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,480
 which is called seed

685
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,200
 capital

686
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,360
 but on paper makes me worth a couple of million

687
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,520
 right but there there's nothing has been taken from anyone at this point

688
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,640
 the investors have said okay we'll invest some money then as the business succeeds

689
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,400
 some more investors

690
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,960
 come along and they say we'll give you a little bit more money to keep growing

691
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,799
 it

692
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,640
 um and i'm innovating something new

693
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,840
 and let's say investors come in and give me a million pounds

694
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,640
 and for 10% of the company

695
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,559
 and the rest of the company's worth 9 million

696
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,640
 or $9 million

697
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,200
 right

698
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,520
 so i'm not stealing

699
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,360
 something from the existing economy i'm bringing something from outside of the economy

700
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,960
 into the economy

701
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,480
 um and my quote unquote net worth is growing exponentially

702
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,200
 because investors

703
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,840
 say

704
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,120
 we'll give you a little bit of money that values the rest of the pie

705
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,760
 at a lot of money

706
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,240
 but there's everyone's getting richer

707
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,080
 in the in the wealth create

708
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,840
 there's where there's wealth extraction

709
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,279
 which is what traders do they extract from the existing economy

710
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,440
 um and they bet on

711
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,880
 the economy and then there's wealth creation which what entrepreneurs

712
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
 do they come up with new ideas

713
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,919
 better ways of doing things

714
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,279
 and they build wealth so do you think the reason

715
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,080
 our viewers

716
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,960
 the average brit american are getting poorer is because they

717
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,840
 don't know how to create wealth

718
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,000
 no the reason people are getting poorer is because economic freedoms are being eroded

719
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,679
 when we have high economic that with taxes

720
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
 well anything that imp it could be anything that impacts economic freedom so

721
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,919
 taxes and regulations are big was economic freedom higher in the 50s

722
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:27,880
 50s was okay so 50s was a

723
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,520
 interesting time

724
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,320
 we we were in food russians in this country till

725
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,960
 1956 so we had 10 years of food rations after the war

726
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,159
 um we had a labor shortage

727
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,559
 because only really men worked women hadn't entered the workforce in mass

728
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,000
 um there had been three or 400,000

729
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,640
 men

730
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
 killed in war

731
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,039
 so we actually had this big labor shortage the whole country needed to rebuild

732
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,640
 because of the blitz had bombed it so we had this huge need for economic

733
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,320
 activity

734
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,679
 and not enough people to do it we only had 2%

735
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:57,480
 unemployment

736
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,880
 people who had had their blown off were put to work at that particular time

737
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,840
 so we had this boom this postwar

738
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,559
 boom and we also had the postwar baby boom which drove

739
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,679
 consumption

740
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,120
 and then when we got to the 60s we had the roaring 60s or the

741
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,399
 um the swinging 60s right pretty amazing time in britain and along comes high taxes

742
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:21,159
 and they put up the taxes massively at the end of the 60s

743
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:22,679
 um and it pretty much crashed the economy

744
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,559
 one of the things that happened so what were the tax rates in the 50s

745
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,360
 well they went up as high as 80 to 90%

746
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,120
 for the top for the top ear i think it was in the 60s

747
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,440
 you sure about that i think the 50s are unique what is the answer

748
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,120
 feel like you they went up off the wall

749
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,799
 they went up after the war well in the us actually

750
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,360
 tax rates

751
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,760
 started

752
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,279
 got before the war

753
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:44,120
 but also the size of government as a percentage of gdp was like 30%

754
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,799
 it was a tiny like we're we're now 45%

755
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,960
 of the uk economy is government spending

756
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,640
 we have got a mass who funds that spending

757
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,640
 debt they the bank of england allows them to print endless amounts of debt which deflates

758
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,720
 gary i want to get your opinion

759
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,120
 here

760
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,399
 cuz you're asking a lot of questions

761
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,159
 but i actually don't know your opinion

762
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,760
 i just want to know what daniel thinks

763
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,840
 and i want our viewers to be able to research daniel's

764
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
 opinions

765
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,919
 but how how do you disagree with those opinions

766
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:10,480
 listen

767
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,159
 daniel's a businessman he's obviously a very successful businessman

768
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:14,440
 you know i i've not been any

769
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,279
 i'm not a businessman i'm not going to pretend to be a businessman i'm an economist

770
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,240
 i make money by being right on the economy

771
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,480
 daniel's a good businessman

772
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,559
 and i'm right on the economy

773
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,080
 you know it's a simple as that basically

774
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,760
 you know i'm not a good businessman

775
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,039
 but i've got 15 years of being right on this on the economy

776
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,640
 and look and i know

777
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,520
 you're probably a wealthy

778
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,919
 man

779
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:30,880
 you probably don't want

780
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,799
 to pay high taxes

781
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,840
 you probably don't want your kids to pay high taxes

782
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,600
 but we exist in an economy

783
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,399
 where wealth

784
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:37,480
 is being extracted

785
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,880
 out of the middle class out of the working class very very rapidly

786
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
 it's benefiting people like the three of us at this table

787
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
 it will benefit our kids

788
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,840
 you know our kids will be rich their kids will be poor

789
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,679
 and i just think we should be honest with them capitalism's finished we won

790
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,640
 well done stephen

791
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
 well done daniel well done gary

792
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,679
 it's over now our kids will be rich their kids will be poor

793
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,960
 they'll pay the tax taxes we won't pay the taxes

794
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,360
 we'll avoid it i'll make money betting on it year after year

795
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,120
 why are we lying to them why are we lying to them

796
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,799
 yeah i i think that's an overly simplified

797
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,679
 view of things i don't

798
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,399
 an overly simplified

799
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:12,120
 view of things that has made me a multimillionaire

800
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,080
 yeah well look entrepreneurs take bets on the economy as well we take bets differently

801
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,320
 um when we start a company we're betting on how the econ the average

802
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,559
 british and american worker at the 50th percentile

803
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,960
 do you think their kids will be richer than they are

804
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,760
 it depends if we have economic freedom

805
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,399
 or not

806
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,600
 right we're going to have a split test on this

807
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,960
 right we're going to have a split test we're going to have

808
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,039
 the uk seems like we're going to have more taxes more regulations

809
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,919
 and it seems like the us is going to have less taxes and less regulations

810
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,399
 here's what i've noticed i've noticed that places like singapore that have small governments

811
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:48,880
 um have got widespread affluence there's not a lot of poverty in singapore

812
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,440
 yeah except for the cleaners living in the closets yeah you know

813
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,679
 look but we don't count them in the statistics just like we don't count our viewers

814
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,080
 that that's not widespread in well there's a lot of people w

815
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,480
 i've seen them in the closets

816
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,279
 i've seen them in the closets there are there are some but they're not singaporeans

817
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,880
 well also you only count the rich ones

818
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,200
 look the the also the issue is is that they've come from

819
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,240
 even worse conditions in many cases people mve to singapore for an increase in lifestyle

820
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,600
 right the

821
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
 um

822
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,760
 you could take ireland or switzerland

823
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,039
 right economically free places ireland was economically in a disaster

824
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,559
 in think the average irish person lives well

825
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,760
 well the their

826
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
 economy

827
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,159
 their economy almost collapsed in 2011

828
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,120
 and they went down the road of lower taxes lower regulations and they attracted

829
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,080
 all sorts of businesses

830
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,200
 into the economy

831
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,000
 and do you think that works well for the average irishman

832
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,799
 who doesn't own a home in dublin

833
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,679
 the the if you measure everything by home ownership

834
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,480
 i'm measuring people by the average

835
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,399
 i want to know what the average man or woman

836
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,960
 today lives that by the way i i'm also furious

837
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,799
 about the home ownership

838
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:56,960
 thing everyone is

839
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,760
 um i think it's utterly ridiculous

840
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,919
 the way like the idea that homes are now worth 10 times the average wage

841
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,679
 all of that difference is i blame government for that

842
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,159
 i blame high taxes

843
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:10,000
 where they've

844
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,480
 because of high taxes they can take out more debt

845
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,039
 they can then inflate the economy do you think if we shrink the government

846
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,840
 if we start to slash government spending

847
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,159
 do you think that would improve living conditions well the uk government is 45%

848
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,080
 of the economy

849
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
 like that's a huge government it's

850
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,159
 think using

851
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:26,279
 additions will increase

852
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,440
 in the next few years

853
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,600
 because we have us government now that's planning to slash

854
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,399
 the us government

855
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:33,919
 well that's what the us voters have asked for do you think it would improve

856
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:34,279
 living

857
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,880
 conditions

858
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,039
 do i think it'll improve

859
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,080
 the average american if they're smaller government

860
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,600
 yeah i trust market so you think

861
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
 the average us american

862
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,519
 will be rich in years than the here what i trust

863
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,000
 i trust

864
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,399
 economic

865
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:45,880
 freedom

866
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,000
 if people have freedom

867
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 they create

868
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,279
 better decisions for their own life there's two ways to make decisions

869
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,399
 right there's two ways you have freedom

870
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,240
 i got less freedom

871
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,240
 than i did when i ared

872
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,600
 just

873
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,960
 because my sister can't pay the rent

874
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,039
 is that freedom

875
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,080
 the

876
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,159
 if you're living in a country

877
00:29:59,159 --> 00:29:59,640
 she can't

878
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,279
 to live in the city that she was

879
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:01,600
 born

880
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,039
 in

881
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,279
 i i agree

882
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,080
 you and i agree on the problem you keep bringing

883
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
 back to the problem

884
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,120
 i keep bringing it back to people because the people who watch we're millionaires

885
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,279
 okay the people who watch us are mostly not

886
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,279
 millionaires

887
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:16,240
 is life going to get better for them they life will get better

888
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,960
 if you are connected to the most productive parts of the economy

889
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,480
 um if you pretend that it's 1955

890
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,559
 and you recreate the postwar era conditions if you try to go back to 1955

891
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,080
 i don't think

892
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,720
 that's going to work

893
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,960
 so so let me ask on that then

894
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,279
 the point

895
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:30,600
 about

896
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,240
 if you're connected

897
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,919
 to the most productive

898
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:32,679
 parts of the economy

899
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,399
 i was quite

900
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,360
 um

901
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,960
 quite surprised

902
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,880
 when i was doing some research on this to find that there's quite big differences

903
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 between the uk and the us in terms of gdp

904
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,799
 growth

905
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,360
 in q4 2024 the us economy grew by 6% while the uk growth was 0.1%

906
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,159
 so they're doing significantly better in that regard us gdp per head stands at $82,000

907
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,039
 per head whereas the uk stands at $49,000

908
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,480
 per head and stock market performance

909
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,120
 which is an

910
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,440
 indication of i guess what ever

911
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,919
 rose by 300%

912
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,799
 in the us whereas the footsy

913
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:07,240
 100 declined by 20% which is the uk stock market productivity growth since 2018

914
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,880
 productivity increased by 30%

915
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
 in the united states which has outpaced

916
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,880
 the the uk and lastly income growth since 2007

917
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,159
 american income per head has increased by 72%

918
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:20,840
 while it has decreased

919
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,639
 in by 2%

920
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,440
 in the uk in dollar terms

921
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,240
 so they seem to be doing better from if you just look at the economy

922
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,200
 um

923
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,200
 why is that is that because they lean more into technology and innovation and entrepreneurship

924
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,720
 and is it because of the things you were saying earlier about their attitude towards

925
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,159
 the govern like reduced government spending versus tax the rich why

926
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,200
 i'm keen to hear gary's

927
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,039
 view on this because i

928
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,760
 understand yours because you've just said it

929
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,320
 yeah i think these are great statistics

930
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,519
 um and of course the us has a strong reput

931
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,240
 reputation

932
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,080
 for being very free markets and being very small states

933
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,639
 in the last 5 years 10 years 15 years

934
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:02,080
 we've had a uk government that has been aggressively slashing the state

935
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,639
 and the us state's bigger than ever it's 45%

936
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:07,480
 of the economy and the us we had

937
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,880
 a government in the last four years which has been running a massive massive deficit

938
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,080
 so in that period of time

939
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:21,080
 it appears the government which has been aggressively increasing its deficit has massively overperformed

940
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,960
 the government which has been aggressively slashing the

941
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
 state

942
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,559
 that's what it looks to be from the last

943
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,919
 i mean b joe biden in enormously increased the deficit enormously

944
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,360
 and the conservatives were austerity government for 14 years

945
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,320
 which one seems to have given the better numbers

946
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,519
 well i mean there were austerity in name only they went from 30%

947
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,120
 the state was 30% of gdp to 45% of government services haveed

948
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,919
 now they're the government is terrible at doing most things that's the problem

949
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:52,200
 you you you don't want you don't think that spending on

950
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,279
 government service has been slashed

951
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,440
 let me let me zoom out a little you think the police spending has been slashed

952
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,120
 oh police spending

953
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,840
 is definitely

954
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,919
 do you know where it ends up it ends up with like big corporates

955
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:04,519
 big consulting

956
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,559
 who get paid $50 million to produce a report to tell government some thing

957
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,919
 right all of these big i won't name names but all the big consulting firms

958
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:15,720
 they're all blood suckers to government they

959
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,279
 they know that the money is in the government

960
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:22,240
 and they set up business models to extract that money from government

961
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,720
 and it also is in the financial trading side of things

962
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,279
 the one of the issues that we've got

963
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,960
 right and this is a big big issue as well cuz you care about wealth

964
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,519
 inequality

965
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,279
 one of the biggest issues i see

966
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,360
 is that during the pandemic we all learned to work remotely

967
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,080
 and remotor

968
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,679
 became

969
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:38,880
 the norm and what i see at the moment is

970
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,440
 huge amounts of what would have been normal british jobs

971
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,720
 are going to the philippines

972
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,360
 going to india going to

973
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,240
 vietnam

974
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,559
 people who work remotely now

975
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:52,880
 we now have a thousand millionaires a month leaving to go to dubai we have 120,000

976
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,480
 british people living in dubai

977
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,000
 in in that economy the world's become incredibly mobile

978
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,480
 and one of the things that's happening

979
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,760
 is that what would have previously been good british jobs

980
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,599
 are getting moved overseas to lower cost countries

981
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,639
 and that's technology

982
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,879
 that drives that wedge

983
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,800
 the us is very smart in that they've built a technology

984
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,599
 powerhouse

985
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,359
 and the uk has completely lost our technology industry

986
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,159
 our tech industry is in decline same same across europe

987
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,800
 china

988
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,000
 and the us

989
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,679
 know that the game is tech

990
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,359
 and they've basically pulling all the tech company

991
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,079
 into the into their

992
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,079
 borders

993
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,480
 and what's happening a lot is the erosion

994
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,839
 of good jobs and the erosion of of just normal

995
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,599
 well-paying

996
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,000
 jobs because they they're going

997
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,399
 and it's a bit of a self-fulfilling loop that the more we lose millionaires

998
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,560
 the tax burden falls on everyone else so they put the taxes up

999
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,480
 and then the millionaires

1000
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,960
 say oh the taxes are too high so they leave

1001
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,079
 um i've watched some of the most incredible entrepreneurs

1002
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,719
 that you would want here that would employ your sister at a high rate

1003
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,839
 um and they've

1004
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:00,400
 picked up and left cuz the taxes are too high so you saying we should tax

1005
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,119
 working people less

1006
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:06,480
 well the the the overall government has to be smaller

1007
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,800
 you can't whoever what do you want to cut in the government if you

1008
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,280
 yeah i mean you'd have to child services we'd have to no police no education

1009
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,240
 nhs

1010
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,079
 all i know is this pensions

1011
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,000
 you go to switzerland they sp single mothers 25%

1012
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 disabled benefits

1013
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,520
 what do you want to cut hold up all i know is in switzerland

1014
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
 i tell you what i want

1015
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,560
 the government is

1016
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,280
 ta

1017
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,560
 on those entrepreneurs

1018
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,040
 and raise the taxes on the billionaires

1019
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,800
 because i worked my tits off how many billionaires are in the uk

1020
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,960
 there's a lot of billionaires in the uk 150

1021
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,320
 yeah so tax them more what do they pay listen i went my tits off

1022
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,760
 and i paid it was 50%

1023
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,160
 top rate tax 50%

1024
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,240
 top rate tax plus national insurance 60%

1025
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,680
 million to bring my family out of poverty

1026
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,119
 at the same time the duke of westminster inherited 10 billion

1027
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,119
 and paid nothing do you think that's fair that's not true

1028
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,839
 okay why is it not true because the duke of westminster

1029
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,720
 is one of the highest tax payers in the country what does he pay

1030
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,359
 well on the trust the groer estate

1031
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:07,560
 they don't pay inheritance tax because trusts can't die they pay something called periodic taxes

1032
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,720
 which how much 6% every 10 years 6% so they pay 0.6%

1033
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,520
 so i paid 16% and this guy pays 0.6%

1034
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,040
 apples with apples inheritance tax is 40% across the course of your life

1035
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,000
 if a trust is

1036
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,160
 if a person lives who owns a trust for 70 years

1037
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,240
 then 6% time 7 would be 42 so they actually pay more so he pays 0.6%

1038
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,359
 a year

1039
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,000
 pro 0.6%

1040
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,880
 that would be the same as

1041
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,040
 what percent did i pay per

1042
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,680
 no no no but that's 60%

1043
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,760
 so you're saying i pay what 60 of a 0.6

1044
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,760
 what 100 times the tax not comparing apples with apples

1045
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,319
 wait why is it not apples with apples this guy pays 0.6%

1046
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:49,400
 a year i paid 60% a year that's inheritance tax i paid that 60%

1047
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,800
 every year daniel every year i paid you're pay income tax so why have i du

1048
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,720
 p more than the duke of westminster pays income tax he probably

1049
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,079
 he probably makes your bill blush

1050
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,599
 yeah think can pay his income tax

1051
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,720
 yeah well if he's going to live he has to withdraw money to have his income

1052
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,480
 he also

1053
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,960
 let me give you a list of all the taxes

1054
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,640
 he would pay

1055
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,400
 he'd pay income

1056
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,720
 tax

1057
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,160
 corporate

1058
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,640
 tax he'd pay stamp duty when he buys a building

1059
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,359
 he pays

1060
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,920
 any of the other taxes vat when he spends money

1061
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,839
 all the same taxes

1062
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:18,680
 apply to a duuk

1063
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,680
 as they apply to anybody

1064
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,000
 else

1065
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,440
 so you think he pays income tax on on the income on that

1066
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
 any income he draws

1067
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,200
 okay well our viewers can research whether he pays income tax on his income

1068
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,640
 because i don't think he does

1069
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,680
 it's in a trust but the only difference with the trust

1070
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,119
 versus income

1071
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,000
 is that the trust pays periodic tax versus inheritance tax 0.6%

1072
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,040
 but we're only talking inherit that that's just one type of tax

1073
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,200
 you think he's paying 60%

1074
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
 on his income

1075
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,319
 he's one of the highest taxpayers

1076
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:46,839
 in the uk i'm not like his big fan

1077
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:47,480
 club but

1078
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,079
 the truth is he's one of the highest taxpayers

1079
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:49,960
 in the uk

1080
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,200
 um he's one of the biggest employers

1081
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,760
 in the uk

1082
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,400
 he's one of the

1083
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,680
 like

1084
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,560
 one of the biggest land owners

1085
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,240
 in the uk land owners

1086
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,920
 in the uk

1087
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,800
 right

1088
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,079
 so

1089
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,040
 the the issue is is does he pay tax

1090
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,720
 all the same taxes that apply to you apply to him

1091
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,079
 and if you want to set up a trust you can also pay periodic

1092
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,240
 taxes as well

1093
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,440
 um which would be on top of all the other taxes so what would you say

1094
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,240
 but it's just not true that he doesn't pay tax

1095
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,520
 no what would you say this guy has inherit 1010 million

1096
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
 p

1097
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,319
 so he's worth 10 billion ps

1098
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:17,440
 what would you say will be the total

1099
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:17,680
 amount

1100
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,079
 of tax

1101
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,359
 he will pay in his lifetime

1102
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,520
 well i know that just the smallest

1103
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,280
 if i make 10 million i pay 60% just one sec

1104
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,920
 you're not you're talking about income versus the transfer of

1105
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,000
 an estate so why why is it that the

1106
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,839
 be 10 million p just you're comparing your income

1107
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:37,200
 yeah versus the amount he inherited

1108
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,880
 which is not a fair thing that's not income that's his income

1109
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,800
 he inheritance is not income

1110
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,560
 so wait wait wait wait wait wa so if i get given1 billion

1111
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,079
 i don't pay any tax but if i work for10 billion i pay 60%

1112
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:49,960
 well if you inherit

1113
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,480
 this is the tax system that you want

1114
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,920
 you'll end up in a system

1115
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,280
 where the kids of the richual own everything

1116
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,960
 that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying

1117
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,240
 and that's fun because that's our kids you're not telling the truth about his

1118
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,599
 let's support it let's have a tax system where your kids and my kids and steven's

1119
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,760
 kids are multimillionaires

1120
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,240
 and

1121
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,520
 these

1122
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,200
 guys out there

1123
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,480
 can't

1124
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:06,760
 afford

1125
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,160
 to feed

1126
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,520
 their kids

1127
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,240
 and put the heat in

1128
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,960
 that's not what i'm saying

1129
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,319
 but that's what you will get

1130
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:12,400
 that is what you will get that's listen

1131
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,079
 that's what i'm betting on that's fine because i'll make money in the markets

1132
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,880
 it's fine and you'll make money and you'll make money

1133
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,960
 it's our viewers who will be poor and that's fine

1134
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,760
 that's fine that's fine for us let's let's explore the other alternative

1135
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,160
 right so let's say tax the rich

1136
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,920
 right so let's play the game of tax the rich

1137
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,960
 tax the owners

1138
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,920
 not the workers

1139
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,040
 the owners

1140
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,520
 so the issue that we have with the rich

1141
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,400
 is that is the number one most valuable assets in the economy now in tangible assets

1142
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,800
 so there's this chart called the s&p 500 of the 500

1143
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,319
 richest countries in the country in the world in the us sorry

1144
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:52,000
 um in 1970s 75% of the value of the s&p 500 was physical assets like property

1145
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 um and today it's less than 10%

1146
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,040
 it's closer to 5%

1147
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,160
 you think that housing is not particularly important

1148
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,560
 just just let's stick stick with what i'm saying

1149
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
 okay

1150
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,000
 the the the powerhouse the engine room of the economy is digital assets

1151
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,800
 and that's reflected in

1152
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,800
 the s&p 500 for example which is 95%

1153
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,319
 intangible assets

1154
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:14,480
 one of the issues that we have is that the richest people are completely

1155
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:14,920
 mobile

1156
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,400
 now

1157
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,560
 so they can be absolutely

1158
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,640
 anywhere in the world

1159
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,880
 so if you come up with this idea of let's tax richest people 1%

1160
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,400
 if a tiny proportion of them leave

1161
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,160
 we're all in trouble

1162
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,920
 so this really rich guys m

1163
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,079
 what do they own

1164
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,079
 companies

1165
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,520
 and why are those companies worth money

1166
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,480
 because investors say they are and where do the revenues come from globally

1167
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,319
 okay the issue is is that these companies operate globally now so

1168
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,640
 take my company for example

1169
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,440
 my company has 8,000 customers in 150

1170
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,119
 countries

1171
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,440
 okay we could be anywhere if you p what country is your biggest single revenue source

1172
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,119
 probably the us now

1173
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,599
 let's say you move to cayman

1174
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,599
 island

1175
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:01,160
 and the us says we're going to tax your revenue at point of sale

1176
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,480
 m what can you do

1177
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,599
 well that's different right because that's not taxing billionaires that's taxing

1178
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,599
 companies

1179
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,000
 see when you say tax the rich on their wealth

1180
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,520
 yeah that's different to saying tax companies a consumption tax

1181
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,000
 oh but you just said the're rich owned companies

1182
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,200
 you said that's what they own yeah but you're saying

1183
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,000
 how do you tax them right so do they do you tax their wealth

1184
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,560
 which is what they own

1185
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,040
 or do you tax the companies where they trade

1186
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,640
 um typically consumption taxes get passed on to consumers

1187
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,760
 it's not consumption tax it's the tax on the ownership

1188
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,800
 yeah but if you simply say when you're doing revenues

1189
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,560
 then that's a consumption we start to tax

1190
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,400
 if we start to taxit

1191
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,720
 by the way i'm not exactly against you on on companies i think it's disgusting

1192
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,640
 that a british company

1193
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,680
 can can take out a facebook ad to sell to a british

1194
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,599
 consumer

1195
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,880
 a british product and facebook pretends to be in ireland on that transaction

1196
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,280
 um and amazon you can buy something on amazon in britain from a british supplier

1197
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,400
 from a british warehouse

1198
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,200
 and amazon pretends to be in luxembourg

1199
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,440
 in that situation

1200
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,400
 and that sucks right like that that does not seem

1201
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,640
 fair and it strikes me as very strange that the government

1202
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,359
 is okay with that right now the government is chasing

1203
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:10,920
 down

1204
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,880
 moms and dads who sell a few things on ebay

1205
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,920
 and chasing them for taxes but they don't talk to ebay

1206
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,359
 they they they're paranoid

1207
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,040
 about someone

1208
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,119
 doing a little bit of a side hustle on facebook

1209
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:22,760
 but facebook's

1210
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,079
 fine to pretend to be an ireland

1211
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,319
 so i don't agree with all of all of that right like i think where

1212
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:29,240
 missing some serious tricks here

1213
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,200
 but the idea

1214
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,040
 with

1215
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,000
 taxing

1216
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,480
 billionaires at wealth

1217
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,200
 billionaires will just leave they just get up and leave and and not just billionaires

1218
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,240
 but what the billionaires

1219
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
 own what the billionaires own companies

1220
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,599
 and where do companies get their money from revenues

1221
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,160
 and where do the revenues come from

1222
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
 purchasing

1223
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,599
 people purchasing where do those people live

1224
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,599
 all over the world

1225
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,920
 we can tax them at that point

1226
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,280
 that's consumption tax this is the thing that's a consumption

1227
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,880
 tax

1228
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,079
 no it's not it's

1229
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:55,599
 v

1230
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,440
 is a tax on revenue

1231
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,200
 tax these guys on

1232
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,319
 profits based on where the revenues

1233
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:58,839
 come from

1234
00:42:58,839 --> 00:42:59,200
 so

1235
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,400
 it's very easy to move profits

1236
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,359
 internationally

1237
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,319
 see steven had a

1238
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:05,800
 starbucks cup when he buys that starbucks

1239
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,040
 yeah it's bought from a british company

1240
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,079
 who licenses the starbucks logo

1241
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:14,599
 from luxembourg or somewhere like that so 15%

1242
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,839
 so here we are saying oh we're going to tax their profits

1243
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:18,640
 they say ah i wish we were profitable

1244
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,280
 sorry

1245
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,440
 unfortunately we had to do that licensing deal with that international

1246
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,119
 i know how profit shifting works okay so are you you think are you telling

1247
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:27,160
 me

1248
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,400
 compan selling to

1249
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,800
 the uk the us enormous amount of of profit in the us

1250
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,000
 and they turn around and say actually our profit is not in the us

1251
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,440
 the difference you think the us

1252
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,839
 is in is is incapable

1253
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,040
 of going and looking if that's seeing

1254
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,680
 where they really where the profit is i'm not saying

1255
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,240
 that you can't

1256
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,520
 do

1257
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:41,920
 this

1258
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,359
 i'm saying

1259
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:43,280
 that the benefits

1260
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,200
 of doing it it's so hard to tax

1261
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,000
 wealth for example or it's so hard to tax

1262
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,839
 millionaires and billionaires

1263
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,079
 that that you end up cutting off your nose despite your face

1264
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,240
 um for every

1265
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,640
 like if we britain for example

1266
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,720
 and we build a brand

1267
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,240
 which is that we're anti- wealth

1268
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,400
 we don't want you to ever have more than 10 million

1269
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,800
 if you've got more than 10 million we punish you

1270
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,839
 every young entrepreneur

1271
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,200
 who comes to me and says dan do you think i should start a company

1272
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,280
 here in this country

1273
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,359
 i'm going to say well if you do

1274
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,200
 they'll take it

1275
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,000
 as soon as you start to make it they'll take it

1276
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,359
 as soon as if you're successful

1277
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,520
 if you get investment

1278
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,559
 they're going to tax you at your wealth

1279
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,079
 if you sell the company they're going to take it off you

1280
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,599
 i'm going to basically say to that young entrepreneur

1281
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,880
 don't build your business in brit go start it somewhere that they're more proactive

1282
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,480
 and positive towards entrepreneurs

1283
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,800
 are we seeing that now with this they call it the millionaire exodus

1284
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,559
 which is

1285
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:38,440
 for people that don't know the uk has set to lose the greatest proportion of millionaires

1286
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,160
 in the world

1287
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,359
 um this parliament i'll put a graph on the screen which is this one here

1288
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,920
 this one here

1289
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,319
 and that little red line here is

1290
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,480
 us losing all of our millionaires at the moment and in 2024 it's an estimated

1291
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,160
 that 10,800

1292
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,079
 high net worth individuals left the uk which is

1293
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:57,920
 57%

1294
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,839
 increase from the previous year which means that 1 millionaire is departing every 45 minutes

1295
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,000
 the uk millionaire

1296
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 exodus

1297
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,280
 is equal to losing 530,000 average

1298
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,280
 taxpayers

1299
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,880
 and another stat

1300
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,040
 the top 10% of earners in the us account for nearly half of all consumer spending

1301
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,680
 the top 1% of income taxpayers in the uk are projected to contribute

1302
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,559
 about 30% of total income tax from 2024 to

1303
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,559
 2025

1304
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,680
 why are all these millionaires running away

1305
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,880
 well it's not because they're taxing their world because we don't have any wealth taxes

1306
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,720
 why why do you think they're leaving

1307
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,160
 i think the reason they're leaving is because the uk economy is is really really weak

1308
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,319
 because the uk consumer is really really weak because you've absolutely crushed the spending power

1309
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,280
 of your average british family

1310
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,480
 your average british family

1311
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,760
 can barely afford to feed the kids and turn the heating on

1312
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,920
 so why are you going to start a business

1313
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,400
 here

1314
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,440
 when the customers are absolutely impoverished

1315
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,599
 look it corresponds with a new tax that we brought in which was

1316
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:52,960
 um we ended the non-dom scheme

1317
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,520
 so the non-dom scheme basically said if you're living in the uk

1318
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,119
 but you've got businesses all over the world

1319
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,760
 then we only tax you on what you've got in the uk

1320
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,160
 um and if you die in the uk

1321
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,760
 we'll only tax you on your uk assets for inheritance tax if you're a non-dom

1322
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,520
 but if you die in the uk and you've got wealth in india

1323
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,480
 once that nonon

1324
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,400
 scheme ended

1325
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,960
 they basically said we will tax you on everything globally

1326
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,240
 if you're an economic

1327
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,079
 if you're a tax resident in the uk

1328
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,680
 everything you've got globally we want 40% of it so unfortunately every wealth manager

1329
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,440
 contacted their clients and said you can't stay here you're going to have to get out

1330
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,760
 um it's it's gotten really bad a th000 people a month are leaving

1331
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,359
 and

1332
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,559
 in the uk 1% of people pay 30%

1333
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,920
 of the taxes 10% of people pay 60%

1334
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,000
 of the taxes

1335
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,760
 and you imagine

1336
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,119
 if we're sitting out at dinner

1337
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:41,920
 and there's 10 of us out to dinner

1338
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,280
 and one person says hey i've got this i get i'll get 60%

1339
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,760
 of the bill tonight we say to them no it should be 70% should be 80%

1340
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,200
 and they say you know what i'll get up and leave so they leave

1341
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,280
 everyone else's bill just doubled

1342
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,000
 so what's going to happen is if we drive the millionaires out of this country

1343
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,599
 everyone

1344
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,319
 every ordinary

1345
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:00,760
 normal

1346
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,040
 person

1347
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,440
 who pays

1348
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:01,880
 10 grand

1349
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,480
 a year in tax

1350
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,319
 will now have to pay

1351
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:03,599
 20

1352
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:03,800
 grand

1353
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,720
 a year in tax

1354
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,760
 so the reason they left because we used to allow them to not pay tax

1355
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,960
 and we ta on their global incomes

1356
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
 on their global

1357
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,000
 isn't it a bit more like if we were 10 of us at dinner

1358
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,920
 and there was one guy

1359
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,440
 who

1360
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,720
 came on to dinner on the condition he wouldn't pay their leaves

1361
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,200
 because these guys weren't paying tax anyway

1362
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,079
 the reason they left is because they weren't paying tax

1363
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,359
 it's like saying

1364
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:23,119
 um

1365
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:23,839
 it's like saying

1366
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:24,920
 hey i'll pay 60%

1367
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,079
 of this table and they say at the table

1368
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:27,920
 hey wait a second

1369
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,800
 we also want you to pay for

1370
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,160
 everything that's happening at other restaurants as well isn't it a bit more like

1371
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,920
 these guys we're stretching

1372
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,800
 on a condition you you yourself said

1373
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,839
 the reason why they left

1374
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,359
 is because we let them live here

1375
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,119
 on the condition that they didn't have to pay taxes

1376
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,319
 on their global

1377
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,640
 yeah taxes matter right so why why is everyone going to dubai

1378
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,680
 dubai they're going there because there's no tax

1379
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,480
 these guys

1380
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,599
 they live in dubai

1381
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,240
 their money comes from the west

1382
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,480
 they are making money

1383
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,880
 from the west while your average western

1384
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,760
 ordinary person watching this show now

1385
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,440
 cannot afford to buy a house cannot afford to have a family

1386
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,240
 we can tax those revenues at the point of sale why do we allow these

1387
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,839
 it's a called a consumption tax no it's not it's a tax on

1388
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:09,839
 tax on profit

1389
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:10,640
 not tax on consumption

1390
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,559
 you just said at point of sale which means it's a consumption

1391
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,760
 tax based on the profits

1392
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,040
 you look at how much profit

1393
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,040
 they

1394
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,319
 where the profits exactly it's not consumption tax what i'm saying so

1395
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,520
 no so if you tax profits

1396
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,760
 yeah right then those profits

1397
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,160
 have to accumulate in that country and because of the digital

1398
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,440
 ecosystem that we now have the world we now live in

1399
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,480
 i can lease the database off of my company in luxembourg i can

1400
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,839
 license the i can license my logo from understand how profit shifting

1401
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:45,319
 listen these guys are not gandal you just say we don't accept profit shifting

1402
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:48,440
 we don't need to accept profit shifting china does not accept profit shifting

1403
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,680
 we did not accept profit shifting

1404
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,200
 50 years ago we do not have to accept profit shifting

1405
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,880
 but you have

1406
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,160
 a government class who are extremely wealthy and a media class are extremely wealthy saying

1407
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,720
 it's impossible to tax rich people and i would like to say

1408
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,520
 i will agree 100%

1409
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,160
 it is difficult to tax rich people it is very

1410
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,280
 very very difficult to tax rich people

1411
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,520
 i don't i don't come here saying i want to tax rich people because it's easy

1412
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,559
 i know it's hard

1413
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,920
 i know probably i'm going to lose

1414
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,880
 i know our viewers

1415
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,960
 kids will live in desperate poverty i know that

1416
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,799
 i do this because it is hard

1417
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:20,359
 if we are a country

1418
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:23,920
 which says to ourselves we don't try and do things which are necessary

1419
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,599
 to keep our kids out of poverty

1420
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,880
 because they are hard

1421
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,520
 then our kids will live in poverty i don't need to be here i'm a multimillionaire

1422
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,319
 just like you i could be in the philippines drinking panac laders

1423
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:35,839
 i come in here because i come from a poor background

1424
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,920
 and it's ordinary families like my family

1425
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,000
 like the kids i grew up with whose kids are going to be in poverty

1426
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,520
 it's

1427
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,839
 difficult but it is

1428
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:43,839
 necessary

1429
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,960
 sometimes we have to do things not because they're easy but because

1430
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:53,040
 they are hard that is what makes a rich country rich and that is what protects

1431
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,720
 ordinary people listen our grandparents lived in poverty

1432
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,760
 did they say let's not change it because it's hard no they didn't

1433
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,480
 they fought

1434
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,680
 and they demanded

1435
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,599
 they demanded health care education

1436
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,359
 housing food and they got it they got it that's why my parents

1437
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,359
 could live a good quality life

1438
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,680
 they got those things they got those things and they were aware

1439
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,000
 that in order to do that you could not allow

1440
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,480
 the super

1441
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:15,839
 rich

1442
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,160
 who have been living lives of luxury

1443
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,520
 for hundreds and hundreds of years

1444
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,000
 to eat

1445
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,680
 everything

1446
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,680
 while ordinary

1447
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,319
 families couldn't afford to feed their kids

1448
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:22,960
 i know it's

1449
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,680
 difficult i know it's

1450
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,040
 difficult and i know i'm probably going to lose

1451
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,720
 i know that i know i'm probably going to lose

1452
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,200
 and that means our viewers will be poor but i do it anyway

1453
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,000
 because i do not want this country that i grew up in to fall into desperate

1454
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 poverty

1455
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,760
 i agree with you on the passion and i agree with you on the problem

1456
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,680
 i don't agree with you on the solution because in 2019

1457
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,240
 we be kids in 2020 and that's not what i'm saying in 2020

1458
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,520
 we made a decision globally to shut down the economy

1459
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,240
 and we taught

1460
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,040
 everyone that they can live and work from anywhere

1461
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,079
 the biggest threat to everything you're saying is remote working

1462
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,000
 the fact that we can live and work work from anywhere our grandparents

1463
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,040
 their boss if their boss owned a company

1464
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,640
 that company

1465
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,520
 had to physically

1466
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,599
 be in the country and the boss had to physically be in the country

1467
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,200
 if we look at today

1468
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,680
 there are plenty of fitness trainers who work for a gym

1469
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,200
 and the owner of that gym is somewhere overseas

1470
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,559
 plenty of people work in live

1471
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:14,359
 work in a restaurant

1472
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:15,240
 and the owner of the restaurant

1473
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:15,960
 lives overseas

1474
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,319
 you can live in you can run a business from anywhere in the world right now

1475
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,480
 so the problem that we face

1476
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,160
 is that you're describing

1477
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:24,799
 on one

1478
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,520
 hand you say

1479
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,160
 we need to tax it at the point of sale which is a consumption

1480
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,799
 tax

1481
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:32,720
 and not tax on profit okay and then you say a tax on profit

1482
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,440
 and then you say

1483
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:33,799
 oh

1484
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,640
 but then we'll stop

1485
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,319
 profit shifting

1486
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:36,359
 by the way i'm also

1487
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,799
 actually all for this idea of

1488
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:38,319
 stopping

1489
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:38,839
 profit

1490
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:41,480
 i i've already said i think it's utterly

1491
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
 ridiculous

1492
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,200
 the way that many of these global companies are treated

1493
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:45,920
 and if we don't

1494
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,319
 stop

1495
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:46,680
 that

1496
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,760
 then all the money just flows

1497
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,200
 out to the tech companies

1498
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,119
 um so i'm i'm with you on that but when you say tax the rich

1499
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,720
 the actual people who own the companies

1500
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,720
 those people can

1501
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,319
 be anywhere right now so but but their revenues

1502
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:00,400
 can't their customers

1503
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,599
 their customers are where their customers are

1504
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:04,880
 their customers are where their customers are

1505
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,400
 listen amazon doesn't pay any uk tax doesn't pay any us tax where are the customers

1506
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,799
 in the uk and us in uk

1507
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:10,359
 us

1508
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:14,000
 do you really think it's impossible for us to tax that well you're talking about taxing

1509
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 people at 10 million

1510
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,960
 plus right

1511
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,680
 so this is a lot of startup entrepreneurs

1512
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,040
 jeff bez is a lot more than 10 million jez

1513
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,799
 jeff worth a lot more than you talk about

1514
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:26,680
 anyone above 10 million is on your radar you don't want people worth

1515
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,839
 11 million pounds we pay more i'm not just talk

1516
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:29,760
 it's not that

1517
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,960
 dan if you you you're worth more than 10 million pounds so if we tax people

1518
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,960
 on

1519
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,280
 as gary says that have more than 10 million what are your options

1520
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,319
 to avoid say if your objective was to avoid that

1521
00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:44,400
 what options do you have look if if my objective was to

1522
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,760
 avoid it i pass a board resolution that we're moving the head office somewhere else yeah

1523
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,440
 um we move the intellectual property somewhere else

1524
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,119
 i pick up and move my family somewhere else

1525
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:54,920
 and within

1526
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,559
 about a week or two we've got a we

1527
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:57,119
 work office

1528
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:57,720
 somewhere else

1529
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,720
 i've got a new house

1530
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,599
 on airbnb

1531
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,799
 somewhere else

1532
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,319
 and i cut ties with the uk

1533
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:04,720
 and i'm non- tax resident

1534
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,720
 here and i can

1535
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,839
 i have a digital business

1536
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:09,559
 i can literally make my head office anywhere in the world

1537
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:13,119
 if there was a particular country that turned hostile towards

1538
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,880
 our operations they not have to withdraw service from that thing

1539
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,119
 you know so that that's possible but it's unlikely that that would actually happen

1540
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,240
 but ultimately if i choose to get up and leave then i get up and leave

1541
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,079
 now

1542
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:28,599
 the the the bigger issue is would i have even come here in the first place

1543
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:31,880
 and then there's another issue and here's the other issue gary for you

1544
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,760
 you've just had 750,000

1545
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,480
 subscribers to your youtube channel 820 it's 8:20 right so it's going up fast

1546
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,680
 i could have

1547
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:46,119
 one of my analysts at a consulting company do valuation of your brand

1548
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:48,240
 and do valuation of your youtube channel

1549
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,799
 we could say this is a fast growth media company

1550
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:51,920
 and it's worth

1551
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,040
 11 million

1552
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,640
 right so we could come up with a forecast

1553
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,640
 and a projection and we say gary's

1554
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,359
 economics

1555
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,359
 is actually a new fast growth media brand it's worth 11 million

1556
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:02,400
 now your channel

1557
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,520
 now you have to pay 100 grand a year in extra taxes

1558
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,400
 because you're a millionaire

1559
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
 sorry 1%

1560
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,640
 on wealth above

1561
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,799
 10 million on 11 million is going to be 10 grand taxes

1562
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:13,119
 oh you're saying only on the part above that's how

1563
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,720
 taxes work so it's not on everything

1564
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,319
 it's

1565
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,920
 okay so it's a it's a marginal tax that's how taxes work

1566
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,680
 it's

1567
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,559
 so okay so but is it fair

1568
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:25,799
 that like who gets to decide what wealth is wealth and what it's worth because wealth

1569
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:29,640
 let's just hit me out wealth is a a technical term for unrealized

1570
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,280
 gains

1571
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,440
 right it's not real

1572
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,000
 you know someone buys a house for 20 grand and it's worth 200 grand

1573
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,400
 they've still got the same house but now they've got wealth

1574
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,280
 um if someone starts a business

1575
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,880
 and a tiny little seed investor

1576
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,000
 puts in a little angel

1577
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,079
 investment

1578
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,559
 now they've got wealth on paper but who gets to say what is wealth

1579
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,160
 um like for example

1580
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,559
 if you introduce wealth taxes theoretically

1581
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:56,400
 that will actually

1582
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,559
 reduce the value of wealth of things anyway

1583
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,079
 because

1584
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:00,880
 things in inside that economy

1585
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,960
 are now subject to a disadvantage

1586
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,200
 so therefore investors will be unlikely to invest in them to a certain point

1587
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,160
 and also

1588
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,079
 people start

1589
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:13,280
 cutting and dodging and weaving and ducking and weaving so they say oh our uk operations

1590
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,280
 worth 10 million so we're now going to start

1591
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,760
 a second company over in some other country and make sure that

1592
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,400
 that's where the wealth accumulates

1593
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,440
 so it's incredibly

1594
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,039
 difficult because it is just unrealized

1595
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:23,599
 gains

1596
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:24,960
 i know i know it's difficult

1597
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,160
 yeah i know i know these guys have the best accountants

1598
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,720
 i i know it's difficult i know so what if there was an easier

1599
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,720
 solution

1600
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,559
 if there was an easier

1601
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:31,880
 solution

1602
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,559
 i would support

1603
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,400
 that you know what i mean it's called it's called economic

1604
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:34,799
 freedom

1605
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:35,240
 the economic

1606
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:35,559
 freedom

1607
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:36,240
 index

1608
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,160
 okay well

1609
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,000
 just tell the viewers

1610
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,960
 that give them more economic

1611
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,119
 freedom and then they'll be rich

1612
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:40,760
 yeah so this

1613
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,440
 this diagram

1614
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
 here basically says

1615
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,240
 the most free

1616
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,200
 countries

1617
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,760
 have less than 10% poverty in fact less than 7% poverty

1618
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,440
 as soon as you reduce economic freedom it jumps to 30%

1619
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,480
 poverty you reduce economic freedom again and it jumps up to huge huge amounts of poverty

1620
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,079
 so

1621
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,240
 the these countries here are the least economically

1622
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,160
 free and these countries are the most economically

1623
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:00,799
 free

1624
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,280
 the countries that get in the way of your economic

1625
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,280
 freedom

1626
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,960
 have more poverty and the countries that let people make decisions for their own life

1627
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,640
 what you're saying is

1628
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,079
 if the governments of our countries cut taxes on us the three multimillionaire

1629
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,720
 sitting at this table

1630
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,280
 that will improve the lives of

1631
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,920
 the ordinary british and american

1632
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,079
 give a real life example to feed their kids i'll give you a real life example

1633
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,200
 i know of a company

1634
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,559
 that was going to give pay rises to its employees

1635
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,520
 and then national insurance went up and instead of national insurance is a tax on employment

1636
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:29,960
 yeah

1637
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,200
 i'm saying to reduce that i'm saying to reduce tax on i want your viewers

1638
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:33,720
 the viewers

1639
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,720
 here to be paying less tax

1640
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,680
 while multimillionaires pay more tax good in theory

1641
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,680
 but

1642
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,559
 of if you could tax rich people 1% of their wealth above 10 million

1643
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,400
 i did a back of a napkin cap

1644
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,079
 calculation you might be able to get 20 billion

1645
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:49,480
 yeah

1646
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,480
 right that's if they don't leave that's if they don't respond

1647
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,839
 to it if they just happily pay it you get 20 billion

1648
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,240
 that's less than a week worth of current government spending

1649
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,599
 so the government's out of control 1.2

1650
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,359
 trillion a year of government spending is now what they spend

1651
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:04,720
 okay so let's cut that get that 20 billion

1652
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,400
 and cut the taxes

1653
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,160
 for

1654
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,319
 the viewers

1655
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,480
 cut their income tax so that works out about 250 a year

1656
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,559
 okay so let's do more let's make it 60 billion

1657
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,000
 so then you tax 3%

1658
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,240
 above wealth yeah do that right and then you also bring it down

1659
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,240
 this is what governments do make five or six

1660
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,240
 yeah and then and that's what they did

1661
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,039
 that's what they did in the second

1662
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:24,240
 world

1663
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,520
 war and that's why my dad could afford

1664
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,319
 a house

1665
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,200
 actually that's not why you could afford a house

1666
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,039
 okay well

1667
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,720
 who's buy if ordinary people are losing their houses and the wealth which they are yeah

1668
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,799
 and we're getting richer

1669
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:37,119
 yeah who is it who is now owning the houses if it is not us

1670
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,799
 the government used to own the houses and then they sold the government wealth is collapsing

1671
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,559
 government wealth is collapsing but what they did

1672
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,440
 is they sold the houses to the people

1673
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,319
 okay but but

1674
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:46,559
 ordinary middle

1675
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,280
 is also you can only do that once

1676
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,440
 and they did it for the baby

1677
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,760
 so you think it's our viewers who have got my houses now

1678
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,280
 who

1679
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,119
 where is the wealth

1680
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:53,520
 going

1681
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:53,960
 daniel

1682
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,119
 where is the wealth going who has the wealth now who is getting rich

1683
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,039
 who is getting the wealth that is lost by our viewers

1684
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,839
 i'll tell you where the biggest amounts of money are going the biggest amounts of money

1685
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:04,960
 since the pandemic

1686
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,119
 11 trillion went just to the value of seven companies that own te technology

1687
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,960
 so the biggest seven companies in the usa

1688
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,520
 11 trillion

1689
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,520
 has and you don't want their billionaire owners to pay more tax

1690
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,119
 well would that help the uk

1691
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,280
 well if you use that money to reduce tax on working

1692
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,599
 people then it it would help yeah they

1693
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:25,319
 own shares in the usa they're us citizens

1694
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:27,160
 so that doesn't help us here

1695
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,200
 but it will help the american

1696
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:28,720
 consumer

1697
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,440
 and then we can export the american consumer

1698
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,559
 and it will mean the american consumer

1699
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:32,079
 has money

1700
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:32,839
 and then it will show

1701
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:33,200
 british

1702
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:33,520
 people

1703
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,720
 how much you can achieve

1704
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,079
 by taxing super rich we can raise tax on our super rich here

1705
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:38,880
 and then

1706
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,640
 what i want is these guys to be taxed so much that they start to sell

1707
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,319
 assets

1708
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:42,960
 and then ordinary

1709
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,319
 british people can buy assets again because what i want is our viewers

1710
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,799
 to be able to own things

1711
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:49,640
 to be able to own their own homes

1712
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,119
 i when i hear this

1713
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:51,880
 um i

1714
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,280
 admissibly

1715
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,559
 don't know as much about these issues as you guys do but

1716
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,359
 when i hear that there's these seven

1717
00:58:56,359 --> 00:59:01,920
 tech companies in the us my brain goes can't we have one here yeah yeah

1718
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,880
 can't we start

1719
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,880
 and then so my brain goes how what conditions do we have to create

1720
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,720
 ones that we had

1721
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,440
 yeah what conditions do we have to create

1722
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,640
 to have one of those seven

1723
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,640
 tech companies here especially

1724
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,799
 in this sort of ai world we're heading towards

1725
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,520
 where when i was reading through the stats

1726
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,359
 most of the investment in ai

1727
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:18,280
 which is going to be hugely destabilizing

1728
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,160
 across every industry from driving to to

1729
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,359
 any form of knowledge work even podcasting

1730
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:28,280
 i can play your podcast now yeah which sounds exactly like me which has a 4.6

1731
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,720
 star rating on apple which was written by ai in my voice published by ai

1732
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,480
 wild

1733
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,520
 and the and who's acing

1734
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,160
 the value there well it's a company in america

1735
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:36,680
 called 11

1736
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,000
 labs

1737
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,160
 and it's bloody

1738
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,280
 open ai

1739
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,039
 and i

1740
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:40,720
 why

1741
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,760
 why can't we have those companies here we need them here because china

1742
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,039
 and the us are dominating

1743
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:45,960
 this next

1744
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,960
 revolution

1745
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,160
 um and i i worry as a bystander that if we don't create entrepreneurship

1746
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,160
 friendly

1747
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:53,960
 environments

1748
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,599
 here

1749
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:57,760
 we're going to we are going to become indian yeah m so you

1750
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,720
 if you want businesses that to thrive

1751
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,520
 you don't need just a good environment for entrepreneurs

1752
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,200
 you also need people to have money that they can spend

1753
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,200
 mh

1754
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,799
 and we are in a country where increasingly

1755
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:14,079
 most of the people out there have almost

1756
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,760
 nothing left over at the end of the month

1757
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,960
 they can barely pay the bills

1758
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,319
 those companies are selling globally

1759
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,000
 right so they don't need any particular

1760
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,440
 company to do well they just they sell to anywhere

1761
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,440
 so like open ai chat gpt

1762
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,119
 we're all using that bloody product and pay our 20 $30

1763
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:27,520
 a month

1764
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,520
 yeah where do they actually get their money

1765
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:28,760
 from

1766
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,799
 right they get their money from selling

1767
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:30,119
 data

1768
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:31,119
 to to to the rich

1769
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:31,880
 right

1770
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,559
 my point was making the environment more friendly for entrepreneurs because when i start a company

1771
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,799
 i am at a i can't explain the disadvantage

1772
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,240
 i'm at at the moment if i start

1773
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,880
 that kind of company here in the uk there's no investors

1774
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,760
 and then all the talent seems to flock over to san francisco

1775
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,720
 so the the guys that built

1776
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,760
 the british guys that built

1777
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,960
 an ai company called fixer

1778
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,559
 which i was going to invest in all british lads from london

1779
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,839
 they went over to san francisco they're like 25y

1780
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,599
 olds they've just raised at a 60 million valuation

1781
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,240
 they're in this room

1782
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,880
 this building in san francisco full of entrepreneurs

1783
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,920
 and they're pumping knowledge and capital into this room

1784
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,119
 with all due respect stephen

1785
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:08,319
 you're not a great example for the fact that it's impossible

1786
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:09,200
 to start

1787
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,160
 a successful online brand in the uk

1788
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:11,720
 facts

1789
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,280
 um

1790
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,599
 but i also realized that the problem of of but he started when things were different

1791
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:17,680
 but i i also realized

1792
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,359
 i don't like using personal examples

1793
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,680
 because there's a huge amount of privilege and

1794
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,079
 okay is there a chat gbt in germany

1795
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,839
 no is there a chat gbt in in france

1796
01:01:26,839 --> 01:01:29,000
 no is there a chat gpt in australia

1797
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,960
 no no is there a chat gpt in ja

1798
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,039
 it's china and one sec sec yeah exactly

1799
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,839
 what you have here is an extremely

1800
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:35,599
 low labor

1801
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:36,000
 extremely

1802
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,359
 high capital model which employs

1803
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:37,799
 extremely

1804
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:39,640
 few people across the entire world

1805
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,839
 that is focused in

1806
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:42,559
 basically two cities

1807
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:43,559
 yeah

1808
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:47,440
 good luck competing with that h how do we create an environment where the uk

1809
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,000
 can start to build some of these companies

1810
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,799
 which are going to capitalize

1811
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:51,039
 on this next technological

1812
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:52,039
 revolution

1813
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:54,760
 how if you were prime minister what would you do

1814
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,000
 i think you need to look realistically

1815
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,920
 about what companies do we have a chance of growing

1816
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,559
 you know i'm not an expert in ai

1817
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:01,599
 but i think trying to compete with san francisco

1818
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:02,680
 in london would

1819
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,880
 will probably

1820
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,000
 not work

1821
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,160
 why try try and do it you know try and do it and listen

1822
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:08,520
 i know

1823
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,680
 that you can get a lot of likes saying

1824
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,240
 let's just invest

1825
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:10,640
 in ai

1826
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,400
 let's just invest

1827
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,400
 only one city in the world outside of china has managed

1828
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:13,720
 it

1829
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,279
 china has managed it by basically state

1830
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:15,880
 capitalism

1831
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,960
 you know this is very similar in a sense to what we had with micro electronics

1832
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,319
 in japan in the 8s

1833
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,000
 right when you have a new industry

1834
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,559
 especially these industries which are very capital intense and don't employ many people

1835
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:29,000
 you get a first move advantage they tend to win eventually

1836
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 often they get undercut

1837
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,920
 by cheaper rivals

1838
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,760
 and that does happen you know that does happen and you might stand in ai

1839
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,520
 i don't think ai is going to become

1840
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,559
 a massive massive

1841
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:37,559
 employer

1842
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:40,440
 of course you know a lot of countries are going to be like because basically

1843
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,240
 it sounds good we're going to invest in i we're going to invest in ai

1844
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,039
 personally i think we should be looking at what does the british person need

1845
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,799
 you know we live in a country where the housing stock is falling apart

1846
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,400
 if if we say ai

1847
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,480
 when we talk about ai i think we're actually talking about technology

1848
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,640
 because even a podcast

1849
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,480
 like a podcast like this you don't think this

1850
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,160
 of this as an ai company

1851
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,960
 but actually now the editing process the scripting process the transcription

1852
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,160
 process even youtube itself is an ai company

1853
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:07,760
 so

1854
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,000
 it's it's really technology

1855
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,079
 we're speaking about here and i'm wondering why we can't create a better environment

1856
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,160
 in the uk

1857
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,119
 to start launching

1858
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:15,359
 and building some of these technology

1859
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:18,160
 companies we've even seen i think we should and i think we should be looking

1860
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,480
 we should be look at reducing

1861
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:19,960
 taxes

1862
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,000
 on people who

1863
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,599
 who work and make money this is what i've been saying for the whole time

1864
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,440
 what about people what about people who start companies

1865
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,160
 yeah we should reduce

1866
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,599
 their taxes on the income that they make

1867
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:29,960
 but then if they start owning a50

1868
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,079
 million pound company

1869
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:32,160
 are you telling me

1870
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,839
 if you come to me and i say all right you want to start a company

1871
01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:37,480
 we we tax you very very little on a company that you start

1872
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,400
 if that company becomes

1873
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,920
 worth 20 30 40 million quid

1874
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,839
 then we're going to start taxing

1875
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:42,880
 you you're going to come and say to me oh no sorry

1876
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,920
 50 million is not enough for me so can i ask a question on that so

1877
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:51,119
 um my company was was valued at x 50 whatever 100 millions

1878
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,599
 um congratulations i still had

1879
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,359
 because i hadn't had an exit event yeah i still had

1880
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,359
 101,000

1881
01:03:58,359 --> 01:03:59,119
 20,000

1882
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,079
 in my bank account

1883
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:00,799
 are you saying

1884
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,559
 at the point when i sell the company

1885
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,480
 or are you saying just because i have shares from the company

1886
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,000
 i think

1887
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,480
 you can structure

1888
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,839
 it a number of ways you can structure

1889
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:08,559
 a number of ways

1890
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:09,119
 my preferred

1891
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,160
 way is to stop people

1892
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:10,520
 from

1893
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,000
 hoarding

1894
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,880
 enormous a of wealth for enormous amounts of time that's my

1895
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,599
 that's basically my preferred method

1896
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,079
 there's also the wealth tax method

1897
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:17,839
 there's also

1898
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:18,599
 capital gains

1899
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:21,079
 as a method there's a lot of different ways it there's a lot of different ways

1900
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:22,480
 but you have to deal with the problem

1901
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,079
 of

1902
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:25,480
 if you do not do not tax very wealthy individuals

1903
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,839
 and very wealthy families

1904
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:29,599
 their share of the pie will obviously goow over time

1905
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,119
 and they will and they are as we are watching

1906
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,720
 squeezing our ordinary families

1907
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,160
 you have to deal with that my friend sold his company in the uk

1908
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,119
 it's a company everybody

1909
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,680
 knows

1910
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,960
 um and he

1911
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,319
 i remember

1912
01:04:39,319 --> 01:04:41,520
 him saying to me at the time it was in the middle of the pandemic

1913
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,520
 he got this big exit event i think he'd made 300 million

1914
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,359
 and he goes i'm off

1915
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,000
 i go where you going he goes i'm going to go to

1916
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,400
 dubai

1917
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:47,839
 in monaco

1918
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,119
 and live between the two

1919
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:49,839
 and i i said

1920
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:50,119
 explain

1921
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:51,440
 to me why he goes well the amount of tax

1922
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,640
 i'd have to pay in the uk

1923
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,200
 is equivalent

1924
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,680
 to me paying 20 million rent in the uk

1925
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,440
 for the next six or seven years

1926
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,200
 which he'd have to stay here for

1927
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,240
 so he

1928
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,000
 he went and he pops back in

1929
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,559
 every now and then but it meant that he could keep that

1930
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:05,400
 150

1931
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,079
 million whatever tax he would pay

1932
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:09,760
 never had to pay it to the uk is living this

1933
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,119
 highflying life now in dubai drops into monaco every now and then

1934
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:14,480
 um

1935
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,000
 and i remember him saying to me well steve

1936
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,200
 i'd have to pay 20 million

1937
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,559
 rent

1938
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:18,839
 a year to live here and he

1939
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:20,119
 went on to say the uk

1940
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:20,440
 product

1941
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,559
 is just isn't worth it

1942
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:22,240
 he goes crime

1943
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,079
 i'm going to get my rolex

1944
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:24,240
 robbed off me

1945
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:24,920
 he goes

1946
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,760
 um the healthare

1947
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,079
 system isn't the best the education

1948
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:28,119
 system isn't necessarily

1949
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:28,720
 the best

1950
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,880
 and the particular one was crime

1951
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,200
 which is i'll get i'll get i'll get mugged walking through

1952
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,559
 yeah london streets

1953
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:36,079
 stephen

1954
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,160
 if you allow british people who own 300 million pound of british assets

1955
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:40,799
 to

1956
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,160
 technically live in monaco and not pay tax

1957
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,279
 then you will get crime

1958
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:45,200
 and you will have

1959
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:45,920
 dirty streets

1960
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,400
 and you will have a bad health care system and you will have education

1961
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,760
 because if you give all of the wealth to a group of people

1962
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,799
 who do not tax

1963
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:53,480
 there will be nothing left to provide

1964
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,920
 things like healthcare and education

1965
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,119
 for ordinary people

1966
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,240
 it's not unconnected

1967
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,319
 these people are not technically

1968
01:05:58,319 --> 01:05:59,240
 living there they're moving

1969
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,200
 out my friends have

1970
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:00,559
 moved

1971
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,079
 out of the country they don't come back to the uk

1972
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:06,359
 they've left and they leave with their they built a company here

1973
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:07,359
 they

1974
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:07,960
 glob

1975
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,319
 p tax they typically build globally business it's not that they p it was a global

1976
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,839
 they don't pay no tax they pay extortionate

1977
01:06:14,839 --> 01:06:16,000
 amounts of tax

1978
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,440
 right anyone who's here is paying extraordinary

1979
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:22,480
 taxes more than they've ever paid before 1% pays 30%

1980
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,160
 10% pays 60% of

1981
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:30,359
 1 trillion a year gu 300 million how much tax rec he's paid in his life

1982
01:06:30,359 --> 01:06:31,920
 i have no idea

1983
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,960
 i have no idea

1984
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,760
 his business was global that his biggest customer was the us it's i pay 60%

1985
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,000
 and our viewers will pay 30 40 50%

1986
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,240
 do you think it's fair that your 300

1987
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,839
 million guy pays his two or three

1988
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:42,839
 i have no idea what he

1989
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:43,839
 pays

1990
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,119
 well it sounds like he didn't pay 50%

1991
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:48,359
 well he dashed when before he got the tax bill

1992
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:49,359
 but why did we allow it

1993
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,119
 why did we allow

1994
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:51,839
 i i'm not allowed to not pay my tax

1995
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:52,520
 what could you have done

1996
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,279
 to you are allowed

1997
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:53,520
 to

1998
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,279
 when you were in japan

1999
01:06:54,279 --> 01:06:55,200
 you wouldn't have paid uk

2000
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,240
 taxes

2001
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,880
 yeah because i was working in japan

2002
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,319
 and i pay japanese taxes because you're living in japan

2003
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:04,039
 this is the thing people can live wherever they want now so but

2004
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:05,960
 we're talking about this is

2005
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,839
 i think we should stop obfuscating

2006
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:11,960
 tax on people's work from tax on the ass they

2007
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,079
 so i'm talking about entrepreneurs work generates wealth

2008
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:18,680
 so when if i if i ear a billion pound of british houses

2009
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,960
 yeah and then i say i live in dubai yeah and i'm getting

2010
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,720
 the rent on a billion pounds of houses which would probably be something like like

2011
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,039
 that's going to be something like 50 million

2012
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,279
 a year so i'm getting 60 50 60 million a year of rent from british people

2013
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:35,520
 yeah and that gets paid to me from british people

2014
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:35,839
 yeah

2015
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,880
 and i pay and i don't pay tax i live in dubai

2016
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,960
 do you think that's fair

2017
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,839
 no

2018
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,480
 all right so let's change that let's let's make people pay tax on

2019
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,480
 on their world regardless where they live yeah the question would be though

2020
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,000
 how would you tax people right and how would you actually structure it because

2021
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,400
 regardless

2022
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,599
 of what you feel like is fair

2023
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:53,359
 this is the thing

2024
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:54,240
 it's not about fairness

2025
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,720
 it's about what you can pragmatic

2026
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,039
 and practically do in the modern economy

2027
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:01,640
 you might say oh i actually like for example if we said what's fair

2028
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,520
 a lot of people would say a flat tax is fair

2029
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,039
 you make one pound you pay 20%

2030
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,720
 you make a million pounds you pay 20%

2031
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,319
 make 100 million pounds you pay 20%

2032
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,599
 so a lot of people would say the fairest

2033
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,960
 tax system would just be a flat tax on everything

2034
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,480
 right that would be a fair thing it's pragmatically

2035
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,759
 can you do it is it actually good for society

2036
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:20,920
 should people be excluded from that so it's not about fairness it's about pragmatically

2037
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,120
 what can you get away with

2038
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,000
 all right well pragmatically

2039
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,759
 what we can get away with is desperate poverty for our viewers kids

2040
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,560
 if you want to have

2041
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,880
 can we zoom out just a minute

2042
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,198
 right i want to zoom out let's zoom away from our viewers

2043
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:31,759
 kids

2044
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,479
 forget about them they're not

2045
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:36,520
 i got i'm a dad right i got three kids you're you are a multimillionaire

2046
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,399
 dad you probably don't have the same problems as our viewers do you know that

2047
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,880
 do you know that kids born into the top have a 60%

2048
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,719
 chance of dropping out of the top

2049
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:45,799
 right 60%

2050
01:08:45,799 --> 01:08:48,640
 that's the number it's called persistence you can google it

2051
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,359
 um the persistence rates is actually only 40%

2052
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,319
 for the richest

2053
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,640
 so which means 60%

2054
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,920
 drop out in the second

2055
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,238
 you think kids have a 60%

2056
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:58,158
 chance of living in poverty pos not poverty

2057
01:08:58,158 --> 01:08:59,080
 do you know what's interesting

2058
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,238
 we're all trying to aim at the same goal

2059
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:02,238
 i think here

2060
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,759
 i'm not sure we are but well

2061
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:04,279
 that's fair

2062
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:05,359
 that's fair maybe we're not i suspect

2063
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,719
 some of us are maybe trying to protect

2064
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:06,960
 our

2065
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,960
 kids

2066
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,040
 i want widespread affluence through the technological

2067
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,238
 revolution that's happening

2068
01:09:11,238 --> 01:09:13,640
 and i don't want the people who create that

2069
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,479
 to want to go somewhere else so you agree with me

2070
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,120
 that we should cut tax on wealth creators and raise tax on wealth

2071
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,359
 orders

2072
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:22,719
 well broadly

2073
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,759
 okay so let's do it let's cut on people who are making

2074
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,880
 let cut tax on people who are working hard creating a good product

2075
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,040
 making a good income

2076
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,759
 and let's raise tax on people who are sitting there on 20 30 40

2077
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:34,238
 100

2078
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:36,080
 200 500 million pounds of assets

2079
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,359
 that they're going to give to their kids and they're going to use to dominate

2080
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:38,719
 society

2081
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,640
 and squeeze out the middle class so who's an example

2082
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,520
 of someone who's hoarding

2083
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,560
 wealth

2084
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,880
 she so his family owns a tech company

2085
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,880
 his

2086
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,679
 wife's dad owns a tech compan

2087
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,520
 which he will inherit and his kids will inherit

2088
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,520
 his net worth

2089
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,520
 that is quoted

2090
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,400
 is based upon his wife's

2091
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,800
 but that company already exists

2092
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,760
 yeah it's created now yeah

2093
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,640
 it's worth billions but they they have to reinvent that business every two years

2094
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,440
 like it's a so you think that the reason you think that if r's father-in-law

2095
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,920
 stopped managing the company it would be valueless

2096
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,280
 no i think it it

2097
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:11,840
 it

2098
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,320
 hires

2099
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:12,640
 hundreds

2100
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,560
 of thousands of people

2101
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:13,920
 and

2102
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,159
 it's you know it's a big company i don't know a lot about that particular

2103
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:17,600
 company but i know it's a tech company

2104
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,679
 steve jobs died

2105
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:19,679
 okay

2106
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,040
 is apple valueless

2107
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,480
 no let's not pretend

2108
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,400
 that these creators are the sole

2109
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,120
 reason these companies are are valuable

2110
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,040
 sure you know and what we're talking about in many cases

2111
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,000
 you know i was a trader okay

2112
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,360
 and

2113
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,040
 i'm worth a millions

2114
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,400
 of quid

2115
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:33,679
 and

2116
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:34,239
 you know now

2117
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:34,800
 that is just

2118
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,080
 assets

2119
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,159
 i just own the assets

2120
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:36,960
 i own the assets

2121
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,560
 and that will grow and it will grow and it will grow and it will grow

2122
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,080
 and that will squeeze out and squeeze out and squeeze out and squeeze out our viewers

2123
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,560
 and i'll give that to my kids

2124
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,719
 they don't even need to work

2125
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:46,280
 they wouldn't even

2126
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,679
 have even have to work they could just live on

2127
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:48,760
 i could live on off the

2128
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:49,760
 wealth

2129
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,600
 is that what you want do

2130
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,440
 do you think there are any opportunities

2131
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,840
 for people today like if you're born into a poor family

2132
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,520
 do you think it's possible

2133
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,159
 that housing being

2134
01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:05,120
 and we can both agree agree on that but do you think there are new opportunities

2135
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,800
 that didn't exist for our parents or grandparents but they do exist for people today

2136
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,560
 i think the reality is for kids from poor

2137
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,560
 backgrounds

2138
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,440
 it is almost

2139
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,440
 impossible

2140
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,280
 to realistically

2141
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,679
 get even financial security

2142
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,480
 never mind wealth but why do you think

2143
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,400
 you could do it i could do it he could do it

2144
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,080
 but you don't think other people could do

2145
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,080
 it

2146
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,360
 well the first thing is i'm 38 now so i'm not not a kid nowadays

2147
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,480
 um listen

2148
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,560
 i want every mass competition

2149
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,280
 i've ever been in

2150
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,719
 you know what i mean

2151
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:30,840
 since

2152
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,120
 i was a

2153
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:31,320
 little

2154
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:31,520
 kid

2155
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:31,760
 i didn't

2156
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:31,920
 even

2157
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,159
 have a

2158
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:32,360
 desk

2159
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:32,840
 in my

2160
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,320
 house

2161
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,000
 you know

2162
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,960
 i was one of the top students at

2163
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,960
 lc

2164
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,360
 and i still had to win my job by cheating in a card game

2165
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,920
 you know that's the world that we live in i don't think that's a very replicable

2166
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:42,440
 strategy

2167
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,719
 and it's very easy for people like us who've made money

2168
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,400
 to say oh ar we did it aren't we great go out and you know

2169
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,199
 you've said that you think if young people go and work in tech business

2170
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:51,800
 they can get financial security

2171
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,520
 if it was that easy

2172
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,000
 they'd all be doing it you know they're not idiots

2173
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,360
 our viewers

2174
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:54,880
 are not idiots

2175
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:55,800
 they're trying trying

2176
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,719
 they're trying

2177
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,400
 they want to find the good opportunities

2178
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,440
 and they work listen i speak

2179
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,960
 i'm the one saying they're idiots you're the one who says

2180
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,360
 that they can't do it anymore

2181
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,480
 i i see people do it all the time like i'm working in entrepreneurs

2182
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,239
 people from poor backgrounds

2183
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:12,440
 and so so then so but then why are i vi you think all of our

2184
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,840
 if it was that easy why is everybody

2185
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,719
 not doing it i'll tell you why people aren't doing it we went through a schooling

2186
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:17,239
 system

2187
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:19,360
 that taught us how to get an office job

2188
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,960
 okay right we went through a schooling system to prepare us for a

2189
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,880
 a world that doesn't really exist anymore which is the industrial revolution world

2190
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,199
 and you have to go through a process of figuring out how it really works

2191
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:31,880
 so

2192
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,320
 what what i see is

2193
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,040
 the most often the people who do really well financially

2194
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,000
 who are young

2195
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,239
 they dropped out of school they dropped out of university they started learning

2196
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,440
 how to do things

2197
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,000
 by doing their own research they start their own business or co-found a business

2198
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,400
 they take a very alternative

2199
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,600
 path

2200
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,520
 none of that was taught to us at school

2201
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,960
 none of it's taught to us in normal society

2202
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,159
 we have a school system that manufactures

2203
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:57,560
 people for a set of skills that are not particularly valuable anymore

2204
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,960
 and we also get them in debt for those skills

2205
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,600
 um when people sid step that

2206
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,560
 and say okay i'm not going to get into university

2207
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,679
 debt i'm just going to go off and actually figure out how the world works

2208
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,000
 there's actually loads of

2209
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 opportunities

2210
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,520
 okay so

2211
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,520
 i guess we've sorted it then all our viewers need to do

2212
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,159
 is go and buy dan's book

2213
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,040
 become an entrepreneur

2214
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:17,920
 and become a millionaire

2215
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:18,719
 it's that easy

2216
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,679
 why w you guys doing it to begin with they're idiots

2217
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:21,520
 the viewers are idiots

2218
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,400
 they should be just being more entrepreneurial

2219
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,360
 it's as simple as that more entrepreneurial

2220
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,440
 start a business listen i come from east london okay my friends

2221
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,840
 can't feed their kids

2222
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,480
 okay

2223
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,199
 and if it was as simple as going out and be an entrepreneur

2224
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:35,880
 i can bet you they would do it

2225
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,280
 i can bet you they would do it let us

2226
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,280
 i'm sick of multi-millionaires

2227
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:40,719
 telling

2228
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:41,159
 kids

2229
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:44,719
 who can't afford to turn the heating on you just need to be more entrepreneurial

2230
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,199
 it's sick dan it's sick

2231
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:47,840
 i this gives people mental illness

2232
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,480
 it gives people mental illness tell them the truth okay we your older generation

2233
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,600
 we took the opportunities

2234
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,920
 and now is almost impossible to out of poverty

2235
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,639
 and don't just don't just stand up and wave

2236
01:13:57,639 --> 01:13:58,360
 you know your millions

2237
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,120
 of pounds in front of them and say if you entrepreneurial

2238
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,880
 like me you could do it you could have it because it's sick because they can't

2239
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,440
 they can't feed their kids down

2240
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,000
 they can't turn the heating on don't tell them to be more entrepreneurial

2241
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,239
 fix the system that drives more and more and more of them into poverty every generation

2242
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:15,440
 i find it very strange

2243
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,719
 that you think it would be easier to fix the entire global economic

2244
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:19,120
 system

2245
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,199
 than to start a business

2246
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:21,360
 and fix your own personal

2247
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,360
 economics

2248
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,440
 the the thing that

2249
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,080
 the thing that i know that gives people mental health issues

2250
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,400
 is feeling that they have no agency in their life that they can't do anything

2251
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,760
 your video where you talk about if you don't have a rich dad you're screwed

2252
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,239
 there's no such thing as meritocracy

2253
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:35,480
 you're never going to be successful

2254
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,120
 to me

2255
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,840
 if i had have come across your content

2256
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,480
 at 19

2257
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,480
 20 years old i would have been screwed

2258
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,880
 i was so i'm so glad

2259
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,239
 that i came across people who said

2260
01:14:45,239 --> 01:14:47,120
 daniel you weren't born into a

2261
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,719
 a rich family you don't have any bank of mom and dad

2262
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:52,880
 but it's cheap and easier than ever to start a business

2263
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,040
 start by working for someone who's got a business then figure out what's your opportunity

2264
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,040
 and there's a way there is a way

2265
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,560
 i've actually worked with a lot of teenagers from poor backgrounds

2266
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,480
 and one of the things we do is we

2267
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,679
 tell them if it's possible for someone else it is possible for you

2268
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:11,800
 um i also worked in rural uganda

2269
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,760
 um with a charity that did work with the poorest of the poor

2270
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,120
 um one of the most incredible things i ever saw was a woman who started

2271
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,120
 out

2272
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,679
 literally picking food out of a trash

2273
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:24,639
 pile

2274
01:15:24,639 --> 01:15:26,800
 um and she was

2275
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,560
 basically

2276
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:27,920
 sh

2277
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,560
 they they shared

2278
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,760
 with her how to start a chicken

2279
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,120
 business

2280
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,600
 which then ended up as a pig business

2281
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,560
 which then ended up as a cattle business

2282
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,320
 and she ended up

2283
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,520
 making

2284
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,960
 hiring 15 16 people in her local community

2285
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,920
 the power of entrepreneurship is that starting with nothing you can

2286
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,920
 actually

2287
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,679
 make improvements

2288
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:49,120
 i'm not saying everyone ends up as a millionaire and i'm not saying everyone ends up

2289
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:49,760
 equal

2290
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,199
 but i'm saying you can make improvements

2291
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:54,080
 in your life and the thing that causes mental health issues

2292
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,320
 is the feeling of having no agency or no control over your circumstances

2293
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,040
 until the world changes the whole economic

2294
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,040
 system

2295
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,639
 i never told people don't work hard i never once said that never once said that

2296
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:08,520
 never said that you said if your dad wasn't rich you'll never be rich

2297
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,120
 which is true in 99.9%

2298
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,440
 of cases i've never told people don't work hard true 99%

2299
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,239
 i've never told people don't work hard okay and listen if you think that ugandans

2300
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,400
 should be more entrepreneurial

2301
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,360
 i've never been to uganda

2302
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,920
 maybe that's the problem out there maybe that's the problem in nigeria

2303
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,679
 maybe that's the problem in india listen

2304
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,960
 i've never said don't work hard

2305
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,360
 okay

2306
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,719
 when i brought my book out last year

2307
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:27,560
 the hardback

2308
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,800
 i was at some event and i come out i was drinking london bridge

2309
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,840
 and i come out late it was like it was like 1:00 a.m.

2310
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,199
 and

2311
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:35,199
 um

2312
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,679
 some guy come up to me when i was unlocking my bike

2313
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:40,400

2314
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,120
 which is the northeast

2315
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,600
 of england it's this quite a poor town there's a lot of workingclass

2316
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,080
 people there

2317
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:45,679
 and

2318
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:51,920
 um he said i've been watching you on youtube and um i love your stuff and

2319
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:52,920
 um

2320
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,320
 this guy started crying this guy start crying on the street right in front of me

2321
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,400
 he's like i work so hard gary i work two jobs

2322
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,239
 um

2323
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:02,360
 my mom's sick

2324
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:06,440
 and i'm trying to help i'm trying to support and and i don't understand why

2325
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,960
 and and i'm sorry that i'm

2326
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:09,960
 crying

2327
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,520
 but nobody ever told me that it wasn't my fault before

2328
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,280
 that's what he said to me okay and listen listen

2329
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,960
 i believe 100%

2330
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,880
 aspiration

2331
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,280
 ambition entrepreneurial

2332
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:20,600
 spirit

2333
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,440
 i would never say

2334
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,280
 see a kid that has that and say turn it off

2335
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:23,840
 okay

2336
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,639
 but the flip side of your if you just work hard enough you can make it

2337
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:29,159
 is if you didn't make it

2338
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:31,560
 it's because you didn't work hard enough and it's your fault

2339
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,920
 and i would like you to sit and think very hard

2340
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,639
 before you send that message to young men and young women in our

2341
01:17:37,639 --> 01:17:41,880
 society meritocracy doesn't mean that everyone

2342
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,159
 ends up with the same result

2343
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:44,480
 what

2344
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,280
 what i'm trying to

2345
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,480
 what here's what i'm trying to achieve

2346
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,239
 i'm trying to achieve

2347
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:48,600
 the people who have ambition

2348
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,560
 who can go for it are incentivized

2349
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,639
 to do it and incentivized

2350
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:53,440
 to build jobs and build companies

2351
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:53,880
 about the ones

2352
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,880
 that just want to work hard and

2353
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,440
 have a good family

2354
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,199
 and take care of them

2355
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:56,960
 and have a home

2356
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,960
 and be able to turn the heating on and be able to

2357
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,880
 financial security they need to work for business don't they they need to work for you

2358
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:02,480
 yeah

2359
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,960
 p they need to work they need to work for a business

2360
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,040
 some business

2361
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,840
 right if someone doesn't create that business then where do they work for

2362
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,880
 we now have by the way we now have 11%

2363
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,480
 of 11% of working age people are now declared too sick to work

2364
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,880
 right we have a huge problem in the uk

2365
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,560
 we also have 25%

2366
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,360
 of people who are working age don't work

2367
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,880
 it's one in seven men don't work work at all do you think they're lazy dan

2368
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,920
 i think the system is collapsing do you think think the system is average british american

2369
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,800
 working is lazy what i think is happening

2370
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,920
 is that the technology

2371
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,639
 companies

2372
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:37,800
 are totally transforming and disrupting everything

2373
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:43,360
 um and what happened is around the post-war era we had good jobs we had

2374
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,880
 um you could work in a local thing what's happening

2375
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,840
 now is that jobs are going to the philippines

2376
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,520
 they're going to

2377
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:55,239
 techn technology does three things it makes jobs more simple which makes them replaceable

2378
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:56,760
 it makes jobs global

2379
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,480
 where you can move them to anywhere else

2380
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,199
 and then ultimately

2381
01:18:59,199 --> 01:18:59,800
 it automates

2382
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,760
 the job al together and gets rid of it

2383
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,199
 through code and software

2384
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:07,480
 and what's really going on in the last especially 5 years since the pandemic

2385
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,719
 is technology

2386
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,159
 has decimated the existing systems

2387
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:15,960
 that we all relied upon when we grew up and when i say the

2388
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,520
 education system isn't really working

2389
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,760
 it's still pretending

2390
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,280
 that there are office jobs available

2391
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:25,400
 for people when they graduate and it's still pretending that there's like 1950

2392
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,000
 scenarios available

2393
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,120
 when actually

2394
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,360
 my kids are going to be disrupted by ai

2395
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,880
 everyone's kids are going to be disrupted by ai

2396
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:33,120
 um

2397
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:33,440
 you know

2398
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,360
 these sorts of things are the are the things that really

2399
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:35,600
 we

2400
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,199
 we also need to be talking

2401
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:38,199
 about

2402
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:41,120
 to all the founders and small business owners listening

2403
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,679
 i think you need to hear this it's an update from my sponsor fiverr

 talent

2431
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,159
 i i want to take this back to a point you were talking about earlier

2432
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:45,880
 which is about personal

2433
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,639
 agency

2434
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:50,840
 because i would like you daniel to give the counter to your own argument

2435
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:54,199
 because i want to make sure when we're talking about solutions to this problem

2436
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:55,840
 start a business

2437
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,000
 be

2438
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
 entrepreneurial

2439
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,360
 you can also understand how that might

2440
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,159
 that works for people with our brains

2441
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:06,520
 and our mindset and whatever we had that made us do that our risk appetite

2442
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,480
 our trauma whatever it might be

2443
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,440
 but not everybody

2444
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,159
 is wide in such a way

2445
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,400
 so that's not necessarily the best solution for

2446
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,840
 and also we sit here with a bit of hindsight bias where we we were lucky

2447
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,320
 and it worked out for us but when you look at the stats around businesses succeeding

2448
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,520
 what you know the stat it's like 90% of businesses fail

2449
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,320
 so most of them are failing

2450
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,480
 the ones that emerge from that people like me

2451
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:27,880
 then

2452
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,679
 we have a bias where we go well it work for us you do it too

2453
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:33,199
 i don't come from money so i have the same bias like i watched

2454
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,120
 well i've i've built

2455
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,480
 i've built from scratch several times because i got disrupted

2456
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,639
 several times so i've had to start with nothing several times and build

2457
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:40,760
 but you started

2458
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,639
 type of person right and when we say start from nothing

2459
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,639
 you actually started with a wealth of information

2460
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,080
 and the whole game in building building

2461
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:47,520
 capital

2462
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:47,960
 intellectual

2463
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,400
 capital having been through it before being around that mentor that gave you the information

2464
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,000
 also having access to a great market

2465
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,400
 like having

2466
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:53,639
 access

2467
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:54,080
 to a free

2468
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:54,360
 market

2469
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,199
 is is a big thing

2470
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:56,120
 i was born in australia

2471
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,000
 and i moved to london at the peak of london's

2472
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,120
 economic freedom so this can't be broadly applicable

2473
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,120
 advice

2474
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,280
 can it

2475
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,360
 well i think personal agency is broadly applicable

2476
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:06,960
 the idea

2477
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,199
 i got this friend of mine

2478
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:08,600
 who

2479
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,239
 woke up one day he went out clubbing

2480
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:11,520
 went out to a nightclub

2481
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,040
 felt sick collapsed

2482
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,080
 woke up and they had chopped off all four limbs right so

2483
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:16,840
 he

2484
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,920
 had quadruple ampute

2485
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:22,040
 um he was 19 years old so he wakes up in bed and he basically

2486
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:22,520
 says

2487
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,280
 i'm a quadruple

2488
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:23,760
 ampute

2489
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,960
 i was i was fine

2490
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,960
 48 hours ago and now i'm a qu quadruple amputee

2491
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,159
 and he decides to make this decision in the in the hospital room

2492
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:33,840
 um that this is going to be the best thing that ever happened to him

2493
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,000
 and he makes that decision right even that is a consequence

2494
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
 of

2495
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,639
 his him and his wiring

2496
01:22:39,639 --> 01:22:40,400
 what i'm trying to

2497
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:40,760
 understand

2498
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,080
 but he ended up he ended up starting

2499
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:42,560
 a clinic

2500
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,400
 and it's a multi-million

2501
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,199
 dollar clinic

2502
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:45,880
 i mean it's incredible what

2503
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:46,800
 can do

2504
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,400
 the rule

2505
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,560
 it's incredible what people

2506
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,280
 but you only need a few people to succeed

2507
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,960
 and the whole economy starts to

2508
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,679
 improve

2509
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:54,600
 we we actually in this uk

2510
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,920
 we only at the peak of our entrepreneurial

2511
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:02,520
 like blitzing it where we're doing so well there was only 40,000 scale ups 40,000

2512
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,239
 companies were creating jobs growth higher wages

2513
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:09,199
 um investment into the company into the country

2514
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:10,600
 you know it's only

2515
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,120
 1%

2516
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,600
 of people who pay 30%

2517
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,360
 of the taxes

2518
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,040
 and 10% of people who pay 60%

2519
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,639
 of the taxes so you only need

2520
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,080
 one in a 100

2521
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:22,000
 to actually create something that's valuable and you get an extra 30% of taxes

2522
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:22,800
 but so

2523
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,679
 so that again is

2524
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:24,639
 we need this one that

2525
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:27,560
 advice for the what the people that end up getting into that 1%

2526
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,280
 but who does everyone else work for

2527
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,880
 like all jobs growth comes from entrepreneurs so what are you saying to those the 199%

2528
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,560
 there are you saying go get a job

2529
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,280
 well you you need wealth creators in the economy

2530
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,440
 who are building something like you take

2531
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,440
 um

2532
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,560
 gym shark

2533
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,840
 people who work at gym shark they're super glad that this guy started the company

2534
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,080
 they're really happy that there's a company

2535
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:52,000
 otherwise where would they go what would they work where would they work

2536
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,440
 so if ben decides that he doesn't want to start that company in the uk

2537
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,040
 um or if he gets to 10 million and stops

2538
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:04,000
 then all of those additional jobs are are toast they're all gone so you encouraging

2539
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,040
 the entrepreneurial

2540
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,800
 you're not encouraging everyone to become an entrepreneur

2541
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,080
 you're saying those that have those

2542
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,800
 that bias or that i'm saying we need a system

2543
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,639
 that encourages

2544
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:15,560
 the people who can to do

2545
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,280
 um and what about everybody else

2546
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,880
 well every the flow on effect

2547
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,760
 is that that creates

2548
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:20,199
 jobs

2549
01:24:20,199 --> 01:24:22,400
 that creates wealth in the economy

2550
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,120
 um and free markets lift everybody up

2551
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,600
 um free markets just means that everyone's trading with everyone

2552
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:28,920
 um

2553
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,760
 you know it starts

2554
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,400
 to like the whole thing i mean it's

2555
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,719
 it's just a tail as oldest

2556
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:33,840
 time as soon as economies

2557
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:34,360
 are free

2558
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,840
 and there are entrepreneurs

2559
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,600
 starting things and growing things everyone's life improves everyone life get better

2560
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:45,040
 um and what's your what part of that do you disagree with gary

2561
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,080
 i think it's it doesn't work

2562
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,080
 it doesn't work the only period listen the last 70 years are not normal stephen

2563
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,600
 the last 70 years are not normal

2564
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,440
 the last 70 years in europe and the us

2565
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,040
 where ordinary

2566
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,080
 people like my dad

2567
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,360
 could work for the post office

2568
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,560
 on less than average wage

2569
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,560
 and buy a house and support family it's not normal

2570
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,400
 it's not normal

2571
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,000
 in the world and it's not normal in history

2572
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,800
 most countries in the world do not like that

2573
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,360
 most countries have a a small super rich elite

2574
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,080
 and a very large group of extremely poor people that's most of the country

2575
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,159
 and it's most of

2576
01:25:13,159 --> 01:25:15,960
 history in this country and it's most of history in the us

2577
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,199
 you know

2578
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:20,000
 yeah we talk about charles dickens i read hard times

2579
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,080
 i read hard times and this is written in the 19th

2580
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:22,520
 century

2581
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,960
 when britain was like the industrial

2582
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,440
 super

2583
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,440
 of the whole world

2584
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,600
 and at the time

2585
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,199
 the government was talking about should we tax these industrialists

2586
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:33,119
 and the industrialists were saying if you tax us we'll throw our factories into the sea

2587
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:36,080
 and it just reminds me you know

2588
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,960
 the only time we've ever really been able to provide

2589
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:39,840
 decent living

2590
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,679
 conditions for ordinary working people

2591
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,400
 was the period after the war where we massively redistributed

2592
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,320
 wealth and and now we're losing

2593
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:46,800
 that

2594
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,159
 that holding of wealth

2595
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:49,760
 in of the middle class can you acknowledge

2596
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,760
 though that that was a completely different time

2597
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,840
 as it relates to being able to it was a different time but you

2598
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,159
 i could you know of techy nigeria today brazil today

2599
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:02,320
 the uk 300 years ago france 200 years ago there is only one specific

2600
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:02,880
 time

2601
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,440
 that we have ever successfully

2602
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,159
 provided

2603
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:09,480
 broad living standards for ordinary people and it was a period of time we protected

2604
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,280
 a broadly

2605
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,760
 equal wealth distribution

2606
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,400
 and tax the rich at very high rates and you can acknowledge that that's

2607
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,320
 extremely hard to do because the nature of the economy 100%

2608
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,320
 100

2609
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,639
 that's the reason why all of our grandparents and our great-grandparents

2610
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:24,320
 and our great great grandparents lived in poverty and that's why i know

2611
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,400
 i'm probably going to lose

2612
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,400
 and that's why i bet

2613
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,000
 on the economy

2614
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,520
 getting worse

2615
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,199
 and that's why i know poverty is going to increase

2616
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:30,639
 because it was extremely

2617
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:32,360
 difficult to get the unusually

2618
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,119
 fair share for ordinary working people and i know we're losing the argument

2619
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:37,119
 and i know that farage

2620
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:38,199
 will win and i know that trump

2621
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:38,600
 will win

2622
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,040
 and i know

2623
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:39,320
 that

2624
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,400
 and i know that things will get

2625
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:40,679
 worse

2626
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:41,880
 i don't think i'm going to win

2627
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,440
 so if you if you know you're

2628
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,440
 promoting

2629
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,880
 a a strategy

2630
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:49,800
 that is not going to work and it sounds like you think is incredibly

2631
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:55,679
 almost impossible then why would you not be more practical in your solution stephen

2632
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,239
 if it was impossible i wouldn't be here

2633
01:26:58,239 --> 01:26:58,960
 think it's possible

2634
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,360
 of course it's possible of course it's possible but you believe you're not going to win

2635
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,639
 i'm a betting man steve

2636
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:06,560
 i'm a betting man i put my bets on you know i am

2637
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,880
 if i get okay look okay so my youtube channel is growing really really quickly

2638
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:10,679
 and you know i'm obviously

2639
01:27:10,679 --> 01:27:11,760
 like starting a bit of a movement

2640
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,600
 and there's a lot of political

2641
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,280
 support and if it keeps growing we'll get more political

2642
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:14,840
 support

2643
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,960
 at the end of the day

2644
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,600
 i'm trying to tax the richest and most powerful people in the world

2645
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,560
 and most of these people

2646
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,440
 will come out and attack

2647
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,400
 me and they'll try and stop

2648
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:22,719
 me

2649
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:23,239
 and

2650
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:24,320
 i do not have

2651
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,760
 billions of pounds hundreds of millions of pounds to use to support my youtube channel

2652
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,600
 i'm counting

2653
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,280
 on ordinary people like your viewers to support and share my message

2654
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,199
 now listen

2655
01:27:32,199 --> 01:27:33,320
 for most of history

2656
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,199
 that has not worked and for most of history

2657
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:37,080
 ordinary families live in poverty

2658
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,480
 i don't think it's impossible

2659
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,360
 that we ordinary people can win and get a fair share

2660
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,480
 but i think it's worth fighting for steve so i fight for it anyway

2661
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,800
 he's he's right that for most of history you've had the super elite

2662
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:53,440
 and then everyone else is down here and it's massive wealth inequality is almost the normal

2663
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:57,040
 for the last five thousand years and almost everywhere

2664
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,080
 you've got kings queens dukes

2665
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,159
 and peasants and surfs down there

2666
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:03,639
 there have been economic

2667
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:05,480
 situations that have been different

2668
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,760
 dubai is a really strange situation

2669
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,719
 it's a desert it's in inhospitable

2670
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:10,679
 to live in

2671
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:11,440
 it's the last

2672
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,719
 place in the world most people would think or choose that they would want to be

2673
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,199
 and yet it's one of the most economically

2674
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:18,080
 rich places in the world right now

2675
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:22,199
 they actually didn't start with oil wealth they were able to borrow money to build dubai

2676
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:23,560
 but the low tax environment

2677
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,639
 has now attracted raed some of the world's most talented

2678
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:26,960
 people to go and build technology

2679
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:27,440
 companies

2680
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:27,920
 there

2681
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,719
 and if you i don't know have you been there recently

2682
01:28:29,719 --> 01:28:30,560
 i've been to dubai

2683
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,600
 few years ag now but i've been so at the moment

2684
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,639
 it is the most

2685
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:34,159
 thriving

2686
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:34,880
 entrepreneurial

2687
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:39,679
 community on earth outside of the us but probably even rivaling the us

2688
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,880
 that there are investors there's entrepreneurs

2689
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,320
 and the wealth is going through the roof

2690
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,880
 um i've got two friends who are personal trainers fitness trainers

2691
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,800
 one fitness trainer has decided to stop working

2692
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:55,000
 more hours because he's hit 50 grand a year and he now gets taxed at 40%

2693
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,920
 so he's basically decided he's going to earn right up to 50,000 and then stop working

2694
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,159
 and then the other fitness trainer went to dubai

2695
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:04,639
 launched an online fitness

2696
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:09,040
 community and has just bought a $350,000 ferrari

2697
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,719
 and one entrepreneur

2698
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:15,040
 is super pumped and super excited about building a business because he's not over taxed

2699
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:15,800
 the other entrepreneur

2700
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,880
 has literally said

2701
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:17,320
 i'm not

2702
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:17,600
 willing

2703
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,199
 to do this

2704
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:19,199
 because of how much i have to pay

2705
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:19,760
 just want to be clear

2706
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,159
 i've always

2707
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:20,520
 campaigned

2708
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,600
 for lower taxes on rich

2709
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,719
 on working people

2710
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:24,199
 always always so but here's

2711
01:29:24,199 --> 01:29:26,040
 but here's the thing right if i was ask you

2712
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:26,840
 you've just become

2713
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:27,880
 one of the best selling authors

2714
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,159
 in the country

2715
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:31,040
 if your publisher came to you

2716
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,639
 and said because you're in the top 1% of our authors

2717
01:29:33,639 --> 01:29:35,719
 we're going to harve your royalties

2718
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:37,440
 if you sign a second book with us

2719
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,280
 you wouldn't sign a second book with them you go to another publisher

2720
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,000
 who says we'll pay you more royalties

2721
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,960
 because you're so successful i would have written this book for free then

2722
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,600
 i would have written

2723
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,560
 this book for free in fact the first time i got off of a

2724
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,560
 deal

2725
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,800
 i said i said don't pay me an advance then give you royalties away

2726
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,480
 why

2727
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,639
 well because if

2728
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:55,920
 what i'm saying all right fine i'll give my royalties away

2729
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,440
 i'll shut my youtube channel

2730
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,440
 down

2731
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,400
 i'm saying we respond to incentives

2732
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,520
 that if your publisher

2733
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,159
 if penguin

2734
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:02,960
 came to you

2735
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,199
 and said book number two you get half royalties

2736
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:07,119
 because you're in the top 1%

2737
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:10,320
 would you sign with penguin or would you go someone el from a 2 million

2738
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,280
 job a year

2739
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,719
 to run a youtube channel

2740
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,880
 do you think i do the work that i do for money

2741
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,480
 i'm not talking about that you do it for money

2742
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,040
 i'm just saying

2743
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,199
 if you had the option to

2744
01:30:18,199 --> 01:30:18,560
 sign

2745
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:18,880
 between

2746
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:19,199
 two

2747
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:19,719
 publishing

2748
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:20,639
 contracts

2749
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,360
 right and all things being equal

2750
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,679
 one's going to penalize you for being in the to 1%

2751
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:27,239
 and the other one's going to reward you for being in the top 1%

2752
01:30:27,239 --> 01:30:29,760
 would you you of course you would go with the normal

2753
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,679
 like if all things being equal you want to write a second book anyway

2754
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:34,239
 it's the same for entrepreneurs

2755
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:36,119
 when entrepreneurs start companies

2756
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:38,639
 we can either start them in high tax economies

2757
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,639
 or with a stroke of a pen start them in low tax

2758
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:43,800
 i think the rich world is going to have to start rethinking

2759
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,880
 the fact that it allows

2760
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,600
 people to very very wealthy people to own

2761
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,639
 enormous amounts of their physical wealth

2762
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,560
 go live overseas and not pay tax i think that has to be revisited

2763
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:54,320
 for sure

2764
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:54,840
 because

2765
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,080
 what you're saying is

2766
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:56,840
 i want the benefit

2767
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,440
 of being able to sell to the us market

2768
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,520
 and the uk market

2769
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,400
 but i don't want the obligation

2770
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,960
 of having to pay us and uk taxes

2771
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:02,760
 and you are correct

2772
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:03,639
 that at the moment

2773
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:06,040
 the us and uk governments allow that and i think that's

2774
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,920
 us taxes you on worldwide income

2775
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,440
 well only a small amount right so i think that realistically

2776
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,719
 i think that the us and uk governments have to stop that but

2777
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:18,159
 the way i see it the us and uk governments and increasing a lot of global

2778
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:19,159
 governments

2779
01:31:19,159 --> 01:31:20,880
 are kind of being bought up by the elites

2780
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,239
 and

2781
01:31:21,239 --> 01:31:22,920
 you know we have elo musk is basically

2782
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:23,480
 the president

2783
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,880
 right and we had richy sunak who father

2784
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,520
 was one of the richest men in the world like if you're richy sunak

2785
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,679
 who for our american viewers was our prime minister until very recently

2786
01:31:30,679 --> 01:31:32,639
 his father is one of the richest men in the world

2787
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:33,960
 he's got 700 million

2788
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,960
 personal wealth he's going to be making 3040 million pound passive income

2789
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,880
 and you're getting paid 130

2790
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,480
 grand de to be prime minister

2791
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:46,320
 when you're making policy do you think maybe i'll ask my father-in-law at once

2792
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,600
 you know the fact is what you're seeing here is if you allow the rich

2793
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,600
 i'm i'm never ever against entrepreneurship

2794
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,000
 i'm not against people getting rich

2795
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,880
 if you allow the rich to get richer and richer and richer

2796
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:56,560
 they squeeze

2797
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,760
 the middle class and they squeeze the poor class out of things like housing

2798
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,119
 of things like space in cities

2799
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:02,080
 of things like energy

2800
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,719
 and of things like owning

2801
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:09,400
 a sharing government and media do you acknowledge that countries that adopt a anti-ri

2802
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,199
 big government approach tend to collapse

2803
01:32:12,199 --> 01:32:14,440
 what like like this country in the

2804
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,440
 60s

2805
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:18,679
 we needed a us bailout we needed an imf bailout in 1976

2806
01:32:18,679 --> 01:32:21,280
 but the us did the same thing the us had even higher taxes than us

2807
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:21,600
 we

2808
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,159
 we

2809
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:22,679
 basically

2810
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:23,920
 like you take

2811
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,000
 you take all the countries

2812
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,400
 that where the government becomes big they meddle with your life they're involved in every decision

2813
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,360
 right half the economy

2814
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:31,320
 i mean here's one other the things

2815
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:31,679
 this period

2816
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:32,040
 is known

2817
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:32,560
 as the golden

2818
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,880
 age of capitalism

2819
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,880
 it's the period of time when

2820
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,800
 which period thisi 50 years off the second world war

2821
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,199
 oh it's the golden age of middle class to be middle class

2822
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:44,600
 you don't care about the middle class no no of course i do

2823
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,440
 the the but the 70

2824
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,239
 years after the world war ii

2825
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:48,639
 yeah

2826
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:49,360
 where the government

2827
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:49,719
 sold

2828
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:51,400
 off all of its houses to middle class

2829
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:51,719
 people

2830
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:52,600
 so we got housing

2831
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:53,040
 wealth

2832
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:53,840
 but you can only

2833
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,400
 do that trick once

2834
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:55,679
 right

2835
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:56,520
 so you can only sell

2836
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,159
 off all the houses

2837
01:32:57,159 --> 01:32:57,600
 to everyone

2838
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:57,840
 once

2839
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:58,960
 which is why all the baby boomers

2840
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,800
 own them well

2841
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,800
 the

2842
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,280
 living s is collapsed

2843
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,880
 after the houses were sold there was a long period where the houses weren't sold

2844
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,800
 between the second world war and the 80s

2845
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,040
 pinpo living standards collapsing

2846
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,760
 well i think there's a few obviously

2847
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:11,440
 big moments

2848
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:11,880
 i think

2849
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:12,199
 2008

2850
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:14,000
 is a big moment i think co is a big moment

2851
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,080
 i think it's the 80s

2852
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:16,560
 where you start to see the wealth distribution

2853
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,119
 go

2854
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:19,199
 what matters is actually the distribution itself

2855
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,199
 so once you change the tax system

2856
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:24,480
 it takes a bit of time for the wealth distribution to change

2857
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,280
 but once you start

2858
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,320
 for me the big thing is is the loss of wealth holding

2859
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,320
 i want ordinary

2860
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,040
 families to be able to hold wealth

2861
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,199
 and once you lose that

2862
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,920
 you lose a middle class and you will not find me a single

2863
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:34,400
 country

2864
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,920
 in in the world now or the history of the world

2865
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,040
 that has provided

2866
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,520
 good broad living standards

2867
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,760
 without allowing ordinary families to own assets

2868
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,280
 yeah i agree and take singapore for example

2869
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,800
 where everyone's encouraged to own properties they've got an amazing system in singapore

2870
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:53,119
 they've taken this a massive government by the way enormous government 25% of gdp

2871
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:54,000
 they they

2872
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,159
 own they own the houses they have a weal f they own all the houses

2873
01:33:57,159 --> 01:33:58,840
 they don't own all the houses they have a

2874
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,360
 a sovereign wealth fund that circulates

2875
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:03,280
 houses through they've they own the hous they' solved they've solved

2876
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:07,639
 singapore owns the house they own the singapore government owns an enormous share of the houses

2877
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:11,760
 so do you think we should own pension pension funds people

2878
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,719
 they force not force their citizens but they

2879
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:16,679
 direct their citizens into home ownership

2880
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:19,800
 you don't think singapore and government owns a large sh i just know that the singaporean

2881
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,000
 government's only 25%

2882
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
 of the economy

2883
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
 but big sh of the housing stock 75

2884
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,600
 the economy is i would like to say by the way just to be really clear

2885
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,520
 i've never ever once advocated for big government

2886
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,480
 never a single time

2887
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:34,040
 big government i want higher taxes on the wealth orders

2888
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,560
 so we can tax wealth creators

2889
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:36,960
 and working people less

2890
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,080
 i don't want to big a government i want our viewers to have more money

2891
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,320
 i want our viewers to have more money and also

2892
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:45,960
 i want to tax those super rich so that they stop squeezing

2893
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:46,400
 ordinary

2894
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,760
 families out of asset ownership

2895
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,400
 it just

2896
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,000
 yeah it see it it seems like an obvious solution

2897
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:51,920
 it seems like

2898
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:52,520
 yeah

2899
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,760
 it's good solution

2900
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,119
 it seems like

2901
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:57,520
 like hey who's got the money rich people

2902
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,440
 not the money the assets

2903
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,639
 the asset who's got the assets

2904
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:00,199
 rich people

2905
01:35:00,199 --> 01:35:01,560
 then let's just take them off them

2906
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,080
 and

2907
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,199
 no no no i don't want i don't want to redistribute

2908
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:07,400
 i'm i'm i am the only person in this table anti- redistribution

2909
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,280
 because the redistribution

2910
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,000
 is happening in front of our eyes

2911
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,800
 the middle class is losing its assets

2912
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,280
 government is losing its assets

2913
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:17,239
 those assets are being accumulated by the rich i want to stop the redistribution

2914
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:18,040
 please

2915
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,600
 please i'm i am the most anti- rist

2916
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:24,000
 redistribution person in this game we need to stop the redistribu

2917
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,360
 of wealth away from ordinary british and american families so

2918
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,679
 the difference is for me it's very simple

2919
01:35:30,679 --> 01:35:33,600
 which is i really truly believe that free markets

2920
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,000
 and low governments

2921
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
 and less taxes

2922
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,320
 creates more wealth in the middle and freedom for the heron is death for the fishes

2923
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,480
 if we have complete freedom multi-millionaires

2924
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,440
 like you and me will get richer and richer and richer every year

2925
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,800
 and we will squeeze out and we will eat the middle class

2926
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:52,840
 ask you though if wealth inequality could be solved but everyone does worse

2927
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:53,920
 is that a good solu

2928
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:54,360
 obviously

2929
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:54,840
 not

2930
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,719
 the whole reason i do this because i don't want ordinary

2931
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:57,280
 people toap

2932
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:57,880
 into public

2933
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:59,880
 this is about people being able to feed their kids

2934
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:00,800
 so wealth inequality

2935
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,960
 is not the problem

2936
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:05,199
 it's collapsing living stand that's quite contorted

2937
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:09,239
 i mean quite contorted logic the problem isaps

2938
01:36:09,239 --> 01:36:12,119
 living standards i am somebody who has made millions of pounds

2939
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:16,520
 by understanding the simple fact that living standards are falling because of growing wealth ine equality

2940
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:19,159
 so living standards if they were to increase

2941
01:36:19,159 --> 01:36:22,960
 but they were super rich yeah is that a problem

2942
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,000
 i think you do need to be worried about

2943
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,719
 us

2944
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:28,000
 extremely wealthy elites

2945
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,760
 yeah i think what's interesting you look at the the founding of the united states

2946
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,480
 these guys the founding of the united states conceptually

2947
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,360
 is really based on these ideas of distribution of power

2948
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,440
 that's why you have the president

2949
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:39,560
 and the house and the senate

2950
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,440
 and you have this independent

2951
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,159
 judiciary

2952
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:44,159
 they're like we cannot allow power to become concentrated

2953
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:47,040
 because they came from a europe which had extremely

2954
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:47,679
 concentrated

2955
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:51,000
 power and extremely wealthy elites and extremely broad poverty

2956
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,280
 so i think that allowing a small group of society to increasingly

2957
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,199
 monopolize

2958
01:36:56,199 --> 01:37:00,480
 power and wealth over time is obviously something we should be worried about but primarily

2959
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,280
 the reason i worry about wealth inequality

2960
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,400
 is because i see

2961
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,080
 and i bet on and i make money on

2962
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,639
 the fact that it causes

2963
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:07,280
 living standards

2964
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:07,840
 to fall

2965
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,239
 by the way i i actually really agree with you and the founding

2966
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:10,560
 fathers

2967
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,400
 of the us

2968
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:12,480
 they did

2969
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,320
 um especially around the 1900s

2970
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,600
 they did want to break up monopolies

2971
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,560
 and break up monopolies

2972
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,040
 was one of the big things that

2973
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,960
 um they did trust busting

2974
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,080
 where they broke up standard

2975
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:24,119
 oil and all of those sorts of things one thing i do really really

2976
01:37:24,119 --> 01:37:25,639
 see happening at the moment

2977
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:29,520
 is that we have a stupid outdated definition of monopolies

2978
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:35,080
 where we use monopolies the same way they used it when they had the oil

2979
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,320
 companies that owned all the oil

2980
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:40,960
 in the technology world a monopoly is formed through an ecosystem

2981
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,119
 so amazon for example owning aws

2982
01:37:44,119 --> 01:37:48,320
 and audible and this and this and this and whole foods

2983
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,480
 it creates

2984
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:52,400
 a a fortress that's almost impossible to

2985
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,480
 um to compete with and google owning youtube

2986
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:59,679
 and gmail and all of this they create these fortresses through ecosystems

2987
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:02,280
 one of the things that i do think we need to look at

2988
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,280
 is

2989
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:03,800
 compulsory

2990
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,159
 breakup of big tech once you hit a certain time

2991
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:06,599
 because

2992
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:07,239
 it's very

2993
01:38:07,239 --> 01:38:07,719
 difficult

2994
01:38:07,719 --> 01:38:08,159
 because

2995
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,040
 do you know

2996
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:09,880
 billionaires

2997
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,239
 have two big fears

2998
01:38:11,239 --> 01:38:13,960
 right keep them up at night having nightmares

2999
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:15,480
 number two is high taxes

3000
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,960
 number one is that startup entrepreneur who disrupts their business

3001
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,480
 and they want to kill that early

3002
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:23,679
 you know steve jobs at 24 years old disrupted

3003
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:24,679
 ibm

3004
01:38:24,679 --> 01:38:31,840
 um and jeff bezos disrupted walmart so they are terrified of entrepreneurs in the middle

3005
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,239
 um and they want to create government regulations

3006
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,480
 to say hey you know what let's cap entrepreneurs

3007
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,320
 at 10 million

3008
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,560
 you can get to 10 million

3009
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,760
 it's okay for us we're way past that point

3010
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,239
 but gary's our guy because he's going to cap everyone

3011
01:38:43,239 --> 01:38:45,440
 i never said cap anyone at 10 million by the way

3012
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,880
 what do you think will happen people stop

3013
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,199
 as soon as you have wealth taxes

3014
01:38:48,199 --> 01:38:49,880
 people just give up they just don't want

3015
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:50,599
 telling me our viewers

3016
01:38:50,599 --> 01:38:51,400
 if if they said

3017
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,560
 if they knew they could build

3018
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,920
 a 20 30 million

3019
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,960
 ss ridiculous they knew they would have to pay 20

3020
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:58,639
 if you if you're if you're worth 30 million 1%

3021
01:38:58,639 --> 01:38:59,000
 above

3022
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,280
 is

3023
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,480
 200 grand a year so if i said

3024
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,320
 if you you can have a 30

3025
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,360
 million pound company

3026
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:03,119
 tr

3027
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:04,199
 just bear in mind

3028
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:05,440
 right you make 5%

3029
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,480
 a year on your wealth

3030
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,320
 right so if you got 300

3031
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,119
 million pound company

3032
01:39:08,119 --> 01:39:10,040
 you're going to be making 15 million pound a year

3033
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:10,599
 and i'm turning

3034
01:39:10,599 --> 01:39:12,400
 to you and i'm going to say you know you've got to pay

3035
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:12,800
 200 grand

3036
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,440
 a year on your 50

3037
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:13,679
 million

3038
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:14,119
 pound revenue

3039
01:39:14,119 --> 01:39:15,679
 and they're going to say you know what

3040
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:16,639
 i'm not going to start a business

3041
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,040
 i don't want to be worth 30 million quid

3042
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:18,719
 this is

3043
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,000
 you know this is ridiculous

3044
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
 you know nobody

3045
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
 is going to say

3046
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,400
 oh my god i don't want to be multi multimillionaire

3047
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:29,119
 because in 20 years time i'll have to pay 1% taxes but most traders

3048
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:33,719
 most traders are earning what most people earn in lifetime traders can earn in a year

3049
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:35,960
 most traders don't stop

3050
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:39,480
 talk about that a lot in my book right so most traders just keep going entrepreneurs

3051
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,639
 are the same

3052
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:45,639
 that they're motivated to keep going but when you have wealth advisors and investors

3053
01:39:45,639 --> 01:39:50,080
 saying do not build a company in the uk because they're anti- wealth

3054
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:50,800
 l

3055
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,920
 i'm not trying to make the uk

3056
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:52,239
 anti-

3057
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:53,480
 wealth i'm not trying to make the uk

3058
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,440
 and anti wealth

3059
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,239
 i think

3060
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:59,639
 the uk and the us need to be looking at a situation where you cannot allow

3061
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:03,679
 people who own enormous businesses that sell to your country

3062
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:04,560
 to live in dubai

3063
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,280
 to live in the cayman islands and not pay tax

3064
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,599
 and i i don't think that's a controversial

3065
01:40:07,599 --> 01:40:08,239
 position

3066
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:11,639
 i've got a question for both of you which is if you are a young person

3067
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:13,280
 and you're 18 years old now

3068
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:16,280
 and that you're listening to this but your objective really is an individualistic

3069
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,280
 one you want to get rich

3070
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,119
 and you have a great future

3071
01:40:18,119 --> 01:40:19,080
 for you and your family

3072
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,360
 like all all of us have been able to do

3073
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:25,679
 what would your advice be to them gary at this moment in time

3074
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:26,880
 this is such a hard

3075
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:27,280
 question

3076
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,599
 i know dan's angry at me for

3077
01:40:28,599 --> 01:40:30,400
 what i put in my video how to get rich

3078
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:30,880
 um

3079
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,280
 somebody

3080
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,040
 came around to my house and asked me this other day obviously

3081
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:33,440
 i get asked

3082
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,280
 it a lot

3083
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,280
 because

3084
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,000
 stupidly i'm very public about the fact that i'm rich

3085
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,920
 um

3086
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,560
 what i did is not replicable

3087
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,880
 what i did is not replicable

3088
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:42,520
 it's not

3089
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:43,119
 i'm sorry

3090
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:45,800
 i'm sorry but it's not people always say why don't you teach me to trade

3091
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,080
 like it's hard

3092
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:48,480
 it's hard trading and it's dangerous

3093
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,199
 and i think a lot of young men are getting sort of sold into trading

3094
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:52,719
 and becoming gambling addicts

3095
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,280
 um

3096
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:58,480
 you know work hard and i would i wouldn't even say don't become an entrepr

3097
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,599
 i've never ever said these things work hard

3098
01:41:00,599 --> 01:41:03,599
 you know if you think that you have an opportunity in tech entrepreneurship

3099
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:05,400
 go for it understand it's risky

3100
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,480
 i think that sometimes this message just become an entrepreneur

3101
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,760
 and you make it is a bit dangerous

3102
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:09,480
 because i think

3103
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,000
 most people who try to become entrepreneurs

3104
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:11,639
 fail

3105
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:13,159
 and i think it's super super dangerous

3106
01:41:13,159 --> 01:41:17,320
 the reality is and you know maybe d like this maybe you won't like this

3107
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,679
 i think it is very very difficult for a young man or a young woman

3108
01:41:20,679 --> 01:41:22,440
 from a poor family

3109
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,599
 to become

3110
01:41:23,599 --> 01:41:24,320
 rich

3111
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:28,679
 and i think it's increasingly hard even to just get those basics of financial security

3112
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:29,679
 so

3113
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:33,480
 listen obviously reduce your spending if you can don't buy into this like balenciaga

3114
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:36,000
 stay away from that

3115
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
 but

3116
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,679
 work hard study hard try to get a good job but also understand

3117
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:43,520
 we are shrinking the seats on the lifeboat that's what we're doing

3118
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,560
 we used to allow

3119
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,080
 50%

3120
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:46,920
 to be secure then it's 40%

3121
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:47,760
 then it's 30%

3122
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,400
 then it's 20% you know you got family in nigeria

3123
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,000
 if a young person from

3124
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,400
 like shanty town in nigeria

3125
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,800
 i came to you and said stephen what could i do to get

3126
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:56,800
 rich

3127
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,000
 you would have to say to him realistically listen

3128
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,040
 you are in a difficult situation here

3129
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,719
 you need to work really really hard but if you are able to make enough money

3130
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,280
 to to support a family

3131
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,719
 be proud of yourself

3132
01:42:07,719 --> 01:42:10,199
 what i would actually say to them so yeah i have got family in nigeria

3133
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:13,520
 um for people that don't know i'm by blood half nigerian

3134
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:18,400
 i would say to them that knowledge is really your life raft

3135
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:18,719
 so

3136
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:19,480
 obviously there's a

3137
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:20,960
 big tech boom happening in nigeria

3138
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:21,599
 which is liberating

3139
01:42:21,599 --> 01:42:22,920
 a lot of people from that situation

3140
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,400
 so i would try and tell them to

3141
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:29,000
 get on the life raft that is like knowledge of this new revolution

3142
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,560
 so from nigeria you can learn to code and then

3143
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,800
 the the great thing now is that we're we literally

3144
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,360
 have actually this is quite interesting

3145
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,400
 we're building a tech company in san francisco

3146
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,760
 called flight cast it's live everyone can go look at at flight.com

3147
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,440
 and

3148
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:42,920
 the lead developer oh and guest radar

3149
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:46,920
 the lead developer of guest radar is a nigerian guy but how many of those

3150
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:48,960
 jobs in the nigerian tech sector

3151
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,199
 are going to kids that grew up in the shanty towns i have no idea

3152
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:54,880
 cuz i worked in

3153
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:55,320
 people

3154
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,760
 ask me tell me how to do what you did all right i worked in canary

3155
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,159
 warf it's in east london

3156
01:42:59,159 --> 01:43:01,960
 i could see the building from my house going up

3157
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,440
 there was not a single

3158
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,480
 other kid from east london

3159
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:07,320
 the whole time i was there

3160
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:12,320
 do you know to dan's point about this remote work revolution where like work now has

3161
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:16,159
 you can work from anywhere and in our company third web san francisco

3162
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:17,400
 me some of the

3163
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,119
 stuff that we now have are in the philippines

3164
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:20,719
 because they just have like great creatives

3165
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:22,119
 there it's obviously more cost

3166
01:43:22,119 --> 01:43:23,119
 effective

3167
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:27,199
 isn't this a huge part of what's going on in our economy this this digitalization

3168
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,520
 and this

3169
01:43:34,119 --> 01:43:39,239
 remotify b your workers in the philippines very very well

3170
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:40,239
 um

3171
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:42,280
 most of these people

3172
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,040
 they used to have

3173
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,440
 a half decent wage on office

3174
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:50,719
 and now they're locked in their bedrooms barely paying the bills yeah um in the philippines

3175
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,840
 not in the philippines the philippine guys are balling out control

3176
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,159
 no i'm saying the philippines is booming at the moment

3177
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:58,679
 so you think the average person in the philippines is living a luxurious

3178
01:43:58,679 --> 01:44:00,239
 life have you if you

3179
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:01,400
 what's happening at the moment

3180
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,520
 do you think the average

3181
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,360
 person in the philippines is living a luxurious

3182
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:07,360
 life there is there is this thing called remote foreign workers

3183
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,119
 and

3184
01:44:08,119 --> 01:44:10,119
 this is a huge boom

3185
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:10,639
 and

3186
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:11,400
 the economic

3187
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:12,440
 the kidchen move to the philippines

3188
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:15,000
 then it's great you get great quality of life in the philippines

3189
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,199
 you know when i looked at the thums of manila

3190
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:20,400
 they should just get j they i don't know why they're not getting the laptops out

3191
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,760
 the the poverty in the philippines is horrific

3192
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:26,360
 i'm listen philippines a beautiful country an amazing country i love the philippines

3193
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,080
 number

3194
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:27,719
 in there at

3195
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:28,719
 at a rate that's never

3196
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:29,520
 what is the life

3197
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,400
 like for your average

3198
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,239
 filipino

3199
01:44:31,239 --> 01:44:33,560
 well would you agree though that their economy is just

3200
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:36,440
 getting flooded with money at the moment like money is flowing in there

3201
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:37,159
 money is flowing

3202
01:44:37,159 --> 01:44:40,199
 in but it is not giving a good quality of life your average filipino

3203
01:44:40,199 --> 01:44:42,520
 that's not true remote foreign workers

3204
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:47,080
 well we can remote foreign workers filipino viewers to tell us what's

3205
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:49,360
 can actually support the often support their en

3206
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,599
 a look i don't know what the average

3207
01:44:50,599 --> 01:44:51,400
 wages in the phili

3208
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,400
 just to bring it back to this point though so i wanted

3209
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,040
 to know from gary

3210
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,080
 he said work hard if you're a young guy listening to this now

3211
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,760
 um i was reading this really interesting article yesterday

3212
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:00,760
 from the i think it was from

3213
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:01,119
 major

3214
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:01,599
 newspaper

3215
01:45:01,599 --> 01:45:03,159
 talking about the lost boys

3216
01:45:03,159 --> 01:45:05,679
 and it goes to show that i think it's one in seven

3217
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:09,080
 young men that is at a working age now are out of work

3218
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,119
 so there's lots of talk around young men in particular

3219
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:11,920
 and how they're struggling

3220
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,599
 you'd say work hard gary

3221
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:16,679
 you' say work hard no blena but the big thing

3222
01:45:16,679 --> 01:45:18,400
 the big thing is

3223
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,800
 recognize the situation that you're in and i would encourage them

3224
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:25,000
 to support my work and follow my channel because

3225
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,280
 the lifeboats are shrinking and trust me

3226
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,000
 we're going to get out kids in the lifeboats

3227
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,520
 and we all know that all right and if those life boates are shrinking

3228
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,800
 if you don't if you don't stop the from going down

3229
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,880
 it is not you and you and me

3230
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,960
 who are going to go down we will be fine

3231
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,920
 if you don't fight the political fight i guarantee

3232
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:42,400
 you

3233
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,880
 people like daniel will so

3234
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,520
 you're saying that they should also get involved in the political fight

3235
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,400
 you have to you have to that's what our grandparents

3236
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,320
 did

3237
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:52,480
 grand if they want to become millionaires like you and me and dan

3238
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,080
 well it sounds like dan's got better advice for that than i do

3239
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,040
 okay well i'm going to ask dan as well but i just wondering

3240
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:01,159
 i'm wondering how your your advice ties into sort of

3241
01:46:01,159 --> 01:46:02,159
 like

3242
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,440
 the young the young person who's trying to liberate

3243
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:07,639
 themselves from where you came from or where i came from

3244
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:11,040
 you know what i don't think i'm the guy to say that man because you know

3245
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,080
 i had this unusual

3246
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,560
 gift from a young age i was very very very good at maths

3247
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,360
 and i just followed

3248
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:15,840
 that

3249
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,480
 um and you know

3250
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,679
 you know my sister she's a poet and she wrote a really successful

3251
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:24,080
 grime of musical about diy r's first album

3252
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:24,639
 all right

3253
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:27,639
 she comes from obviously the same family as me poor family

3254
01:46:27,639 --> 01:46:30,239
 she works so hard she works so

3255
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:31,639
 so hard

3256
01:46:31,639 --> 01:46:32,760
 two degrees

3257
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,040
 she can barely pay the rent all right so

3258
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,440
 i don't want to turn around to our young kids and say

3259
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,560
 well i've got this talent follow your talent

3260
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:43,280
 because it doesn't work stephen true it doesn't work yeah

3261
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,199
 wait

3262
01:46:44,199 --> 01:46:46,440
 my sister does great work but financially

3263
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:51,320
 for young people following your passion following your talent unless you come from rich family

3264
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:52,159
 realistically

3265
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:52,920
 very very

3266
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,199
 really works and i know it worked for the three of us at this table

3267
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:56,560
 but let's not pretend

3268
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:57,560
 that everyone

3269
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:59,840
 experiences the same things that we experienced

3270
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,800
 what would you say to that d and what's your answer

3271
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:05,000
 i think there's two economies going on at the moment there's a dying economy

3272
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,679
 which is the industrial revolution

3273
01:47:06,679 --> 01:47:07,679
 economy

3274
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:08,920
 um and that is all the office

3275
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,760
 jobs and the factory

3276
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,280
 jobs and all of that sort of stuff which is very much being automated

3277
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,239
 away and moved

3278
01:47:13,239 --> 01:47:14,239
 globally

3279
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:17,960
 um and at the same time there's this new bubbling up digital economy

3280
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,280
 um which i'd call the entrepreneur economy or the digital economy

3281
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:25,880
 um both of these economies are kind of co coexisting one's going like that one's going

3282
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,520
 like that

3283
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,520
 um

3284
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,080
 and if you want to be economically

3285
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:34,119
 successful you need to stand next to the biggest piles of money that you can

3286
01:47:34,119 --> 01:47:37,280
 um you know unfortunately being a poet

3287
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:40,040
 doesn't pay a lot of money and we all know that that's not a surprise

3288
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:40,960
 if you came from a very

3289
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:41,239
 rich

3290
01:47:41,239 --> 01:47:41,520
 family

3291
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,320
 and you were a poet

3292
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:42,560
 you'd

3293
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:42,800
 probably

3294
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,000
 be one of the 60%

3295
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,440
 who fell out of a rich family

3296
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:47,080
 as well

3297
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:47,760
 um

3298
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,080
 if you want to be economically

3299
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:53,159
 successful you need to say what is the thing that's economically booming right now

3300
01:47:53,159 --> 01:47:53,920
 gary

3301
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,920
 saw

3302
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:55,679
 the finance

3303
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:56,080
 industry

3304
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:56,800
 at that particular

3305
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,360
 time but if we actually look at the finance

3306
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:58,760
 industry

3307
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,280
 now it's in decline

3308
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:04,239
 um and trading is being rep replaced by ai robots

3309
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:10,159
 um people who worked in your career are going to be replaced by

3310
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:11,000
 it systems

3311
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,560
 that basically

3312
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:11,920
 do

3313
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:12,280
 similar

3314
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:13,239
 jobs it's going to be

3315
01:48:13,239 --> 01:48:14,360
 you know these things happen

3316
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,360
 we're going through a massive

3317
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:18,119
 technological change

3318
01:48:18,119 --> 01:48:21,239
 but at the same time it's never been easier

3319
01:48:21,239 --> 01:48:23,719
 to learn skills for free

3320
01:48:23,719 --> 01:48:26,239
 on youtube it's never been easier to join communities

3321
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:27,639
 where you can get mentoring

3322
01:48:27,639 --> 01:48:28,679
 and get support

3323
01:48:28,679 --> 01:48:33,040
 there are communities of angel investors who do invest in in startups

3324
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,800
 it's never been cheaper or easier to start a company

3325
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:39,280
 there's never been more software and technology to scale and grow

3326
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,800
 you know in just a in a short

3327
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,599
 space of time i would say do what gary's

3328
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:43,080
 done

3329
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:43,920
 gary publishes

3330
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:47,040
 online he's built a personal brand he's attached it to a recurring

3331
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,400
 revenue model

3332
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,040
 he's got yeah i also worked for three for free for four years

3333
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:52,239
 i'm not sure how replicable

3334
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:52,960
 that is

3335
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,679
 you know

3336
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:54,239
 so

3337
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:55,639
 build a personal brand

3338
01:48:55,639 --> 01:48:59,719
 attach it to a business model that is that is where money is flowing

3339
01:48:59,719 --> 01:49:02,080
 um these are these are positive things you can do

3340
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,199
 we all have to play the cards we're dealt

3341
01:49:04,199 --> 01:49:06,239
 you can always find someone who's done better

3342
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:07,080
 with better cards

3343
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,239
 or someone who's been dealt

3344
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:11,000
 better cards and you can always find someone who's been dealt worse a cards

3345
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,760
 no matter who you are on the planet there's someone better there's someone worse

3346
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,800
 you have to play the cards that you dealt

3347
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:19,560
 you cannot sit around waiting for the economic system of the world to be changed

3348
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,639
 you have to say

3349
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:21,599
 you know what

3350
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:25,840
 these are the cards i was born at this particular time in this these circumstances

3351
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,520
 these are my strengths these are my weaknesses

3352
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,760
 i'm going to play the cards that i' i've dealt

3353
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:33,880
 um personal agency is what gets people

3354
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:36,679
 to feel good about their life to make progress

3355
01:49:36,679 --> 01:49:38,679
 and as soon as you play the victim mindset

3356
01:49:38,679 --> 01:49:39,560
 soon as you say

3357
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:40,599
 oh you know what

3358
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:44,159
 the answer to all my prayers is gary's going to change the system

3359
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:47,920
 you're in serious trouble can i just say one thing back on that

3360
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,719
 um if we become a society of of individuals

3361
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:55,000
 who think only individually and and never consider broader societal problems

3362
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,719
 we will become a society that becomes unable to fix societal

3363
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:01,719
 problems

3364
01:50:01,719 --> 01:50:03,480
 i'm somebody who has made millions of pounds

3365
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:06,599
 betting on the collapse of society the collapse of the middle class

3366
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:11,360
 um i don't want to be giving stock tips on the titanic

3367
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,360
 okay

3368
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:14,880
 i i understand i understand that we live in individualized

3369
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,040
 societies and and it's not popular to say hey you need to protect your society

3370
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:18,719
 um

3371
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:21,599
 if you don't protect your society your society is going to collapse

3372
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:25,320
 and and the british public the american public have a choice to make here

3373
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,280
 here to protect these what do you want people to do

3374
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,360
 i want them to get involved

01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:43,960
 to tax working people less and tax extremely

3382
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:47,119
 wealthy wealth orders more so vote for the greens

3383
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:47,960
 vote for whoever

3384
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:50,000
 gives you that whoever gives you your share of the pip

3385
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,320
 basic listen this is not football

3386
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,040
 okay i'm not here

3387
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,320
 m of the gre

3388
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,760
 i'm here to protect the working class

3389
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,360
 so that's their sort of that would be their social and sort of

3390
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,880
 um political

3391
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:00,800
 energy

3392
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,480
 would be to stand up and fight

3393
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,040
 but in their in their personal lives are you telling them to

3394
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:09,199
 start businesses take big risks work really hard go for it because they can also

3395
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:11,480
 i would defer to you guys on that you know i'm not a businessman

3396
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:12,719
 i'm an economist

3397
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,560
 that's what i am you know i made my money by being an economist

3398
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:16,800
 i'm a very very good economist

3399
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,400
 my predictions will be right people can go and watch my predictions

3400
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:20,719
 at the beginning of covid

3401
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:22,639
 i predicted the entire co crisis

3402
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:23,639
 exactly correctly

3403
01:51:23,639 --> 01:51:25,199
 in may 2020

3404
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:27,960
 you know this is you know i'm good at this i'm and listen

3405
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,760
 i'm never going to come here and say i'm a better businessman

3406
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:30,679
 than you and i don't

3407
01:51:30,679 --> 01:51:32,400
 i'm pretty sure that i'm not

3408
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,599
 i'm a very very very good economist

3409
01:51:34,599 --> 01:51:35,520
 this will happen

3410
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,239
 is there something

3411
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:37,679
 that i can do if i'm sat here listening

3412
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:38,159
 at home

3413
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:38,480
 i

3414
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:39,560
 understand everything you said i believe

3415
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:39,880
 everything

3416
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:40,480
 you said

3417
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,480
 i i i believe that it's going to get worse for me

3418
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:44,599
 do you think

3419
01:51:44,599 --> 01:51:47,360
 i should still take responsibility of my situation

3420
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,320
 and fight to make my life

3421
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:51,000
 richer better moreful

3422
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
 100%

3423
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:52,840
 100

3424
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:53,639
 100%

3425
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:55,920
 cuz you you know and i'm sure you know if you're average

3426
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,880
 british or american if you don't do that

3427
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,880
 you're not going to be able to turn the heating on

3428
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,520
 you have to do it you have to do it and i've never once you

3429
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:03,199
 i think my opinions

3430
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:04,159
 are often mischaracterized

3431
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:05,480
 to being anti- ambition

3432
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,560
 you've read my book do you think i'm anti- ambition

3433
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:07,840
 no

3434
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:08,560
 i work my tits

3435
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,040
 off to make money and i want every single

3436
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:10,440
 young person

3437
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:10,880
 in this country

3438
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:11,360
 to be able

3439
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:12,320
 to make money

3440
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:12,960
 if they

3441
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,520
 want to

3442
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,679
 if that's what they want to work towards

3443
01:52:14,679 --> 01:52:16,159
 but we've created a society

3444
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:17,480
 where it's almost impossible

3445
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:19,280
 for young listen i've been there i've been at lc

3446
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,040
 i've been at oxford

3447
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,320
 i've been in the city i've been in the media i've been in politics

3448
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,560
 all all of the guys at the top are a bunch of rich idiots

3449
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:26,920
 we are not allowing

3450
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:29,239
 these smart kids from ordinary backgrounds

3451
01:52:29,239 --> 01:52:30,480
 to get into those spaces

3452
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,360
 why why do we pretend we're not doing that

3453
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:36,440
 do that i disagree with that you're talking about two types of elite spaces

3454
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:38,599
 elite space of elite universities

3455
01:52:38,599 --> 01:52:42,480
 yeah and you're talking about the elite space of derivatives trading

3456
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:43,840
 there's the real economy

3457
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,960
 yeah where entrepreneurs

3458
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:45,800
 do their work

3459
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,679
 then there's the first derivative which is the banking system

3460
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:52,079
 and then there's the second derivative which is rates traders like yourself

3461
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:55,360
 right these are these these are places that

3462
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:59,920
 normal people don't want to end up most normal people who grow up in normal households

3463
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,079
 don't

3464
01:53:01,079 --> 01:53:03,760
 wake up one day and say i want to be a rates trader

3465
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:06,400
 on a double derivative of the economy making bets

3466
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,280
 most people want to start a business that employs

3467
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,760
 people and they want to grow that business and be successful

3468
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:12,239
 do you think that

3469
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:13,880
 starting a business

3470
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,320
 is a realistic

3471
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:17,440
 high success probability chance

3472
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:23,079
 of ordinary poor people becoming rich i i know that economies thrive when entrepreneurs are active

3473
01:53:23,079 --> 01:53:25,040
 and it's not just the entrepreneurs

3474
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:26,000
 they create

3475
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:26,639
 is

3476
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:30,119
 our viewers can do and most of them will end up rich you only need 1%

3477
01:53:30,119 --> 01:53:34,040
 to improve the whole economy there's a really interesting stat that says globally around 65%

3478
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,800
 of ultra high net worth individuals are

3479
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:37,800
 self-made

3480
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,199
 approximately 19%

3481
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:39,920
 primarily

3482
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:42,400
 primarily inherited their wealth and about 16%

3483
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,159
 inherited wealth but significantly grew it through their own ventures

3484
01:53:45,159 --> 01:53:46,320
 so 65%

3485
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,960
 of the ultra high worth individuals globally

3486
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,520
 are self-made

3487
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,599
 does that not mean that if i want to become

3488
01:53:52,599 --> 01:53:55,360
 an ultra high networth person it's going to come down to

3489
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,040
 listen

3490
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,760
 we are just come off the back of the golden age of capitalism

3491
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,440
 when ordinary

3492
01:53:59,440 --> 01:53:59,880
 people

3493
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:01,360
 like my dad you know i grew up in ilford

3494
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:02,679
 it's in east london it's a very immigrant

3495
01:54:02,679 --> 01:54:03,040
 area

3496
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,040
 most of my friends i grew up with come from

3497
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:05,599
 pakistani

3498
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:07,079
 indian immigrant backgrounds

3499
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:08,320
 they come over with nothing

3500
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:12,199
 they worked really hard they made money they had their own assets we had a period

3501
01:54:12,199 --> 01:54:12,920
 where ordinary

3502
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:13,599
 people

3503
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:14,000
 could

3504
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,440
 make money and could make wealth

3505
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:15,960
 so obviously

3506
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,040
 we are now in a period

3507
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:17,440
 where

3508
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,719
 there are rich people who made money during that period

3509
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:22,599
 but it's over now i'm seeing ordinary people making money all the time

3510
01:54:22,599 --> 01:54:25,320
 okay so you're telling our viewers they're idiots why are they not making money

3511
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:28,560
 i'm not telling anyone they're an idiot i'm saying that if it's that easy

3512
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:31,599
 okay all right fine go and buy dan's book read it and become a millionaire

3513
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,239
 because dan thinks it's easy

3514
01:54:33,239 --> 01:54:35,000
 to become a millionaire

3515
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,079
 being an entrepreneur

3516
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:38,239
 but i suspect having not been an entrepreneur

3517
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:40,520
 that most of the people who've read your book are not millionaires

3518
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,520
 everything you've touched has turned to gold

3519
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,599
 you turned yourself to academia

3520
01:54:44,599 --> 01:54:45,440
 you got

3521
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:46,360
 an amazing

3522
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:47,000
 qualification

3523
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,239
 you turned yourself to banking

3524
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:49,639
 you became 2 million a year

3525
01:54:49,639 --> 01:54:50,960
 you turned yourself to being a writer

3526
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:51,639
 you become sunday

3527
01:54:51,639 --> 01:54:52,599
 times bestseller

3528
01:54:52,599 --> 01:54:55,159
 you turn yourself to content creating you get 800,000

3529
01:54:55,159 --> 01:54:56,159
 followers

3530
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:59,040
 and you and now you sit there after all of that evidence

3531
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:01,599
 and say oh no it's all over guys it's all

3532
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:02,079
 i'm smart

3533
01:55:02,079 --> 01:55:04,119
 enough to do it but you guys are not smart enough to do

3534
01:55:04,119 --> 01:55:05,400
 if if you think you can teach

3535
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:06,560
 you've got your book

3536
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,239
 if you think you canach you say

3537
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:10,560
 you're smart enough but they're not smart enough

3538
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:14,159
 i i wonder if um we do have a bit of an education problem

3539
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:16,119
 at the at the heart of this because i was thinking about your sister

3540
01:55:16,119 --> 01:55:17,320
 and i was like right if i was the ceo

3541
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:17,800
 of gary's

3542
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:18,119
 sister

3543
01:55:18,119 --> 01:55:19,360
 what would i do

3544
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:24,159
 there's two things i do right now the first is okay where's where what what marketplace

3545
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:25,280
 is really valuing

3546
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:25,760
 an ability

3547
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:26,320
 to write

3548
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:27,320
 and write an impactful

3549
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:28,599
 way i go write you need to start an instagram

3550
01:55:28,599 --> 01:55:29,079
 page

3551
01:55:29,079 --> 01:55:29,280
 because

3552
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:29,840
 i've seen what happened

3553
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:30,400
 with j sh

3554
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:30,800
 this guy's

3555
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:31,079
 pulling

3556
01:55:31,079 --> 01:55:31,719
 in tens of millions

3557
01:55:31,719 --> 01:55:32,400
 a year

3558
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,960
 because he took like you

3559
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:34,960
 know

3560
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,440
 nice words that were motivational

3561
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,560
 poetic put them on there and i also youtube

3562
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:39,599
 needs to get to youtube

3563
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:40,119
 because

3564
01:55:40,119 --> 01:55:42,199
 if she can talk like you

3565
01:55:42,199 --> 01:55:44,840
 then she's going to do exceptionally well on youtube as well

3566
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,440
 um but the old

3567
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:48,880
 there's not going to be a great economy necessarily

3568
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:50,679
 for someone who's doing poetry

3569
01:55:50,679 --> 01:55:53,560
 in many other places other than one i'm saying is the internet

3570
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:57,599
 but in school we don't teach this there's no youtube class for youtube

3571
01:55:57,599 --> 01:56:00,320
 and and it's such a huge part of the economy i mean

3572
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:03,159
 i mean me and you have seen that it's there's been this decentralization

3573
01:56:03,159 --> 01:56:07,040
 of media where the megaphone was growing at 20% a year the me

3574
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:10,079
 the megaphone was people watching start a youtube become ent

3575
01:56:10,079 --> 01:56:11,440
 it's the internet isn't

3576
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,520
 e i'm not say

3577
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:15,719
 works for most people stepen for most people no it doesn't work

3578
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:16,520
 it doesn't work

3579
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:17,239
 why are we pretending

3580
01:56:17,239 --> 01:56:17,760
 it does

3581
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:19,280
 but i what what i what i would say

3582
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,480
 is if in school

3583
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,480
 we taught young kids a couple

3584
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,719
 new things and we stopped teaching them about pythagoras's

3585
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:25,040
 theorem

3586
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:25,960
 which by the way chat gbt

3587
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:27,840
 is going to do for you with your eyes closed

3588
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,040
 and we taught them

3589
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,880
 about the new economy of the internet

3590
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,760
 about the ability to start a shop

3591
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:33,960
 and i

3592
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:35,199
 it's crazy that

3593
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:35,639
 i

3594
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:38,360
 the school system was designed in such a way where they put me in exclusion

3595
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:39,880
 unit because i was so preoccupied

3596
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:40,639
 with doing

3597
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:41,920
 business deals at school

3598
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:42,679
 and my headmaster

3599
01:56:42,679 --> 01:56:43,400
 came on t

3600
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:45,040
 national tv on what i lied to and said

3601
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:45,639
 yeah we unexp

3602
01:56:45,639 --> 01:56:46,360
 beled him eventually

3603
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:48,199
 because he made the school so much money but the system

3604
01:56:48,199 --> 01:56:48,880
 was punishing

3605
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:49,599
 me

3606
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:51,520
 for entre for entrepreneurship

3607
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:56,440
 and it wasn't teaching me anything about the the new economy which is which is technology

3608
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:58,520
 st do you think it matters if the percentage

3609
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,360
 of young people who are able to

3610
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,840
 achieve financial freedom

3611
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,520
 and have a family is shrinking

3612
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:07,320
 so do i think it matters if the percentage of young people that are able

3613
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:08,320
 to

3614
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:08,920
 are you saying

3615
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:12,560
 attain wealth and have a family yeah achieve financial freedom and have a family

3616
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,679
 i think that's a really big problem listen

3617
01:57:14,679 --> 01:57:15,960
 i think that's a really big problem

3618
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:18,599
 i agree i know listen and i know you've got this podcast

3619
01:57:18,599 --> 01:57:19,360
 and i know you inspire

3620
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,599
 young people and i think that's a good thing

3621
01:57:20,599 --> 01:57:21,840
 i think it's a good thing that you inspire

3622
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:22,320
 young people

3623
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:22,960
 to go out

3624
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,280
 and work hard and try and achieve

3625
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:24,760
 something

3626
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,920
 but i'm an economist

3627
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:28,800
 and what i see is the percentage of young people who make it shrinking

3628
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,280
 and i think if you combine those two things you reach a really dangerous place

3629
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:33,960
 because we go and tell the young people

3630
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:35,400
 it's there for you to start a business

3631
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:36,400
 and at the same time

3632
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,159
 the number of people who make it is 10%

3633
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:39,400
 5% 2%

3634
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:40,000
 1%

3635
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:40,280
 and

3636
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:40,800
 there will always

3637
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,840
 be that one person who makes

3638
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,119
 it

3639
01:57:42,119 --> 01:57:43,159
 there will always be that steven

3640
01:57:43,159 --> 01:57:43,520
 bartley

3641
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:45,159
 in every country in the world who's making it through

3642
01:57:45,159 --> 01:57:46,400
 you know what i'm saying but

3643
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,079
 the systematic

3644
01:57:47,079 --> 01:57:48,400
 issue matters stephen

3645
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,480
 c can we can we not change the education

3646
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,239
 system so that when i was

3647
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:53,040
 16

3648
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,280
 and they threw me in the exclusion

3649
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:54,599
 unit

3650
01:57:54,599 --> 01:57:56,320
 which made me which would could so easily

3651
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,280
 have made me think

3652
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,480
 that i was a failure

3653
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:01,239
 because my brothers who went jason went to lsc

3654
01:58:01,239 --> 01:58:04,800
 okay and became very much like you and now works in my company

3655
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,800
 um managing my investments

3656
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:11,440
 he in that education system was rewarded so i sat there as a kid thinking

3657
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,360
 rich and successful

3658
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:13,239
 my older brother jason

3659
01:58:13,239 --> 01:58:14,199
 because he can do maths

3660
01:58:14,199 --> 01:58:15,599
 and i thought i'm going to be a failure

3661
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:17,000
 because i like this thing called entrepreneurship

3662
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
 and i have adhd

3663
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,719
 so i can't pay attention in lessons

3664
01:58:19,719 --> 01:58:20,960
 what i'm saying is if the education

3665
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,119
 system was designed in such a way where people like me who were entrepreneurial

3666
01:58:24,119 --> 01:58:26,960
 who were interested in the internet and couldn't stop playing video games

3667
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:30,599
 were clapped for and said oh my god double down on that

3668
01:58:30,599 --> 01:58:32,520
 yeah um i think

3669
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:33,560
 the net benefit

3670
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:36,440
 when you think about what the backbone of the economy is which is entrepreneurs

3671
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:37,520
 starting businesses

3672
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:39,000
 would be profound

3673
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,679
 for this country here

3674
01:58:40,679 --> 01:58:41,280
 yeah but that

3675
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:42,599
 but but i i think that i believe

3676
01:58:42,599 --> 01:58:42,800
 there

3677
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:43,880
 needs to be such a radical

3678
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:44,520
 overhaul

3679
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:45,360
 of our education

3680
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:48,119
 system if we want to stand a chance of capitalizing

3681
01:58:48,119 --> 01:58:49,719
 on what the economy is today

3682
01:58:49,719 --> 01:58:50,920
 yeah i i think

3683
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:52,119
 i think you could probably

3684
01:58:52,119 --> 01:58:52,440
 change

3685
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:52,920
 the education

3686
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:54,239
 system in a lot of ways that could improve

3687
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:55,480
 it but you're kind of changing

3688
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:56,079
 the education

3689
01:58:56,079 --> 01:58:56,599
 system

3690
01:58:56,599 --> 01:58:57,480
 on the titanic

3691
01:58:57,480 --> 01:58:58,480
 what my my perspective

3692
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:01,239
 is i can tell you with a very very high rate of certainty

3693
01:59:01,239 --> 01:59:04,679
 if you don't fix this problem of the wealth being sucked out of the middle class

3694
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:05,280
 95

3695
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:05,920
 98%

3696
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:09,840
 of people will be in poverty in this country in 70 years i agree with you

3697
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:11,159
 this is the thing

3698
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:11,639
 i agree

3699
01:59:11,639 --> 01:59:12,280
 that you can't

3700
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:14,880
 have a group of people at the very top that own all the assets

3701
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:17,960
 and all the money or else i mean it's going to come from somewhere

3702
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:20,199
 and i remember the day that i printed off the jobseekers

3703
01:59:20,199 --> 01:59:20,560
 allowance

3704
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:20,920
 form

3705
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:21,840
 when i was stealing chicago

3706
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:22,199
 town

3707
01:59:22,199 --> 01:59:22,599
 piz

3708
01:59:22,599 --> 01:59:24,239
 10 years ago in my room in mosside

3709
01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:25,079
 in manchester

3710
01:59:25,079 --> 01:59:26,239
 i remember what it feels

3711
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:26,679
 like

3712
01:59:26,679 --> 01:59:28,520
 to not have my parents speaking to me

3713
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:29,159
 to be

3714
01:59:29,159 --> 01:59:30,079
 have all these ccj

3715
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:32,000
 letters and baith letters on my desk

3716
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,400
 and really

3717
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:34,440
 have no answer

3718
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:37,199
 how how to get out of the situation to the point that i was like shoplifting

3719
01:59:37,199 --> 01:59:38,159
 i'd call the justy

3720
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:40,679
 driver and then trying to persuade him just to give me the food

3721
01:59:40,679 --> 01:59:43,719
 that was that was that was 10 years ago for me so i i it's not

3722
01:59:43,719 --> 01:59:45,040
 i've not forgotten

3723
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,920
 the the those years of my life

3724
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:48,360
 so i understand what it is

3725
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:49,239
 to be in that

3726
01:59:49,239 --> 01:59:50,239
 situation

3727
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:53,079
 and on an individual level i need need some answers

3728
01:59:53,079 --> 01:59:56,239
 because i'm not going to wait for these people in

3729
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:59,320
 the parliament to fix my life for me so i need some individual answers

3730
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:02,760
 and then i do also care about the bigger picture so i'm not like here

3731
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,280
 as someone that just wants to

3732
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:07,719
 acrew loads of wealth myself of course listen let's be honest

3733
02:00:07,719 --> 02:00:08,679
 no one like

3734
02:00:08,679 --> 02:00:10,800
 there's not many human beings that wouldn't like more money

3735
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,880
 so i try and acknowledge that bias

3736
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:17,239
 but what i'm the the the the big issue i have is

3737
02:00:17,239 --> 02:00:18,880
 is is how

3738
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,639
 and from my personal experience

3739
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:21,960
 as someone that now employs

3740
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:24,400
 hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people here in london

3741
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:26,520
 up in manchester in our offices

3742
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:29,800
 i there are a set of things that would make me leave this country

3743
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:31,400
 if it became increasingly

3744
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:32,159
 less

3745
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:35,599
 friendly to entrepreneurs i reckon if we come back here in 5 years time

3746
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:36,960
 i reckon i'll employ

3747
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,079
 500 more

3748
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:39,320
 people in the uk

3749
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:39,760
 and actually

3750
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:40,280
 as you look around

3751
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:42,040
 this room you can see the age of them these are young

3752
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:42,679
 people

3753
02:00:42,679 --> 02:00:43,159
 yeah

3754
02:00:43,159 --> 02:00:43,599
 um

3755
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:45,800
 there are things you could do to make me not do that

3756
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:48,199
 i mean it's probably worth pointing out that we're not taxing

3757
02:00:48,199 --> 02:00:51,320
 wealth and you're leaving the country anyway stephen no i haven't left the country

3758
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,320
 okay you're going

3759
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:53,400
 i'm i'm a tax resident

3760
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:54,320
 here i pay my taxes

3761
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:55,320
 here and i have zero

3762
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:56,159
 intent in changing

3763
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:56,480
 that

3764
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:57,280
 i'm also on dragon

3765
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:58,079
 you know so we're investing

3766
02:00:58,079 --> 02:00:59,119
 a lot of money in uk

3767
02:00:59,119 --> 02:00:59,880
 businesses

3768
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:01,440
 but listen

3769
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,920
 i want to raise i want to tax only

3770
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,920
 high levels of wealth only high levels of wealth

3771
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:08,560
 and listen don't get me wrong i understand very rich people will complain

3772
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,679
 and very rich people will say just like they did in dickens

3773
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:11,880
 i'm going to throw my businesses

3774
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:13,079
 i'm going to throw my taxes

3775
02:01:13,079 --> 02:01:13,719
 my

3776
02:01:13,719 --> 02:01:16,639
 my businesses and my factories into the sea

3777
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:18,119
 stephen your viewers are here

3778
02:01:18,119 --> 02:01:21,639
 you listen steven your viewers are here you are a very wealthy person

3779
02:01:21,639 --> 02:01:23,840
 they are are paying 20 30 40 50%

3780
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:27,440
 you should be paying your fair share stephen you should

3781
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:30,239
 i think that i should

3782
02:01:30,239 --> 02:01:33,360
 pay more tax especially when

3783
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:34,360
 um

3784
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:35,639
 i don't think my kids should get

3785
02:01:35,639 --> 02:01:36,320
 should should benefit

3786
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:37,000
 from my wealth

3787
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,159
 and maybe this is a controversial

3788
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:39,920
 opinion but i actually don't

3789
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,320
 i don't think i should be able to pass down my assets to my children

3790
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:47,280
 you can't it's 40% tax i think it should be more 4 yeah

3791
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,000
 let's not pretend rich people don't successfully

3792
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,360
 pass their ass their children i'm just telling you now

3793
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:51,960
 i do

3794
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:52,719
 think i'd be robbing

3795
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:53,719
 my children of something

3796
02:01:53,719 --> 02:01:54,360
 from the background

3797
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:56,079
 that i came from if my ch my child

3798
02:01:56,079 --> 02:01:57,000
 gets

3799
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:57,840
 if my child

3800
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,079
 has gets tens of millions

3801
02:01:59,079 --> 02:02:00,119
 let's say even

3802
02:02:00,119 --> 02:02:02,360
 when i die i don't think that should happen

3803
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:03,000
 well i agree

3804
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:03,360
 people say

3805
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:03,920
 when i talk about

3806
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:04,280
 my sister

3807
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:05,400
 people like why don't you just give your sister

3808
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:06,040
 a load of money

3809
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:06,440
 listen

3810
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:07,639
 my sister works hard

3811
02:02:07,639 --> 02:02:09,719
 she's a smart person she works hard

3812
02:02:09,719 --> 02:02:10,360
 she produces

3813
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:11,079
 good work

3814
02:02:11,079 --> 02:02:12,560
 i want to live in a society

3815
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:14,000
 where people like my sister

3816
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,280
 are able to support

3817
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:18,079
 themselves with the work that they do but we we're destroying that society

3818
02:02:18,079 --> 02:02:19,880
 who would pay her

3819
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:24,280
 the the customers you know this the situ so you want her to start a business

3820
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:25,400
 she is a business

3821
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:25,960
 yeah

3822
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:28,400
 yeah and i want people like her to be to be taxed

3823
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:28,760
 less

3824
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:29,239
 so that

3825
02:02:29,239 --> 02:02:30,119
 what i want is

3826
02:02:30,119 --> 02:02:30,520
 ordinary

3827
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:30,880
 working

3828
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:31,239
 people

3829
02:02:31,239 --> 02:02:31,920
 to be tax

3830
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:33,800
 less so they have more money in their pocket listen

3831
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:34,960
 the reason we had the thriving

3832
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,360
 art scene in the 60s

3833
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:38,000
 is because we had a thriving middle class

3834
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,440
 that could go and buy the new fashions

3835
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,639
 and buy the new records and then that created

3836
02:02:41,639 --> 02:02:43,000
 this thriving art scene

3837
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,239
 now we have a middle class which is struggling to pay the bills so they can't

3838
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:48,040
 they can't buy stuff they you know

3839
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:49,560
 my syst makes theater shows

3840
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:50,599
 the only people who go to the theater

3841
02:02:50,599 --> 02:02:53,159
 are rich people now but back back in the day you know theater

3842
02:02:53,159 --> 02:02:54,400
 was something that was more accessible

3843
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,800
 you want you want the arts

3844
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:58,239
 i've got to mate use a fashion designer right

3845
02:02:58,239 --> 02:02:58,960
 nowadays

3846
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:00,800
 there's all of the business is

3847
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:03,079
 super fast super cheap super disposable fashion

3848
02:03:03,079 --> 02:03:04,040
 or unbelievably

3849
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:05,000
 expensive high-end

3850
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,639
 because that's the economy we've created

3851
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:09,400
 i want you go to japan which is a less unequal society

3852
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:13,079
 the restaurants are good quality restaurants for ordinary people because

3853
02:03:13,079 --> 02:03:16,960
 a good capitalist society will produce things for the people with money

3854
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,639
 in the case of theater

3855
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:23,440
 where have the theater consumers moved to where are they getting their entertainment now

3856
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:23,960
 well

3857
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:25,000
 what you have is a very rich

3858
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,639
 group of people who will still go to the theater

3859
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:28,440
 and they will pay a lot but then you have

3860
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:30,480
 a large group of people who are relatively

3861
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:31,440
 cash scarce

3862
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:33,000
 and they will try to get their entertainment

3863
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,159
 in cheaper ways of course you know what i mean

3864
02:03:35,159 --> 02:03:38,079
 they're spending their time watching your youtube channel well exactly my you

3865
02:03:38,079 --> 02:03:40,840
 which is free by the way yeah but you get paid from it

3866
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:41,639
 you get the youtube

3867
02:03:41,639 --> 02:03:43,040
 honest it's only in the last couple of months

3868
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:43,480
 that i started

3869
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:44,119
 to make any money

3870
02:03:44,119 --> 02:03:45,320
 because i don't do my own

3871
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:46,599
 um editing

3872
02:03:46,599 --> 02:03:46,960
 so

3873
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,199
 and you i mean you'll know

3874
02:03:48,199 --> 02:03:48,880
 but in the first few

3875
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:49,400
 years you're paying

3876
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:49,639
 yourself

3877
02:03:49,639 --> 02:03:49,880
 to

3878
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:50,840
 do it you know what i mean

3879
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:51,480
 like i think people

3880
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:51,880
 some

3881
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:52,520
 times

3882
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:53,559
 massively overestimate

3883
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:55,119
 the amount of money this is entrepreneurs

3884
02:03:55,119 --> 02:03:55,679
 entrepreneurs

3885
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:57,000
 go through 2 three four

3886
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,520
 5 years worth of struggle

3887
02:03:58,520 --> 02:03:59,760
 to get to the point where they're

3888
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:00,760
 successful

3889
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:02,920
 and it feels pretty horrific

3890
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:05,920
 that you say oh finally when i make it you take it

3891
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:11,719
 um and then the advisers to entrepreneurs just 10 million is quite a lot of money

3892
02:04:11,719 --> 02:04:13,960
 so you know you can be worth 9 million

3893
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:17,400
 and not be paying anything more but what if i just raise 1 million for investment

3894
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:18,760
 into my company

3895
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:20,440
 but that then

3896
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:23,639
 like i do if i'm if if i'm raising money all the way along

3897
02:04:23,639 --> 02:04:26,520
 and my investors are saying i'm sorry i don't invest in the uk economy

3898
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:29,679
 because it's wealth taxes and all that sort of stuff it's anti- wealth

3899
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:31,920
 and then i just have to move my company overseas

3900
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,280
 well i want to create a situation where the uk consumer is so strong

3901
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:36,000
 that you have to invest

3902
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:36,480
 in the uk

3903
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,360
 you don't have to be here to sell to

3904
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:39,360
 them

3905
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:42,040
 if you're looking to take the next step in your tech career

3906
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:44,400
 you'll want to hear about our sponsor inuit

3907
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:45,520

02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,360
 that if you want to do your best work

3909

02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:52,159

 with data and ai

3914
02:04:54,599 --> 02:04:57,320
 and this is what you can expect into it they're growing

3915
02:04:57,320 --> 02:05:00,800
 their tech careers building an ai driven expert platform

3916

3920
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:15,159
 having a mission-driven culture

3921
02:05:15,159 --> 02:05:18,360
 is something i really align with because it's all about solving

3922
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,159
 complex customer

3923
02:05:19,159 --> 02:05:20,880
 problems with rapid experimentation

 to move faster

3925
02:05:22,159 --> 02:05:25,199
 quite similar to the culture i want to foster at my companies

3935
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:49,480
 quick one i want to talk to you about our sponsor whoop

3936
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,719
 a business i'm also an investor in

3937
02:05:51,719 --> 02:05:55,840
 and if you follow me on instagram you probably noticed that recently i've picked up running

3938
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,400
 which i'm very much enjoying and it started out as a challenge

3939
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:01,000
 but it's now evolved into something i do almost

3940
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,800
 daily it is one of those things that's pushing me to be better every single day

3941
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:08,520
 but here's the thing to me progress isn't just about pushing harder it's also about training

3942
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:09,199
 in a smarter

3943
02:06:09,199 --> 02:06:09,719
 way

3944
02:06:09,719 --> 02:06:11,119
 which is where my whoop

3945
02:06:11,119 --> 02:06:12,040
 comes in

3946
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:13,760
 whoop doesn't just track my workouts

3947
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,480
 it tells me how ready my body is to take them on

3948
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:18,480
 before i've even started the workout

3949
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,119
 a few years ago we ran a study called project

3950
02:06:21,119 --> 02:06:25,000
 p are and it found that runners who adjusted their training based on their recovery

3951
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:25,719
 scores

3952
02:06:25,719 --> 02:06:29,639
 improved their 5k times by an average of 2 minutes

3953
02:06:29,639 --> 02:06:33,800
 and 40 seconds while reducing injury risk by over 30%

3954
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,880
 and they did it while training less

3955
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:38,880
 so if you're looking for this type of guidance when it comes to your training

3956
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:39,920
 head over to join.

3957
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:45,119
 woop.com ceo and get a 30-day trial with zero commitment that's join.

3958
02:06:45,119 --> 02:06:46,599
 woop.com

3959
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:47,599
 ceo

3960
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:49,400
 let me know how you get on

3961
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:51,000
 so so do we all agree on this premise

3962
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:51,639
 though that gary's

3963
02:06:51,639 --> 02:06:52,800
 saying which is the very

3964
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:53,400
 the ultra

3965
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:54,320
 rich

3966
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:55,280
 which we can classify

3967
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:55,960
 as being

3968
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:57,079
 worth more than you're saying

3969
02:06:57,079 --> 02:06:59,079
 we say 10 10 million is the line that we campaign

3970
02:06:59,079 --> 02:06:59,639
 for

3971
02:06:59,639 --> 02:07:00,199
 okay

3972
02:07:00,199 --> 02:07:00,760
 we

3973
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:04,239
 we think that they should pay a greater share of the tax

3974
02:07:04,239 --> 02:07:07,599
 and then the qu if you agree with that premise the question then becomes

3975
02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:09,760
 yes but how yeah

3976
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:12,040
 well they already do 1% pay 30%

3977
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:13,320
 i want to be clear

3978
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:15,119
 that's the top 1% of taxpayers

3979
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:20,360
 which is not the top 1% of richest people mind you i'm also not necessarily saying

3980
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:23,199
 um what's fair i'm saying what's practically

3981
02:07:23,199 --> 02:07:27,520
 possible right so like you could you could come up with the world's most fair

3982
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:29,800
 on a back of a napkin this is what's fair

3983
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:32,199
 but whether you can implement it is a very difficult thing

3984
02:07:32,199 --> 02:07:33,719
 the problem is wealth is completely

3985
02:07:33,719 --> 02:07:34,199
 mobile

3986
02:07:34,199 --> 02:07:36,599
 now it's really you can live work from

3987
02:07:36,599 --> 02:07:37,599
 anywhere

3988
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:38,559
 the houses

3989
02:07:38,559 --> 02:07:40,159
 dan yeah it's land

3990
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:43,119
 is that mobile you going rip you can't rip the country out of the

3991
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:45,719
 out of the sea there's very few i've never met any

3992
02:07:45,719 --> 02:07:48,239
 seriously wealthy people who own a lot of houses

3993
02:07:48,239 --> 02:07:52,920
 you honestly think that the entire housing stock of the uk is not valuable

3994
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:54,719
 yeah no it is but

3995
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:59,719
 78% is owned by baby boomers they just own they've they've bought a house in 1992

3996
02:07:59,719 --> 02:08:03,880
 they own the house personally i think that that house ownership especially when you consider mortgages

3997
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:05,719
 is relatively unequally distributed

3998
02:08:05,719 --> 02:08:07,520
 that is by the way the most equally distribut

3999
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:09,159
 young people have now had the commercial

4000
02:08:09,159 --> 02:08:09,679
 property

4001
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:11,040
 the land the natural

4002
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:12,159
 by pension funds

4003
02:08:12,159 --> 02:08:12,480
 so

4004
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:13,840
 you're the viewers own it do they

4005
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,480
 no they're owned by if they own a pension

4006
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:15,800
 fun

4007
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:16,920
 most of those commercial

4008
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:18,480
 what the distribution of pion

4009
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:22,559
 what is the distribution of pensions what percentage of pensions is owned by top 1%

4010
02:08:22,559 --> 02:08:23,199
 the

4011
02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:25,320
 i wouldn't know off the top of my head but with pensions

4012
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:26,960
 but i know i know that ob

4013
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:27,960
 obviously

4014
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:28,760
 wealth concentrates

4015
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:32,599
 at the top but here's the one thing keep in mind wealthy group are not necessarily

4016
02:08:32,599 --> 02:08:33,679
 a static group

4017
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:34,639
 there was a study

4018
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:35,159
 of

4019
02:08:35,159 --> 02:08:36,480
 the richest people

4020
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:37,360
 in

4021
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:38,360
 1900

4022
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:40,800
 and most of those families are poor today

4023
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:43,679
 or they they've gone down in value today

4024
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:45,520
 if the richest people in 1900

4025
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:48,000
 had have just simply kept their wealth there'd be 16,000

4026
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,280
 more billionaires

4027
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:51,040
 but but they they don't

4028
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:55,079
 um you know in wealth management in banks yeah they have this thing called the

4029
02:08:55,079 --> 02:08:56,960
 um succession planning

4030
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:57,639
 so succession

4031
02:08:57,639 --> 02:08:57,920
 planning

4032
02:08:57,920 --> 02:08:58,880
 is where they try and figure

4033
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,760
 out how to not to screw

4034
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:00,280
 it up across

4035
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:01,199
 generations

4036
02:09:01,199 --> 02:09:02,480
 and they're they're notoriously

4037
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:07,159
 bad at it it's very hard to keep wealth in generations down in the 20th

4038
02:09:07,159 --> 02:09:08,159
 century

4039
02:09:08,159 --> 02:09:10,599
 we had two world wars and a

4040
02:09:10,599 --> 02:09:13,440
 holocaust that redistributed

4041
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:14,440
 wealth

4042
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:17,639
 i would prefer not to have that again yeah yeah yeah

4043
02:09:17,639 --> 02:09:19,199
 i'm with you i want a affluent

4044
02:09:19,199 --> 02:09:19,880
 middle class

4045
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:20,360
 i i really

4046
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:20,559
 do

4047
02:09:20,559 --> 02:09:20,800
 so where's

4048
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:21,000
 the we

4049
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:21,400
 going to come from

4050
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:21,599
 you want

4051
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:21,719
 to

4052
02:09:21,719 --> 02:09:21,880
 just

4053
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:22,079
 you're going

4054
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:22,360
 to create

4055
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:22,639
 your

4056
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:24,000
 entrepreneurs

4057
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,199
 entrepreneur

4058
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:26,199
 entrepreneur

4059
02:09:26,199 --> 02:09:29,440
 economies that are friendly towards wealth creation and entrepreneurship

4060
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:33,400
 was the last time you had a government that wasn't let's grow let's grow let's

4061
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:34,400
 grow

4062
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:35,079
 it's not working

4063
02:09:35,079 --> 02:09:35,760
 for the people

4064
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:36,159
 daniel

4065
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:37,920
 no the problem is is that they need to step

4066
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,079
 back they need to let shrink

4067
02:09:39,079 --> 02:09:39,599
 let shrink

4068
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:40,040
 let

4069
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:41,040
 shrink

4070
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:42,119
 our viewers should keep

4071
02:09:42,119 --> 02:09:42,480
 close

4072
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:44,040
 ey on donald trump and elon musk

4073
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:45,119
 because they're doing what you're asking

4074
02:09:45,119 --> 02:09:46,520
 it'll be interesting to see what happens

4075
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,040
 right

4076
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:50,400
 it's too soon to tell if you were trying to grow the uk economy

4077
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,679
 would you not take america

4078
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:55,360
 approach because they seem to be much more successful at growing growing their economy

4079
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:55,840
 i think

4080
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:56,679
 i mean of course

4081
02:09:56,679 --> 02:09:57,520
 when we talk about slashing

4082
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:59,000
 of the state they're going to use these examples

4083
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,040
 like oh there's this wasteful

4084
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:01,440
 government building

4085
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:01,800
 everybody

4086
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:02,440
 wants to slash

4087
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:02,760
 government

4088
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:03,079
 waste

4089
02:10:03,079 --> 02:10:04,719
 of course i'm not going to fight against slashing

4090
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:05,040
 government

4091
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:05,599
 waste

4092
02:10:05,599 --> 02:10:06,360
 um

4093
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:07,440
 i'm from the uk

4094
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:09,440
 you know i saw the austerity years

4095
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:11,239
 i've seen what's happened to local services

4096
02:10:11,239 --> 02:10:14,040
 i've seen what's happened to things like the police like like education

4097
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:16,480
 you know especially things like youth services

4098
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:22,159
 um you slash the state you fire a load of people you know

4099
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:26,199
 what does the state okay yeah if you can get rid of state corruption yes 100%

4100
02:10:26,199 --> 02:10:30,079
 if you can get rid of state waste 100% you know

4101
02:10:30,079 --> 02:10:32,239
 this is how single moms feed their kids

4102
02:10:32,239 --> 02:10:33,239
 stephen

4103
02:10:33,239 --> 02:10:34,840
 you want to stop that

4104
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:36,480
 no i'm saying that

4105
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:38,559
 slashing the state

4106
02:10:38,559 --> 02:10:40,000
 i don't think it's going to work

4107
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,880
 um to be honest i think tariffs is is not an uninteresting

4108
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:47,960
 discussion i think yeah of course tax avoidance is something you need to get rid of

4109
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:48,920
 really

4110
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:52,280
 i would like to take a step back look at the country and say

4111
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:54,360
 what is the state of the country

4112
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:55,840
 what what the people need

4113
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:56,719
 you know we have a country

4114
02:10:56,719 --> 02:10:58,079
 here where the housing stock is falling

4115
02:10:58,079 --> 02:10:58,400
 apart

4116
02:10:58,400 --> 02:10:59,520
 and we're letting it fall apart

4117
02:10:59,520 --> 02:10:59,840
 because

4118
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:00,880
 those houses

4119
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:04,040
 are owned by ordinary people who don't have any money

4120
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:06,400
 if you want the country to work for ordinary people

4121
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:09,800
 you need ordinary people to have money i'm always reminded of mr beast

4122
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:11,199
 he goes to places in africa

4123
02:11:11,199 --> 02:11:11,719
 and he spends

4124
02:11:11,719 --> 02:11:12,119
 500

4125
02:11:12,119 --> 02:11:12,480
 quid

4126
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:13,639
 and he gives a kid eyesight

4127
02:11:13,639 --> 02:11:15,280
 who would have been blind for the rest of their life

4128
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:16,559
 for 500 quid

4129
02:11:16,559 --> 02:11:21,400
 why are kids in africa blind who could be given sight for 500 quid

4130
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:22,840
 because they don't

4131
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:23,440
 have

4132
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:24,480
 any money

4133
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:27,119
 this is what happens when you drain your middle class

4134
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:27,599
 you

4135
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:29,599
 this will end up like that you know you know

4136
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:30,400
 i've got a friend who

4137
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:31,000
 went to india

4138
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:31,760
 last week

4139
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:35,040
 he said there were people lying on the street outside with rotting limbs

4140
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:38,199
 you know that is what happens when you when you disempower

4141
02:11:38,199 --> 02:11:39,800
 when you take the money away from your middle class

4142
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,360
 you've got to protect the middle class

4143
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,679
 if the middle class had

4144
02:11:42,679 --> 02:11:43,679
 money

4145
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:45,280
 then there would be unbelievable

4146
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:47,440
 business opportunities for selling

4147
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:51,880
 goods and services like your business to the middle class so would you tax daniel more

4148
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:54,840
 i don't know if daniel's worth more than 10 million pounds it sounds like he is

4149
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:55,840
 um is

4150
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:56,800
 i mean i think

4151
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,440
 i want to make it clear right

4152
02:11:58,440 --> 02:11:59,320
 you people you make

4153
02:11:59,320 --> 02:11:59,719
 5%

4154
02:11:59,719 --> 02:12:00,280
 on your wealth

4155
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:01,040
 so if daniel's

4156
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:01,800
 worth 100 million

4157
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:03,079
 he's making £5 million

4158
02:12:03,079 --> 02:12:04,559
 we're only trying to tax you 1%

4159
02:12:04,559 --> 02:12:06,000
 i think if you are worth 100 million

4160
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,719
 you're making 5 million pound passive income

4161
02:12:07,719 --> 02:12:08,760
 you can afford to pay

4162
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:11,280
 a million pound tax a year you're going to still keep getting rich

4163
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:11,719
 the truth

4164
02:12:11,719 --> 02:12:12,199
 is

4165
02:12:12,199 --> 02:12:13,840
 even if we were to tax these billionaires

4166
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:17,320
 1% a year they would still squeeze the rest out this is not

4167
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:18,480
 this is not about morality

4168
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:19,639
 this is just cold

4169
02:12:19,639 --> 02:12:23,639
 hard economic analysis that i have made a lot of money betting on so closing arguments

4170
02:12:23,639 --> 02:12:25,119
 then chaps

4171
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:28,480
 um i'll start with you gary based on everything we've discussed today

4172
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:30,079
 um what is

4173
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:33,360
 i'm going to ask you to to give me two perspectives which is

4174
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:36,000
 if i'm a young individual in this country right now

4175
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,440
 what should i do to protect myself and my family and to feed my family

4176
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:40,320
 what kind of behaviors

4177
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,440
 what strategy should i drop

4178
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:41,880
 there

4179
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:43,040
 but also then from a

4180
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:46,079
 government level i know we have some politicians that listen because they message me

4181
02:12:46,079 --> 02:12:46,840
 what should

4182
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:47,480
 politicians

4183
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:49,320
 be doing to to fix

4184
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,480
 the issue that we're all clearly identify

4185
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:54,000
 which is the collaps of the middle class the collaps of sort of working-class

4186
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,400
 people and the the

4187
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:57,520
 the increased wealth of the rich

4188
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:58,920
 i think

4189
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:02,119
 what i would like young people to understand is that

4190
02:13:02,119 --> 02:13:06,119
 this gets worse this getss much much worse it will get much worse

4191
02:13:06,119 --> 02:13:12,280
 um relatively quickly poverty will increase relatively quickly it will become increasingly

4192
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:15,480
 difficult almost impossible to make any serious money

4193
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:18,480
 prepare yourself for that prepare yourself when you consider your finances

4194
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,960
 when you consider your plans for having a family

4195
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:21,880
 um

4196
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:22,159
 this

4197
02:13:22,159 --> 02:13:22,400
 gets

4198
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:22,679
 worse

4199
02:13:22,679 --> 02:13:23,520
 and it's going to be really

4200
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:24,000
 really hard

4201
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:24,559
 it's going to be

4202
02:13:24,559 --> 02:13:25,079
 a big mental

4203
02:13:25,079 --> 02:13:25,360
 health

4204
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:25,639
 problem

4205
02:13:25,639 --> 02:13:26,320
 for a lot of young

4206
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:27,239
 people

4207
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:29,239
 um so speak to people and understand that

4208
02:13:29,239 --> 02:13:33,239
 um my youtube videos are there g's economics people don't understand what's happening

4209
02:13:33,239 --> 02:13:33,960
 um

4210
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:35,119
 after that

4211
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:36,360
 you've got to do all the right things

4212
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:37,400
 yeah i mean i don't disagree

4213
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:37,880
 with you

4214
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:40,199
 you've got to work hard you've got to study the right things

4215
02:13:40,199 --> 02:13:44,719
 um i i think it's a great shame we have made subjects like the arts

4216
02:13:44,719 --> 02:13:46,239
 um a thing which

4217
02:13:46,239 --> 02:13:47,119
 you you're not allowed

4218
02:13:47,119 --> 02:13:48,320
 if you come from po poor backgrounds

4219
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:49,360
 you cannot work in arts

4220
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:49,800
 i'm sorry

4221
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:51,280
 you can't pay the bills you can't

4222
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,400
 so you have to go and study

4223
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:55,000
 ai and computing

4224
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,880
 and you know maybe social media although we have to be honest social media doesn't

4225
02:13:57,880 --> 02:13:58,559
 pay for most

4226
02:13:58,559 --> 02:14:00,040
 people

4227
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:01,040
 um

4228
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:05,960
 you have to realize the reality of your situation it's very very very

4229
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,119
 very bad

4230
02:14:07,119 --> 02:14:09,360
 that doesn't mean you don't work that doesn't mean you don't aspire

4231
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:11,159
 you work damn hard because you have to

4232
02:14:11,159 --> 02:14:11,760
 but if you manage

4233
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:12,280
 to make enough

4234
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:12,840
 money to even

4235
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:13,079
 support

4236
02:14:13,079 --> 02:14:13,480
 a family

4237
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:14,559
 you should be proud of yourself

4238
02:14:14,559 --> 02:14:16,159
 that that's the number one thing

4239
02:14:16,159 --> 02:14:18,280
 um but

4240
02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:19,280
 recognize

4241
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:23,239
 this can be changed this can be changed our grandparents our great-grandparents

4242
02:14:23,239 --> 02:14:23,760
 fought

4243
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:26,079
 for our biggest share of the pie and they got it

4244
02:14:26,079 --> 02:14:26,920
 they got healthcare

4245
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:27,960
 they got education

4246
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:30,679
 they got housing they got food

4247
02:14:30,679 --> 02:14:32,599
 our young people can have that as well

4248
02:14:32,599 --> 02:14:36,079
 but they won't get it unless they fight for it so i would encourage people

4249
02:14:36,079 --> 02:14:37,079
 to

4250
02:14:37,079 --> 02:14:42,199
 educate themselves support my work get involved politically but also work hard

4251
02:14:42,199 --> 02:14:46,239
 support your friends and family try and make money because you'll have to

4252
02:14:46,239 --> 02:14:47,800
 if you don't play politics

4253
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:51,960
 i guarantee you the other side will play politics and that means

4254
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:55,800
 your kids and your grandkids live in poverty so you have to do both

4255
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:57,679
 with regards to politicians

4256
02:14:57,679 --> 02:15:00,239
 um i got mixed feelings about a lot of politicians

4257
02:15:00,239 --> 02:15:03,800
 the truth is i think a lot of politicians are very rich and and ultimately

4258
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:05,840
 they don't care they're protected

4259
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:07,280
 a crisis of inequality

4260
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,079
 looks fantastic

4261
02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:08,840
 from the top

4262
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:10,719
 and i think that's why the three of us can sit here and say

4263
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:11,760
 things will be fine

4264
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:12,960
 because for us they will be fine

4265
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:14,320
 and for our kids they will be fine

4266
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:15,000
 but for our viewers

4267
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,159
 kids they won't be fine

4268
02:15:16,159 --> 02:15:19,360
 um the politicians are not going to try and save you

4269
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:21,800
 i'm going to try and make sure they do it but i don't think they will

4270
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:22,159
 listen

4271
02:15:22,159 --> 02:15:23,079
 my plan

4272
02:15:23,079 --> 02:15:25,559
 is not to get concessions from politicians

4273
02:15:25,559 --> 02:15:29,880
 my plan is to get 5 million followers on the internet and bully the politicians

4274
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:33,559
 so that they have to give us what we need so i would support people

4275
02:15:33,559 --> 02:15:37,800
 to get behind me get behind my campaign but also

4276
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:42,639
 understand what's happening educate your friends and your family and just crucially to understand

4277
02:15:42,639 --> 02:15:45,679
 this is going to be a long fight so be strong

4278
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:47,679
 keep your people around you

4279
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:49,440
 but be ready for what's to come

4280
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:53,320
 i am i see hint and some of the things you've said recently of you

4281
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:55,520
 going into politics yourself at some point

4282
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:56,840
 stephen i'm in politics

4283
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:58,480
 but i me politics actively

4284
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:00,880
 listen i i do not want to be an mp

4285
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:01,960
 i do not want to be chancellor

4286
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:03,159
 i do not want to be prime

4287
02:16:03,159 --> 02:16:04,159
 minister

4288
02:16:04,159 --> 02:16:06,960
 if we get to a point where i feel that that is something that is achieved

4289
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,400
 when is the best way to

4290
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:09,840
 fix this problem

4291
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:13,280
 i will be open to it this is not plan a this is not

4292
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:13,960
 you know

4293
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:17,719
 would you like to be prime minister i suspect probably not right like this is

4294
02:16:17,719 --> 02:16:19,480
 i'll be honest i i

4295
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:22,599
 am quite uncomfortable with even the level of um public profile

4296
02:16:22,599 --> 02:16:23,440
 that i have at the moment

4297
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,480
 which is you know it's much less than what you have but it stresses

4298
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:26,199
 me out and

4299
02:16:26,199 --> 02:16:28,599
 it's weird we spoke about it before we were shooting

4300
02:16:28,599 --> 02:16:29,599
 um

4301
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:30,920
 i don't want to can you imagine

4302
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:33,718
 i i don't want to be prime minister i don't want to be an mp

4303
02:16:33,718 --> 02:16:34,318
 um

4304
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:35,959
 but i'm serious about this work that i do

4305
02:16:35,959 --> 02:16:37,920
 and if we reach a point that i think

4306
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,959
 that is the best way to do it

4307
02:16:39,959 --> 02:16:42,439
 i will consider it but i would much rather

4308
02:16:42,439 --> 02:16:44,240
 be able to influence the mps

4309
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:46,519
 from the sideline to influence the politicians from the sidelines

4310
02:16:46,519 --> 02:16:49,398
 and for that person you just gave advice to who should they be voting for

4311
02:16:49,398 --> 02:16:51,558
 well we don't have an election for listen

4312
02:16:51,558 --> 02:16:52,959
 politics is not football

4313
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:54,318
 politics is not football

4314
02:16:54,318 --> 02:16:56,398
 okay this is not about i'm labor i'm conservative

4315
02:16:56,398 --> 02:16:57,040
 i'm republican

4316
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:57,558
 i'm democrat

4317
02:16:57,558 --> 02:16:58,359
 you're losing your houses

4318
02:16:58,359 --> 02:16:58,679
 here

4319
02:16:58,679 --> 02:16:59,718
 you you're losing your houses

4320
02:16:59,718 --> 02:17:00,959
 your kids will be in poverty

4321
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:02,240
 and you're going to see

4322
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:03,879
 both trump and the republicans

4323
02:17:03,879 --> 02:17:04,760
 and karma

4324
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:05,519
 and labor

4325
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:08,240
 who are supposed to be on the opposite side of the political spectrum

4326
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:09,439
 they will both fail

4327
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:12,080
 because they will not take action on growing wealth inequality

4328
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:12,200
 and

4329
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:12,359
 i'll

4330
02:17:12,359 --> 02:17:12,519
 be

4331
02:17:12,519 --> 02:17:12,679
 right

4332
02:17:12,679 --> 02:17:12,799
 on

4333
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:13,000
 that

4334
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:13,120
 you

4335
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:13,318
 know

4336
02:17:13,318 --> 02:17:13,519
 bring

4337
02:17:13,519 --> 02:17:13,679
 me

4338
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:13,799
 back

4339
02:17:13,799 --> 02:17:14,120
 in a few

4340
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:14,318
 years

4341
02:17:14,318 --> 02:17:14,478
 i'll

4342
02:17:14,478 --> 02:17:14,599
 be

4343
02:17:14,599 --> 02:17:14,760
 right

4344
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:15,000
 on

4345
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:15,519
 that

4346
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:15,840
 and

4347
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:20,000
 um that shows you it's not about i think this factionalism

4348
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,120
 is unbelievable

4349
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,280
 damaging to our societies

4350
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:25,679
 especially in the us where there's so much hatred behind it where suddenly

4351
02:17:25,679 --> 02:17:27,080
 i'm on this side you're on that side

4352
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:28,398
 we're going to shake hands after this

4353
02:17:28,398 --> 02:17:28,760
 nothing

4354
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:30,240
 we will you know it's there's no hatred

4355
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:30,718
 here

4356
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:32,558
 but if you allow yourself to be divided

4357
02:17:32,558 --> 02:17:34,000
 from half of your country

4358
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,200
 and you allow we're seeing it growing

4359
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:36,879
 tensions

4360
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:38,679
 racial tensions gender tensions

4361
02:17:38,679 --> 02:17:41,040
 if you allow yourself to be divided

4362
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,679
 they will win they will win so you need to vote for

4363
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:45,718
 whoever is going to protect your houses

4364
02:17:45,718 --> 02:17:47,280
 and if you want to know who that is

4365
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:48,080
 come and check gary's

4366
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:48,478
 economics

4367
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:49,160
 before the election

4368
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:51,760
 and i will tell you who it's going to be

4369
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:56,478
 daniel nice closing arguments personal and social a a few things

4370
02:17:56,478 --> 02:18:00,638
 um i read gary's bookin it's brilliant and regardless of

4371
02:18:00,638 --> 02:18:01,638
 um

4372
02:18:01,638 --> 02:18:03,318
 regardless of whether you actually

4373
02:18:03,318 --> 02:18:04,160
 like economics

4374
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:07,280
 it's a brilliant story it's a really i read it in about two or three days

4375
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:10,359
 um and it'll it'll eventually be a good movie as well

4376
02:18:10,359 --> 02:18:12,558
 um i agree with a lot of what gary's saying

4377
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:17,638
 um there is a collapse of the middle class and it probably will get worse

4378
02:18:17,638 --> 02:18:18,599
 and

4379
02:18:18,599 --> 02:18:19,398
 the traditional

4380
02:18:19,398 --> 02:18:20,558
 middle class jobs

4381
02:18:20,558 --> 02:18:22,160
 that came out of the back of the industrial

4382
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:22,599
 age

4383
02:18:22,599 --> 02:18:23,080
 mature

4384
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:23,599
 industrial

4385
02:18:23,599 --> 02:18:24,280
 revolution

4386
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:25,280
 system

4387
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:31,398
 th those are collapsing and it's globalizing we're seeing technology move opportunities all over the world

4388
02:18:31,398 --> 02:18:35,478
 um and wealth inequality it has a cause

4389
02:18:35,478 --> 02:18:37,879
 wealth inequality itself is a scoreboard

4390
02:18:37,879 --> 02:18:40,439
 and there's a cause for what led up to wealth inequality

4391
02:18:40,439 --> 02:18:42,840
 and the cause in my mind is technology

4392
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:46,840
 technology is moving the those opportunities around and it's changing things

4393
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:48,160
 we already have big governments

4394
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:51,638
 we have huge amounts of taxes we're at record levels of tax taes

4395
02:18:51,638 --> 02:18:53,040
 um

4396
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:55,359
 wealth has never been more mobile

4397
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:57,439
 it's not about what's fair it's about what you can practically

4398
02:18:57,439 --> 02:18:58,920
 get away with it's about what you can

4399
02:18:58,920 --> 02:18:59,519
 actually

4400
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:00,519
 implement

4401
02:19:00,519 --> 02:19:02,080
 um and

4402
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,120
 it's going to be very very

4403
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:05,318
 as gary said it's going to be very very very hard

4404
02:19:05,318 --> 02:19:06,840
 to tax people who have digital

4405
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:07,439
 businesses

4406
02:19:07,439 --> 02:19:10,280
 who can live and work from anywhere i know that firsthand

4407
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:11,799
 um that it's incredibly

4408
02:19:11,799 --> 02:19:12,799
 mobile

4409
02:19:12,799 --> 02:19:17,359
 with that said at a micro level oh sorry at a macro level big picture

4410
02:19:17,359 --> 02:19:19,558
 we do know that there is a correlation

4411
02:19:19,558 --> 02:19:20,879
 between economic freedom

4412
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:22,599
 where the government gets out of your way

4413
02:19:22,599 --> 02:19:24,240
 and low poverty rates

4414
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:27,240
 and we know that as soon as governments become big

4415
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:29,120
 high taxes high regulations

4416
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:30,718
 it actually drops down

4417
02:19:30,718 --> 02:19:35,478
 a category and we see poverty goes up from 10% to 30% so triples

4418
02:19:35,478 --> 02:19:36,679
 um so

4419
02:19:36,679 --> 02:19:41,120
 constricting economic freedom is never a good idea if you look at the data

4420
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,760
 at a micro level there's never been a greater opportunity

4421
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:46,959
 for anyone who's ambitious and entrepreneurial

4422
02:19:46,959 --> 02:19:48,519
 to go and start a company

4423
02:19:48,519 --> 02:19:50,399
 it's cheaper than ever to start a company

4424
02:19:50,399 --> 02:19:53,600
 you can do what gary's done which is publish content

4425
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:55,439
 build a following

4426
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:57,760
 figure out how to monetize it

4427
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:01,240
 you can create products and services and sell them to anywhere in the world

4428
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:04,280
 um you're an example of someone who started with nothing and became a millionaire

4429
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:04,960
 in your 20s

4430
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:06,760
 and then again in your 30s with a completely

4431
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:07,640
 different thing

4432
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:08,720
 he became a millionaire

4433
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:09,439
 in his 20s

4434
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:11,479
 and then again in his 30s is's a bestselling

4435
02:20:11,479 --> 02:20:13,000
 author and a content creator

4436
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,120
 i did it in my 20s my 30s and now my 40s

4437
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:17,920
 um starting from scratch

4438
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:18,720
 so

4439
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,760
 it's it's not normal that three guys

4440
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:23,040
 our agage could have done that over and over again

4441
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:26,000
 it's because we are living in a time where there is incredible

4442
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:26,880
 opportunities

4443
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:29,200
 but you have to be tapped into those opportunities

4444
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:32,479
 you never heard about it at school you never heard about it at university

4445
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:33,920
 you're going to have to learn the skills

4446
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:36,479
 to get tapped into those opp opportunities

4447
02:20:36,479 --> 02:20:38,000
 but there are definitely

4448
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,240
 ways that you can succeed

4449
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:40,680
 in the world that we're living in

4450
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:43,359
 and on that macro point who should we be voting for because some of your

4451
02:20:43,359 --> 02:20:44,760
 thinking in policy

4452
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:45,280
 suggestions

4453
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:48,280
 through this conversation align more with trump elon

4454
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:51,439
 the american mission now where they're welcoming millionaires

4455
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:52,840
 they're trying to create a really entrepreneurship

4456
02:20:52,840 --> 02:20:53,680
 friendly environment

4457
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:55,240
 they're doing the doge dismantling

4458
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:56,880
 of sort of government waste

4459
02:20:56,880 --> 02:21:00,160
 i i agree with gary it's not football you don't have a team you swing

4460
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:01,600
 you should be a swing voter

4461
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:02,800
 you should vote

4462
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:04,359
 every single election

4463
02:21:04,359 --> 02:21:06,240
 you should make them work hard for your vote

4464
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:07,760
 and you should is trump going to succeed

4465
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:09,800
 though you should see it's too soon to tell

4466
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:10,720
 but he made a prediction

4467
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:12,040
 so i'm inviting you to make a prediction

4468
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:14,240
 he said five years time we come back here we're going to see that trump

4469
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:14,520
 i think

4470
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:15,280
 i think a lot of

4471
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:15,520
 very

4472
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:15,800
 wealthy

4473
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:16,600
 people are going to move

4474
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:18,000
 move to the usa

4475
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,640
 um you're going to get a lot of people from all over the world he's playing

4476
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:21,240
 to win

4477
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:21,920
 and he wants

4478
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:23,359
 rich people and entrepreneurs

4479
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:23,960
 and investors

4480
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:28,680
 to come into the us and be based there he's creating golden visas and open visas

4481
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:33,880
 and the success metric here is the middle class get richer and more affluent

4482
02:21:33,880 --> 02:21:34,640
 what i actually

4483
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:38,240
 think will happen as a result of all of that you will see rising living standards

4484
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:39,479
 in the usa

4485
02:21:39,479 --> 02:21:41,560
 and you'll see a detriment

4486
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,880
 to the places where those people live

4487
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:45,319
 it's not a good thing

4488
02:21:45,319 --> 02:21:49,080
 to have the people who pay the majority of the taxes which is 1%

4489
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:51,000
 of people paying 30% of taxes

4490
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,359
 if those people leave

4491
02:21:52,359 --> 02:21:53,080
 the bills

4492
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:54,760
 get spread across everybody else

4493
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:57,720
 well we'll have to do a part two and we shall see

4494
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:58,280
 um

4495
02:21:58,280 --> 02:21:59,240
 i want to thank you both

4496
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:00,240
 for the work that you do

4497
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:00,479
 because

4498
02:22:00,479 --> 02:22:01,760
 i'm a big fan of both of you

4499
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:02,399
 i watch gary's

4500
02:22:02,399 --> 02:22:03,880
 videos all the time helps me to

4501
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:04,840
 understand another perspective

4502
02:22:04,840 --> 02:22:07,319
 on what i'm typically hearing out out on the internet

4503
02:22:07,319 --> 02:22:09,960
 or that i hear on twitter about what's going on in the world

4504
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:10,840
 and i think i really

4505
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:11,200
 respect

4506
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:11,720
 and admire

4507
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:14,080
 people that can do what both of you have done today

4508
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:18,640
 which is to exchange and listen to ideas in the pursuit of answers

4509
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:20,520
 and that's why i'd highly recommend anybody

4510
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:23,359
 regardless of whether you agree with everything or some things or

4511
02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:24,800
 or or just a little bit

4512
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:27,840
 to go and follow gary's channel on youtube called gary's economics

4513
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,120
 because it's a great source of

4514
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:30,880
 information

4515
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:35,120
 from someone who has done it from understands the world from another perspective but also

4516
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:36,600
 someone who's providing a narrative

4517
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:39,160
 which i actually think there's we kind of talked about before you started

4518
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:41,040
 there's a big gap in the market for

4519
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:42,160
 there are a lot of people

4520
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:44,600
 like me and dan out on the internet that are talking about entrepreneurship

4521
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:46,359
 and finance and how to make money

4522
02:22:46,359 --> 02:22:51,120
 but there aren't enough people talking about wealth inequality from the perspective as gary sees

4523
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:54,200
 um and that are providing more sort of

4524
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:56,680
 collectivist and sort of society

4525
02:22:56,680 --> 02:22:57,680
 wide

4526
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:02,800
 solutions and answers and sort of explanations as to why that's ultimately happening

4527
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:04,120
 i do think

4528
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:07,040
 i do think because i know you dan i hope i know myself

4529
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:10,040
 i do think that we we all want

4530
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:11,960
 the uk to survive

4531
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:14,720
 and i think we all believe that the way that the uk survives

4532
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:18,120
 isn't necessarily a couple of ultra rich people getting more money

4533
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:19,000
 it is

4534
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,640
 sort of social mobility and it's allowing people that are at the very bottom

4535
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:26,600
 to create opportunities and to succeed we all agree upon that even if we agree

4536
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:30,279
 disagree sorry on the causes and the solutions to that

4537
02:23:30,279 --> 02:23:30,640
 um

4538
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:31,600
 i'd also highly recommend

4539
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:32,960
 everybody to go check out the trading

4540
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:33,720
 game because everybody's

4541
02:23:33,720 --> 02:23:35,279
 talking about this this book and

4542
02:23:35,279 --> 02:23:37,479
 i think it's what four weeks at the moment on the sunday

4543
02:23:37,479 --> 02:23:37,800
 times

4544
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:38,200
 besteller

4545
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:38,600
 list

4546
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:40,040
 four weeks number one number one

4547
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:41,680
 four weeks number one

4548
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:42,120
 which is

4549
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:42,560
 an incredible

4550
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:42,880
 achievement

4551
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:45,439
 but it speaks to what's in this book the way that the story is told

4552
02:23:45,439 --> 02:23:46,319
 but also

4553
02:23:46,319 --> 02:23:47,120
 the timeliness

4554
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:47,920
 of this message

4555
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:48,800

4556
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:50,880
 everybody to go check it out i'm going to put a link below

4557

02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:53,680
 um

4560
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:54,600
 the the testimonials

4561
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:55,920
 for this book it's

4562
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:58,439
 profound i hear people describe it as like

4563
02:23:58,439 --> 02:23:59,080
 unforgettable

4564
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:00,560
 on one end and then sad

4565
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:02,120
 on the other end because that's the

4566
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:02,960
 nature of the reality

4567
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:05,279
 it speaks to and i highly recommend everybody to go check out

 is drinking matcha

4578
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:25,319
 and there's a good chance that that matcha you're drinking

4579
02:24:25,319 --> 02:24:26,399
 is made by a company

4580
02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:27,120
 that i've invested

4581
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:28,040
 more than seven figures

4582
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:28,399

4583
02:24:28,399 --> 02:24:29,200

 ted

4587
02:24:31,880 --> 02:24:35,560
 because they're the brand used globally by cafes like blank street coffee

4588
02:24:35,560 --> 02:24:36,560
 and joe and the juice

4589
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:37,560

 in seconds

4594
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:47,399
 using our flavored matcha powders that i have here in front of me

4595
02:24:47,399 --> 02:24:49,520

 grade and source from japan it is smooth

4597
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:55,040
 it is naturally sweet not like those bitter grassy

4598
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:55,560
 matches

4599
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:56,200
 that i tried

4600
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:56,840
 before perfect

4601
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:57,160

 you don't like matcha

4604
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:03,800
