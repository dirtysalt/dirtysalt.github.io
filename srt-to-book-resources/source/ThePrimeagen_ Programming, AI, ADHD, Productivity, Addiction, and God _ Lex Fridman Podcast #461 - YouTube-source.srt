00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,000
- The following is a conversation with Michael Paulson,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,450
better known online as ThePrimeagen.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,120
He is a programmer who has entertained

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,480
and inspired millions of people to have fun building stuff

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,660
with software, whether you're a newbie

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,010
or a seasoned developer who has been battling it out

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,770
in the software engineering trenches for decades.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,030
In short, ThePrimeagen is a legendary programmer

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,360
and a great human being with an inspiring roller coaster

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,950
of a life story.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,960

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,587
And now, dear friends, here's ThePrimeagen.

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,820
What do you love most about programming?

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,950
What brings you joy when you program?

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,090
- I can tell you the first time

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,100
that I ever felt love in programming,

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,930
or felt that joy or that excitement-

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,120
- Sure. - Which was in college.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,510
It was the second class, data structures,

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,880
and the teacher that was teaching, Ray Babcock,

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,860
he was talking about linked lists.

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,459
Now you have to learn Java at Montana State University

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,340
when I went, and so he's off there explaining

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,510
this whole linked list thing and all that,

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,827
and then he shows code.

28
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:14,160
And in the code it's like abstract class node

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,990
or whatever it was, I can't remember what it was.

30
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,217
And then it had a private member,

31
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:19,800
and that private member was of type node,

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,210
and I've never seen that before.

33
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,010
It is a class that is called node

34
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,170
with a member that is of itself.

35
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,950
And for the first time ever I was like, "Oh my gosh."

36
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,870
Like there's no end.

37
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,810
There's no way to iterate. This is not a set of 10 items.

38
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,660
This is a set of infinite items.

39
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,480
And so my mind kind of exploded in that moment.

40
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,280
Like, there is actually...

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,660
What you can express is huge.

42
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,460
I can see what memory looks like.

43
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,160
I can see this hopping through space.

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,870
And I just remember being just so blown away,

45
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,037
because up until that point, everything was just,

46
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:52,320
all right, I have a list of 10 items.

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,390
I have a list of 20 items, right?

48
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,700
It was very rigid and small,

49
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,250
and the things I built were really small and trivial,

50
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,310
and all of a sudden I felt like I could build anything

51
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,143
in that one moment.

52
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:04,350
And it was so amazing.

53
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,200
I just remember sitting in class for,

54
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,950
I don't even remember

55
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,330
how long those classes were or anything,

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,490
but I just remember being just completely,

57
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,430
like profoundly impacted by this notion.

58
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,296
And so I just sat there and I watched,

59
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,900
and I had the exact same experience in heaven's forbid

60
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,250
by a software engineering class,

61
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,720
when we talked about the Decorator pattern,

62
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,610
where you can keep on constructing these objects

63
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,443
in this recursive way.

64
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,640
Not that I think that's actually a good idea to do,

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,410
but just watching that and realizing there's

66
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,920
so many weird and unique ways you can solve problems,

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,940
and you can just...

68
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,710
Anything your mind can think of, you can just create that.

69
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,700
And I just remember getting just so excited

70
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,760
about the possibility that anything is possible.

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,360
- Yeah, let's wax philosophical about a linked list.

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,830
It is pretty profound.

73
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,650
For people who don't know, a node in a linked list

74
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,840
doesn't know anything about the world it's in.

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,640
It only knows about the thing it's linked to, its neighbor.

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,540
Maybe that's symbolic. It's a metaphor for all of us humans.

77
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,100
There's billions of us on this planet

78
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,680
and we only know about our local little network.

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,330
- Yeah. - And it's kind of beautiful.

80
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,530
And you realize in that little simple data structure,

81
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,710
you can construct arbitrarily large systems,

82
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,250
and they're like roots that go through memory.

83
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,360
And then of course,

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,130
that's where you get all the programming languages

85
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,940
that allow you to dump junk into memory

86
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,690
and have memory leaks, and therefore create infinite pain

87
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,303
as you try to figure out where that unfreed memory is.

88
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,160
For me, yeah, probably...

89
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,810
It's so beautiful the way you put that.

90
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,850
Linked lists are indeed beautiful.

91
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,310
Recursion also for me,

92
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,220
when I finally wrapped my brain around

93
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,860
what it means to write a recursive function.

94
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,137
- What was the thing? What was one that taught you?

95
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:54,129
Because I think we all probably...

96
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:55,440
You probably did factorial,

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,040
where you just do a quick factorial of it.

98
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,250
It just doesn't hit home.

99
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,440
What was the thing that made it hit home?

100
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,190
- I don't remember the first. (chuckles)

101
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,930
- I remember my first.

102
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,025
How do you not remember your first? It was magic.

103
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,114
- I've had so many that just...

104
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:12,210
- I mean, you are a Lisp guy.

105
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,190
You're probably pretty used to the recursion.

106
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,100
- Yeah, all I remember is just surrounded

107
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,709
by sea of parentheses.

108
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,410
I mean that's really, probably, when I...

109
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,920
In high school, I think it was either Java or C++.

110
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,300
Wow, how do I not remember that?

111
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,989
It must have been C++.

112
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,980
And then college it was,

113
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,580
the generic bullshit software engineering classes were Java,

114
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,920
but then the renegades, the cool kids, were all using Lisp.

115
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,600
That's when you're doing the AI,

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,557
the quote-unquote "AI" at that time, that was Lisp.

117
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:52,757
If you want to write a chess engine, you would use Lisp.

118
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:57,240
And so for me, probably the moment I really fell in love

119
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,660
with programming was Lisp,

120
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,890
and writing Othello programs and chess engines,

121
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,803
all kinds of engines that play a game,

122
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:08,790
and then I could play against that thing

123
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,380
and that thing would beat me.

124
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,950
The joy of being destroyed by the thing you've created.

125
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,570
And oh, game of life too. Cellular automata.

126
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,830
That's when I...

127
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,230
I built that, you know, all kinds of programming languages.

128
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,060
That's less about programming languages

129
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,947
and more about the system you create.

130
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:30,570
And that just filled me with infinite joy, having...

131
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,850
Now similar to the linked list situation,

132
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,910
creating a system where each individual cell

133
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,610
only knows about its neighbors

134
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,030
and operates in very simple rules.

135
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,430
But when you take that system as a whole

136
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,140
and allow it to evolve over time,

137
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,150
you can create infinite complexity.

138
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,220
So I just...

139
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,950
Man, those are many pothead moments,

140
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,340
where I'm just looking at the beautiful complexity

141
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,380
that can be created with cellular automata.

142
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,040
That filled me with just infinite joy, for sure.

143
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,320
But yeah, all I remember is parentheses.

144
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,300
So my first, memories of my first are drowned

145
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,013
in a sea of parentheses.

146
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,160
- Oh man, mine is, I have...

147
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
Well, first off, mine was in Java,

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,370
so my first was a little bit more rigid,

149
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,900
kind of a corporate, you know, a corporate experience.

150
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,390
- Yeah. - But...

151
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,580
- Cold, meaningless. - Cold. Yeah.

152
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,930
I was in a lab, everyone was using CentOS at that...

153
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,973
Or CentOS or however you say.

154
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:29,978
I always called it CentOS, the fresh maker.

155
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:30,959
- Yeah. - And so it's just like

156
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,310
I'm in this very cold... (Lex laughs)

157
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,660
- That's nice. - Thank you.

158
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,010
- Yeah. - I'm in this cold,

159
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,580
rigid environment with my Microsoft keyboard,

160
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,900
programming away in Java.

161
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,080
And I still have just such, this memory of despair,

162
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,070
because I love programming, this was after the linked list,

163
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,520
and I cannot figure out recursion.

164
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,510
And so I go to the university store and I buy a book

165
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,490
and it's Deitel and Deitel learn Java

166
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,720
and it has a section, Recursion,

167
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,037
so I open it up and I start reading it,

168
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:02,520
and it just doesn't hit home. And I'm spiraling into this.

169
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,010
Like, maybe I'm not a programmer.

170
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,200
Maybe I'm not worthy enough to enter

171
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,880
into this circle of people who can figure out

172
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,818
what the heck recursion means.

173
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:13,482
And Deitel and Deitel's, I still remember this,

174
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:14,917
their exact phrase was,

175
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,520
"Every young budding developer

176
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,380
solves this recursion program,"

177
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,390
and it was the Tower of Hanoi.

178
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,223
And guess what?

179
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:25,053
I don't know if I can solve the Tower of Hanoi to this day.

180
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:28,950
It's a very hard recursive problem.

181
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,800
And I just sat there and thought, "Oh my gosh.

182
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,210
I'm not going to make it."

183
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,870
And I sat there in the lab for 8 hours, 10 hours

184
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,060
doing these things, so worried.

185
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,360
It's the week of recursion, we have to do a lab assignment.

186
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,193
I'm not going to be able to do it.

187
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:46,830
And I just remember being genuinely worried about that.

188
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,000
And then, because I always...

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,220
My big problem was like, okay, do factorial.

190
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,110
Why not just use a for loop?

191
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,970
Okay, what about Fibonacci sequence?

192
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,440
Why not use a for loop?

193
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,570
I don't understand. What's the purpose of recursion?

194
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,210
I don't understand it, yet it's so powerful. Why?

195
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,130
It looks like a really complicated for loop.

196
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,140
And so I just could not understand it.

197
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,980
And then lab came that day and it was,

198
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,930
I'm gonna give you a 2D array you have to read from a file.

199
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,890
This is what a starting position looks like.

200
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,330
This is what an ending position looks like.

201
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,650
This is what a wall looks like.

202
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,620
I want you to find me a path through the maze.

203
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,030
So I just sat there like,

204
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,249
Okay, well, I guess I can just go up

205
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:25,050
and I can create a visited grid,

206
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,120
so I know not to visit these places anymore.

207
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
And then all of a sudden it just started clicking.

208
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,400
Like, well, wait a second.

209
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,200
I don't know the maze, but if I just go

210
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,330
up, right, down, and left,

211
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,520
and hop back every time I've been to that square,

212
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,460
don't visit it, like, I can just, it will just go forever.

213
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,720
And I realized in that moment,

214
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,220
I'm like, I actually understand recur...

215
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,350
I've understood recursion this whole time,

216
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,580
I just never had a problem

217
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,950
in which it actually made sense to use.

218
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,630
And that was my big downfall,

219
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,110
is that I was measuring my understanding with the problems

220
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,200
that I had available, which were just list traversal,

221
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,677
which is not a good use of recursion.

222
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:59,490
And so I just remember that freeing...

223
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,570
Oh, man. Recursion.

224
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,800
It was a great moment in my life.

225
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,220
- I mean it does require, to be fair, a leap of faith,

226
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,620
because people will tell you,

227
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,970
those conformist, dogmatic,

228
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,240
Java instructors will tell you,

229
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,890
that this is important, to understand recursion.

230
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,780
But it takes a leap of faith that is something,

231
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,060
this is a different way of looking at the world,

232
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,980
and it's a powerful way of looking at the world.

233
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,970
Actually remembered when I...

234
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,040
Think I first...

235
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
I think I remember my first now.

236
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,540
- [ThePrimeagen] All right.

237
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,500
(Lex chuckles)

238
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,420
- I think it was dev first search for one of the games.

239
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,700
Maybe Othello, something like that,

240
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,890
and for that implementing recursion.

241
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,620
Understand that you can search trajectories

242
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,820
through the space of states and do that recursively?

243
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,960
That was mind blowing.

244
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,420
Just imagining like...

245
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,340
- You can just see it all. - The possibilities.

246
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,810
Yeah. Just like numbers flying.

247
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,403
It was like The Beautiful Mind.

248
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:09,441
And that's when I also discovered conspiracy theories.

249
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:10,274
(Lex and ThePrimeagen chuckle)

250
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:11,220
That was...

251
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,590
And I just saw, I saw the truth.

252
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,423
Okay. Yeah.

253
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:15,690
So what were we talking about?

254
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,690
Oh, what was the most painful aspect of programming for you?

255
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,750
What memories do you have of deep, profound suffering

256
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,810
in terms of programming in the early days?

257
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,490
- I would say the biggest one that I can really hold on to

258
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,953
had to be one of two experiences.

259
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,050
The first experience was

260
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,920
when I was at a place called Schedulicity, and...

261
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,900
Am I not allowed to say the place-

262
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,890
- You're allowed.

263
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,723
There is...

264
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:45,930
- I'm not sure if they're even operating still

265
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,763
at this point, but they're in-

266
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:48,600
- There was something funny about the name. I'm sorry.

267
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,190
- Oh, Schedulicity? Yeah.

268
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,770
Actually, the name was so bad that

269
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,800
when you looked at their paid-for Google ad terms

270
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,633
that they would make sure

271
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:57,960
that they're at the top of the list,

272
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,580
the spellings were just insane,

273
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,100
because no one knew how to spell the word Schedulicity,

274
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,900
and so, it was just like this,

275
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,230
the Google optimizing for that is just hilarious.

276
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,540
But okay, go back to the thing.

277
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,760
The thing that kills me the most about programming,

278
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,000
what I actually considered the worst aspect of programming,

279
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,890
is when you know everything.

280
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,780
And so when I was at this job,

281
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,240
it's just every single day I'd come in,

282
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,360
there were no surprises, there was no questions.

283
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,890
I didn't understand the code base, sure, that's fair.

284
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,080
I didn't understand all the things about the code base.

285
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,620
But I knew I was gonna go in,

286
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,040
I was gonna generate some sort of object from the database.

287
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,660
I was gonna take that object from the database,

288
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,950
and I was just gonna map it over

289
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,450
and just display it on the webpage.

290
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,610
There's no creativity, there's nothing to it.

291
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,790
It's very almost factory line kind of work.

292
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,564
And that was a very difficult moment for me, which is...

293
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,603
I didn't enjoy programming,

294
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:49,530
because I knew everything about it.

295
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,870
I already knew exactly what I was gonna do that day.

296
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,270
I knew all the hurdles I was gonna have to go over.

297
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,120
There was no unknown unknowns, if you will.

298
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,390
It was just knowns at all times.

299
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,347
And it just, that is...

300
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,960
And for me, that is the worst part about programming,

301
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,460
is when you already know the solution

302
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,590
and it's just a matter of how fast you can type

303
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,080
and get it out from your head to your hands.

304
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,640
- So the absence of uncertainty,

305
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,370
the absence of challenge, was the pain?

306
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,690
- Yeah.

307
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,060
- That's pretty profound, Prime.

308
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,225
- I'm more than just good looks. I want you to know that.

309
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:21,900
(Lex and ThePrimeagen chuckles)

310
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,760
- It's a low bar.

311
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,350
What do you identify as?

312
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,390
I'm enjoying asking the general question.

313
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,010
- 38, male.

314
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,843
- Male.

315
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:30,930
- Husband of beautiful wife.

316
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,763
- Okay.

317
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:34,500
You stream about all kinds of programming,

318
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,283
but what kind of programmer are you?

319
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:41,580
Are you full-stack developer, web programming?

320
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,050
And maybe can you lay out

321
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,210
all the different kinds of programming

322
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,120
and then place yourself in that, in terms of your identity.

323
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,260
Sexual identity as well.

324
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,166
- Yeah, I can get it, we can put it all in there.

325
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,180
- Okay.

326
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,500
- Plus, obviously those two are very, very tightly coupled.

327
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,620
- I have seen you on the border of sexually aroused

328
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,490
by certain languages.

329
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,910
I think you got real excited about OCaml, or...

330
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:05,463
- OCaml. Let's go.

331
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,980
Thank you Dillon Mulroy.

332
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,523
- Okay, wow. - Yeah.

333
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,130
- I did not expect that.

334
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,710
That escalated quickly. Anyway, what do you identify as?

335
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,040
- Okay, so first let's do the previous

336
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,600
or the in-between question first,

337
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,550
which is the different archetypes.

338
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,500
I think that's a really interesting kind of question,

339
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,930
because if you go on Twitter or you're new,

340
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,070
your thoughts are probably

341
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,860
that there is just web programming,

342
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,850
and maybe there's some other stuff,

343
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,260
yeah, like game programming, but you'd be like,

344
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,140
game programming in JavaScript and on the web.

345
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,310
There's this very myopic view of the programming world,

346
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,890
and I bet if you ask a lot of people these days

347
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,050
what is the most popular form of programming,

348
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,310
they'd probably say web.

349
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,800
If you said what contains the most amount of repos,

350
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,470
how many percentage of repos on GitHub are web-based,

351
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,200
they probably say 90% or some huge number.

352
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,033
But the reality is

353
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,837
that there's an entire embedded robotics world.

354
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:59,340
You know, you're familiar with the ML side of things.

355
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,890
There's networking, there's gonna be just performance,

356
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,870
operating systems, compilers.

357
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,790
There's just huge amounts of variation

358
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,950
of all these different types of programming verticals

359
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,783
that you can be.

360
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:10,920
And so we often talk about programming

361
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,530
in perspective of web, or something that's pretty narrow,

362
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,870
and I think that's just a social construct of Twitter

363
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,740
more than anything else,

364
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,950
that actually I don't believe it's that representative

365
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,707
of the entire programming world out there.

366
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:25,050
And I think a lot of programming's really, really fun.

367
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,100
There's some really great stuff.

368
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,933
Building your own language

369
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,760
is just a very fun experience to do.

370
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,320
Every programmer should just do that once,

371
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,950
just to have a completely different perspective

372
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,540
on how things work in life.

373
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,860
But as far as what do I do,

374
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,200
I've always looked at myself as a tools engineer.

375
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,500
So at my time, at my jobs, typically

376
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,357
I would start off on the UI, and then they'd be like,

377
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:48,390
"Okay, well hey, we need a library for this thing."

378
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,190
So then I'd be the one writing the library.

379
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,540
So in 2012, 2013, I was writing a UI library

380
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,570
for the web that can behave just like an iPad,

381
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,610
so you can pinch and zoom on it, but it's still a web page.

382
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,080
Because we didn't have any of that stuff back then.

383
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,200
It was a canvas, had to do all the matrices operations

384
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,100
and all that stuff to kind of...

385
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,660
- Nice. - You know, it felt like

386
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,510
you're on an iPad, but it actually wasn't on an iPad.

387
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,560
And this was iPad 2 by the way, so this is a long time ago.

388
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,727
And so every single time I got into a job it's like,

389
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:17,400
"Okay, hey, we need to do a library.

390
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,350
Hey, can you work on a build system?"

391
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,990
So back then there was no Grunt, there was no gulp,

392
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,130
there was no any of those things,

393
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,640
so I had to hand roll my own JavaScript build system.

394
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,190
And so I always fell into these positions of building tools

395
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,410
for developers to be successful.

396
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,390
And I've always really enjoyed that region.

397
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,710
So as I went on to say Netflix, spent 10 years there,

398
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,320
I'd say the majority of my 10 years were building things

399
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,950
for developers to use

400
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,720
that they could be successful at their job.

401
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,820
And so I've always really enjoyed that aspect,

402
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,190
because your stakeholders and the people

403
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,290
that use your program understand programming

404
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,630
and they're gonna say, "Hey, I need this."

405
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,260
And typically the thing that they need, they actually want.

406
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,750
Whereas with people, people want stuff,

407
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,940
but what they actually need versus what they actually want

408
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,883
often are this weird separation.

409
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,137
That's like the old Henry Ford quote,

410
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:09,210
"I just want a faster horse,"

411
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,950
and he's like, "No, what you actually want is a car."

412
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,080
And so it's like, you have to play this game

413
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,030
of trying to really figure it out,

414
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,990
whereas developers, it's like,

415
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,600
I know, you know what I'm doing, I know what you want.

416
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,160
Let's figure it out together."

417
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,283
- That's actually, that gives you

418
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:24,030
a really nice big-picture view of programming in general.

419
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,410
So I love the idea of just starting at the interface,

420
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,570
like you need to pinch and all that kind of stuff,

421
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,610
and then figure out the entire thing

422
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,059
that requires to make that happen,

423
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,860
including maybe the side quest tooling,

424
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,630
how to make it more productive and efficient,

425
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,463
all that kind of stuff.

426
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:43,200
So the entirety of the thing. That's really cool.

427
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,633
Okay, so that mean that would be full stack?

428
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,560
By that general definition of full stack, meaning like...

429
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,393
- [ThePrimeagen] Perhaps, yeah.

430
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:54,240
- Versus systems engineer, like starting at the bottom

431
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,510
and trying to optimize a certain kind of specific thing

432
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,890
without seeing the big picture

433
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,091
of what the resulting interface would look like.

434
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:05,099
And a lot of people in web programming,

435
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,683
they never go beyond the front-end of how a thing looks.

436
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:10,083
They kind of always assume there'll be somebody,

437
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,980
some grunt in the shadows,

438
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,300
in the darkness of the basement,

439
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,010
that will implement the back end.

440
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,089
- Some Gilfoyle out there

441
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,196
will be doing the back end. - Gilfoyle. Yeah.

442
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:22,079
- Yeah, I like to call myself a generalist,

443
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,032
just to give some ideas.

444
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,109
At one point at Netflix I built the WebSocket connection.

445
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:31,590
So for TVs, how WebSocket works is code I just wrote.

446
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,120
And so I built the framing thing,

447
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,800
and before that I was doing stuff with memory,

448
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,080
and before that I built a UI for a tool.

449
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,607
Right? I can just do the thing.

450
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:39,900
You just tell me the thing to do

451
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,826
and I'll just go do the thing. I worry to...

452
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:46,419
I don't try to get super good at one specific activity.

453
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,300
I don't want to be a Kubernetes engineer,

454
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,100
who's the world's greatest employer,

455
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,720
but if I had to go learn Kubernetes,

456
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,237
I'd go learn it and learn how to deploy some things,

457
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:56,820
and then hopefully move on to the next thing,

458
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,350
if that makes sense.

459
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,780
- I posted about the fact that I'm talking to you on Reddit,

460
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,210
and there's a lot of wonderful questions.

461
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,730
Somebody mentioned that I should ask you about DevOps.

462
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,310
Can you explain what DevOps is?

463
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,630
Is it a kind of special ops of programmers,

464
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,340
is it SEAL Team Six of developers?

465
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,230
What's DevOps? Can you define?

466
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,490
Are you a DevOps engineer?

467
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,770
- Well, people keep telling me DevOps isn't real.

468
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,630
There's actually, you want platform engineers,

469
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,733
cloud engineers, infra engineers.

470
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,850
I just often think the easiest way,

471
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,970
if we're doing just some basic nomenclature,

472
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,740
it's just DevOps are the people that make sure

473
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,590
that when you launch a service and all of that,

474
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,120
it doesn't just disappear, right?

475
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,730
It's all the backbone of being able to operate

476
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,260
something at scale.

477
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,670
Like really don't, if you think about it,

478
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,160
if you're just writing a mom-and-pa website,

479
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,950
people that do PHP that are doing WordPress and all that,

480
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,820
they're going to build something,

481
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,863
they're going to hand it off to, I don't know,

482
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,810
Linode, DigitalOcean, some company.

483
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,870
They don't really need a really complicated build,

484
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,130
deployment, all this.

485
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,200
It's just someone with a simple website

486
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,460
so they can sell their goods.

487
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,767
And so they don't really need that.

488
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,510
And so that's kind of how I think of a DevOps,

489
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,160
is when things need to scale,

490
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,920
that's kind of the person you hire.

491
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,510
- Yeah, those people are actually amazing.

492
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,800
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.

493
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,500
- The time I spent at Google, it's like, oh, yeah, yeah,

494
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,090
there's all these fancy machine learning people,

495
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,090
but the folks that are running the infrastructure,

496
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,210
basically that make sure that shit doesn't go down,

497
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,580
they're like wizards, and they're essential.

498
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,980
- It's a very incredible vertical of job.

499
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,020
And obviously I'm using a very broad term to describe,

500
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,910
I'm sure, like a bunch...

501
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,410
You know, because making sure stuff doesn't go down,

502
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,420
you could also say that's an SRE, right?

503
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,950
Site reliability engineer.

504
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,430
Whatever, the ones that wear the bomber jackets at Google.

505
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,050
And so when we say DevOps,

506
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,610
I think people get very particular

507
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,350
about terms specifically in this category.

508
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,183
They're like, "Well actually,

509
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,300
you're mentioning infrastructure engineer

510
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,163
versus site reliability engineer."

511
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:48,870
It's just like, "Okay, yes, I hear you,"

512
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,940
but generally when someone thinks DevOps,

513
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,130
they think somebody that manages the servers

514
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,230
and their life cycles and the reliability.

515
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,563
There's DevOps.

516
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,860
Is it real? I'm not sure.

517
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,760
- [Lex] Okay.

518
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,370
- Did Vercel kill DevOps?

519
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,660
- Question mark? - Question mark.

520
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,390
- Yeah. Wow, you're almost a journalist.

521
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,353
That's a headline.

522
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,830
Let's go back to the beginning.

523
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,420
- All right. - Baby Prime.

524
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,370
So you mentioned Netflix.

525
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,510
You've...

526
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,580
- Oh, I worked at Netflix by the way.

527
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,320
- For people who don't know who ThePrimeagen is,

528
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,550
he mentions the fact that he has been very successful

529
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,760
and has worked at Netflix in basically every other sentence.

530
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,270
- Correct. Almost as much as I mention Neovim.

531
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,970
- Oh, great. Tell me more about Neovim.

532
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,560
No, please don't.

533
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,413
So, baby Prime. At the very beginning.

534
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,619
You've had one hell of a life,

535
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,720
and I think it's inspiring to a lot of people.

536
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:54,649
you've come out of that to become a successful programmer

537
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:57,899
and a person that inspires a huge number of people

538
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:01,519
to get into programming, and just to find success in life.

539
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,639
So maybe, I would love it if you laid out

540
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,039
just your whole life journey from the beginning.

541
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,949
- So I guess if we're gonna start with this whole journey,

542
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:11,329
I think it's probably best to start to

543
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,339
when I was about four or five years old.

544
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,252
That was the first time I was ever exposed to pornography,

545
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:19,939
and it's kind of just earwormed me

546
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:22,309
for a large portion of my life.

547
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:24,859
And so I don't think there was a day that didn't go by

548
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,289
from when I was a very young lad all the way up

549
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:29,509
until I was twenty-some years old

550
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:32,329
where I didn't think about porn on the daily basis.

551
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:35,599
And so it was just every single day, even that young.

552
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,859
And so it was just a very mind-consuming, time-consuming,

553
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:42,859
thought consuming thing that plagued me,

554
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:44,359
starting at a very young age.

555
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,339
When I was seven years old, my dad died.

556
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,552
That was kind of a really tough period of life.

557
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,339
I still think about this time that I went over to China,

558
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:59,389
and there's some rules that we were given,

559
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:01,676
and one of the rules was just like,

560
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:03,469
"Hey, don't talk about God,

561
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:06,289
and if you do, use the word 'Dad' instead."

562
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:08,539
And I was just like, "Okay, Dad!"

563
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:11,089
It was the first time I said that word in 17 years

564
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:12,001
or some long time.

565
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,419
"Daad." It was so weird to say that phrase.

566
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:17,629
And I was just like, "Oh, that was just the strangest thing

567
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,699
I've ever said in my entire lifetime."

568
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:21,259
It just felt so weird.

569
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:22,999
So, kind of rewind.

570
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:26,020
As I got older, obviously was very good at computers,

571
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,489
good at accessing porn, of course,

572
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:31,132
played video games on the Internet.

573
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:33,949
Fun fun kind of side quest story.

574
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:36,889
I think the guy's name is Lord Toc on Twitch.

575
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,449
I can't quite remember his name,

576
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:41,959
but he built this game called Graal, G-R-A-A-L,

577
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,129
and Graal Online.

578
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:47,059
And when I was a young lad it was just like Zelda,

579
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:48,619
except for it also had a level editor

580
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,209
and it had a C-like language,

581
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:51,949
and that's how I discovered how to program,

582
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:54,199
is I looked at these symbols and figured out

583
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,339
what they meant,

584
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:57,259
and then I was able to make things happen in the game.

585
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,279
And that was like a,

586
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,109
that's my introduction into programming.

587
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:03,079
So thank you that guy, whatever your Twitch name was.

588
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,569
But all right, so keep on going.

589
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:09,859
As I got older, I was super bad socially.

590
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:12,289
I was not a very great social person.

591
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:15,889
High school was brutal, got made fun of a lot,

592
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:18,709
really didn't enjoy, I wouldn't say had a great time

593
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:20,269
during high school.

594
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,309
Definitely felt very out of place

595
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:24,829
or offset or maybe misplaced, if you will.

596
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:26,106
I'm not sure what the right word is.

597
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:30,109
And so of course at that point, I just always wanted to,

598
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,809
I wanted to be accepted, to fit in and all that.

599
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,699
I did forget to say one side story.

600
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:37,099
After my dad died, my older brother,

601
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:38,749
he started getting into drugs,

602
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:41,419
and along with that he exposed me to pot,

603
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,959
so at eight years old I was smoking some marijuana

604
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:48,409
for a while there, until maybe 11 or 12, and took a break,

605
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,839
and then again did a lot of that

606
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,819
as I got a little bit older, but...

607
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:55,432
So I got a lot of these exposures fairly young.

608
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,089
16, 15 through 18, lot of drinking and all that.

609
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:04,372
When I graduated, or as I was graduating high school,

610
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:08,369
it's just like, I had such sadness, if you will.

611
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,909
I was very sad about how everything went,

612
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,352
tried to commit suicide,

613
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:15,079
obviously it was a very poor attempt.

614
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,259
And I'm still here today. I'm very happy about that aspect.

615
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,719
I'm glad that I didn't follow through with anything,

616
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,309
had to go to the hospital and all that.

617
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,259
And when I was done, I just still remember

618
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:26,119
kind of coming out of the hospital,

619
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,999
and at that moment it's kind of like something broke in you.

620
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:31,039
Have you ever read the book Wheel of Time?

621
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,199
It's 14,000 pages or something like that,

622
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,909
but right around page 12,000,

623
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:38,329
Rand has to intentionally kill a girl, the main character.

624
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:39,649
And that's the moment he breaks,

625
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:41,249
and he gets into like Hard Rand,

626
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,969
Quindalor Rand, if you will,

627
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:46,692
for those that know Wheel of Time will appreciate all that.

628
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:49,909
For those that don't, very confusing, and I understand.

629
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:54,229
Not the Amazon movie show, not that Wheel of Time.

630
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:56,029
So now that we go back onto it,

631
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:57,979
at that point it's just like something kind of broke in me,

632
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:00,499
and I just didn't care anymore.

633
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,809
So all the social awkwardness, if you will,

634
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:05,419
all that, just died away with me,

635
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,999
but also so did everything else.

636
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:12,799
And so I started using a bunch of drugs.

637
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,769
LSD, mushrooms, meth.

638
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:17,599
Did a bunch of meth, did a bunch of that stuff,

639
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,849
and then went off to college

640
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:21,529
and continued to do a bunch of stuff.

641
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:23,839
I took too much acid to where for quite a few years,

642
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,269
I had little squigglies on the side of my eyes

643
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:29,029
whenever I'd walk by high contrast objects.

644
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,339
And so it's just that whole period of life

645
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:36,339
was just kind of marked by just poor decisions.

646
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:40,249
And then sometime when I was about 19 years old,

647
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:43,939
somewhere in that range, I just had this one evening

648
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:47,389
where I felt the very dramatic and real presence of God.

649
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:51,559
And I kind of had this choice, like Frodo, on a razor,

650
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,829
where it's like if I go either way, I'm going to fall off,

651
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,169
and I need to change my life.

652
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:58,999
You get to make the choice now.

653
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,466
Do you want to do that or not?

654
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:03,259
And so I remember going, okay, I do want to change my life.

655
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:04,512
I don't like this experience.

656
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:07,369
I don't like what I'm living. I am still very sad,

657
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,509
I still feel very desperate.

658
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:09,499
I still feel all those things.

659
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:12,769
I'm just pretending to be this other person.

660
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:17,769
And then I just went to sleep that night.

661
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,429
Nothing changed in my life.

662
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:20,719
Everything was still the way it was.

663
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:23,059
I woke up the next day, the same person,

664
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:23,892
and I was just like,

665
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:26,899
"Oh, that's just such a strange, weird experience."

666
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,309
And I just went about my day.

667
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,949
And then I remember, I think that evening,

668
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:34,309
I looked at porn, and all of a sudden

669
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:38,299
I just had a conscious, just this deep, profound shame.

670
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:41,719
And I was like, I've never felt shame in my life.

671
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,639
I have no idea what's happening now.

672
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:45,259
And then all of a sudden when I smoked pot,

673
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:46,189
I just felt deep shame.

674
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:48,258
And when I hurt somebody or did something wrong,

675
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,699
all of a sudden, it's just like I got a conscious

676
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:50,719
from that evening.

677
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:53,209
That's what my gift was, if you will.

678
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:56,359
And just at that point, I didn't even have a choice.

679
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:59,779
I had to change my life, because for whatever reason,

680
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:01,846
I've been changed in a moment.

681
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:04,579
And so from there I started actually trying in school.

682
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:07,489
I always joke around that I got 2.14 in high school.

683
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:09,139
I had a teacher hand write me a note saying

684
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:10,939
I was the worst student she's ever had.

685
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:13,789
All that kind of stuff. I was not a really great student.

686
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:17,276
And then in that moment it's just like,

687
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:20,296
"Okay, now life's changed," and I start trying to learn,

688
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:22,429
and I try to become a good student.

689
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:25,489
And it turns out it's really hard. I was really bad.

690
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:27,019
I still got Cs.

691
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,809
I went and took pre-calculus and failed pre-calculus,

692
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:32,539
and I'm like, "Oh my gosh, I used to be the smart math guy,

693
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:34,339
and now I'm the idiot failing."

694
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:37,099
And so I'm just questioning myself and all that,

695
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:42,099
and I spent hours upon hours in a studying,

696
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,239
math learning center,

697
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:46,939
and then just at some point years into this journey,

698
00:27:46,939 --> 00:27:49,759
I'm like a year and a half into this journey, at this point,

699
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,749
something clicks, and I go from being the worst person

700
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:55,549
to just immediately becoming the best.

701
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,639
Everything after that is just, I don't know what happened.

702
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:01,429
All of a sudden I was the best person at math.

703
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,199
I started going into my computer science classes.

704
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:05,269
I just really got everything.

705
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,939
Everything, at just years after trying,

706
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:09,559
just all of a sudden became easier.

707
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:12,409
And I'm not sure if it happened over the course of weeks

708
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:15,619
or when the easier started, but it was just first predicated

709
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:17,779
by just a huge amount of difficulty.

710
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,119
And then this is where I started really desiring

711
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,769
and loving the process of learning,

712
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,269
was when things started getting easier

713
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,102
after all those years.

714
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,532
Because I just was motivated by this desire to do something,

715
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:32,179
not thinking it was going to get any easier,

716
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:34,009
and then all of a sudden it just started getting easier,

717
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:34,849
and it was great.

718
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:37,519
And that's really where I guess I started

719
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,219
having the biggest parts of my life change at that point.

720
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,219
I started really, really, really wanting

721
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:44,719
to never look at porn again,

722
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,339
because every single time just such shame,

723
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:47,419
and I really wanted to stop.

724
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:49,819
And that was by far the hardest addiction to quit.

725
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:52,519
Smoking cigarettes was also a really hard addiction to quit,

726
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,529
shockingly hard addiction to quit,

727
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:57,409
but porn by far was just the worst of them all.

728
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:00,499
And then I think about 22,

729
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:04,249
I was finally done with all kind of addictions, if you will,

730
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:06,619
and then for a year I just worked in all that,

731
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,149
and I think right around,

732
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:11,359
maybe it was 21 and three quarters, somewhere in that range,

733
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,179
I'm not really sure where I stopped all the addictions part,

734
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:17,689
but, or at least the outwardly addictions.

735
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,179
And then at some point, six months later, a year later,

736
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,039
met my beautiful wife.

737
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,529
Things just started falling more and more into place.

738
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,079
I loved more and more work. I loved programming.

739
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,239
I started programming 12 hours a day.

740
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,349
I watched the Social Network movie, and after that,

741
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:33,276
I was just like, "I'm doing a startup."

742
00:29:33,276 --> 00:29:35,689
And so that night I started my first startup,

743
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:36,682
and I was just like, so...

744
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:38,811
It was in PHP by way.

745
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,309
- Nice. - PHP, yeah, 5.2

746
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,142
or something like that.

747
00:29:41,142 --> 00:29:42,709
It was great. Great times.

748
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,699
And I was just so motivated to do that,

749
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,669
and I would just program for...

750
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:49,082
Sometimes I'd program for 24, 36 hours straight

751
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:53,689
, and just nonstop, that's all I wanted to do at all points.

752
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:56,236
I think my wife got a little sick of me.

753
00:29:56,236 --> 00:29:57,589
She would be like, "Can you drop me off at school?"

754
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:58,669
And I'd be like, "No, I'm programming."

755
00:29:58,669 --> 00:29:59,629
I was not a very nice...

756
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:01,149
You know, I didn't think through things that well.

757
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:03,509
- Yeah. - I was just so into it

758
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,389
and I just did it nonstop,

759
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,879
and that's kind of how I became me,

760
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:10,099
is that story, if that makes sense.

761
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,559
- Let's try to reverse engineer some of the pain

762
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,609
and some of the triumph.

763
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,759
You made it sound easy at times.

764
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,949
Let's try to understand it better,

765
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:20,812
maybe when you were seven years old.

766
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:24,349
What do you think about the pain you've experienced there,

767
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:25,939
losing your dad?

768
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:28,609
What do you think? What kind of impact did it have on you?

769
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,769
What kind of memories do you have at that time?

770
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:32,152
- The best way I can put it is

771
00:30:32,152 --> 00:30:34,639
that I just never knew what a dad was.

772
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:37,039
I was young enough that I could maybe repress

773
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,629
or just even have the capability

774
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,399
of remembering things long-term.

775
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,139
Because I know most people don't remember a lot

776
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:44,419
from when they're young, and so I'm not exactly sure.

777
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:47,329
I probably was at one of the best possible ages,

778
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:50,389
if I'm going to lose a dad, to lose a dad, you know?

779
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:52,287
If you're gonna lose one, if you're 11 or 12,

780
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:54,469
it's a terrible age.

781
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:56,839
That's what my brother was, and he fell into drug addiction

782
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,989
and never got back out.

783
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:02,659
So I just have more of a fuzziness

784
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,789
and just kind of a longing.

785
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:05,989
I just wish I had a dad.

786
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:11,629
- What impact did that have on your evolution, on your life,

787
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,399
having that longing?

788
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:18,229
- I think that's why I was so bad socially,

789
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:21,349
in the sense that I was looking for approval, right?

790
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:22,182
I needed approval.

791
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:24,349
I think a lot of people desire that approval

792
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,379
or that loving figure, and I just didn't have that.

793
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:29,126
So I think I just looked for it in everything else, right?

794
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:32,569
If I were to psychoanalyze my actions.

795
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:35,569
During the time, it's not like I was actively thinking that,

796
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:40,309
but yeah, I just always wanted something to fill in

797
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:41,749
whatever that was I felt.

798
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:44,179
- I think a lot of people listening to this will resonate

799
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,069
with your experience in high school.

800
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:48,559
Being the outsider, being picked on,

801
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,099
struggling through a lot of different complexities at home.

802
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:53,902
What advice would you give to them?

803
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:57,979
- The worst part about high school is that you're surrounded

804
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:01,969
by a bunch of people your age and it feels eternal.

805
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:02,802
- [Lex] Yeah.

806
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:04,549
- You don't think...

807
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:07,189
The people that are around you, you feel like are the people

808
00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:08,779
that will be there for the rest of your life.

809
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:10,459
At least that's what I thought.

810
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:12,589
And I didn't really even realize this

811
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:15,829
until many years later, that they are going to be

812
00:32:15,829 --> 00:32:18,829
some of the least consequential people in your life.

813
00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:19,662
- [Lex] Yeah.

814
00:32:19,662 --> 00:32:22,009
- Which is very shocking to think about,

815
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:23,839
especially if you're in it right now.

816
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:24,672
- Yeah. - Right?

817
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:27,109
Right now they are everything that your experience is,

818
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:28,399
your whole reality.

819
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,519
And then one day it all stops,

820
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,379
and then real life starts to begin.

821
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:34,399
- Yeah.

822
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,959
- That's such a shocking thing,

823
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,639
and if I could just tell myself that,

824
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,649
maybe I would have been a bunch of different person.

825
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:41,269
- That's so beautifully put.

826
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:43,659
I mean, it is like a trial run.

827
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,769
You know at the beginning of video games,

828
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:46,729
there's a little tutorial?

829
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:47,907
That's what that is.

830
00:32:47,907 --> 00:32:48,740
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.

831
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,379
- And actually that should be a chance to try shit out,

832
00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:58,849
to take risks, because real life will begin with,

833
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:00,559
there is more consequences after that.

834
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,449
- Yeah. - Here you can,

835
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:03,889
if you like a girl, ask her out.

836
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:05,282
Try, try shit.

837
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:08,629
If you get picked on, hit that guy back. Try shit out.

838
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:10,369
- I'm not gonna condone punching another person.

839
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:12,979
- I will. Beat the shit out of him,

840
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:15,830
and take some jiu-jitsu and learn how to take him down.

841
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,689
And then that girl that rejected you will be like,

842
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:21,469
"Hmm, maybe I'll give that guy a second chance."

843
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:25,219
Be a bad motherfucker. It's a chance to try stuff out.

844
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:28,399
This is a very motivational speech for kicking ass.

845
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,232
- It is true.

846
00:33:29,232 --> 00:33:30,136
I mean, there is something very true about that,

847
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:31,609
that I think especially...

848
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,869
I mean, I have no idea

849
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:35,299
what the girls experience of high school would be like,

850
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:36,979
but as a guy, there's definitely a lot of

851
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,949
like physical requirements in high school.

852
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:41,809
There's a lot of physical measurement,

853
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:42,829
at least where I grew up.

854
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:44,809
I think that might not be true in all high schools,

855
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:47,869
but if they're filled with boys, it's probably true.

856
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:50,059
And so it's just like,

857
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,249
yeah, it probably does help to do those things,

858
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:54,919
to go to BJJ, to do any of these activities.

859
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:56,749
Because even if you don't ever kick someone's ass,

860
00:33:56,749 --> 00:33:58,969
just having some level of confidence in yourself

861
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:01,129
is probably a very valuable thing.

862
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:05,029
But just remembering that this is such a short,

863
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:09,739
tiny moment in your life is just like a huge help.

864
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:12,679
- I mean, the way you phrased it is exactly right.

865
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,609
That's what it feels like.

866
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:16,518
That these are the people that will be with you

867
00:34:16,518 --> 00:34:19,606
for the rest of your life and this is the whole world.

868
00:34:19,606 --> 00:34:22,129
And so that means that there'll be

869
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:24,469
just tremendous amount of impact if somebody picks on you

870
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:28,438
or if you fall somewhere low in the hierarchy

871
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:31,849
and the status hierarchy of this high school,

872
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:34,248
that means you'll be low in the status hierarchy

873
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:36,409
of the world and you're fucked for the rest of your life.

874
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,409
And that carries a tremendous amount of weight.

875
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,869
It's just why psychologically it's extremely difficult

876
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:42,702
to be...

877
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:47,268
I think it's understated often by parents, by society,

878
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:49,609
how difficult it is to be a high schooler,

879
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:51,379
how difficult psychologically it is,

880
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:53,958
how it actually makes sense that some people

881
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,839
would suffer from depression and be on the verge of suicide;

882
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,549
is very, very difficult.

883
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:00,469
- Yeah, I think it's even...

884
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:02,689
People always say, "Back in my day," blah blah blah.

885
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:05,479
I think it's genuinely harder today than it's ever been

886
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,639
in the sense that when I was a kid,

887
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,769
there was a qualification to people.

888
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:12,169
Meaning, this is a cool guy, this is not a cool guy.

889
00:35:12,169 --> 00:35:14,419
Today, there's a quantification of people.

890
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:19,112
You have 32,514 people following you, you have 12.

891
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:21,589
The people can visually...

892
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:23,959
They can inspect your exact social value

893
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,336
on whatever platform you're on.

894
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:28,639
And that has to be just so much harder.

895
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,629
And I can imagine that there's a lot of

896
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:34,159
just so much weight to put on that, that it's just...

897
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,879
It feels probably way worse and way more damning

898
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:40,189
to be uncool because you have an exact number

899
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:41,989
of how uncool you are.

900
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,642
- Yeah. The challenge there.

901
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:49,309
And the task, the quest is to remember

902
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:53,419
that just because your social circle on social media

903
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:57,292
and in high school thinks you're uncool,

904
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:01,339
it actually might mean you are cool.

905
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,699
And you need to find that cool and grow it

906
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:08,119
and let it flourish so that when real life begins,

907
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:10,759
you can fucking come out of the gate

908
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:12,919
firing on all cylinders because-

909
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:13,789
- That's a great way to put it.

910
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:18,529
- I think if anything, high school is really bad

911
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:20,122
at picking out the cool people.

912
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:24,109
Whatever the system, the hierarchy that forms,

913
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:27,529
it's such a basic bitch hierarchy.

914
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:30,619
You're good at very generic shit. That's how you rise.

915
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:32,089
- Your parents bought you an expensive car.

916
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,409
- Expensive car, right? - Just-

917
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:35,179
- Materialistic shit. Yeah, exactly.

918
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:36,139
- It's a greedy search.

919
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:37,399
See, they didn't have a proper search,

920
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:39,139
so they're just hitting that local optima.

921
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:42,259
- But the US, I mean, even the objective function

922
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:45,829
for that greedy search is just a really shitty one,

923
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,579
where those people that win the game of high school

924
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:51,559
are very often not gonna be the people

925
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,739
that win the much more exciting, beautiful game of life.

926
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:58,909
So do epic shit and try stuff out.

927
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:00,979
The weirdos are the ones that are gonna succeed,

928
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:02,482
the weirdos in high school.

929
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:05,329
Probably because they also get bullied

930
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:08,179
and they get to be tormented more psychologically

931
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:10,219
and get to explore their own mind

932
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,849
and think through what it means to be a human being more.

933
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:16,279
Because if you're winning in high school,

934
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:20,059
you're not being challenged, you're not self-reflecting,

935
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:21,979
you're not trying shit out.

936
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:25,219
So there is some degree to being tormented

937
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:27,499
as long as it doesn't break you.

938
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:31,399
The porn addiction, that's another powerful one

939
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:34,579
that I think will probably resonate with a lot of people.

940
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:35,959
And it's interesting that you say

941
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:40,609
that's one of the hardest addictions to overcome.

942
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:41,809
- Let me say it this way,

943
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:45,049
some addictions have a much bigger societal look

944
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:47,989
and porn is just not one of them, which makes it super hard.

945
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:49,759
None of your friends are going to cheer you on.

946
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:51,740
If you go on Twitter and say, "I quit porn,"

947
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,573
they're going to be like,

948
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:53,406
"Well, that's good for you but not everybody..."

949
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:56,179
No one makes that argument with meth, right?

950
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:57,012
No one's gonna be like,

951
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,789
"Well, not everyone has to quit meth, okay.

952
00:37:58,789 --> 00:37:59,959
It's actually a fine industry

953
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:02,149
and people who are the ones producing it,

954
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,499
they're good also, right?"

955
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:05,719
No one's going to make that kind of argument.

956
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,599
Whereas with porn, you're going to have a whole thing

957
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,819
and friends are gonna think you're dumb for doing it

958
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:12,153
or whatever.

959
00:38:12,153 --> 00:38:13,189
It's like you have...

960
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:16,639
It's a much more difficult one in just like that.

961
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,199
So it feels accepted.

962
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,379
- And I think it's also an addiction you can practice,

963
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:24,349
participate in privately and hide it from the world.

964
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:26,089
There's certain addictions that are harder to hide

965
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:28,099
from the world for prolonged periods of time.

966
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:30,349
And porn addiction is probably one you can just have

967
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,929
for many years and then it can deepen.

968
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:35,119
That's probably a serious issue.

969
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,319
Boy, am I glad I grew up before the internet

970
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,762
because porn is so accessible,

971
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:45,412
so easy to go deep into that addiction.

972
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:47,839
I mean, what can you speak about

973
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,149
what impact it had on your life?

974
00:38:50,149 --> 00:38:53,389
Maybe some of the low points, but also how to overcome it?

975
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:56,419
- I'd say as far as impact goes is that

976
00:38:56,419 --> 00:39:00,709
you will have such a long and broken look at women.

977
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:01,969
By the very, like I can...

978
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:05,329
Again, I'm only speaking from a male's perspective,

979
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:08,749
that porn in its just most basic thing

980
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:12,462
is that you use another person for your own desire

981
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,499
or your own want.

982
00:39:15,499 --> 00:39:18,673
It's not something that is deeply needed.

983
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:20,209
There's no need for porn.

984
00:39:20,209 --> 00:39:23,089
It's purely a want-based activity or a lust,

985
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:25,339
however you want, whatever word you can fill in there.

986
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:28,879
And it is purely an objectifying activity.

987
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:32,209
Someone else is on display for your own enjoyment.

988
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:34,502
And so I think you carry this around.

989
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:36,879
I do think that the women that I dated during high school

990
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:39,029
or the women after high school and college,

991
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:41,866
I looked at them as a means to an end.

992
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:45,109
And I think porn greatly kind of shifted that perspective

993
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:47,329
in my head that I did not give the value

994
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:49,249
that was desired to another person.

995
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:52,909
It really devalues humanity just in general,

996
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:54,483
is my perspective of it.

997
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:55,666
And then it makes people into commodities.

998
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,469
And I don't think people are commodities.

999
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:59,209
I think everyone has value.

1000
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:00,499
And so during that,

1001
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:03,979
for me that's like the great effect of porn,

1002
00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:07,249
is that it's just consumerism gone wild

1003
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:10,459
or materialism maybe, you could ask or argue, gone wild.

1004
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:13,789
And it's extremely hard to quit, just like you said,

1005
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,702
because I can look at porn and then I can go out to lunch.

1006
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,969
No one's going to know. No one's going to have any ideas.

1007
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:23,329
It's a very private, it can be very short session.

1008
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:25,399
It doesn't have to be something that takes...

1009
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:27,832
You can't take acid then go out to lunch, right?

1010
00:40:28,669 --> 00:40:31,309
Your whole day is going to be a very different day.

1011
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:35,029
And so it's very quick, easy, accessible.

1012
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:38,029
And then obviously there's all the science and statistics,

1013
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:40,519
like men make worse decisions for some period of time

1014
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:43,219
after looking or being exposed to sexualized images.

1015
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:45,079
There's the whole dopamine effect

1016
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:47,779
that's just like you constantly need more and more dopamine.

1017
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,029
That's why people typically don't just watch

1018
00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:51,289
five minutes of porn and call it a day.

1019
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:53,239
There's like the hundred tab joke

1020
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,739
that's always made on the internet.

1021
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:57,769
It's because it's just this constant dopamine cycle

1022
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:58,969
you're constantly doing.

1023
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,399
And all that stuff is great to say.

1024
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:04,369
And I'm sure statistics and science and all that stuff

1025
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:06,529
is really great arguments for some amount of people.

1026
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:09,199
But for me it just comes down to,

1027
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,949
is it really a good thing to do?

1028
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:13,099
Is it really actually something we want,

1029
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:15,409
is to value people in such a profane

1030
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:18,392
or just disregarding way?

1031
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,259
I just really think it's just bad for the soul.

1032
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:24,469
Even if all the stats said it was great for you,

1033
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,179
I still say it's actually bad.

1034
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:29,299
- Yeah, you have to look at the long-term big picture,

1035
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:32,299
psychological impact it has on your relationships

1036
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:33,679
with human beings in general.

1037
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,232
That's my, more generally than just porn,

1038
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:40,849
my problem with the quote, unquote, sort of "manosphere",

1039
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:45,849
is I think sleeping with a bunch of women is great,

1040
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:48,499
wonderful.

1041
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:49,969
But the problem is,

1042
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:52,879
making that the primary objective of your life,

1043
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:54,499
similar with porn,

1044
00:41:54,499 --> 00:41:58,189
is you devalue one of the most awesome things,

1045
00:41:58,189 --> 00:41:59,719
which is intimacy.

1046
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,189
That's true for deep friendship,

1047
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:03,469
that's true for relationships.

1048
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:07,249
And I think porn does that in its purest,

1049
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:09,169
darkest form, which is:

1050
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:10,879
the thing that matters is the sex,

1051
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:13,822
not the deep connection with another human being.

1052
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:16,939
And I think, again, going back to high school

1053
00:42:16,939 --> 00:42:21,229
and the manosphere, the objective function

1054
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:22,879
if it's to get laid,

1055
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:25,579
which helps with status and confidence and all...

1056
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:29,509
All that is wonderful, I think. Again, can be an addiction.

1057
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:33,289
But the thing that's even more awesome for a lot of people

1058
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:36,109
is a deep friendship or deep intimacy

1059
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:38,179
with a romantic partner.

1060
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:42,229
That's also fucking awesome, and both of those are great.

1061
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:44,509
- It's objectively better to have...

1062
00:42:44,509 --> 00:42:46,759
I would say that there's no universe that exists

1063
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:48,829
or there should be no argument possible that exists

1064
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:51,319
that a guy who has meaningless sex

1065
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,629
has a better or a more meaningful life than,

1066
00:42:53,629 --> 00:42:55,789
say, me and my wife who've been together for 15 years.

1067
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:57,169
We have a very...

1068
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:59,989
I can depend on her in all circumstances.

1069
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:03,079
Whereas if you live that other life, it sure could be...

1070
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:05,779
It could feel great, but there's no meaning to it.

1071
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:07,789
There's no actual real value to it.

1072
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:08,959
- That's absolutely correct.

1073
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:11,609
I do think that getting laid

1074
00:43:12,649 --> 00:43:14,299
can have a tremendous positive impact

1075
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:15,769
on the confidence of a young man.

1076
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:19,939
I think just there's a certain number of sexual partners

1077
00:43:19,939 --> 00:43:21,529
from which you can collect a lot of data

1078
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:24,412
and it can free you about,

1079
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:28,789
like not to be so nervous about the opposite sex,

1080
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:31,609
not to be so nervous about human interaction.

1081
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,119
And that will allow you to see the world more clearly

1082
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,249
and to actually find that one partner

1083
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:39,259
with whom you can be deeply intimate with.

1084
00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:42,499
Sometimes the nervousness around

1085
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:47,499
like this societally constructed value

1086
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:51,169
in getting laid can cloud your judgment.

1087
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:52,999
And if you just release that

1088
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:55,489
by getting laid a bunch of times,

1089
00:43:55,489 --> 00:43:57,499
then you could see the world clearly

1090
00:43:57,499 --> 00:44:00,079
that getting laid is not nearly as important as you said,

1091
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,989
as finding the right human,

1092
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:05,419
including I should put in that pile,

1093
00:44:05,419 --> 00:44:07,069
not just a romantic partner,

1094
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:10,999
but friendships, deep lasting friendships.

1095
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:11,832
- Well, I mean I think you're right

1096
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:14,629
that our society puts a lot of emphasis on getting laid.

1097
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:17,079
And I'm sure that's true among any group of males

1098
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,549
throughout any point in history.

1099
00:44:19,549 --> 00:44:21,199
I'm sure that's a very common joke

1100
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:23,929
that's never actually never stopped at any point.

1101
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:27,109
So I'm sure that exists but...

1102
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:29,029
And there's probably some truth to the sense

1103
00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:30,289
that after you've...

1104
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:31,676
Who was it? Jim Carrey.

1105
00:44:31,676 --> 00:44:33,619
"I hope that everyone can get rich so they realize

1106
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:35,869
that money solves none of your problems."

1107
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:38,059
The realization that this thing that society told you

1108
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:40,839
is hyper important is actually not the important part.

1109
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:42,169
It is a very important...

1110
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:45,139
It's a great sign that your relationship is healthy.

1111
00:44:45,139 --> 00:44:47,299
Like if me and my wife were to have no sex at all

1112
00:44:47,299 --> 00:44:50,209
for months on end, something's gone wrong,

1113
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:51,889
which means what...

1114
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:55,159
We are no longer on the same plane.

1115
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,109
But it's not also a good identifier.

1116
00:44:57,109 --> 00:44:58,604
Just because you're having a lot of sex,

1117
00:44:58,604 --> 00:45:00,889
it doesn't mean you're having a good relationship.

1118
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:03,129
And so it's like a unique kind of...

1119
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:05,869
I forget the right term here,

1120
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,199
but it's a unique way at looking at the problems.

1121
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:11,359
And our society puts so much emphasis.

1122
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,249
And maybe that's why porn was so hard to quit,

1123
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:16,039
but my guess is it's just all the dopamine effect

1124
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:16,872
that it is.

1125
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:20,899
But for me, the most important part

1126
00:45:20,899 --> 00:45:24,529
and the thing that actually has real reward is having that,

1127
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:26,629
having just my wife.

1128
00:45:26,629 --> 00:45:27,739
I do not look at...

1129
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:29,989
I desperately try not to look at any other woman.

1130
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:31,159
I'm hopefully not going to get caught...

1131
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:33,509
Mark Zuckerberged at the White House like that.

1132
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:35,899
I don't look at porn.

1133
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,309
My wife has complete confidence in me

1134
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:39,049
that there is not going to be a situation

1135
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:41,629
in which she has to question me in any kind of sense.

1136
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:45,799
And that builds a much more deeply, I would argue,

1137
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:47,929
a very deep relationship

1138
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:49,549
because the trust is that much bigger.

1139
00:45:49,549 --> 00:45:51,259
I think the deepness of the relationship

1140
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:52,969
is probably proportional to the trust you have

1141
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:54,079
in each other.

1142
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,659
It's very hard to have a deep relationship with no trust.

1143
00:45:56,659 --> 00:46:01,659
- Yeah, and a probably a prerequisite,

1144
00:46:01,669 --> 00:46:04,579
maybe a component of trust is vulnerability

1145
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:07,729
to where you take the leap of being vulnerable

1146
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:09,889
with another human being.

1147
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:14,599
And that vulnerability when reciprocated

1148
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:16,328
builds this really strong trust

1149
00:46:16,328 --> 00:46:18,109
and it's a beautiful thing, yeah.

1150
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,482
I personally just, given my position,

1151
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:24,199
that's even more challenging,

1152
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,639
being vulnerable with the world

1153
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:26,929
and there's a bunch of people out there

1154
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:28,379
that want to hurt you for it,

1155
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,889
but I think it's worthwhile anyway to be vulnerable.

1156
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:34,722
- It's always worth it.

1157
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:37,020
The risk is always worth it in some sense.

1158
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,949
Obviously, everyone has a different life

1159
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:42,259
they have to filter through their actions with, right?

1160
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:43,699
Because the person that has no,

1161
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:45,469
say, social following or anything,

1162
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,229
their risk reward profile could just be local impact,

1163
00:46:48,229 --> 00:46:50,959
which could be just as damning or harming to them.

1164
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:53,689
- And so it's always worth the risk though,

1165
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:55,999
in my personal opinion, because finding my wife

1166
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:59,179
has been obviously the most impactful

1167
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:00,949
or changing thing in my life.

1168
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:03,409
Or second most, I'd argue that one night with God

1169
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:05,839
would probably be the most impactful thing

1170
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:06,769
that led to everything else,

1171
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:08,659
but then the wife would be the next most impactful.

1172
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,329
I mean, I'm cleaning up after myself and stuff now.

1173
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:14,359
Changed man. I'm a changed man.

1174
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:16,669
- Can we try to reverse engineer

1175
00:47:16,669 --> 00:47:18,319
that moment of you finding God.

1176
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,879
What is it at 19?

1177
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:24,499
Because it feels like that was a big leap

1178
00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:27,739
for you to escape the pain,

1179
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:30,589
to escape the addiction or the beginning of that journey.

1180
00:47:32,931 --> 00:47:34,039
What do you think happened there?

1181
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:36,079
- I think it just felt like I just...

1182
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,959
There was no line that I wasn't willing to cross.

1183
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:41,419
Everything was fine and just like...

1184
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:43,039
It just all of a sudden, just in that moment,

1185
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:44,459
it's just like I had I guess

1186
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:48,299
some sort of deep fear and understanding like

1187
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,619
I am going down a path.

1188
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,819
Is this really the path you want to go down?

1189
00:47:54,979 --> 00:47:56,899
And I don't know what the result of that path would be

1190
00:47:56,899 --> 00:47:58,069
or anything like that.

1191
00:47:58,069 --> 00:48:01,849
I don't tend to speculate on things I don't understand.

1192
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:05,189
I just know that in that moment I had the option

1193
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:08,149
and I just chose...

1194
00:48:08,149 --> 00:48:10,099
I didn't want it anymore. Right?

1195
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:11,299
It's kind of mixed in this whole thing

1196
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:13,069
where it's just like I had no value.

1197
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:14,809
I wrapped up all my meaning or value

1198
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,549
in having sex or getting laid.

1199
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:17,419
I had, you know...

1200
00:48:17,419 --> 00:48:19,609
All that stuff, all the things we just talked about,

1201
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:21,559
that was where all my worth was.

1202
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:25,009
And that is just such a terrible place to have your worth.

1203
00:48:25,009 --> 00:48:27,856
And it was just all came to a point.

1204
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:29,869
And I can't tell you the day of the week,

1205
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:32,209
I can't tell you anything other than it was nighttime

1206
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,749
and I was in South Hedges in Montana State University,

1207
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:38,089
go Bobcats, meowww...

1208
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:38,922
That's about...

1209
00:48:38,922 --> 00:48:40,459
Yeah, that's the sign that we do at football games.

1210
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,419
Don't worry about it.

1211
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,599
But that's all I can really tell you

1212
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:47,659
because that night was no more or less special

1213
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:48,492
than some other night.

1214
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,809
It's just the specialness was

1215
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:55,609
I got at least a chance to make a choice.

1216
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:57,349
- Because you find in that advice

1217
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:00,679
that you can give to others who are probably,

1218
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:03,889
there's probably just an endless amount of people

1219
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:06,529
that are struggling with porn addiction now, young people.

1220
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:09,279
What advice could you give to them? How to overcome it?

1221
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,109
- For me to overcome it, I had to realize

1222
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:17,809
that I was taking something away from my future wife.

1223
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:18,642
Some people would be like,

1224
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:21,079
"Oh, well, once you get a girlfriend then you can stop."

1225
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:21,949
And it's just like,

1226
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:24,199
no, because you never stopped the problem.

1227
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:26,392
You don't stop a problem by replacing it.

1228
00:49:27,439 --> 00:49:29,299
And so I didn't have a girlfriend, I didn't have all that.

1229
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,549
I just realized that I was truly taking away

1230
00:49:31,549 --> 00:49:34,039
from something from my future wife.

1231
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,319
And I didn't even know my current wife at that time.

1232
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,789
She was not in the picture.

1233
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:39,409
I'm not even sure if she was at Montana State University

1234
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,249
at that point.

1235
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:42,369
And so it's just that's...

1236
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:45,709
Once I made that realization,

1237
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:47,359
I think it went from my head to my heart,

1238
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,179
which they say is the greatest distance in the universe.

1239
00:49:50,179 --> 00:49:52,279
I finally got it.

1240
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:54,179
And that's really where things change.

1241
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:57,799
The ability to say like

1242
00:49:57,799 --> 00:49:59,322
what's gonna help you change and all that,

1243
00:49:59,322 --> 00:50:00,259
I don't know if there's,

1244
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:02,419
I don't think there's silver bullets, right?

1245
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:04,099
If someone could offer you a drug...

1246
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:05,239
I forget who says this phrase,

1247
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:07,009
but there's this really interesting phrase

1248
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:08,749
that goes something like.

1249
00:50:08,749 --> 00:50:10,969
He was a very depressed man

1250
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:13,639
and he was struggling with suicide

1251
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:15,559
and he writes about this in this memoir.

1252
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,359
And he goes to these doctors

1253
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:18,386
and the doctors effectively say,

1254
00:50:18,386 --> 00:50:20,206
"Well, here's antidepressants, it's gonna help you."

1255
00:50:20,206 --> 00:50:21,146
And he says that,

1256
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:23,899
"Well, the problem was is that scientists told me

1257
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:26,749
that I could just touch my brain and make myself happy,

1258
00:50:26,749 --> 00:50:27,582
and that's it.

1259
00:50:27,582 --> 00:50:29,119
They could reach in, they could configure some stuff

1260
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,289
and I'll be happy."

1261
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:33,859
He's like, "For me, it was a lot like going out into a field

1262
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:35,899
and being able to take a drug to see the rain.

1263
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,119
I could look out, see the rain, it would fall down,

1264
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:40,129
it'd be silvery, it'd be beautiful,

1265
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:41,389
but all the crop would still die

1266
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:42,799
because there's not actually any rain.

1267
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:45,256
I had to discover how to be happy myself."

1268
00:50:45,256 --> 00:50:48,199
And so for me, it's like the reason why I looked at porn is

1269
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:49,519
because I was unhappy.

1270
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:50,539
I was trying to find meaning.

1271
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:53,179
I was trying to find value in something, right?

1272
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:54,589
Something that was supposed to finally give me

1273
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:56,239
this ultimate satisfaction.

1274
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:59,119
And it just does not, no matter how hard,

1275
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,369
and no matter how much you think it will,

1276
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:05,119
there is no escapade, there is no pornography

1277
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:05,952
that will ever give you

1278
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:07,489
that satisfaction you're looking for.

1279
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:09,339
That's the reason why it's addicting.

1280
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:12,679
And that's my call to why you shouldn't do it,

1281
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:16,402
but how to get out of it, I only got out of it by realizing.

1282
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:20,482
- I think that's really brilliantly described.

1283
00:51:23,419 --> 00:51:26,329
You knew that this thing you're doing is preventing you

1284
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:28,049
from finding your future wife

1285
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,039
and future wife could mean more even broadly,

1286
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:37,552
this path to a flourishing,

1287
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:39,949
to a beautiful life.

1288
00:51:39,949 --> 00:51:40,939
I think there's a lot of choices we make

1289
00:51:40,939 --> 00:51:45,109
that are just preventing us from opening the door

1290
00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:46,522
to whatever future.

1291
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:51,469
I think what's really nice to do is to imagine,

1292
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:53,629
just like we said with high school,

1293
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:57,679
that there are a bunch of trajectories in life

1294
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:59,809
where you'll be truly happy

1295
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:01,526
and you need to construct your life in a way

1296
00:52:01,526 --> 00:52:04,909
where you have the chance to travel down those paths.

1297
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:06,079
And there's a bunch of addictions,

1298
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,099
there's a bunch of choices

1299
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:09,649
that prevent us from traveling down those paths.

1300
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:13,729
So just believe that you're gonna have an awesome life

1301
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:15,619
and remove from your life the things

1302
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:20,029
that are preventing you from walking down that path,

1303
00:52:20,029 --> 00:52:21,142
which is essentially what you did.

1304
00:52:21,142 --> 00:52:23,269
It's a leap of faith

1305
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:26,449
that if you let go of porn,

1306
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:29,299
that a better life is waiting for you on the other end.

1307
00:52:29,299 --> 00:52:30,709
- Yeah.

1308
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:33,949
I definitely can't say how long it will take, a better life.

1309
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:36,409
But for me, there's no way in the universe

1310
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:38,659
I could have had the relationship that I have

1311
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:39,979
without first making those steps

1312
00:52:39,979 --> 00:52:44,929
because I couldn't value my wife

1313
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:49,069
in the way that was proper for who she was.

1314
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:51,019
I would have valued her through the index

1315
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:55,399
or the lens that I currently was looking through, so.

1316
00:52:55,399 --> 00:52:56,599
- Got to ask.

1317
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:58,102
So I've never done meth.

1318
00:52:59,629 --> 00:53:00,799
I've never done meth.

1319
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,068
- That was a great segue by the way.

1320
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:05,286
(Lex and ThePrimeagen chuckle)

1321
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:06,952
- Oh, man. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing,

1322
00:53:06,952 --> 00:53:08,509
honestly, with this interviewing thing.

1323
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:10,599
But yeah, meth and LSD...

1324
00:53:11,899 --> 00:53:15,109
I did ayahuasca. I did shrooms a bunch of times.

1325
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,889
And this topic, I should say that there's a lot of,

1326
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:22,159
on Twitter and in the tech community in general,

1327
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:24,559
people speaking negatively about ayahuasca

1328
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,002
and some positively.

1329
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:29,782
I think it's such a roll of the dice.

1330
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,569
I had incredible experiences,

1331
00:53:32,569 --> 00:53:35,419
but I don't think I want to recommend it to anyone.

1332
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:37,969
It's a risk, it's a serious risk.

1333
00:53:37,969 --> 00:53:39,349
It really is a roll of the dice

1334
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,429
that you could meet your demons and they could destroy you

1335
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:45,139
or you can meet your demons and let go of them.

1336
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,409
Or you could have experiences like I did, which is never...

1337
00:53:48,409 --> 00:53:49,819
Apparently I don't have demons.

1338
00:53:49,819 --> 00:53:52,789
I'm pretty sure they're somewhere in the basement,

1339
00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:55,579
but I've never met them on drugs.

1340
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:59,149
- I'm always really happy. I'm a happy drunk.

1341
00:53:59,149 --> 00:54:02,659
I'm a super happy on ayahuasca, just full of love.

1342
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:05,209
I don't understand, I don't understand where the demons are,

1343
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:07,669
but that's my biochemistry, whatever that is.

1344
00:54:07,669 --> 00:54:11,239
And for some others, one trip could be amazing

1345
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:13,489
and the next one could just completely destroy you

1346
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:14,322
and wreck your life.

1347
00:54:14,322 --> 00:54:17,509
So I don't know what the recommendation from that is,

1348
00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:22,159
maybe avoid it, but then all of us die and life...

1349
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:26,539
I tend to lean into adventure but drugs is...

1350
00:54:28,459 --> 00:54:31,549
If you fuck with the biochemistry of your brain,

1351
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:33,832
you can really destroy yourself in a way

1352
00:54:33,832 --> 00:54:35,299
that it's gonna torment you.

1353
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:38,689
So I would generally recommend

1354
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:43,426
that people avoid drugs altogether, probably,

1355
00:54:44,509 --> 00:54:47,149
unless you're a crazy motherfucker.

1356
00:54:47,149 --> 00:54:48,322
Hunter S. Thompson.

1357
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:51,799
- What an intro to this topic.

1358
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:53,599
- [Lex] I'm sorry. What's meth like?

1359
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:55,602
- That's a great intro.

1360
00:54:55,602 --> 00:54:56,779
I like...

1361
00:54:56,779 --> 00:54:59,269
You are very correct in the sense that there is,

1362
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:01,039
at least when it comes to hallucinogens,

1363
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,669
there is a wild variance to what you're going to experience.

1364
00:55:04,669 --> 00:55:07,369
And there is no guarantee, there's no...

1365
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:08,539
Just because you buy the product,

1366
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,429
it doesn't mean you're going to have a good time, right?

1367
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:11,899
There's a lot of...

1368
00:55:11,899 --> 00:55:14,919
Personally, I find that stuff to be very...

1369
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:18,319
I believe in the spiritual realm, right?

1370
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,349
I believe demons and angels exist. I believe God exists.

1371
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:23,056
And that whole realm is like...

1372
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:25,549
I don't know what it opens you up to,

1373
00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:26,959
but it's much, much different experience.

1374
00:55:26,959 --> 00:55:27,998
Now, some people will be like,

1375
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:28,999
"Oh, it's just a bunch of chemicals in your brain.

1376
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:29,832
They all get mixed up.

1377
00:55:29,832 --> 00:55:32,599
LSD just takes all of your pathways and they all go...

1378
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:34,429
They all get kind of scrambled up in your brain."

1379
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:37,039
And it's just like, yeah, the experiences are profound.

1380
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:42,019
I had some really bizarre, very cool, very awful...

1381
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:44,359
I've had all the experiences in them all.

1382
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:45,192
I can just tell you

1383
00:55:45,192 --> 00:55:47,359
that I personally always say the same thing.

1384
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,579
It's like, choices that I made I can never take back.

1385
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,499
I would never take that away from myself

1386
00:55:51,499 --> 00:55:53,599
because I don't know if I would be who I am today

1387
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,909
without all those experiences going up to it.

1388
00:55:55,909 --> 00:55:58,339
But if you have not had that experience, I'm on your team,

1389
00:55:58,339 --> 00:56:00,679
or at least partially on your team, maybe more severely,

1390
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:02,359
I don't think you need those experiences.

1391
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,589
I don't think they're gonna...

1392
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:06,349
You don't have to put yourself through that

1393
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:08,269
to make a good decisions or to realize

1394
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:10,972
that people have value, right?

1395
00:56:12,462 --> 00:56:13,295
You don't have to do that.

1396
00:56:13,295 --> 00:56:15,319
So as far as what is meth like? Meth is like...

1397
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:16,399
If you've ever done cocaine,

1398
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:19,099
cocaine starts off with like a 15-minute dance party.

1399
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:20,664
Just (beatboxing)

1400
00:56:20,664 --> 00:56:22,249
It's just so intense. It's so great.

1401
00:56:22,249 --> 00:56:25,159
And then it just followed up with like a five hour,

1402
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:26,509
just feeling wiggly, right?

1403
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:28,249
I don't know how else to describe it.

1404
00:56:28,249 --> 00:56:29,209
Meth is like that

1405
00:56:29,209 --> 00:56:31,489
except for I didn't get as much dance party

1406
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:34,489
or any dance party, but instead I just got

1407
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:37,039
that part for like 12 hours.

1408
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:38,269
- Yeah.

1409
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,582
- So did a lot of skateboarding,

1410
00:56:41,749 --> 00:56:43,993
did a lot of running around, staying all night.

1411
00:56:43,993 --> 00:56:46,129
- Would you say it's a pleasant feeling

1412
00:56:46,129 --> 00:56:47,699
or is it more like an escape

1413
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:51,829
from the loneliness of life?

1414
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:54,029
Is it pleasant or negative

1415
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:56,629
in the actual moment?

1416
00:56:56,629 --> 00:56:58,489
Not the consequences but in the moment.

1417
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:03,199
- So I mean, this is just a very interesting kind of area,

1418
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:05,299
which is that not...

1419
00:57:05,299 --> 00:57:07,609
Universally, you can't say that.

1420
00:57:07,609 --> 00:57:08,629
Often you'll find that there's

1421
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:12,199
kind of these two groups of drug addicts.

1422
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:14,389
There's those that like the opioids

1423
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,339
and those that like the uppers.

1424
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:17,569
They typically don't like...

1425
00:57:17,569 --> 00:57:20,299
There's very few people in the drug world that do both.

1426
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:22,579
They're really just like find their side and they go for it.

1427
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:25,999
So is meth a thing that everybody's gonna enjoy?

1428
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:27,409
Well, categorically, as you can see,

1429
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:31,039
and just how people experience drug addiction, no.

1430
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:33,409
But for me it's just I had a really...

1431
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:37,173
It kind of feeds into the ADHD nature of this...

1432
00:57:37,173 --> 00:57:38,419
Because you know you're kind of high energy,

1433
00:57:38,419 --> 00:57:39,799
you're like always in the moment.

1434
00:57:39,799 --> 00:57:41,449
So it's just like you're in the moment,

1435
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:43,969
but it's just like, "Oh, I'm in the moment!"

1436
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:45,259
Everything's just so intense!

1437
00:57:45,259 --> 00:57:48,596
You just want to really be in the moment.

1438
00:57:48,596 --> 00:57:50,992
And so it's just experiencing that constantly.

1439
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:53,419
And so was that great?

1440
00:57:53,419 --> 00:57:55,609
Well, some people...

1441
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:59,779
My wife always tells me this, being nervous or...

1442
00:57:59,779 --> 00:58:02,389
I forget, the anxiety of a situation

1443
00:58:02,389 --> 00:58:04,249
can also be the same thing as like thrill.

1444
00:58:04,249 --> 00:58:05,179
I forget the exact way.

1445
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:07,279
She's probably super disappointed that I messed this up.

1446
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:09,829
But it's like you could perceive those two experiences

1447
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:10,789
in very different lights.

1448
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:14,659
Some people get in front of a crowd and it's thrilling.

1449
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:15,589
Some people get in front of it

1450
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:17,599
and it's just the worst experience of their lifetime.

1451
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,429
They would actually literally rather die,

1452
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,349
which is a crazy thing to think about

1453
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:22,579
than stand up and speak.

1454
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:26,032
And so for me, meth was that thrilling side,

1455
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:28,909
but at the same time,

1456
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:32,929
it still didn't quite give me that thing I wanted,

1457
00:58:32,929 --> 00:58:34,549
whatever I was looking for.

1458
00:58:34,549 --> 00:58:37,129
I'd use it to help try to get that thing I want,

1459
00:58:37,129 --> 00:58:40,009
but it was never giving me that thing I wanted.

1460
00:58:40,009 --> 00:58:43,762
- Yeah. For me, I've had all really wonderful experiences.

1461
00:58:43,762 --> 00:58:45,564
Do not recommend them.

1462
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,024
But like with shroom-

1463
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,106
- That's a YouTube policy by the way that you have to say,

1464
00:58:49,106 --> 00:58:50,179
"By the way, do whatever you do,

1465
00:58:50,179 --> 00:58:51,259
do not do a illegal activity."

1466
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:53,119
- I- - But I had great experiences,

1467
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,589
but whatever you do, don't do it.

1468
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:57,829
- Mr. ThePrimeagen, I have no master.

1469
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:59,899
I don't have YouTube or whatever.

1470
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:02,269
I'll say whatever the fuck I want.

1471
00:59:02,269 --> 00:59:05,296
I'm just- - But seriously, you do.

1472
00:59:05,296 --> 00:59:06,129
- No. No.

1473
00:59:07,165 --> 00:59:09,589
I don't give a shit about YouTube or anybody, honestly.

1474
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:13,369
I'm just careful about the words I say because,

1475
00:59:13,369 --> 00:59:16,249
just because I had positive experiences,

1476
00:59:16,249 --> 00:59:19,249
I don't want young people listening to this

1477
00:59:19,249 --> 00:59:20,869
think they should try the experience.

1478
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:23,329
I think the much more powerful message is

1479
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:25,849
that life is awesome even without that.

1480
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:29,189
That's something I definitely experiment with

1481
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:31,909
on the alcohol side.

1482
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:35,449
So for me, I'm an introvert. I'm afraid of the world.

1483
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:37,999
Social interaction fills me with anxiety.

1484
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:39,259
Alcohol is definitely a thing

1485
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:41,089
that helps with that sometimes,

1486
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:44,779
but I think honestly it's not even the alcohol,

1487
00:59:44,779 --> 00:59:46,459
it's like having to do something

1488
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,109
while a person is talking to me.

1489
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:49,822
I could just drink a liquid.

1490
00:59:50,666 --> 00:59:52,789
"Yeah. Mm-hmm." There's a social thing.

1491
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,489
With a beer, it's like, "Yeah. Uh-huh.

1492
00:59:55,489 --> 00:59:57,469
Yeah, we're having fun."

1493
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,029
And I think it's...

1494
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:01,549
For me, it works the same as...

1495
01:00:01,549 --> 01:00:04,042
If the liquid actually looks like alcohol,

1496
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:10,179
it does the same purpose often because alcohol...

1497
01:00:10,459 --> 01:00:14,269
If you have a whiskey or a beer looking thing,

1498
01:00:14,269 --> 01:00:17,959
it kind of sends a signal that we should be having fun.

1499
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:19,219
So we're socializing, right?

1500
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:20,659
We're fucking getting crazy.

1501
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:21,919
And then that mean...

1502
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:23,089
You don't actually need the alcohol.

1503
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:27,649
You can get fucking crazy without the alcohol substance,

1504
01:00:27,649 --> 01:00:30,666
but there is some kind of social signaling

1505
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:36,079
that happens when you have a drink in your hand.

1506
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,349
So I've been to get-togethers where I'm not drinking,

1507
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:41,759
but just doing a fake drink situation

1508
01:00:41,759 --> 01:00:43,399
and I can also have fun.

1509
01:00:43,399 --> 01:00:44,839
So I've been...

1510
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:48,130
But that said, traveling across the world, there are times

1511
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:50,059
when you get to be able to down a bottle of vodka.

1512
01:00:50,059 --> 01:00:53,119
That's very essential for my line of work,

1513
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,689
but that's almost like a cultural experience

1514
01:00:56,689 --> 01:00:59,059
versus a necessary component

1515
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:01,369
of a successful social interaction

1516
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:02,419
and one that brings you happiness.

1517
01:01:02,419 --> 01:01:04,189
So not drinking...

1518
01:01:04,189 --> 01:01:06,589
I think you can have fun and not drink too.

1519
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:08,149
So all of this...

1520
01:01:08,149 --> 01:01:11,329
Man, I'm so careful saying drugs have

1521
01:01:11,329 --> 01:01:14,959
had a good effect on my life

1522
01:01:14,959 --> 01:01:16,939
because I think for most people,

1523
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:19,309
no, for majority of people,

1524
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:24,309
they will in the long term have a negative effect.

1525
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,139
So I think if you were to choose one or the other,

1526
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:32,139
just no drugs and no drinking

1527
01:01:32,149 --> 01:01:33,349
means one day you can be

1528
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:35,452
the President of the United States, kids.

1529
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:38,209
And I should say...

1530
01:01:38,209 --> 01:01:39,204
Oh, man.

1531
01:01:39,204 --> 01:01:41,149
- That is his funniest line. - That means Diet Coke-

1532
01:01:41,149 --> 01:01:42,739
Diet Coke is great.

1533
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:43,886
- That's his funniest line, which is,

1534
01:01:43,886 --> 01:01:45,169
"You would hate me if I drank."

1535
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:46,002
Which I just like...

1536
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,966
To me, that tickles me to no end. Just like,

1537
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:49,759
"Oh my gosh, that is such a funny line."

1538
01:01:49,759 --> 01:01:52,006
- Self-awareness and humor is wonderful there, but yeah.

1539
01:01:52,006 --> 01:01:53,479
- But I am on your team.

1540
01:01:53,479 --> 01:01:56,270
All of the reasons why I used drugs and all that,

1541
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,909
it's some level of escapism.

1542
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:00,619
I'm sure that's like would be the archetype

1543
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:02,359
or the box I'd put that into

1544
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:04,549
or the pursuit of trying to feel something

1545
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:06,679
that cannot come from them.

1546
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:08,989
It's like trying to find meaning in your job.

1547
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:10,609
You can find satisfaction in what you do.

1548
01:02:10,609 --> 01:02:11,959
That is a very good thing.

1549
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:13,819
You can find satisfaction and be happy

1550
01:02:13,819 --> 01:02:15,139
with what you've created.

1551
01:02:15,139 --> 01:02:17,449
You can be thrilled by the experience,

1552
01:02:17,449 --> 01:02:18,499
but you cannot find...

1553
01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:21,109
I doubt you can find purpose.

1554
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:23,239
Maybe some people in specific jobs.

1555
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,489
This obviously have very broad strokes, I'm painting with.

1556
01:02:25,489 --> 01:02:27,559
Like if you're an EMT and you save someone's life,

1557
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:30,069
maybe there can be purpose in that whole experience, right?

1558
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:33,169
So I'm not saying all things, but as programming goes,

1559
01:02:33,169 --> 01:02:36,349
most programmers, you cannot just simply find your purpose.

1560
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:38,629
And same with drugs, you cannot find

1561
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,099
that thing you're looking for,

1562
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:42,322
but they are a very great distraction.

1563
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,569
And then at some point

1564
01:02:44,569 --> 01:02:46,759
that distraction comes with a heavy cost.

1565
01:02:46,759 --> 01:02:48,529
I think Dr. Faust would probably know the best

1566
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:50,929
about the heavy cost, but it's just you're making one trade

1567
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:54,199
for another and at some point the bill comes due

1568
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:56,099
and that bill can be very, very large.

1569
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:58,849
- The other moment you mentioned

1570
01:02:58,849 --> 01:03:01,039
that I think is really inspiring

1571
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,169
is that you failed pre-calculus.

1572
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:04,879
You really struggled in school.

1573
01:03:04,879 --> 01:03:06,949
You realize that school is really hard

1574
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:11,749
and then eventually you're able to sort of persevere

1575
01:03:11,749 --> 01:03:14,089
and, I don't know,

1576
01:03:14,089 --> 01:03:16,429
break through that wall of struggle.

1577
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:18,409
Can you, by way of advice,

1578
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:20,839
figure out what happened and what kind of advice

1579
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,789
you can give to people who are struggling?

1580
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:23,622
- Yeah.

1581
01:03:23,622 --> 01:03:25,369
I'll paint it in a more clear picture,

1582
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:28,069
or a very fast speed run of it is that

1583
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:29,329
I took pre-calculus, failed.

1584
01:03:29,329 --> 01:03:31,009
I took pre-calculus again, failed,

1585
01:03:31,009 --> 01:03:33,649
took pre-calculus again and got a C.

1586
01:03:33,649 --> 01:03:34,912
So I took it three times.

1587
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:39,349
Then I took Calc over the summer, so Calc 1.

1588
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:42,769
In that one at the end, the final...

1589
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:43,939
The final was a two-hour final.

1590
01:03:43,939 --> 01:03:44,989
I finished it in 30 minutes

1591
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:47,899
and that was the highest score in all of the school.

1592
01:03:47,899 --> 01:03:49,399
And I proceeded to be the highest scorer

1593
01:03:49,399 --> 01:03:50,849
in all calculus and Diffy Q.

1594
01:03:50,849 --> 01:03:52,729
I was the only person out of 400 people

1595
01:03:52,729 --> 01:03:54,262
to finish the Diffy Q final.

1596
01:03:55,189 --> 01:03:56,449
And I got the highest grade.

1597
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:58,039
And so I was like, I got really good.

1598
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:00,319
So I somehow went from really bad to really good.

1599
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,819
And my only...

1600
01:04:01,819 --> 01:04:05,509
The thing that I did is that I had to win.

1601
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,516
It was not a option.

1602
01:04:06,516 --> 01:04:08,767
It was not like, "Oh, this would be really great."

1603
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:10,249
It's like, "I will not graduate,

1604
01:04:10,249 --> 01:04:13,669
I will not finish my stuff if I cannot do this."

1605
01:04:13,669 --> 01:04:16,309
And so every single day I got up,

1606
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:19,519
I went to my however many hour class it was.

1607
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:20,352
Right after that,

1608
01:04:20,352 --> 01:04:21,829
I went straight to the math learning center,

1609
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:22,662
did those problems.

1610
01:04:22,662 --> 01:04:24,649
When I got home, I just got the book

1611
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:26,269
and it had the odd answers in the back.

1612
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:28,339
And I would try to walk through the problems

1613
01:04:28,339 --> 01:04:30,199
over and over and over and over again

1614
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,909
until I absolutely got it.

1615
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:34,189
And it just became this thing where it's just I...

1616
01:04:34,189 --> 01:04:37,189
Just simple rote memory took over

1617
01:04:37,189 --> 01:04:39,949
and the ability to just effectively have the times table,

1618
01:04:39,949 --> 01:04:42,139
but for calculus, all stuck in my head.

1619
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:44,029
Inverse trig substitution, trig substitution,

1620
01:04:44,029 --> 01:04:45,289
doing Taylor and MaClaurin series.

1621
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:46,459
All those things, kind of,

1622
01:04:46,459 --> 01:04:48,889
just over and over and over and over again.

1623
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:52,399
Eventually they became easy. They became very easy.

1624
01:04:52,399 --> 01:04:54,799
It's just that I had to cram it in there.

1625
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,959
And some people, you hear these stories,

1626
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,269
whether they barely show up to class and they get As,

1627
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:00,559
I've never been that person.

1628
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,419
I've always been the person that has to sit down,

1629
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:06,439
read through everything, and I'm bad at abstract concepts.

1630
01:05:06,439 --> 01:05:08,389
I like the concrete into the abstract,

1631
01:05:08,389 --> 01:05:10,279
not the abstract into the concrete.

1632
01:05:10,279 --> 01:05:12,049
Very bad at talking about things theoretically,

1633
01:05:12,049 --> 01:05:13,159
then trying to apply them.

1634
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,229
But if I can do it once literally,

1635
01:05:15,229 --> 01:05:17,809
then it's really easy for me to go into the abstract.

1636
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:18,642
And so it's just like...

1637
01:05:18,642 --> 01:05:20,479
For me, it's just I had...

1638
01:05:20,479 --> 01:05:22,372
There's no substitute for the hours.

1639
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,879
So if I were to give advice,

1640
01:05:25,879 --> 01:05:29,149
it's just that you have to have time in the saddle.

1641
01:05:29,149 --> 01:05:31,336
Hour after hour will make you slowly better.

1642
01:05:31,336 --> 01:05:33,019
And at first, it's crushing.

1643
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:37,069
It's defeating and it's not fun because you are bad at it.

1644
01:05:37,069 --> 01:05:39,769
But then at some point you're just not bad at it

1645
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,659
if you can just do it long enough,

1646
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:42,492
and you'll start getting okay at it.

1647
01:05:42,492 --> 01:05:44,869
And then at some point you might even get good at it.

1648
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:47,869
And when you get good at something, it feels amazing.

1649
01:05:47,869 --> 01:05:49,429
There's like an exploratory thing.

1650
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:51,679
If you've ever played a musical instrument,

1651
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:54,559
you stop having to think about

1652
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,569
all the little teeny things you have to do

1653
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:58,549
to be able to play something correctly.

1654
01:05:58,549 --> 01:06:01,489
And you start thinking about how you can explore that space.

1655
01:06:01,489 --> 01:06:03,769
It's like it's a completely different problem.

1656
01:06:03,769 --> 01:06:04,602
And same with programming,

1657
01:06:04,602 --> 01:06:07,162
programming has an identical kind of feel to it.

1658
01:06:07,162 --> 01:06:09,409
It's just like you'll cross that barrier

1659
01:06:09,409 --> 01:06:12,289
and it becomes magical as opposed to a chore.

1660
01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:13,549
- Yeah, once you cross that barrier,

1661
01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:15,862
somehow other things become easier.

1662
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:18,592
But then if you want to have a truly successful life,

1663
01:06:18,592 --> 01:06:20,329
then you find the next barrier.

1664
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:21,229
- Yeah. - The next barrier.

1665
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:22,819
Yeah, I've always been the same.

1666
01:06:22,819 --> 01:06:24,619
Everything's come really hard.

1667
01:06:24,619 --> 01:06:27,589
- Yeah, I've had no free lunches.

1668
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:31,132
Everything's just been a lot of, a lot of pain and struggle.

1669
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:36,499
- I think somebody said that, on this topic,

1670
01:06:36,499 --> 01:06:40,489
that you think work smarter not harder

1671
01:06:40,489 --> 01:06:42,592
is a phrase that you dislike.

1672
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:44,382
Somebody on Reddit told me this.

1673
01:06:44,382 --> 01:06:45,889
- Yeah. I don't just dislike it.

1674
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:47,332
I hate that phrase. - Okay.

1675
01:06:49,386 --> 01:06:51,859
- Tell me about your hatred. How do you feel?

1676
01:06:51,859 --> 01:06:54,589
- The reason why I dislike that is

1677
01:06:54,589 --> 01:06:57,349
that there is kind of a hidden suggestion there,

1678
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:00,469
which is that you already know what smarter is,

1679
01:07:00,469 --> 01:07:01,522
so just do that.

1680
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:03,949
That actually things should be easy.

1681
01:07:03,949 --> 01:07:05,719
You should just not have to try that hard.

1682
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:08,089
You should just do the quick, easy, obvious path

1683
01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:09,499
and boom, it's done.

1684
01:07:09,499 --> 01:07:13,129
It's like I've never experienced that in anything I've done.

1685
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,539
Everything is actually really hard

1686
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:17,659
and most of the time I don't even know what I'm doing,

1687
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:20,059
so therefore I don't even know what smart looks like.

1688
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:22,249
And so for me, the only way I can learn

1689
01:07:22,249 --> 01:07:25,969
how to work smart is by working very, very hard

1690
01:07:25,969 --> 01:07:27,739
and knowing that there's no shortcuts.

1691
01:07:27,739 --> 01:07:31,669
And then when I finally figure out what smart is,

1692
01:07:31,669 --> 01:07:34,639
when I work smart and work hard,

1693
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:36,499
it is that much better.

1694
01:07:36,499 --> 01:07:39,559
- I think there's a deep profound truth to that.

1695
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:40,489
- There's a lot of these phrases

1696
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,559
that just drive me nuts in our society.

1697
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,392
- But that one is...

1698
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,319
Sorry, that one is really accepted

1699
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:46,152
if you can just linger on it

1700
01:07:46,152 --> 01:07:48,559
because it really bothers me as well.

1701
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:51,559
So one, which is a really nice thing you said,

1702
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:54,619
the presumption there is things should be easy

1703
01:07:54,619 --> 01:07:58,309
and you're a failure if you don't see the easy path.

1704
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:59,239
That's kind of the implied thing.

1705
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:00,072
- Just work smart, daug,

1706
01:08:00,072 --> 01:08:02,089
why are you putting in all those hours?

1707
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:04,369
- And so it makes a lot of people that struggle

1708
01:08:04,369 --> 01:08:08,059
feel like they're a failure because I don't see it.

1709
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:12,259
And then the choice they have, I'll just go with the...

1710
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:13,519
I'll just be lazy

1711
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:16,850
and then maybe the profound truth will come to me somehow.

1712
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:19,788
And yeah, I don't think I've ever,

1713
01:08:19,788 --> 01:08:22,738
and I don't think I've met great engineers

1714
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:26,689
that find the smart way

1715
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:28,729
without the extremely hard work.

1716
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,639
The annoying thing about those great engineers

1717
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:34,429
is then looking back, they forget the hard work

1718
01:08:34,429 --> 01:08:36,242
because they remember all the joy

1719
01:08:36,242 --> 01:08:39,439
they now are experiencing from all the efficient,

1720
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,868
smart work they figured out how to do.

1721
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:42,702
They forget...

1722
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:45,889
So when they give advice they give the stupid advice

1723
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:50,026
of, well, just do it like the easy way.

1724
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:51,288
And here's the easy way.

1725
01:08:51,288 --> 01:08:52,969
But no, no, no, no, no.

1726
01:08:52,969 --> 01:08:55,042
You have to put in the hours.

1727
01:08:56,809 --> 01:08:58,698
Musical instrument is a beautiful example

1728
01:08:58,698 --> 01:08:59,929
of guitar and piano.

1729
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:03,078
I've put in, I don't know how many thousands of hours.

1730
01:09:03,078 --> 01:09:06,772
And now when I'm explaining stuff jiu-jitsu as well,

1731
01:09:10,374 --> 01:09:11,959
I sound like one of those people

1732
01:09:12,979 --> 01:09:14,988
just relax in jiu-jitsu.

1733
01:09:14,988 --> 01:09:17,389
By the way, just relax is a really wonderful thing

1734
01:09:17,389 --> 01:09:19,908
for physical endeavors like piano and so on.

1735
01:09:19,908 --> 01:09:24,049
But to learn how to relax your hand, how to relax your mind,

1736
01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:28,198
your body and use

1737
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:31,279
whatever the biomechanics of your body

1738
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,078
to apply the correct kind of leverage

1739
01:09:33,078 --> 01:09:34,459
and the timing and all that,

1740
01:09:34,459 --> 01:09:37,339
that takes thousands of hours of learning.

1741
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,488
Just to learn how to relax takes a lot of really hard work.

1742
01:09:40,488 --> 01:09:44,118
In jiu-jitsu that takes many months

1743
01:09:44,118 --> 01:09:47,988
of getting your ass beat over and over

1744
01:09:47,988 --> 01:09:52,819
until you ride the bus home crying.

1745
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:56,479
Your ego completely shattered and destroyed.

1746
01:09:56,479 --> 01:09:59,039
And then a little element

1747
01:10:00,049 --> 01:10:04,849
is figured out late that night or next morning.

1748
01:10:04,849 --> 01:10:08,269
And from the depression, there's this little plant

1749
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:11,659
that grows this flower of insight.

1750
01:10:11,659 --> 01:10:14,329
And you use that insight to then get your ass kicked again

1751
01:10:14,329 --> 01:10:18,259
all next month and year.

1752
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:19,759
And then you grow and grow and grow.

1753
01:10:19,759 --> 01:10:21,109
And from that you discover

1754
01:10:21,109 --> 01:10:24,889
how beautifully simple jiu-jitsu is or Judo is,

1755
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:27,289
just speaking for myself, or piano or guitar.

1756
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:32,289
And then yes, the profound truth

1757
01:10:32,299 --> 01:10:36,199
or the mastery of a skill feels simple

1758
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:38,149
when you finally arrive to it,

1759
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:42,582
but the path for most people is going to be a hard one.

1760
01:10:42,582 --> 01:10:45,109
- I think I should make an addendum to the phrase,

1761
01:10:45,109 --> 01:10:48,049
I think the phrase should be "Work hard, get smart."

1762
01:10:48,049 --> 01:10:50,029
- Nice. That's a t-shirt.

1763
01:10:50,029 --> 01:10:51,199
- That's what it should be.

1764
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:52,399
- Yeah, agreed.

1765
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:54,106
Okay, that was a tangent of a tangent.

1766
01:10:54,106 --> 01:10:55,969
- Can I say one more phrase, cultural phrase

1767
01:10:55,969 --> 01:10:56,802
that I absolutely hate?

1768
01:10:56,802 --> 01:10:58,256
- [Lex] Yes.

1769
01:10:58,256 --> 01:11:00,606
- "The journey is better than the destination."

1770
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:03,769
Everyone's heard this.

1771
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:06,709
Just take one second to apply what that means.

1772
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:09,499
That means forever starting from now,

1773
01:11:09,499 --> 01:11:12,702
you are only going towards a place that's worse.

1774
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:13,535
(Lex laughs)

1775
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:16,040
Right? That literally is what it means.

1776
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:16,909
- Powww.

1777
01:11:16,909 --> 01:11:20,389
- Enjoy the journey, celebrate the destination,

1778
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:22,279
that should be what it would be but no.

1779
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,839
People say these phrases, they're everywhere.

1780
01:11:23,839 --> 01:11:25,639
There's these very shallow phrases

1781
01:11:25,639 --> 01:11:27,859
that have no logical bounds to them.

1782
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:29,059
You're just like, what does that,

1783
01:11:29,059 --> 01:11:32,149
why would the journey ever be better than the destination?

1784
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:35,179
I think this might even be a C.S. Lewis quote

1785
01:11:35,179 --> 01:11:37,579
is that C.S. Lewis was like, nope, this is terrible.

1786
01:11:37,579 --> 01:11:40,789
The journey is not in fact better than the destination.

1787
01:11:40,789 --> 01:11:43,402
- I love the demotivational posters.

1788
01:11:44,816 --> 01:11:48,229
"Progress, moving forward is better than moving backwards

1789
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:50,290
even if you're still going nowhere."

1790
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:51,123
There's a lot-

1791
01:11:51,123 --> 01:11:51,956
(ThePrimeagen chuckles)

1792
01:11:51,956 --> 01:11:54,139
- I feel that one so much being in California

1793
01:11:54,139 --> 01:11:57,229
for a few years, that is painful.

1794
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,419
- [Lex] Positivity, if it doesn't break you today,

1795
01:11:59,419 --> 01:12:01,642
don't worry, it will try again tomorrow.

1796
01:12:03,049 --> 01:12:04,789
It's just a lot of really great posters.

1797
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:06,229
- I didn't even know this was a thing.

1798
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:07,219
- [Lex] This is a thing.

1799
01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:08,659
- Oh my gosh, I want that.

1800
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:09,919
- Yeah.

1801
01:12:09,919 --> 01:12:12,109
- Hey. Hi, this is ThePrimeagen.

1802
01:12:12,109 --> 01:12:15,169
One thing that I forgot to mention in this podcast,

1803
01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:17,989
which feels just so foolish to me for forgetting,

1804
01:12:17,989 --> 01:12:20,959
is just what a big role my mom played in my life.

1805
01:12:20,959 --> 01:12:23,629
She had to work 18 hours a day after my dad died.

1806
01:12:23,629 --> 01:12:26,539
She really made her house be able to survive.

1807
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:28,879
I always looked up to her and I always thought her amazing.

1808
01:12:28,879 --> 01:12:30,319
And she really was the reason why

1809
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:33,379
when I decided to get my butt kicked back in gear,

1810
01:12:33,379 --> 01:12:34,819
she's just someone who I looked to

1811
01:12:34,819 --> 01:12:38,209
as an internal inspiration for me to continuing,

1812
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:40,819
to keep on going because I really wanted to make her proud.

1813
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:43,219
And all those years of just high energy effort,

1814
01:12:43,219 --> 01:12:45,859
I really wanted to make sure that she knew

1815
01:12:45,859 --> 01:12:48,199
that I was just so dang appreciative for it.

1816
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:51,319
So hey, I just wanted to say thank you.

1817
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:52,699
Love you, mom.

1818
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:55,582
- For people who don't know, you worked in Netflix.

1819
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:59,059
- By the way. - By the way.

1820
01:12:59,059 --> 01:13:01,249
Now, how did you go from there,

1821
01:13:01,249 --> 01:13:03,619
from the hardship that we mentioned,

1822
01:13:03,619 --> 01:13:06,859
from the struggle, from the addictions and so on

1823
01:13:06,859 --> 01:13:09,889
to a place where you were working

1824
01:13:09,889 --> 01:13:12,119
at this incredible engineering company

1825
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:15,979
and building cool shit there?

1826
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:18,019
So tell the Netflix story.

1827
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:21,109
- Yeah, so I kind of alluded to it earlier

1828
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:23,389
that I wanted to do my own startup so for,

1829
01:13:23,389 --> 01:13:25,789
I forget how long it was, one or two years

1830
01:13:25,789 --> 01:13:28,039
or two and a half years, built a startup.

1831
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:29,749
PHP, jQuery,

1832
01:13:29,749 --> 01:13:32,479
everyone's favorite languages all put together.

1833
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:34,279
You can solve math stuff with jQuery.

1834
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:37,242
So I just was totally into just non-stop doing that.

1835
01:13:37,242 --> 01:13:39,889
This is the height of Stack Overflow.

1836
01:13:39,889 --> 01:13:42,349
I was asking really dumb questions on Stack Overflow

1837
01:13:42,349 --> 01:13:43,849
like what is more pythonic?

1838
01:13:43,849 --> 01:13:45,289
And then you get a bunch of up votes

1839
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:47,299
and try to steal a bunch of karma away,

1840
01:13:47,299 --> 01:13:48,532
all the fun stuff to do.

1841
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:50,232
Good times.

1842
01:13:50,232 --> 01:13:52,669
And I was just so into it breathing

1843
01:13:52,669 --> 01:13:55,195
and I just breathe it in, breathe it out,

1844
01:13:55,195 --> 01:13:56,166
and that's what I do all day every day.

1845
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:59,749
And so it's just like non-stop building of a startup.

1846
01:13:59,749 --> 01:14:01,249
Ultimately that startup failed

1847
01:14:01,249 --> 01:14:03,709
and so I had to go get a real job.

1848
01:14:03,709 --> 01:14:05,039
- Can you say what the startup was?

1849
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:08,359
- It is so wild thinking about it in the past.

1850
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:09,379
Before I tell you what it is,

1851
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:11,509
I want to tell one quick thing about my dad.

1852
01:14:11,509 --> 01:14:15,259
My dad in the early '90s, like '91, '92,

1853
01:14:15,259 --> 01:14:18,499
was building kind of a phone card company

1854
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:21,679
where you'd be able to pre-purchase long-distance minutes.

1855
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:26,124
Now, if you remember the '90s at about what '97, '98, '99,

1856
01:14:26,124 --> 01:14:29,299
10-10-220, all those different things down the center,

1857
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:30,769
all those companies

1858
01:14:30,769 --> 01:14:33,679
where you can pre-purchase long-distance minutes

1859
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,719
kind of came out and were very, very big.

1860
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:39,109
And so my dad was six years early to that notion

1861
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:41,689
and ultimately his startup failed.

1862
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:44,149
But he was just really early to something

1863
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:46,039
that would catch on really, really big

1864
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:48,919
specifically in the telecommunication space.

1865
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:51,109
Me as I grew up and did my own startup,

1866
01:14:51,109 --> 01:14:52,939
I did a startup where was text message marketing.

1867
01:14:52,939 --> 01:14:55,069
This was in 2010 where you could receive,

1868
01:14:55,069 --> 01:14:58,159
say texts about various deals, all that kind of stuff.

1869
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,949
And of course, 10 years later

1870
01:15:00,949 --> 01:15:02,779
now you don't stop receiving texts

1871
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:05,676
and text message marketing is all the rage.

1872
01:15:05,676 --> 01:15:07,939
And so I also, much like my father

1873
01:15:07,939 --> 01:15:09,919
had a startup in the telemarketing space

1874
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:12,829
in which was just like a half decade too early.

1875
01:15:12,829 --> 01:15:13,729
- So is it fair to say

1876
01:15:13,729 --> 01:15:15,769
you're almost always ahead of your time,

1877
01:15:15,769 --> 01:15:17,059
that you're a visionary of sorts?

1878
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:19,039
- No, in fact, I am not ahead of my time.

1879
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:23,209
I just got, some would say I got unlucky on that situation.

1880
01:15:23,209 --> 01:15:25,819
But it seems so obvious to me

1881
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:27,379
at that time when I was doing it,

1882
01:15:27,379 --> 01:15:29,749
80% of phones were dumb phones.

1883
01:15:29,749 --> 01:15:31,309
Most people had flip phones.

1884
01:15:31,309 --> 01:15:33,709
When I went and sold Via Text,

1885
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:36,739
is what the name was of that specific product.

1886
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:38,599
And we had the short code via text too,

1887
01:15:38,599 --> 01:15:41,152
so it was pretty clever, six digits.

1888
01:15:42,649 --> 01:15:43,579
When I went out and sold it,

1889
01:15:43,579 --> 01:15:45,409
I only had a flip phone during that time.

1890
01:15:45,409 --> 01:15:47,479
I didn't even have a smartphone

1891
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:50,779
because they were kind of untenable for a lot of people.

1892
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:53,809
So it's kind of just wild times to think about.

1893
01:15:53,809 --> 01:15:56,419
But then after that, obviously had to get a real job.

1894
01:15:56,419 --> 01:16:00,619
We were living in an apartment right next to campus,

1895
01:16:00,619 --> 01:16:01,699
Bozeman, Montana.

1896
01:16:01,699 --> 01:16:05,809
And the guy below us must've been on some amount of drugs.

1897
01:16:05,809 --> 01:16:06,642
He threatened to kill us several times,

1898
01:16:06,642 --> 01:16:10,699
would just scream and just lose his marbles all the time.

1899
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,729
Very unhinged man, angry downstairs man is what we call him.

1900
01:16:13,729 --> 01:16:16,609
One time my wife dropped a battery, double A.

1901
01:16:16,609 --> 01:16:19,906
Okay, so we're not talking about a B battery or D battery.

1902
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:21,019
We're just talking about a double A,

1903
01:16:21,019 --> 01:16:22,946
drop it, pa, land on the ground,

1904
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:24,409
"I'm going to kill you."

1905
01:16:24,409 --> 01:16:27,649
Like crazy, absolutely unhinged behavior down there.

1906
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,359
So I had to go get a real job,

1907
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:30,459
we needed to move out of there.

1908
01:16:30,459 --> 01:16:31,716
We were gonna start our life.

1909
01:16:31,716 --> 01:16:34,489
And so I worked at a small place Schedulicity,

1910
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,349
which I kind of talked about the boredom there.

1911
01:16:36,349 --> 01:16:38,089
Got to go to a place called WebFilings

1912
01:16:38,089 --> 01:16:40,039
where I'm working just tons and tons of hours.

1913
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:41,299
During all that time I'm still trying

1914
01:16:41,299 --> 01:16:42,499
to figure out startups.

1915
01:16:42,499 --> 01:16:43,399
Did one where you could

1916
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:46,549
pre-wish your friend's birthday messages,

1917
01:16:46,549 --> 01:16:48,229
and then it would automatically send it

1918
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:50,389
via Facebook beforehand.

1919
01:16:50,389 --> 01:16:51,413
We called it Greet Feed.

1920
01:16:51,413 --> 01:16:52,969
It was pretty clever.

1921
01:16:52,969 --> 01:16:56,389
Nonetheless, I say all that story

1922
01:16:56,389 --> 01:16:58,489
because everything that I was doing was exploring,

1923
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:01,459
building, finishing things, working,

1924
01:17:01,459 --> 01:17:02,689
learning about corporate life,

1925
01:17:02,689 --> 01:17:04,969
learning how to communicate in corporate life,

1926
01:17:04,969 --> 01:17:07,279
being able to be successful at a job,

1927
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:10,099
learning about a bunch of technologies that we're about.

1928
01:17:10,099 --> 01:17:12,049
And one of the big technologies during that day,

1929
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:14,809
specifically 2013 was RxJS,

1930
01:17:14,809 --> 01:17:16,399
if you remember that one, RxJS,

1931
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:19,369
that's a link from C-sharp

1932
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:22,249
kind of ported over to JavaScript.

1933
01:17:22,249 --> 01:17:23,239
- And for people who don't know,

1934
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,789
I guess C-sharp, what is its closest neighbor?

1935
01:17:25,789 --> 01:17:27,019
Java, is Java-

1936
01:17:27,019 --> 01:17:28,159
- They obviously just took Java

1937
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,539
and ripped it off at one point,

1938
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:33,199
but now it's such a dynamic, interesting language

1939
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,599
that it seems like it could be a really cool

1940
01:17:35,599 --> 01:17:37,579
bounds of practical versus not practical.

1941
01:17:37,579 --> 01:17:39,769
It's just I'm not really into wearing pleated pants

1942
01:17:39,769 --> 01:17:42,349
and programming at a Microsoft house, so.

1943
01:17:42,349 --> 01:17:43,879
- Is pleated pants a requirement?

1944
01:17:43,879 --> 01:17:44,712
- [ThePrimeagen] I think so.

1945
01:17:44,712 --> 01:17:45,979
- Okay. - We'll get back to this.

1946
01:17:45,979 --> 01:17:47,729
Can we just get back- - All right.

1947
01:17:48,742 --> 01:17:50,715
- Triggering me here. - WebFilings.

1948
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:52,358
- So anyways, WebFilings was that's

1949
01:17:52,358 --> 01:17:55,999
where I had to do all the matrices stuff and build systems

1950
01:17:55,999 --> 01:17:57,889
and just kind of all that. And it really pushed me

1951
01:17:57,889 --> 01:18:01,189
because they also wanted me to do 60 hours a week.

1952
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:04,369
It was not very healthy work-life balance.

1953
01:18:04,369 --> 01:18:05,479
It was very hard work.

1954
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:06,949
And kind of that really hard work

1955
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:09,919
going to cutting edge stuff, really understanding the world,

1956
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:13,009
really made it so that I was able to

1957
01:18:13,009 --> 01:18:14,809
just be able to talk about stuff very commandingly

1958
01:18:14,809 --> 01:18:17,029
because we had to build really complex state machines

1959
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:18,586
for the UI for what we're building.

1960
01:18:18,586 --> 01:18:22,219
And so when I went and started getting a LinkedIn

1961
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:25,489
and all that, inevitably just due to the fact

1962
01:18:25,489 --> 01:18:26,899
that I've touched all these technologies

1963
01:18:26,899 --> 01:18:29,209
and I had some sort of paper trail saying,

1964
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:31,669
I've touched these technologies or Microsoft.

1965
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:33,049
Dang it, Lex.

1966
01:18:33,049 --> 01:18:33,882
- Pleated pants.

1967
01:18:33,882 --> 01:18:34,715
- Pleated pants reached out.

1968
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:36,896
No, Netflix reached out and said,

1969
01:18:36,896 --> 01:18:41,896
"Hey, I see you've done RxJS. We do a lot of it.

1970
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:43,969
You want to come and interview with us?"

1971
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:48,259
And I was always told that you should never reject

1972
01:18:48,259 --> 01:18:51,349
kind of a handwritten personal invitation to interview.

1973
01:18:51,349 --> 01:18:53,719
This was way before bots and even the bots

1974
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:55,669
were pretty obvious to tell they were bots.

1975
01:18:55,669 --> 01:18:58,519
This was a manager at Netflix, Jeff Wagner,

1976
01:18:58,519 --> 01:18:59,659
first manager ever.

1977
01:18:59,659 --> 01:19:01,436
And he just wrote a really nice note and just like,

1978
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,169
"Hey, I see you're doing a lot of these things.

1979
01:19:03,169 --> 01:19:05,749
We really need help with JavaScript.

1980
01:19:05,749 --> 01:19:07,039
I would love for you to come interview.

1981
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:08,539
We're even using a lot of RxJS

1982
01:19:08,539 --> 01:19:09,589
if you're interested in that."

1983
01:19:09,589 --> 01:19:12,169
And so I was like, all right, I can come and I'll interview.

1984
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:15,829
And lo and behold, interview went on

1985
01:19:15,829 --> 01:19:19,939
and I called my wife I think halfway through the interview

1986
01:19:19,939 --> 01:19:23,929
and I was just like defeated, absolutely crushed

1987
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:25,339
because I said...

1988
01:19:25,339 --> 01:19:27,896
And she might remember this but I said,

1989
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:29,539
"We now have to make a decision.

1990
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:31,219
Are we actually going to move to California or not?"

1991
01:19:31,219 --> 01:19:33,079
Because I already knew I had the job at that point.

1992
01:19:33,079 --> 01:19:36,139
I was just knocking them out of the park.

1993
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:37,756
I was doing a great job on that.

1994
01:19:37,756 --> 01:19:41,032
And so I just knew for a fact, I'm getting a job at Netflix.

1995
01:19:42,679 --> 01:19:44,389
There's this thing that people always get so freaked out

1996
01:19:44,389 --> 01:19:46,189
about when it comes to interviews and all that.

1997
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:48,529
And I luckily somehow avoided this.

1998
01:19:48,529 --> 01:19:50,809
I don't get test anxiety, I don't get any of that

1999
01:19:50,809 --> 01:19:53,089
because when I go into these situations,

2000
01:19:53,089 --> 01:19:56,269
my only goal is to show the things I already know.

2001
01:19:56,269 --> 01:19:58,669
And so it's like I walked into this situation,

2002
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,949
I've been preparing for this 80 hours a week

2003
01:20:00,949 --> 01:20:02,929
for the last five years.

2004
01:20:02,929 --> 01:20:05,389
So just walk in and I'm just showing the things I know.

2005
01:20:05,389 --> 01:20:07,819
And it was perfectly fitting for Netflix at that time period

2006
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:11,359
in the 2013, early JavaScript days on television.

2007
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:15,379
And so it was just awesome, just worked out perfectly.

2008
01:20:15,379 --> 01:20:16,879
Got hired there.

2009
01:20:16,879 --> 01:20:18,439
- So we're in California with Netflix.

2010
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:19,272
This is San Francisco.

2011
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:20,509
- Los Gatos.

2012
01:20:20,509 --> 01:20:25,429
So if you're familiar, so classic symbol people do

2013
01:20:25,429 --> 01:20:28,549
which is this is San Francisco, Oakland,

2014
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:31,849
San Jose, Los Gatos is just like a little bit,

2015
01:20:31,849 --> 01:20:34,489
kind of a little bit below, little bit south of San Jose,

2016
01:20:34,489 --> 01:20:36,229
same mega contiguous city.

2017
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:38,719
- Yellowstone is in Montana, Yellowstone, the show.

2018
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:39,979
- Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.

2019
01:20:39,979 --> 01:20:41,419
So is it basically like that,

2020
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:43,249
Kevin Costner riding on a horse?

2021
01:20:43,249 --> 01:20:45,919
Were you riding on a horse to campus?

2022
01:20:45,919 --> 01:20:48,199
- No, but I love those stereotypes.

2023
01:20:48,199 --> 01:20:51,799
Actually to be completely fair, when I was 15 years old,

2024
01:20:51,799 --> 01:20:54,049
I was driving around on

2025
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:57,019
what is now a very busy populated street

2026
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:59,892
shooting gophers out the window of our car with a 22.

2027
01:20:59,892 --> 01:21:02,599
So it's like Montana was a different place

2028
01:21:02,599 --> 01:21:04,009
at one point than it is today.

2029
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:05,659
And there's plenty of parts of Montana

2030
01:21:05,659 --> 01:21:06,769
that's still very rural,

2031
01:21:06,769 --> 01:21:09,019
still kind of more of that old world.

2032
01:21:09,019 --> 01:21:11,089
So yeah, a little bit, you know,

2033
01:21:11,089 --> 01:21:12,919
you can get whatever you want from Montana.

2034
01:21:12,919 --> 01:21:14,359
As far as culturally goes,

2035
01:21:14,359 --> 01:21:17,269
I'm not really sure the best way to put the difference

2036
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:19,909
between California and Montana.

2037
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:21,979
It's just different expectations.

2038
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:24,499
One thing I can really appreciate about California,

2039
01:21:24,499 --> 01:21:26,329
or at least when I say California,

2040
01:21:26,329 --> 01:21:27,829
I mean the Silicon Valley.

2041
01:21:27,829 --> 01:21:30,979
Because obviously LA and the Silicon Valley,

2042
01:21:30,979 --> 01:21:33,229
very different attitudes, very different mindsets.

2043
01:21:33,229 --> 01:21:35,239
You can't really compare one to the other.

2044
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:37,639
One thing I can say that's really positive about the valley

2045
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:41,209
is that everybody is operating on this idea

2046
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:43,339
of trying to build or create something,

2047
01:21:43,339 --> 01:21:46,459
and there's an energy to it that's very exciting.

2048
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:47,989
You meet somebody and they have a startup

2049
01:21:47,989 --> 01:21:49,186
and they're working on the startup.

2050
01:21:49,186 --> 01:21:50,449
And it's very exciting.

2051
01:21:50,449 --> 01:21:53,509
And there's a lot of negative aspects to that,

2052
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:55,909
and we can all agree that our entire life

2053
01:21:55,909 --> 01:21:58,669
being commercialized has probably not been that great.

2054
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:00,649
But the kind of the experience of being there

2055
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,601
and everyone's excited to build something,

2056
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:03,619
it's a really cool experience.

2057
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,179
- Yeah, it's great. It's really great.

2058
01:22:05,179 --> 01:22:06,319
The excitement, the energy.

2059
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:08,338
- Yeah, Montana doesn't have that.

2060
01:22:08,338 --> 01:22:11,269
- I have an admiration, a romantic admiration

2061
01:22:11,269 --> 01:22:13,459
for the shows like Yellowstone being out on nature.

2062
01:22:13,459 --> 01:22:15,499
It's beautiful. I like riding horses.

2063
01:22:15,499 --> 01:22:16,879
Somebody also said...

2064
01:22:16,879 --> 01:22:19,129
Reddit is full of wisdom about you.

2065
01:22:19,129 --> 01:22:21,649
Some of it could be fake news, but something about horses

2066
01:22:21,649 --> 01:22:23,479
and this kind of thing.

2067
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:24,582
You like horses, you like riding horses?

2068
01:22:24,582 --> 01:22:25,729
- We have horses on...

2069
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:29,749
Our neighbor had much more hilly land

2070
01:22:29,749 --> 01:22:32,089
and one of the horses broke its leg,

2071
01:22:32,089 --> 01:22:33,559
so they had to put it down.

2072
01:22:33,559 --> 01:22:35,839
And so we just said, "Hey, we are on much flatter land.

2073
01:22:35,839 --> 01:22:38,026
You can just have your horses in our property."

2074
01:22:38,026 --> 01:22:41,269
And so we just have horses that run around on our...

2075
01:22:41,269 --> 01:22:43,009
- What about milking cows?

2076
01:22:43,009 --> 01:22:46,102
Somebody asked about cattle and cow.

2077
01:22:47,029 --> 01:22:49,639
- So I've only had open cows.

2078
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:51,409
If you don't know, cow means girl,

2079
01:22:51,409 --> 01:22:54,499
open means that, hey, they've tried to get the cow pregnant.

2080
01:22:54,499 --> 01:22:56,299
The cow did not get pregnant first try.

2081
01:22:56,299 --> 01:22:57,649
And so they're calling that gene,

2082
01:22:57,649 --> 01:22:58,519
they're getting rid of that gene.

2083
01:22:58,519 --> 01:23:01,849
The open cow is gonna now go out to pasture,

2084
01:23:01,849 --> 01:23:03,529
pasture for the year and then get turned

2085
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:06,319
into delicious T-bone steaks and various things.

2086
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:10,519
And so we would house open cows on our property.

2087
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:13,129
So no, there's no milking of open cows.

2088
01:23:13,129 --> 01:23:13,962
- [Lex] Okay.

2089
01:23:13,962 --> 01:23:16,939
- They'd be very upset if you tried to milk an open cow

2090
01:23:16,939 --> 01:23:17,976
because they're not milking cows.

2091
01:23:17,976 --> 01:23:20,209
You have to get that cow pregnant.

2092
01:23:20,209 --> 01:23:21,131
And then once you get it pregnant,

2093
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:21,964
you have to kind of put it

2094
01:23:21,964 --> 01:23:23,989
into this permanent state of milking and all that.

2095
01:23:23,989 --> 01:23:27,979
And it's a little bit more complicated than say what we did,

2096
01:23:27,979 --> 01:23:30,349
which was just cows on eating grass

2097
01:23:30,349 --> 01:23:32,269
and I didn't have to touch them.

2098
01:23:32,269 --> 01:23:33,829
- Okay, well, that's wonderful.

2099
01:23:33,829 --> 01:23:36,379
- Reddit is not a great place for wisdom about me.

2100
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:38,959
They're gonna give you the craziest answers.

2101
01:23:38,959 --> 01:23:41,872
- We'll return to Reddit time and time again, my friend.

2102
01:23:43,249 --> 01:23:45,319
So yeah, you took the leap into Netflix.

2103
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:47,179
So what was that like?

2104
01:23:47,179 --> 01:23:49,607
- It was, you know...

2105
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:51,529
This is one of those things where when you talk about it,

2106
01:23:51,529 --> 01:23:54,379
people love to trivialize this

2107
01:23:54,379 --> 01:23:56,059
because it's like, oh, you're taking a leap of faith

2108
01:23:56,059 --> 01:23:57,679
by going into a FANG company.

2109
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:00,829
And in 2013, sounds super risky.

2110
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:02,659
My wife was 36 weeks pregnant.

2111
01:24:02,659 --> 01:24:06,739
We had to travel to a place where we knew not a soul.

2112
01:24:06,739 --> 01:24:07,879
We were about to have our first kid.

2113
01:24:07,879 --> 01:24:09,079
We didn't even have a doctor.

2114
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:10,680
If you don't know what having a baby does,

2115
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,729
you kind of want a relationship with a doctor.

2116
01:24:13,729 --> 01:24:15,739
There's a whole thing that goes on there.

2117
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:20,539
So it was a really hard and great experience.

2118
01:24:20,539 --> 01:24:22,549
So I went to a job in which their culture deck...

2119
01:24:22,549 --> 01:24:25,669
So during this time, this is where Netflix still had

2120
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:29,239
kind of that old generation X feel to it.

2121
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:32,239
Their culture deck was hire fast, fire fast.

2122
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,776
It was very in your face about like,

2123
01:24:33,776 --> 01:24:34,879
"Hey, this is how we operate.

2124
01:24:34,879 --> 01:24:36,229
You don't meet the standards, we kick you out."

2125
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:38,299
So it's like I'm leaving a place

2126
01:24:38,299 --> 01:24:39,979
where it's more secure to go

2127
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:41,779
to a place I don't know anybody,

2128
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:45,529
to a job that's bold in its claims about firing everybody

2129
01:24:45,529 --> 01:24:48,259
with a wife that's just about to have a baby.

2130
01:24:48,259 --> 01:24:52,369
And I'm from Montana and every Montanan's born

2131
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:54,049
with a natural dislike of California.

2132
01:24:54,049 --> 01:24:56,779
So there's all these things kind of flowing into it

2133
01:24:56,779 --> 01:24:57,612
where it's just going to be like,

2134
01:24:57,612 --> 01:25:01,459
wow, this is a very intense experience.

2135
01:25:01,459 --> 01:25:04,159
And it was hard for sure.

2136
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,559
It wasn't just some easy simple experience

2137
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:09,469
that we were just like, oh, well, I work now at FANG.

2138
01:25:09,469 --> 01:25:10,669
We had to kind of work through that.

2139
01:25:10,669 --> 01:25:11,959
Having a kid was very difficult.

2140
01:25:11,959 --> 01:25:14,149
Our first kid was very difficult.

2141
01:25:14,149 --> 01:25:16,879
Not having any family around to ever help you

2142
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:20,869
took a much larger toll on my wife than me, for sure.

2143
01:25:20,869 --> 01:25:22,969
- What was the technical learning curve for you?

2144
01:25:22,969 --> 01:25:25,999
You showed up in your plaid pants, dressed up?

2145
01:25:25,999 --> 01:25:27,517
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.

2146
01:25:27,517 --> 01:25:28,879
- What did you have to learn about the Stack?

2147
01:25:28,879 --> 01:25:31,909
Because Netflix, I imagine

2148
01:25:31,909 --> 01:25:33,619
is this incredible infrastructure.

2149
01:25:33,619 --> 01:25:36,736
It has to deliver just a huge amount of data.

2150
01:25:36,736 --> 01:25:40,399
I'm just blown away by Netflix

2151
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:42,109
but also YouTube.

2152
01:25:42,109 --> 01:25:45,829
These companies that have to deliver,

2153
01:25:45,829 --> 01:25:49,369
serve a huge amount of bits.

2154
01:25:52,009 --> 01:25:53,269
Netflix has it easiest.

2155
01:25:53,269 --> 01:25:54,949
Out of all the companies Netflix by...

2156
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:57,379
Even though you could say

2157
01:25:57,379 --> 01:26:00,289
maybe we beat YouTube in view hours, I'm not sure if we do,

2158
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:01,789
but let's just pretend Netflix has

2159
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:05,329
5X more view hours than YouTube.

2160
01:26:05,329 --> 01:26:08,329
Whatever it is, Netflix has a fundamentally easier problem

2161
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:09,349
than all other companies.

2162
01:26:09,349 --> 01:26:10,279
And let's get back to that.

2163
01:26:10,279 --> 01:26:11,449
I'm gonna first tell you about the Stack,

2164
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:13,759
but I'll tell you why it has a fundamentally easier problem.

2165
01:26:13,759 --> 01:26:15,112
So when I first got there,

2166
01:26:15,979 --> 01:26:18,169
they gave me my PlayStation three.

2167
01:26:18,169 --> 01:26:20,689
My boss said, "Go learn some code.

2168
01:26:20,689 --> 01:26:21,889
Come back to me in a couple of days

2169
01:26:21,889 --> 01:26:22,722
and tell me what you've learned.

2170
01:26:22,722 --> 01:26:23,969
And then I'm going to start giving you bugs to fix."

2171
01:26:23,969 --> 01:26:25,829
- Wait, wait, PlayStation three, what are you talking about?

2172
01:26:25,829 --> 01:26:27,799
- Well, I was on the TV team.

2173
01:26:27,799 --> 01:26:29,779
I had to go plug in a PlayStation

2174
01:26:29,779 --> 01:26:32,479
and start launching programs onto the PlayStation three

2175
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:35,809
and figure out how to work Netflix on a television device.

2176
01:26:35,809 --> 01:26:37,939
- Oh, so you have different kinds of devices.

2177
01:26:37,939 --> 01:26:40,024
Why PlayStation three, is other different-

2178
01:26:40,024 --> 01:26:41,299
- It's just 2013. That's what you have.

2179
01:26:41,299 --> 01:26:42,919
- Any devices that plug into the TV?

2180
01:26:42,919 --> 01:26:43,752
Okay, cool.

2181
01:26:43,752 --> 01:26:45,949
- Yeah, not as many TVs had Netflix,

2182
01:26:45,949 --> 01:26:47,959
let alone what they called their Darwin app,

2183
01:26:47,959 --> 01:26:49,569
which is their new application.

2184
01:26:49,569 --> 01:26:51,469
So if you bought a VIZIO earlier that year,

2185
01:26:51,469 --> 01:26:52,549
you'd get their older one there.

2186
01:26:52,549 --> 01:26:55,519
It's called Plus UI. You get their older version.

2187
01:26:55,519 --> 01:26:57,289
And so not many had the newer version.

2188
01:26:57,289 --> 01:26:58,609
We no longer supported Plus

2189
01:26:58,609 --> 01:27:00,439
or we never actively developed on Plus,

2190
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:01,639
we only did stuff on Darwin.

2191
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:04,639
And so I had to learn that whole stack,

2192
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:07,309
the backend or the middle end, the middle layer

2193
01:27:07,309 --> 01:27:09,469
between the actual back-end and the front-end

2194
01:27:09,469 --> 01:27:10,999
was written in Groovy.

2195
01:27:10,999 --> 01:27:12,939
And as I went around, Groovy is

2196
01:27:12,939 --> 01:27:14,869
if you're not familiar with Jenkins,

2197
01:27:14,869 --> 01:27:17,059
then you've probably never interacted with Groovy.

2198
01:27:17,059 --> 01:27:20,029
But Groovy is a JVM language.

2199
01:27:20,029 --> 01:27:24,619
It's a very interesting language,

2200
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:27,649
but here's how it got started at Netflix.

2201
01:27:27,649 --> 01:27:28,482
- Oh, it's Apache.

2202
01:27:28,482 --> 01:27:29,929
Apache Groovy is a powerful object-oriented

2203
01:27:29,929 --> 01:27:31,609
programming language that runs

2204
01:27:31,609 --> 01:27:34,699
on the Java virtual machine released in 2007.

2205
01:27:34,699 --> 01:27:36,859
It has evolved to become a versatile language

2206
01:27:36,859 --> 01:27:40,099
that combines both static and dynamic typing capabilities.

2207
01:27:40,099 --> 01:27:42,289
- All right, so the AI is kind of lying to you.

2208
01:27:42,289 --> 01:27:45,109
Groovy is not a powerful great language.

2209
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:47,809
That statement makes it seem way cooler than it actually is.

2210
01:27:47,809 --> 01:27:50,659
You'll meet one out of 100 people that have touched Groovy

2211
01:27:50,659 --> 01:27:53,059
that said, "Oh yeah, Groovy's great."

2212
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:55,279
The other 99 will be like, "Heavens forbid,

2213
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:57,199
you ever have to touch that language."

2214
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:01,919
So when I got there, nobody, not a single soul at Netflix,

2215
01:28:01,919 --> 01:28:04,939
those 40-some engineers had any idea

2216
01:28:04,939 --> 01:28:06,649
how Groovy pretty much worked.

2217
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:09,559
Somehow people just hacked together these scripts

2218
01:28:09,559 --> 01:28:11,659
and put them all on there and it worked.

2219
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:16,189
And this was before there was a Groovy RX port.

2220
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:18,469
We wrote our own version called WX.

2221
01:28:18,469 --> 01:28:21,319
It was a nightmare, observables, all these things.

2222
01:28:21,319 --> 01:28:23,216
I remember one time they told me that,

2223
01:28:23,216 --> 01:28:25,309
"Oh yeah, with RX it's really easy.

2224
01:28:25,309 --> 01:28:26,329
You just say what you need to do.

2225
01:28:26,329 --> 01:28:27,949
It maps out and boom, boom, boom,

2226
01:28:27,949 --> 01:28:28,782
everything will run and all that."

2227
01:28:28,782 --> 01:28:30,859
And I was like, "Oh wow, really?"

2228
01:28:30,859 --> 01:28:35,749
So all I did was go like observable.sleep one

2229
01:28:35,749 --> 01:28:36,949
because I just wanted to see it sleep

2230
01:28:36,949 --> 01:28:38,239
and then do the next thing.

2231
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,699
And it turns out when a thread sleeps itself,

2232
01:28:40,699 --> 01:28:42,199
no thread can wake it up.

2233
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:43,969
And I just turned off all of staging

2234
01:28:43,969 --> 01:28:45,059
because I ran it like 10 times.

2235
01:28:45,059 --> 01:28:46,699
Like, oh, it's not responding. Oh, it's not responding.

2236
01:28:46,699 --> 01:28:48,469
Oh, now it's not even coming back.

2237
01:28:48,469 --> 01:28:50,389
Broke all of staging for everybody.

2238
01:28:50,389 --> 01:28:52,549
So no developer could work for the rest of the afternoon

2239
01:28:52,549 --> 01:28:54,109
because I locked up all the instances

2240
01:28:54,109 --> 01:28:57,169
because it turns out no, it was in fact not multi-threaded.

2241
01:28:57,169 --> 01:28:59,119
Every assumption we've been told is a lie.

2242
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:00,949
No one had any idea what they were doing.

2243
01:29:00,949 --> 01:29:03,679
It was a wild time.

2244
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:05,779
And so I just simply naturally gravitated

2245
01:29:05,779 --> 01:29:08,059
towards that because I'm good at print off debugging.

2246
01:29:08,059 --> 01:29:09,171
I'm good at doing those things.

2247
01:29:09,171 --> 01:29:10,729
So I was like, yeah, I'll just figure this out here.

2248
01:29:10,729 --> 01:29:11,719
I will do this.

2249
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:14,089
So I had the rewrite how we do the data structure

2250
01:29:14,089 --> 01:29:16,309
on the front-end for the TV

2251
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,019
from what is called a LoLoMo,

2252
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,012
list of list of movies into LoLoRoMo,

2253
01:29:20,012 --> 01:29:24,049
which is a list of list of recommendation objects for movie.

2254
01:29:24,049 --> 01:29:25,309
Why would we need to do that? Think about this.

2255
01:29:25,309 --> 01:29:29,059
You have two lists, one has Live Free Die Hard, Bruce Willis

2256
01:29:29,059 --> 01:29:30,169
because you love Bruce Willis.

2257
01:29:30,169 --> 01:29:31,909
The other one has Live Free Die Hard

2258
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:34,309
because you want tough men doing tough jobs.

2259
01:29:34,309 --> 01:29:36,679
Well, during those days we'd only have one way

2260
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:38,359
we could show evidence why you wanted it.

2261
01:29:38,359 --> 01:29:39,192
So we couldn't say,

2262
01:29:39,192 --> 01:29:40,729
"Oh, because you liked this other movie."

2263
01:29:40,729 --> 01:29:42,649
You'd go to that one and say the same thing.

2264
01:29:42,649 --> 01:29:44,749
So we had to add one level of indirection

2265
01:29:44,749 --> 01:29:47,239
where we could decorate the video

2266
01:29:47,239 --> 01:29:49,009
with the recommendation information.

2267
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:50,299
- Okay, so you can abstract away

2268
01:29:50,299 --> 01:29:52,069
into the space of recommendation

2269
01:29:52,069 --> 01:29:53,779
versus the space of movies directly.

2270
01:29:53,779 --> 01:29:55,609
- Yeah, so you can't hang it off the video

2271
01:29:55,609 --> 01:29:57,589
because obviously then it would be the same for everything

2272
01:29:57,589 --> 01:29:58,639
that shows that same video.

2273
01:29:58,639 --> 01:29:59,472
- [Lex] That's amazing.

2274
01:29:59,472 --> 01:30:01,688
- I had to do all this and I wrote it in Groovy,

2275
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:03,421
and I just did it-

2276
01:30:03,421 --> 01:30:04,796
- Such a funny name. - And people were like,

2277
01:30:04,796 --> 01:30:06,559
"How did you write this in Groovy?"

2278
01:30:06,559 --> 01:30:10,009
And I was just like, "Well, I read the language reference

2279
01:30:10,009 --> 01:30:11,839
for a day and then programmed it."

2280
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:13,219
Well, what do you mean?

2281
01:30:13,219 --> 01:30:16,159
It was a very radical language, shall we say.

2282
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:18,379
And so I just simply became the person

2283
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:19,212
that knew these things,

2284
01:30:19,212 --> 01:30:20,929
so they just give me more and more jobs with that.

2285
01:30:20,929 --> 01:30:22,459
And so that's kind of how I excelled,

2286
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:23,959
being the person that was willing to do the thing

2287
01:30:23,959 --> 01:30:25,339
that no one else was.

2288
01:30:25,339 --> 01:30:27,799
- Yeah. Can you actually speak to the print off debugging.

2289
01:30:27,799 --> 01:30:30,109
You walk into a system

2290
01:30:30,109 --> 01:30:32,389
and there's a lot of systems in the world like this.

2291
01:30:32,389 --> 01:30:35,719
Twitter was like this, when Elon acquired Twitter

2292
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:40,719
and the rolls in and there's this old junky code base

2293
01:30:40,759 --> 01:30:42,079
that's just like a giant mess,

2294
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:44,479
and you have to basically do print off debugging.

2295
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:46,579
What's the process of going into a code base

2296
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:48,049
and figuring out what the fuck?

2297
01:30:48,049 --> 01:30:49,609
Well, how does this work? What are the flaws?

2298
01:30:49,609 --> 01:30:50,509
What are the assumptions?

2299
01:30:50,509 --> 01:30:53,389
You have to reverse engineer what all these other engineers

2300
01:30:53,389 --> 01:30:55,489
did in the past and the mess

2301
01:30:55,489 --> 01:30:57,799
across the space of months and years,

2302
01:30:57,799 --> 01:30:59,029
and you have to figure out

2303
01:30:59,029 --> 01:31:01,479
how all that works in order to make improvements.

2304
01:31:02,329 --> 01:31:03,162
- The reason why...

2305
01:31:03,162 --> 01:31:04,789
I've always just been good at print off debugging

2306
01:31:04,789 --> 01:31:07,069
because one of my first kind of side quest jobs that I got

2307
01:31:07,069 --> 01:31:08,749
was writing robots for the government

2308
01:31:08,749 --> 01:31:10,069
when I was still at school.

2309
01:31:10,069 --> 01:31:11,989
And so I'd kind of do this contractually

2310
01:31:11,989 --> 01:31:15,589
for so many hours a week.

2311
01:31:15,589 --> 01:31:18,469
And my boss, Hunter Lloyd, great professor by the way,

2312
01:31:18,469 --> 01:31:22,489
he just said, "Hey, here's your computer, here's the robot,

2313
01:31:22,489 --> 01:31:23,509
here's how you plug it in.

2314
01:31:23,509 --> 01:31:24,739
Here's how you run the code.

2315
01:31:24,739 --> 01:31:26,839
Can you write the flash driver, the ethernet driver.

2316
01:31:26,839 --> 01:31:28,429
Can you write the planetary pancake motor?

2317
01:31:28,429 --> 01:31:31,459
Here's some manuals, I'm missing some.

2318
01:31:31,459 --> 01:31:33,109
Just figure it out, I'll be back."

2319
01:31:33,109 --> 01:31:34,468
So that was government work for me.

2320
01:31:34,468 --> 01:31:35,746
So I was like, okay, I'll figure all these things out.

2321
01:31:35,746 --> 01:31:37,159
And I figured them all out

2322
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:40,279
and the only way to really get anything out of the machine

2323
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:41,749
was to print.

2324
01:31:41,749 --> 01:31:44,479
And so it's like I had to become really good

2325
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:46,969
at printing my way through problems.

2326
01:31:46,969 --> 01:31:49,519
And so that kind of became this skill I guess I adopted

2327
01:31:49,519 --> 01:31:51,559
is that I can just kind of print off debug

2328
01:31:51,559 --> 01:31:53,089
my way through a lot of these problems.

2329
01:31:53,089 --> 01:31:54,409
Obviously I'm not a game developer,

2330
01:31:54,409 --> 01:31:56,299
probably a different world probably should use...

2331
01:31:56,299 --> 01:31:57,619
I think John Carmack was on here

2332
01:31:57,619 --> 01:32:00,079
and talked to how great the debugger is, different world.

2333
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:01,339
Because when I was at Netflix,

2334
01:32:01,339 --> 01:32:04,399
there's machines that exist somewhere on AWS,

2335
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:05,329
I'm not logged into them.

2336
01:32:05,329 --> 01:32:06,709
I don't even know how to log into them.

2337
01:32:06,709 --> 01:32:09,139
I'm not even sure if I have credentials to log into them.

2338
01:32:09,139 --> 01:32:11,269
They run once somewhere and I have to figure out

2339
01:32:11,269 --> 01:32:12,469
what happened and why it's happening.

2340
01:32:12,469 --> 01:32:14,069
So it's like I'm gonna become...

2341
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:16,189
This is what I've trained for.

2342
01:32:16,189 --> 01:32:17,869
I'm a print off debugging champion.

2343
01:32:17,869 --> 01:32:19,789
So it's just like I could just run through these things

2344
01:32:19,789 --> 01:32:20,869
really quickly and figure out

2345
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:23,119
why they're happening the way they're happening.

2346
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:24,049
- You're a special human.

2347
01:32:24,049 --> 01:32:25,969
I think that's an incredible skill set to have

2348
01:32:25,969 --> 01:32:28,579
to be able to drop in into any code base,

2349
01:32:28,579 --> 01:32:31,369
drop into any situation, and do print off debugging.

2350
01:32:31,369 --> 01:32:33,949
Meaning you're in a dark room

2351
01:32:33,949 --> 01:32:35,119
and you're feeling around that room

2352
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:37,219
to try to figure out what the room is.

2353
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:38,052
- Well, I had the code

2354
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:40,219
so it's like I can kind of blueprint what's happening.

2355
01:32:40,219 --> 01:32:42,289
I don't understand the services or anything,

2356
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:44,299
but you can start guessing pretty quick

2357
01:32:44,299 --> 01:32:45,709
as to what's going wrong.

2358
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:49,399
- Right, but then the print side of that

2359
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:52,789
helps you confirm your intuitions,

2360
01:32:52,789 --> 01:32:55,579
test your intuitions and build up more and more information.

2361
01:32:55,579 --> 01:32:58,159
And then you start to accumulate this bigger picture

2362
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,209
from that, what the edge cases are

2363
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:03,559
that break the system and not.

2364
01:33:03,559 --> 01:33:07,369
I think that just that kind of space,

2365
01:33:07,369 --> 01:33:10,309
that kind of situation is intimidating

2366
01:33:10,309 --> 01:33:11,989
for a lot of engineers.

2367
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:13,819
They break down at that point.

2368
01:33:13,819 --> 01:33:15,259
I think it really is a powerful thing

2369
01:33:15,259 --> 01:33:17,179
to be able to come into a code base,

2370
01:33:17,179 --> 01:33:19,642
that's generally a skillset of like,

2371
01:33:20,659 --> 01:33:22,879
very few of us start from scratch.

2372
01:33:22,879 --> 01:33:23,724
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.

2373
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:25,609
- And actually this is the fundamental problem

2374
01:33:25,609 --> 01:33:30,199
of web development and in general where they're like,

2375
01:33:30,199 --> 01:33:31,069
I don't know what's going on.

2376
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:34,129
I'm going to write my own thing from scratch.

2377
01:33:34,129 --> 01:33:37,139
As opposed to actually doing print off debugging

2378
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:41,029
on the space of languages, on the space of problems,

2379
01:33:41,029 --> 01:33:43,109
because there's a lot of wisdom

2380
01:33:44,059 --> 01:33:47,749
and solved problems already in this code base.

2381
01:33:47,749 --> 01:33:50,899
It's a much more important skillset to understand,

2382
01:33:50,899 --> 01:33:54,289
to learn from the mistakes and the wisdom of the past,

2383
01:33:54,289 --> 01:33:56,959
of the ancestors that came before

2384
01:33:56,959 --> 01:34:00,169
and build on them as opposed to throw it all out

2385
01:34:00,169 --> 01:34:01,099
and start from scratch.

2386
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:02,569
This is something obviously you see a lot

2387
01:34:02,569 --> 01:34:04,819
with a JavaScript framework that comes out

2388
01:34:04,819 --> 01:34:06,733
and you won every single day.

2389
01:34:06,733 --> 01:34:08,194
- I have a very great story about that,

2390
01:34:08,194 --> 01:34:11,059
that this is what I think has shaped me the most

2391
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:13,219
about my perspective of other devs.

2392
01:34:13,219 --> 01:34:15,469
There's this dev and he always just wrote things

2393
01:34:15,469 --> 01:34:18,979
in just what I thought was such a bizarre and weird way,

2394
01:34:18,979 --> 01:34:20,929
and this had to do with Falcor.

2395
01:34:20,929 --> 01:34:23,839
So our data fetching library for Netflix.

2396
01:34:23,839 --> 01:34:26,479
This would run on mobile. So I had to write in Objective-C.

2397
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:30,229
It had to run on television and it had to also run on web.

2398
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:31,789
So it ran on everything.

2399
01:34:31,789 --> 01:34:33,919
And me and one other person were responsible

2400
01:34:33,919 --> 01:34:34,969
for this thing working.

2401
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:36,889
And the request side

2402
01:34:36,889 --> 01:34:38,959
where we'd have to de-dupe the information

2403
01:34:38,959 --> 01:34:41,719
that we already have, the requests that were pending

2404
01:34:41,719 --> 01:34:43,609
and the new data. So I had to figure all that out

2405
01:34:43,609 --> 01:34:44,719
based on what someone's requesting,

2406
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,539
and then just only optimally request the stuff

2407
01:34:47,539 --> 01:34:48,502
that we don't have.

2408
01:34:49,639 --> 01:34:51,619
He wrote in such a goofy way and I'm thinking,

2409
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:53,119
man, this guy is just...

2410
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:54,409
What a goofball.

2411
01:34:54,409 --> 01:34:57,019
So I delete it all and I start writing and I'm like,

2412
01:34:57,019 --> 01:34:58,159
look at how much nicer this is.

2413
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,416
It's looking so good.

2414
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:02,509
I'm like, ooh, there's that one edge case.

2415
01:35:02,509 --> 01:35:04,369
Okay, I can see why he wrote it this one way.

2416
01:35:04,369 --> 01:35:05,329
That's not a big deal though.

2417
01:35:05,329 --> 01:35:06,649
The rest of my code's really great.

2418
01:35:06,649 --> 01:35:09,739
By the end of it, I'm like, I literally almost line for line

2419
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:12,259
just reproduced what he already wrote.

2420
01:35:12,259 --> 01:35:14,149
It's slightly different towards my style,

2421
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:15,916
but I just wrote the same code.

2422
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:17,689
I'm like, I'm an idiot.

2423
01:35:17,689 --> 01:35:19,639
I am the idiot in this situation

2424
01:35:19,639 --> 01:35:21,589
because it was already a solved problem.

2425
01:35:21,589 --> 01:35:23,569
I just didn't take the time to learn what he did.

2426
01:35:23,569 --> 01:35:25,129
Instead, I relearned what he did

2427
01:35:25,129 --> 01:35:26,449
by rewriting the entire thing.

2428
01:35:26,449 --> 01:35:28,879
- I think that's a skill set that is extremely important

2429
01:35:28,879 --> 01:35:30,199
for people to learn.

2430
01:35:30,199 --> 01:35:31,189
I see that in myself.

2431
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:33,649
That's a constant struggle for myself.

2432
01:35:33,649 --> 01:35:37,129
When facing a code base, for example,

2433
01:35:37,129 --> 01:35:39,349
but this applies generally in life,

2434
01:35:39,349 --> 01:35:42,379
where somebody did a lot of work to do a thing,

2435
01:35:42,379 --> 01:35:44,599
you should invest a huge amount of time

2436
01:35:44,599 --> 01:35:47,749
and get really good at figuring out what they did,

2437
01:35:47,749 --> 01:35:49,639
why they did it.

2438
01:35:49,639 --> 01:35:52,369
Do a lot of print off debugging to understand what they did.

2439
01:35:52,369 --> 01:35:54,379
It's a much more efficient way

2440
01:35:54,379 --> 01:35:57,739
to understand a problem deeply than to start from scratch.

2441
01:35:57,739 --> 01:36:00,499
Even though there's a constant temptation

2442
01:36:00,499 --> 01:36:03,979
to start from scratch, because starting from scratch is fun.

2443
01:36:03,979 --> 01:36:06,779
You do get the puzzle solved and all that kind of stuff.

2444
01:36:07,639 --> 01:36:11,299
It's just not going to be the right thing to do.

2445
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:13,686
Usually pain is the right thing to do,

2446
01:36:13,686 --> 01:36:15,859
and it is for most people painful

2447
01:36:15,859 --> 01:36:18,199
to understand other people's code bases.

2448
01:36:18,199 --> 01:36:20,659
- I highly recommend starting from scratch

2449
01:36:20,659 --> 01:36:22,489
if you want to understand a concept.

2450
01:36:22,489 --> 01:36:25,099
You don't know how an HTTP server works,

2451
01:36:25,099 --> 01:36:29,119
create a TCP socket, learn how to parse HTTP.

2452
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:30,589
It'll become very easy and you'll go,

2453
01:36:30,589 --> 01:36:33,649
this is the reason why whenever I get a request,

2454
01:36:33,649 --> 01:36:35,539
I have to await the text.

2455
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:37,999
I now understand why the text is

2456
01:36:37,999 --> 01:36:39,229
for whatever reason not there.

2457
01:36:39,229 --> 01:36:40,862
I get it. I now understand it.

2458
01:36:40,862 --> 01:36:43,759
And so you kind of gain these new perspectives

2459
01:36:43,759 --> 01:36:45,832
just by simply parsing something out.

2460
01:36:47,029 --> 01:36:49,309
- All right. Back to the wisdom of Reddit.

2461
01:36:49,309 --> 01:36:51,739
Apparently there are memes and legends

2462
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:55,129
about your programming arc in Netflix.

2463
01:36:55,129 --> 01:36:57,829
This Falcor system you mentioned,

2464
01:36:57,829 --> 01:37:00,144
somebody, I think it was Teej,

2465
01:37:00,144 --> 01:37:01,505
how do you pronounce his name by the way?

2466
01:37:01,505 --> 01:37:02,338
- [ThePrimeagen] Teej.

2467
01:37:02,338 --> 01:37:03,739
- Okay, Teej.

2468
01:37:03,739 --> 01:37:04,999
- TJ would be his name,

2469
01:37:04,999 --> 01:37:07,639
but we call it Teej or Telescopic Johnson.

2470
01:37:07,639 --> 01:37:09,742
- Oh wow, so many names.

2471
01:37:10,579 --> 01:37:13,819
DDoS, distributed denial of service attacks,

2472
01:37:13,819 --> 01:37:15,019
you apparently were able

2473
01:37:15,019 --> 01:37:17,869
to accomplish the simplified version of that of just DoS.

2474
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:19,879
That's a legend.

2475
01:37:19,879 --> 01:37:22,849
So you basically broke down the system somehow.

2476
01:37:22,849 --> 01:37:23,809
- Yeah. Yeah.

2477
01:37:23,809 --> 01:37:24,796
- Can you tell the story of that?

2478
01:37:24,796 --> 01:37:25,629
- I'd be glad to.

2479
01:37:25,629 --> 01:37:28,069
So this Falcor, so there's this Falcor business,

2480
01:37:28,069 --> 01:37:32,989
and I kind of, I did discover the bug before anybody else

2481
01:37:32,989 --> 01:37:36,649
and I did report it to security and it was so bad.

2482
01:37:36,649 --> 01:37:39,919
It actually got its own name, Repulsive Grizzly Attack,

2483
01:37:39,919 --> 01:37:42,202
and they even give examples of how to do it.

2484
01:37:43,339 --> 01:37:45,679
Effectively what it means is that there is a request

2485
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:48,379
that targets both memory and CPU and will destroy.

2486
01:37:48,379 --> 01:37:49,212
There you go.

2487
01:37:49,212 --> 01:37:50,045
Look, how Netflix...

2488
01:37:50,045 --> 01:37:52,909
The next one down was the article that was actually written.

2489
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:55,039
I don't get mentioned, which is a little bit upsetting

2490
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:56,539
considering I was the one that discovered it

2491
01:37:56,539 --> 01:37:58,639
and told everybody how bad it was.

2492
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:02,059
Anyways, and had the right to fix for it or the first fix.

2493
01:38:02,059 --> 01:38:04,519
So this is how it works,

2494
01:38:04,519 --> 01:38:08,059
is that you can do something pretty similar,

2495
01:38:08,059 --> 01:38:09,949
I believe with GraphQL as well.

2496
01:38:09,949 --> 01:38:11,719
It has the same kind of danger.

2497
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,449
Any of these kinds of RPC request as much

2498
01:38:14,449 --> 01:38:17,389
or as little of the data as you would like frameworks,

2499
01:38:17,389 --> 01:38:19,279
are vulnerable to this kind of attack.

2500
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:22,039
So with Falcor, what you do is you give it an array.

2501
01:38:22,039 --> 01:38:23,449
That's an array is called a path,

2502
01:38:23,449 --> 01:38:25,159
and that's the path to the data.

2503
01:38:25,159 --> 01:38:27,709
But sometimes you don't want to have to write out,

2504
01:38:27,709 --> 01:38:30,559
I want movie, I want row zero

2505
01:38:30,559 --> 01:38:33,619
or list zero or row zero column zero title.

2506
01:38:33,619 --> 01:38:37,129
I want row zero column zero description.

2507
01:38:37,129 --> 01:38:38,959
You don't want to have to write out all that.

2508
01:38:38,959 --> 01:38:40,659
So instead you could just be like,

2509
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:45,259
I want rows zero through 10,

2510
01:38:45,259 --> 01:38:47,059
columns zero through 10,

2511
01:38:47,059 --> 01:38:48,979
titles and descriptions.

2512
01:38:48,979 --> 01:38:51,199
So you can write in a very compact, nice little format

2513
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,369
and it'll give you all that data.

2514
01:38:52,369 --> 01:38:53,202
It'll go to the server.

2515
01:38:53,202 --> 01:38:55,399
The server will fill that all in and give it to you.

2516
01:38:55,399 --> 01:39:00,079
Oh, dang it, list three, it only had three videos in it.

2517
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:02,209
So what happens when I try to re-request the data?

2518
01:39:02,209 --> 01:39:05,029
Well, I need a way to be able to tell my system

2519
01:39:05,029 --> 01:39:07,249
that you'd have requested the data

2520
01:39:07,249 --> 01:39:08,599
and there's nothing there.

2521
01:39:08,599 --> 01:39:11,569
So call this like a boxed value.

2522
01:39:11,569 --> 01:39:14,599
So it's gonna be like type, something, value,

2523
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:15,432
there's nothing there.

2524
01:39:15,432 --> 01:39:16,736
We've already requested it and there's nothing there.

2525
01:39:16,736 --> 01:39:19,789
It's like a sentinel value, if you will, a boxed value.

2526
01:39:19,789 --> 01:39:23,749
And we have this little special flag weed pass

2527
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:24,859
called materialize.

2528
01:39:24,859 --> 01:39:27,019
Meaning that when you ask for a path,

2529
01:39:27,019 --> 01:39:28,549
we will make sure we fill it out

2530
01:39:28,549 --> 01:39:30,409
so we don't accidentally erase anything.

2531
01:39:30,409 --> 01:39:32,389
And at the very end we'll say okay,

2532
01:39:32,389 --> 01:39:34,309
the thing does, the request you've made

2533
01:39:34,309 --> 01:39:36,469
has already been made and there's nothing there.

2534
01:39:36,469 --> 01:39:39,589
Well, what happens if I request rows 0 through 10,000

2535
01:39:39,589 --> 01:39:41,659
columns through 10,000,

2536
01:39:41,659 --> 01:39:43,066
one more item through 10,000

2537
01:39:43,066 --> 01:39:44,959
and then a whole bunch of properties

2538
01:39:44,959 --> 01:39:46,789
and then ask it to materialize?

2539
01:39:46,789 --> 01:39:51,166
Well, I'm about to go create billions of objects in the JVM,

2540
01:39:51,166 --> 01:39:53,299
and what happens to the machine?

2541
01:39:53,299 --> 01:39:54,469
It stops running.

2542
01:39:54,469 --> 01:39:55,519
And then if we try to JSON...

2543
01:39:55,519 --> 01:39:57,169
Even if it could create a 'em all,

2544
01:39:57,169 --> 01:39:59,989
we then ask it that JSON serialize,

2545
01:39:59,989 --> 01:40:01,609
it's not gonna do it.

2546
01:40:01,609 --> 01:40:02,629
It's impossible.

2547
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:04,759
And so that was the attack vector,

2548
01:40:04,759 --> 01:40:08,119
is a simple wild loop would've taken down

2549
01:40:08,119 --> 01:40:12,049
and held down Netflix for a very long time.

2550
01:40:12,049 --> 01:40:15,202
Because one request would kill one machine on AWS.

2551
01:40:16,129 --> 01:40:18,019
And so that means it would just turn it all off.

2552
01:40:18,019 --> 01:40:19,609
And this was on the website?

2553
01:40:19,609 --> 01:40:23,209
This was on TV, this was on mobile.

2554
01:40:23,209 --> 01:40:24,679
This was profound.

2555
01:40:24,679 --> 01:40:27,679
And here's the worst part, it was in production for years

2556
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,929
so we couldn't even roll it back.

2557
01:40:29,929 --> 01:40:30,762
There was no like,

2558
01:40:30,762 --> 01:40:33,079
"Oh crap, let's just roll back to two weeks ago

2559
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:34,429
and we'll fix forward and figure out."

2560
01:40:34,429 --> 01:40:37,369
No, it's like we could roll back to 2011.

2561
01:40:37,369 --> 01:40:40,069
That's our option is 2011 and that's it.

2562
01:40:40,069 --> 01:40:42,319
So we had to figure out a way forward and all that.

2563
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:43,369
And so it was like...

2564
01:40:45,379 --> 01:40:47,629
The amount of problems that would've happened

2565
01:40:48,629 --> 01:40:51,769
if someone would've discovered this is unstatable.

2566
01:40:51,769 --> 01:40:53,989
- Just to be clear, the infrastructure

2567
01:40:53,989 --> 01:40:57,199
that's serving the videos would shut down.

2568
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:59,989
- Yeah, the UI, you couldn't perform any actions in the UI.

2569
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:01,939
You surprisingly could still stream video

2570
01:41:01,939 --> 01:41:03,919
but you would never be able to get to a video to stream.

2571
01:41:03,919 --> 01:41:05,039
Because every action you would take

2572
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:06,799
would be completely shut down.

2573
01:41:06,799 --> 01:41:08,569
And so it wasn't a DDoS

2574
01:41:08,569 --> 01:41:10,369
because you didn't need a bunch of computers to try

2575
01:41:10,369 --> 01:41:12,889
to overwhelm the system by making a bunch of requests,

2576
01:41:12,889 --> 01:41:14,629
one request, one machine.

2577
01:41:14,629 --> 01:41:17,899
If we had 50 machines serving the millions of requests,

2578
01:41:17,899 --> 01:41:20,569
it'd only take 50 requests to shut down the entire UI.

2579
01:41:20,569 --> 01:41:23,659
- Isn't it possible to do DoS or DDoS

2580
01:41:23,659 --> 01:41:25,669
on basically any software system.

2581
01:41:25,669 --> 01:41:28,519
Like defending against all the, you know,

2582
01:41:28,519 --> 01:41:30,019
closing all those attack factors

2583
01:41:30,019 --> 01:41:31,369
is probably really difficult.

2584
01:41:31,369 --> 01:41:36,369
If you take any sufficiently complicated software system,

2585
01:41:36,769 --> 01:41:39,709
there's probably so many ways to overwhelm it.

2586
01:41:39,709 --> 01:41:42,739
- Yeah, I mean, this is why people use CloudFlare.

2587
01:41:42,739 --> 01:41:46,099
I think DHH said it best, which is like, we have our website

2588
01:41:46,099 --> 01:41:48,589
and we have a strong bodyguard on the outside.

2589
01:41:48,589 --> 01:41:51,319
So CloudFlare has a bunch of utilities all built in.

2590
01:41:51,319 --> 01:41:54,709
Because obviously this is why everyone hates

2591
01:41:54,709 --> 01:41:56,899
all these Bluetooth devices that connect to the internet

2592
01:41:56,899 --> 01:41:58,369
because they just turn into attack vectors

2593
01:41:58,369 --> 01:42:01,249
where people use those to DoS or DDoS other sites.

2594
01:42:01,249 --> 01:42:03,169
And so you don't need something sophisticated,

2595
01:42:03,169 --> 01:42:05,029
you just need a bunch of requests to come in

2596
01:42:05,029 --> 01:42:06,319
and you can take down websites.

2597
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:08,449
And so that's why these fronts are really good

2598
01:42:08,449 --> 01:42:10,759
at discovering where these problems are.

2599
01:42:10,759 --> 01:42:12,049
But DoS is a bit different,

2600
01:42:12,049 --> 01:42:14,209
because it doesn't have to be overwhelming

2601
01:42:14,209 --> 01:42:17,059
by using resources with a whole bunch of requests.

2602
01:42:17,059 --> 01:42:18,109
It really just means simply

2603
01:42:18,109 --> 01:42:20,209
that there's a denial of service attack.

2604
01:42:20,209 --> 01:42:22,699
One of them could be there's a RegEx attack that existed

2605
01:42:22,699 --> 01:42:25,219
where CloudFlare actually did it to itself

2606
01:42:25,219 --> 01:42:26,052
and shut itself down,

2607
01:42:26,052 --> 01:42:28,309
which is there's a RegEx expansion attack

2608
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:29,719
where given the right RegEx,

2609
01:42:29,719 --> 01:42:32,029
if you know someone's running a specific RegEx,

2610
01:42:32,029 --> 01:42:35,359
you can actually provide input that is maximally bad

2611
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:37,909
and that thing goes to super processing.

2612
01:42:37,909 --> 01:42:40,459
It takes 10 seconds to process a single request,

2613
01:42:40,459 --> 01:42:42,529
then you only need to make hundreds of requests

2614
01:42:42,529 --> 01:42:43,879
and you shut down the whole service.

2615
01:42:43,879 --> 01:42:46,099
It's not like you need some giant machinery

2616
01:42:46,099 --> 01:42:47,689
to make one trillion requests.

2617
01:42:47,689 --> 01:42:48,919
You only need just some small amount

2618
01:42:48,919 --> 01:42:50,449
to completely destroy a service.

2619
01:42:50,449 --> 01:42:51,489
And so there's...

2620
01:42:52,429 --> 01:42:56,179
The web is an extremely difficult place to do it correct.

2621
01:42:56,179 --> 01:42:57,579
- This is super fascinating.

2622
01:42:58,429 --> 01:43:00,682
I do also wonder how many ultra competent,

2623
01:43:03,499 --> 01:43:06,319
what is it, black hat hackers there are,

2624
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:10,309
versus the good guys versus the bad guys.

2625
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:15,169
How many bad guys there are and what is the average...

2626
01:43:15,169 --> 01:43:18,319
What is the distribution of skillset on the bad guy side

2627
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:20,359
that are constantly trying to attack?

2628
01:43:20,359 --> 01:43:21,889
- I assume there's probably a huge number

2629
01:43:21,889 --> 01:43:23,869
of just really simple ones, script kitties, right?

2630
01:43:23,869 --> 01:43:25,849
Just people trying to just do things.

2631
01:43:25,849 --> 01:43:27,979
And then there's a huge amount of social engineering

2632
01:43:27,979 --> 01:43:30,739
that just goes in where hacking's done, not with a computer

2633
01:43:30,739 --> 01:43:33,199
but just by one of the classic ones.

2634
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:35,959
Kevin Mitnick had this one in his book which was,

2635
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:37,766
you'd call up somebody pretending to be like,

2636
01:43:37,766 --> 01:43:40,219
"Charlene, we're doing some auditing

2637
01:43:40,219 --> 01:43:43,519
and I think your pin's out of date on file.

2638
01:43:43,519 --> 01:43:45,199
Is it 2323, still?"

2639
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:46,806
And they're like, "No, it's 4747."

2640
01:43:46,806 --> 01:43:49,519
You're like, "Oh, thanks Sharon."

2641
01:43:49,519 --> 01:43:50,719
Boom. You just hacked him, right?

2642
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:54,379
The classic. People love correcting bad information.

2643
01:43:54,379 --> 01:43:55,579
This is like a standard.

2644
01:43:55,579 --> 01:43:57,439
So there's all these ways people hack.

2645
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:59,749
And so my assumption is

2646
01:43:59,749 --> 01:44:01,549
that there are really great white hat hackers,

2647
01:44:01,549 --> 01:44:03,889
there's really great black hat hackers.

2648
01:44:03,889 --> 01:44:07,259
But the vulnerability space, the harp, the thing is that

2649
01:44:08,359 --> 01:44:12,379
discovering a vulnerability and you don't let anyone know,

2650
01:44:12,379 --> 01:44:15,949
the white hat hacker still has to make that same discovery.

2651
01:44:15,949 --> 01:44:17,479
And that's where I think the real thing is

2652
01:44:17,479 --> 01:44:19,369
that black hat hacking in some sense

2653
01:44:19,369 --> 01:44:20,989
has a fundamentally easier job

2654
01:44:20,989 --> 01:44:23,479
or at least a job in which they can take advantage of

2655
01:44:23,479 --> 01:44:25,219
for much longer periods of time.

2656
01:44:25,219 --> 01:44:28,309
One's the process of discovering who's breaking the system.

2657
01:44:28,309 --> 01:44:29,179
The other one's trying to figure out

2658
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:30,529
how to break the system.

2659
01:44:30,529 --> 01:44:33,319
And it seems like most software is held together

2660
01:44:33,319 --> 01:44:34,759
by toothpicks and glue

2661
01:44:34,759 --> 01:44:37,369
and there is a lot of dangers in every piece.

2662
01:44:37,369 --> 01:44:40,669
- And also the social engineering aspect,

2663
01:44:40,669 --> 01:44:42,079
that's a real attack vector.

2664
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:43,939
I think that's the attack vector that will do

2665
01:44:43,939 --> 01:44:46,189
in the longterm the most damage in the world.

2666
01:44:47,089 --> 01:44:49,849
Especially as AI tooling becomes easier and easier

2667
01:44:49,849 --> 01:44:52,399
to convince people at scale,

2668
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:55,309
sort of do that email Grandma.

2669
01:44:55,309 --> 01:44:57,859
I think that's a really serious attack vector,

2670
01:44:57,859 --> 01:44:59,599
like human psychology and all that.

2671
01:44:59,599 --> 01:45:02,392
I assume whenever there's a girl that approaches me,

2672
01:45:02,392 --> 01:45:05,149
it's some kind of social engineering project,

2673
01:45:05,149 --> 01:45:08,809
some attack vector, some intelligence agency.

2674
01:45:08,809 --> 01:45:09,979
In fact, I'm pretty sure-

2675
01:45:09,979 --> 01:45:11,359
- We're back to A Beautiful Mind, aren't we?

2676
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:12,636
- Beautiful Mind? Yeah.

2677
01:45:12,636 --> 01:45:15,889
I have a whiteboard upstairs that I calculate everything,

2678
01:45:15,889 --> 01:45:17,899
everybody's trajectory and move.

2679
01:45:17,899 --> 01:45:19,669
- You're not wrong though with the attack vector,

2680
01:45:19,669 --> 01:45:21,049
especially in the day of AI.

2681
01:45:21,049 --> 01:45:22,579
One thing that I don't think a lot of people

2682
01:45:22,579 --> 01:45:25,609
are talking about as we integrate more and more AI

2683
01:45:25,609 --> 01:45:27,919
is that prompt injection

2684
01:45:27,919 --> 01:45:31,939
is an extremely hard thing to defend against

2685
01:45:31,939 --> 01:45:34,579
because it's not really clear how you defend against it.

2686
01:45:34,579 --> 01:45:36,409
If it's just a, at the end of the day

2687
01:45:36,409 --> 01:45:38,449
word calculator make word come out.

2688
01:45:38,449 --> 01:45:40,729
If you can figure out the proper word calculator input,

2689
01:45:40,729 --> 01:45:42,739
it might just break its bounds

2690
01:45:42,739 --> 01:45:44,539
and start doing something it's not supposed to do.

2691
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:46,219
And there's a whole future word.

2692
01:45:46,219 --> 01:45:48,469
There's all these products that are going to be vulnerable

2693
01:45:48,469 --> 01:45:50,272
to things they never thought about.

2694
01:45:51,409 --> 01:45:53,029
It's one thing where you forget an edge case

2695
01:45:53,029 --> 01:45:54,229
while you're programming.

2696
01:45:54,229 --> 01:45:56,839
Now you have to guess what people might be able to think of

2697
01:45:56,839 --> 01:46:00,079
making something that has access to a system be able to do.

2698
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:02,089
And you don't have a way to reason about it.

2699
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:04,639
Its reasoning came from Reddit, and other words

2700
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:06,289
that it's read and how to put things together.

2701
01:46:06,289 --> 01:46:07,639
This is a very...

2702
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:10,609
It's a massive space that's gonna be happening.

2703
01:46:10,609 --> 01:46:12,018
It's why I'm personally thinking

2704
01:46:12,018 --> 01:46:14,029
don't give too many powers yet.

2705
01:46:14,029 --> 01:46:16,579
We don't know the attacks that are about to happen.

2706
01:46:17,929 --> 01:46:20,269
- Yeah, the more power we give to software systems,

2707
01:46:20,269 --> 01:46:21,169
the more damage they can do.

2708
01:46:21,169 --> 01:46:22,309
That certainly is the case.

2709
01:46:22,309 --> 01:46:23,509
But the more awesome they could do,

2710
01:46:23,509 --> 01:46:27,109
and that's the knife's edge that we all walk along

2711
01:46:27,109 --> 01:46:30,949
as a human civilization together, hand in hand.

2712
01:46:30,949 --> 01:46:33,862
Will we flourish or destroy ourselves? Question mark.

2713
01:46:35,809 --> 01:46:38,569
Folks on Reddit, the good folks on Reddit,

2714
01:46:38,569 --> 01:46:42,049
demanded that I ask you about the time you broke production.

2715
01:46:42,049 --> 01:46:43,636
Is this related to Falcor?

2716
01:46:43,636 --> 01:46:44,809
Did you break production?

2717
01:46:44,809 --> 01:46:45,859
Is this fake news? - I've broke production

2718
01:46:45,859 --> 01:46:46,692
quite a few times.

2719
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:48,589
I've broken productions for so many stupid reasons.

2720
01:46:48,589 --> 01:46:49,699
One time I broke production

2721
01:46:49,699 --> 01:46:52,669
because I came up in the PHP.

2722
01:46:52,669 --> 01:46:56,383
And PHP Static means static for the lifetime of the PHP

2723
01:46:56,383 --> 01:46:59,119
and PHP was the lifetime of every request, right?

2724
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:00,919
That's why PHP was so inefficient

2725
01:47:00,919 --> 01:47:03,169
was that every request was its own instance,

2726
01:47:03,169 --> 01:47:05,869
and therefore static memory was for the lifetime.

2727
01:47:05,869 --> 01:47:07,789
I guess I never put that together.

2728
01:47:07,789 --> 01:47:10,129
And so I had some objects that I made static

2729
01:47:10,129 --> 01:47:11,269
because I was like, oh I just need this

2730
01:47:11,269 --> 01:47:12,949
for the lifetime of the request.

2731
01:47:12,949 --> 01:47:15,523
And lo and behold, those weren't lifetime.

2732
01:47:15,523 --> 01:47:17,179
A whole bunch of bad data got all over the place.

2733
01:47:17,179 --> 01:47:18,439
People were showing up saying they were

2734
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:19,729
from all these different countries

2735
01:47:19,729 --> 01:47:21,769
and everything was all wrong because I just...

2736
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:24,469
Whoopsie-daisies. I just made a whole conundrum with that.

2737
01:47:24,469 --> 01:47:25,789
So that was one time I did it.

2738
01:47:25,789 --> 01:47:27,559
Another time is I took down,

2739
01:47:27,559 --> 01:47:31,339
if you were on the homepage on the website waiting

2740
01:47:31,339 --> 01:47:33,769
for Lady Gaga's video to come out

2741
01:47:33,769 --> 01:47:36,049
and you were watching the countdown go down,

2742
01:47:36,049 --> 01:47:37,522
if it reached zero,

2743
01:47:38,839 --> 01:47:40,849
the billboard would freeze and it wouldn't work.

2744
01:47:40,849 --> 01:47:42,079
If you refreshed it, it would work.

2745
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:45,469
But the reveal, (chuckles)

2746
01:47:45,469 --> 01:47:46,786
the big reveal, I screwed that up

2747
01:47:46,786 --> 01:47:49,369
and my boss got real upset and so did other people

2748
01:47:49,369 --> 01:47:51,139
in Hollywood got upset about that one.

2749
01:47:51,139 --> 01:47:54,379
That was like a, "My bad. Sorry, Jeff Wagner, again."

2750
01:47:54,379 --> 01:47:56,239
I remember that one. I remember that one specifically.

2751
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:59,209
One time I released a bug where again on the billboard,

2752
01:47:59,209 --> 01:48:01,759
if you pressed add to my list,

2753
01:48:01,759 --> 01:48:05,749
I accidentally programmed in an infinite loop,

2754
01:48:05,749 --> 01:48:08,182
and your whole webpage would just freeze.

2755
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:10,909
- Are some of these bugs difficult to discover

2756
01:48:10,909 --> 01:48:11,742
until you started-

2757
01:48:11,742 --> 01:48:13,939
- That one seems really easy looking back at it.

2758
01:48:13,939 --> 01:48:14,956
- [Lex] Infinite loop? Yeah.

2759
01:48:14,956 --> 01:48:17,659
- And we actually, during those days we had manual QA

2760
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:19,429
that are supposed to go through everything.

2761
01:48:19,429 --> 01:48:20,689
So I didn't feel as bad

2762
01:48:20,689 --> 01:48:24,829
because my manual QA counterpart also missed it.

2763
01:48:24,829 --> 01:48:26,689
We all missed it. But it was just so simple.

2764
01:48:26,689 --> 01:48:27,769
Just press that button, boom.

2765
01:48:27,769 --> 01:48:29,959
It just completely freezes the website.

2766
01:48:29,959 --> 01:48:33,019
- Polluting the code with global variables

2767
01:48:33,019 --> 01:48:34,342
that are holding values,

2768
01:48:35,539 --> 01:48:37,609
SPHP I think allows you to do,

2769
01:48:37,609 --> 01:48:39,409
that's a tricky one to discover,

2770
01:48:39,409 --> 01:48:41,359
because you rely on it,

2771
01:48:41,359 --> 01:48:44,749
then there could be somebody else assigns a value to it.

2772
01:48:44,749 --> 01:48:46,279
- Yeah, it's a data race everywhere.

2773
01:48:46,279 --> 01:48:48,349
And I just didn't understand...

2774
01:48:48,349 --> 01:48:50,012
In my head static was like, "Oh, this is for the life."

2775
01:48:50,012 --> 01:48:53,209
I was just so locked into the PHP world at that time

2776
01:48:53,209 --> 01:48:56,539
that I just made just such a,

2777
01:48:56,539 --> 01:48:58,579
looking back on it's so obvious.

2778
01:48:58,579 --> 01:49:01,459
But during the time, it's hard.

2779
01:49:01,459 --> 01:49:03,049
- So in general, pushing to production,

2780
01:49:03,049 --> 01:49:04,819
I talked to Pieter Levels about this.

2781
01:49:04,819 --> 01:49:06,409
He, I mean, obvious he's operating

2782
01:49:06,409 --> 01:49:11,409
as mostly a solo developer, but he often on the website said

2783
01:49:12,019 --> 01:49:15,469
thousands, not, hundreds of thousands of people use.

2784
01:49:15,469 --> 01:49:17,512
He often ships to production,

2785
01:49:19,369 --> 01:49:22,249
pushes to production, meaning just no testing,

2786
01:49:22,249 --> 01:49:24,739
just like push to fix.

2787
01:49:24,739 --> 01:49:26,209
What are the pros and cons of that approach

2788
01:49:26,209 --> 01:49:27,464
in general to you?

2789
01:49:27,464 --> 01:49:28,297
What do you think?

2790
01:49:28,297 --> 01:49:29,599
- It's obviously much easier

2791
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:31,399
the smaller your organization is.

2792
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:34,729
I think no one would argue that sentiment.

2793
01:49:34,729 --> 01:49:37,639
If it's just you working on a singular project,

2794
01:49:37,639 --> 01:49:40,489
it is obviously much easier for you to push directly

2795
01:49:40,489 --> 01:49:43,009
to production because you are the only one working.

2796
01:49:43,009 --> 01:49:44,389
You know all the ins and outs

2797
01:49:44,389 --> 01:49:46,609
and if something were to break, you would discover it.

2798
01:49:46,609 --> 01:49:48,289
So to me that makes sense.

2799
01:49:48,289 --> 01:49:51,259
I think the way he operates is perfect for what he does.

2800
01:49:51,259 --> 01:49:54,019
You couldn't take what he does and move it to say Microsoft

2801
01:49:54,019 --> 01:49:56,239
or Netflix or Google because that would obviously...

2802
01:49:56,239 --> 01:49:57,769
It would just be a disaster,

2803
01:49:57,769 --> 01:50:00,259
just due to the amount of people all pushing to production.

2804
01:50:00,259 --> 01:50:03,169
And so I personally love that.

2805
01:50:03,169 --> 01:50:06,319
I think that you have to gauge

2806
01:50:06,319 --> 01:50:09,199
both the application you're building and its complexity

2807
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:10,459
and what you're pushing,

2808
01:50:10,459 --> 01:50:11,929
and how many people are working on it.

2809
01:50:11,929 --> 01:50:14,779
I think those all go into how you can do that.

2810
01:50:14,779 --> 01:50:17,359
Because not all applications are created equal either.

2811
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:19,639
That application I was making was zooming and scrolling

2812
01:50:19,639 --> 01:50:21,469
where we had all of our own everything.

2813
01:50:21,469 --> 01:50:25,039
It was a very deep heavy logic app,

2814
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:26,899
and that was regardless of what was happening

2815
01:50:26,899 --> 01:50:30,289
on the website, most of the code was library code.

2816
01:50:30,289 --> 01:50:32,209
And that becomes way harder

2817
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:34,429
if you don't have a good test suite and stuff to run

2818
01:50:34,429 --> 01:50:35,269
before you push it out.

2819
01:50:35,269 --> 01:50:37,162
Because when you squeeze that ball,

2820
01:50:38,029 --> 01:50:41,089
different things come popping out in different areas.

2821
01:50:41,089 --> 01:50:45,169
And that's a very harder problem than say

2822
01:50:45,169 --> 01:50:47,599
if you're doing more of a heavy visual one

2823
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:48,679
because a heavy visual one,

2824
01:50:48,679 --> 01:50:50,386
you're affecting just this one area's visual stuff

2825
01:50:50,386 --> 01:50:54,559
and you can test it and that's normally the end of it.

2826
01:50:54,559 --> 01:50:55,729
Whereas, you know...

2827
01:50:55,729 --> 01:50:57,649
So it depends on the coupling and everything.

2828
01:50:57,649 --> 01:50:59,359
So I love his approach by the way.

2829
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:02,299
I have such mad respect for anyone that operates that way

2830
01:51:02,299 --> 01:51:06,679
because I think is a great way, it just is so good

2831
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:09,649
because it breaks this notion that tech Twitter has that,

2832
01:51:09,649 --> 01:51:11,689
oh, well, you have to use all these expensive services,

2833
01:51:11,689 --> 01:51:12,949
you need to use all these things

2834
01:51:12,949 --> 01:51:14,239
because if you don't use all this stuff,

2835
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:15,709
if you're not using the latest version of React,

2836
01:51:15,709 --> 01:51:17,622
if you're not using the latest version of this,

2837
01:51:18,812 --> 01:51:20,059
you're simply not going to make it as a startup.

2838
01:51:20,059 --> 01:51:20,892
It's impossible.

2839
01:51:20,892 --> 01:51:23,809
And it's just like, no, no, that's not software.

2840
01:51:23,809 --> 01:51:25,369
Most of software isn't the new stuff.

2841
01:51:25,369 --> 01:51:28,279
Most of software is old crappy software

2842
01:51:28,279 --> 01:51:30,079
that someone has to maintain,

2843
01:51:30,079 --> 01:51:31,579
and it actually is really, really great

2844
01:51:31,579 --> 01:51:32,959
and has lots of really hard problems.

2845
01:51:32,959 --> 01:51:34,999
And if you look at it differently, it's actually fantastic.

2846
01:51:34,999 --> 01:51:38,269
- For people who don't know his tech stack,

2847
01:51:38,269 --> 01:51:42,589
in terms of web development is PHP, jQuery and SQL.

2848
01:51:42,589 --> 01:51:44,239
- Yeah, all great stuff.

2849
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:45,829
I'm just surprised he still uses jQuery

2850
01:51:45,829 --> 01:51:48,499
just given the fact that at this point on the modern web,

2851
01:51:48,499 --> 01:51:50,989
everything is, I mean, you have document query selector

2852
01:51:50,989 --> 01:51:53,179
and ad event listener click, right?

2853
01:51:53,179 --> 01:51:55,099
It pretty much has everything you already need.

2854
01:51:55,099 --> 01:51:56,629
It had DOM content load,

2855
01:51:56,629 --> 01:51:59,119
all the reasons I used jQuery back in the day was

2856
01:51:59,119 --> 01:52:02,419
adding a click on a button was hard.

2857
01:52:02,419 --> 01:52:05,629
You had to deal with IE7, IE8, IE9.

2858
01:52:05,629 --> 01:52:07,459
Those are hard differences.

2859
01:52:07,459 --> 01:52:08,569
Whereas now, it's just so easy.

2860
01:52:08,569 --> 01:52:09,619
I'm just surprised it's even that.

2861
01:52:09,619 --> 01:52:12,709
- That's definitely a trade-off I have,

2862
01:52:12,709 --> 01:52:14,179
I still use the exact same stack,

2863
01:52:14,179 --> 01:52:18,709
PHP, jQuery and different flavors of SQL.

2864
01:52:18,709 --> 01:52:20,812
But the question there is,

2865
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:23,779
you keep using jQuery

2866
01:52:23,779 --> 01:52:25,519
because you can get the job done really fast

2867
01:52:25,519 --> 01:52:29,539
and there's no significant performance hit that you detect.

2868
01:52:29,539 --> 01:52:31,849
So like why swish to something else?

2869
01:52:31,849 --> 01:52:33,889
But it's always probably, as we'll talk about,

2870
01:52:33,889 --> 01:52:36,259
good to explore and to learn.

2871
01:52:36,259 --> 01:52:39,739
- Not all tools are great at solving all problems.

2872
01:52:39,739 --> 01:52:42,979
And so what you think is really...

2873
01:52:42,979 --> 01:52:45,139
The problem is you run into this trade off,

2874
01:52:45,139 --> 01:52:48,289
which is you have some tool belt

2875
01:52:48,289 --> 01:52:49,999
that you're very adept with,

2876
01:52:49,999 --> 01:52:51,499
you know all the ins and outs.

2877
01:52:51,499 --> 01:52:52,849
There's no unknown unknowns,

2878
01:52:52,849 --> 01:52:54,889
but there's no surprises in this.

2879
01:52:54,889 --> 01:52:56,119
You know what you're building,

2880
01:52:56,119 --> 01:52:57,409
you know what you're getting into.

2881
01:52:57,409 --> 01:53:02,409
You will go through and you'll be able to solve the problem.

2882
01:53:03,019 --> 01:53:05,272
But if you ever use a different language

2883
01:53:05,272 --> 01:53:06,499
or a different experience,

2884
01:53:06,499 --> 01:53:08,119
you can find that some things are able

2885
01:53:08,119 --> 01:53:11,356
to represent states way easier, in a way more efficient way.

2886
01:53:11,356 --> 01:53:13,579
And you can solve problems really efficiently

2887
01:53:13,579 --> 01:53:15,199
in some versus the other.

2888
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:16,999
And so it's like, if you don't take the time

2889
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:18,919
to explore as well, you could be missing out

2890
01:53:18,919 --> 01:53:20,509
on something that makes you twice as good

2891
01:53:20,509 --> 01:53:22,789
on this one specific problem like subset.

2892
01:53:22,789 --> 01:53:26,105
And so I value being able to look at all problems.

2893
01:53:26,105 --> 01:53:27,769
And so I don't want to get stuck on one thing,

2894
01:53:27,769 --> 01:53:29,089
though, I see why people do,

2895
01:53:29,089 --> 01:53:31,429
which is for the efficiency sake.

2896
01:53:31,429 --> 01:53:33,769
- Let's just return to the infrastructure of the platform

2897
01:53:33,769 --> 01:53:35,509
of Netflix and, speak more generally,

2898
01:53:35,509 --> 01:53:37,579
Netflix, Twitch, YouTube.

2899
01:53:37,579 --> 01:53:41,299
Anytime I use any of these services, I'm just blown away

2900
01:53:41,299 --> 01:53:45,289
by the infrastructure it takes to deliver this service.

2901
01:53:45,289 --> 01:53:48,379
YouTube and Twitch are unique, versus Netflix

2902
01:53:48,379 --> 01:53:52,279
where the creators can roll in themselves and upload stuff.

2903
01:53:52,279 --> 01:53:53,809
So on the consumption side,

2904
01:53:53,809 --> 01:53:57,109
YouTube has over 100 billion views a day,

2905
01:53:57,109 --> 01:54:00,349
over one billion hours watch time.

2906
01:54:00,349 --> 01:54:02,599
But on the creator side,

2907
01:54:02,599 --> 01:54:05,299
one million hours of videos are uploaded every day.

2908
01:54:05,299 --> 01:54:06,622
One million hours.

2909
01:54:07,879 --> 01:54:10,369
It's like you have to service both

2910
01:54:10,369 --> 01:54:12,119
and you have to deliver everything.

2911
01:54:15,169 --> 01:54:16,879
It's just incredible to me.

2912
01:54:16,879 --> 01:54:18,799
Can you maybe speak to your own intuition,

2913
01:54:18,799 --> 01:54:19,879
just zooming out on it,

2914
01:54:19,879 --> 01:54:22,639
what it takes to deliver that kind of infrastructure?

2915
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:26,449
- For me, the thing that I find vastly complicated

2916
01:54:26,449 --> 01:54:29,539
and I can't imagine the engineering hours,

2917
01:54:29,539 --> 01:54:32,629
is how do you even create an edge in that situation?

2918
01:54:32,629 --> 01:54:34,789
And what I mean by an edge,

2919
01:54:34,789 --> 01:54:37,639
when people say this phrase, if you're unexperienced,

2920
01:54:37,639 --> 01:54:39,379
an edge is where you deliver data.

2921
01:54:39,379 --> 01:54:41,119
You want that edge to be as close to the customer

2922
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:42,919
as possible because that's where the data lives.

2923
01:54:42,919 --> 01:54:44,689
And then the communication between the customer

2924
01:54:44,689 --> 01:54:46,519
and what you're doing is really, really small.

2925
01:54:46,519 --> 01:54:47,989
Obviously the speed of light adds up,

2926
01:54:47,989 --> 01:54:49,879
the amount of hops adds up, the amount of services

2927
01:54:49,879 --> 01:54:51,499
that you have to remotely call adds up.

2928
01:54:51,499 --> 01:54:53,359
They all add up and they all add inefficiencies

2929
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:54,319
to the system.

2930
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:55,699
So something like YouTube,

2931
01:54:55,699 --> 01:54:57,259
they want to be able to serve that data

2932
01:54:57,259 --> 01:55:01,519
as quick as possible, but their data changes constantly

2933
01:55:01,519 --> 01:55:04,159
and relevance is almost directly tied

2934
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:06,049
with the newness of the item.

2935
01:55:06,049 --> 01:55:08,119
So it's like how do you even cache these things out?

2936
01:55:08,119 --> 01:55:08,952
How are you doing this?

2937
01:55:08,952 --> 01:55:11,689
So they must have such an incredible caching network

2938
01:55:11,689 --> 01:55:13,129
that I can't even...

2939
01:55:13,129 --> 01:55:15,379
I can't even fathom what it takes to do that.

2940
01:55:15,379 --> 01:55:16,879
That just to me is just so impressive.

2941
01:55:16,879 --> 01:55:20,089
A million view hours in how many different resolutions

2942
01:55:20,089 --> 01:55:21,079
with how much data?

2943
01:55:21,079 --> 01:55:22,019
What is a million view hours?

2944
01:55:22,019 --> 01:55:25,729
Is it 4K million view hours, along with 1080p,

2945
01:55:25,729 --> 01:55:28,099
along with 720p, along with 1440p?

2946
01:55:28,099 --> 01:55:30,859
That number is an insane number.

2947
01:55:30,859 --> 01:55:33,319
- Actually, it is brilliant what you said,

2948
01:55:33,319 --> 01:55:36,139
which is for YouTube often the new thing

2949
01:55:36,139 --> 01:55:40,592
is extremely important to show to everybody.

2950
01:55:40,592 --> 01:55:43,429
And so, you can't rely on caching

2951
01:55:43,429 --> 01:55:45,109
or trivial kind of caching.

2952
01:55:45,109 --> 01:55:46,339
- Yeah. - You have to deliver

2953
01:55:46,339 --> 01:55:49,249
the new thing as quickly as possible.

2954
01:55:49,249 --> 01:55:51,199
Yeah, I mean, it's incredible.

2955
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:56,199
So there's the entire system, the recommendation system

2956
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:59,569
that knows each individual human watching YouTube

2957
01:55:59,569 --> 01:56:02,689
and it has to integrate into that the new thing,

2958
01:56:02,689 --> 01:56:06,559
while also caching this incredible cluster

2959
01:56:06,559 --> 01:56:09,712
of possible videos that you're potentially interested in.

2960
01:56:10,549 --> 01:56:14,239
And integrate into that ads

2961
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:16,369
in the case of YouTube and so on.

2962
01:56:16,369 --> 01:56:19,519
- It's a really tough problem because you have to think

2963
01:56:19,519 --> 01:56:21,109
what is the cash hit rate on this?

2964
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:24,229
Because the problem now actually comes down to space,

2965
01:56:24,229 --> 01:56:26,599
space actually becomes a real problem.

2966
01:56:26,599 --> 01:56:29,989
How many hundreds of petabytes do they have

2967
01:56:29,989 --> 01:56:32,239
that they have for like, "Okay, what do we cache

2968
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:33,815
and where do we cache this?"

2969
01:56:33,815 --> 01:56:37,429
The number, I think in the terms of gigabytes

2970
01:56:37,429 --> 01:56:40,729
or maybe megabytes, they have to think in probably

2971
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:43,099
versions of bytes I don't even know the name for right?

2972
01:56:43,099 --> 01:56:45,949
It's such a different problem and that's why I said Netflix.

2973
01:56:45,949 --> 01:56:48,859
Netflix has a much easier job when it comes to caching.

2974
01:56:48,859 --> 01:56:51,049
So if you've never looked it up, it's called OCA

2975
01:56:51,049 --> 01:56:54,319
and that we know what videos we're releasing,

2976
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:57,559
we know what videos are hot in specific areas.

2977
01:56:57,559 --> 01:56:58,879
It's a very limited set.

2978
01:56:58,879 --> 01:57:00,176
We're not going to all of a sudden get,

2979
01:57:00,176 --> 01:57:01,909
"Oopsies, we got a million new view hours."

2980
01:57:01,909 --> 01:57:03,859
We don't even have to worry about that as a problem.

2981
01:57:03,859 --> 01:57:06,589
So it's like, "Okay, we know Stranger Things season five's

2982
01:57:06,589 --> 01:57:10,099
about to drop, we're gonna pre-cash Stranger Things

2983
01:57:10,099 --> 01:57:13,159
season five in every single OCA across the world

2984
01:57:13,159 --> 01:57:15,109
because that thing's about to get hammered."

2985
01:57:15,109 --> 01:57:16,369
And so it's like it's able to do

2986
01:57:16,369 --> 01:57:20,059
such a different decision-making than what you have to do

2987
01:57:20,059 --> 01:57:21,409
with something like YouTube.

2988
01:57:21,409 --> 01:57:23,269
And then Twitch is even more wild

2989
01:57:23,269 --> 01:57:25,549
because now you're actually ingesting video

2990
01:57:25,549 --> 01:57:27,919
and trying to make it go out all at the exact same time

2991
01:57:27,919 --> 01:57:30,649
for all video and you have to transform that video

2992
01:57:30,649 --> 01:57:34,249
from whatever format and whatever the bit rate is

2993
01:57:34,249 --> 01:57:35,599
into something that's more efficient

2994
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:36,799
in the system like that.

2995
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:38,779
Hats off to Twitch engineering,

2996
01:57:38,779 --> 01:57:41,179
because that's some serious work.

2997
01:57:41,179 --> 01:57:43,099
- And here's some asshole, Lex,

2998
01:57:43,099 --> 01:57:46,609
coming out and tweeting about YouTube features.

2999
01:57:46,609 --> 01:57:48,952
So like, (chuckles)

3000
01:57:50,029 --> 01:57:50,862
Listen...

3001
01:57:50,862 --> 01:57:53,299
- You're not wrong on the features you asked for, though.

3002
01:57:53,299 --> 01:57:56,029
- I think this is an engineering problem

3003
01:57:56,029 --> 01:58:01,029
of how do you allow fast iteration and addition of features

3004
01:58:01,339 --> 01:58:03,979
that shouldn't have to be integrated

3005
01:58:03,979 --> 01:58:05,929
or impact the whole code base.

3006
01:58:05,929 --> 01:58:08,869
So at the edges of the code base improve

3007
01:58:08,869 --> 01:58:13,279
on certain features, without having to consult

3008
01:58:13,279 --> 01:58:16,309
the mothership of the code.

3009
01:58:16,309 --> 01:58:17,779
- It's the large team, right?

3010
01:58:17,779 --> 01:58:19,429
That's the fundamental problem.

3011
01:58:19,429 --> 01:58:21,349
When you get into YouTube size,

3012
01:58:21,349 --> 01:58:23,749
there is the team/organization

3013
01:58:23,749 --> 01:58:25,789
that deals with data warehousing.

3014
01:58:25,789 --> 01:58:28,879
There's the team/organization that deals with delivery.

3015
01:58:28,879 --> 01:58:31,249
There's a team/organization that's like the middle layer,

3016
01:58:31,249 --> 01:58:32,269
how you even...

3017
01:58:32,269 --> 01:58:33,979
They're gonna be like the little micro-surfaces

3018
01:58:33,979 --> 01:58:35,599
to talk to these places.

3019
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:36,829
Then you have this front-end engine...

3020
01:58:36,829 --> 01:58:41,119
So for a small feature, you have to get middle team,

3021
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:42,169
you have to get back-end team,

3022
01:58:42,169 --> 01:58:43,309
you have to get all these things.

3023
01:58:43,309 --> 01:58:45,379
Quick example, Netflix.

3024
01:58:45,379 --> 01:58:48,715
Are you familiar with the dystopian, Black Mirror?

3025
01:58:48,715 --> 01:58:49,548
- Yeah.

3026
01:58:49,548 --> 01:58:50,449
- Okay. Season one, episode one.

3027
01:58:50,449 --> 01:58:51,649
Do you know season one, episode one?

3028
01:58:51,649 --> 01:58:52,729
Everyone who watches Black Mirror

3029
01:58:52,729 --> 01:58:54,049
typically knows this episode.

3030
01:58:54,049 --> 01:58:55,759
- Okay, yeah. I don't remember what it is.

3031
01:58:55,759 --> 01:58:56,839
- Forgive my language,

3032
01:58:56,839 --> 01:58:58,609
but they call it the pig-fucker episode.

3033
01:58:58,609 --> 01:58:59,869
- Oh yeah, of course.

3034
01:58:59,869 --> 01:59:01,609
- [ThePrimeagen] Once you've seen the episode,

3035
01:59:01,609 --> 01:59:03,379
you will then know this episode.

3036
01:59:03,379 --> 01:59:05,869
Well, when Netflix adopted it, I got pulled into a room,

3037
01:59:05,869 --> 01:59:08,449
there's like a VP, a VP, a product designer,

3038
01:59:08,449 --> 01:59:09,349
a VP, and they said,

3039
01:59:09,349 --> 01:59:11,059
hey, we're about to release

3040
01:59:11,059 --> 01:59:12,862
our own version of Black Mirror,

3041
01:59:13,786 --> 01:59:15,739
season three, I think at that time.

3042
01:59:15,739 --> 01:59:18,439
We need episode one, season one

3043
01:59:18,439 --> 01:59:20,899
to not be the first thing people see.

3044
01:59:20,899 --> 01:59:23,422
So let's just reverse the season order.

3045
01:59:24,859 --> 01:59:26,029
That required me...

3046
01:59:26,029 --> 01:59:28,879
I had like 20 engineers I had to gather together

3047
01:59:28,879 --> 01:59:30,709
to be able to have this happen.

3048
01:59:30,709 --> 01:59:32,419
And that's just the problem of big companies

3049
01:59:32,419 --> 01:59:34,639
is that eventually every little thing

3050
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:36,346
has to become its own team.

3051
01:59:36,346 --> 01:59:37,549
And so even small...

3052
01:59:37,549 --> 01:59:38,989
There's no such thing as a small feature.

3053
01:59:38,989 --> 01:59:41,659
- Reversing the order of the dropdown

3054
01:59:41,659 --> 01:59:44,929
that selects the seasons is a meeting

3055
01:59:44,929 --> 01:59:46,309
with a bunch of VPs and engineers.

3056
01:59:46,309 --> 01:59:47,160
That's really interesting.

3057
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:47,993
- Yeah.

3058
01:59:47,993 --> 01:59:49,459
- There's got to be a way to accelerate that.

3059
01:59:49,459 --> 01:59:52,909
The natural scaling of a company and the bureaucracy

3060
01:59:52,909 --> 01:59:54,469
that grows, yes, slows that down.

3061
01:59:54,469 --> 01:59:56,779
But just having seen Elon work a lot,

3062
01:59:56,779 --> 02:00:00,439
his teams are able to still keep it very fast,

3063
02:00:00,439 --> 02:00:01,909
even as the company grows.

3064
02:00:01,909 --> 02:00:05,959
There's got to be a process to doing that,

3065
02:00:05,959 --> 02:00:07,582
especially for,

3066
02:00:10,249 --> 02:00:11,899
yeah, for the pig-fucker episode.

3067
02:00:13,159 --> 02:00:15,769
I don't know where that's in the priority list,

3068
02:00:15,769 --> 02:00:17,569
but for important things like that,

3069
02:00:17,569 --> 02:00:18,979
you should be able to do that quickly.

3070
02:00:18,979 --> 02:00:22,219
I don't know. Can you speak to how would you do that?

3071
02:00:22,219 --> 02:00:24,379
- Well, I can tell first how it was done.

3072
02:00:24,379 --> 02:00:26,772
Remember, so at a place like Netflix, there would be...

3073
02:00:26,772 --> 02:00:27,889
I think that at that point it's called,

3074
02:00:27,889 --> 02:00:29,449
a product called Dexter.

3075
02:00:29,449 --> 02:00:30,282
I can't remember.

3076
02:00:30,282 --> 02:00:34,159
There's our actual movie metadata warehouse

3077
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:36,079
that's gonna be highly integrated with Hollywood,

3078
02:00:36,079 --> 02:00:39,589
that's gonna be, where that side is able to manage all that.

3079
02:00:39,589 --> 02:00:42,199
So I'm like, "Hey, you need the ability to mark things

3080
02:00:42,199 --> 02:00:43,189
that need to be reversed

3081
02:00:43,189 --> 02:00:44,719
because we're gonna run into this a bunch."

3082
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:45,552
And we did.

3083
02:00:45,552 --> 02:00:47,119
We ran into quite a few topical shows

3084
02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:48,769
that all need to be reversed and all that.

3085
02:00:48,769 --> 02:00:49,602
And so it's like,

3086
02:00:49,602 --> 02:00:51,079
"We need to be able to reverse episode numbers,

3087
02:00:51,079 --> 02:00:51,912
season numbers.

3088
02:00:51,912 --> 02:00:54,619
We need to be able to hide season or episode numbers."

3089
02:00:54,619 --> 02:00:57,139
Like in the case of the Chelsea Handler Show,

3090
02:00:57,139 --> 02:00:58,789
it was like a daily show, so it's like

3091
02:00:58,789 --> 02:01:00,289
you don't need episode numbers,

3092
02:01:00,289 --> 02:01:01,326
you just need the latest one.

3093
02:01:01,326 --> 02:01:03,649
And so there's this whole problem that exists.

3094
02:01:03,649 --> 02:01:05,749
And so it's like, okay, you need to work on that

3095
02:01:05,749 --> 02:01:07,249
for your UI over there,

3096
02:01:07,249 --> 02:01:08,839
then you need to be able to store that data.

3097
02:01:08,839 --> 02:01:10,849
Then we need to be able to go to the people

3098
02:01:10,849 --> 02:01:13,039
that can actually get the video data out of that

3099
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:16,279
and provide it to our service layer.

3100
02:01:16,279 --> 02:01:17,809
I need to go talk to them and convince them

3101
02:01:17,809 --> 02:01:19,729
they need to be able to give me the new methods

3102
02:01:19,729 --> 02:01:20,899
and everything to do that.

3103
02:01:20,899 --> 02:01:22,489
Then I need to be able to go write the methods

3104
02:01:22,489 --> 02:01:24,169
to get it down, and then I need to go to the UI

3105
02:01:24,169 --> 02:01:25,039
and make that accessible.

3106
02:01:25,039 --> 02:01:25,872
Now I need to go to the website people,

3107
02:01:25,872 --> 02:01:26,876
I need to go to the mobile people,

3108
02:01:26,876 --> 02:01:28,999
I need to go to the TV people.

3109
02:01:28,999 --> 02:01:30,019
And so it's like... - Yeah.

3110
02:01:30,019 --> 02:01:31,879
- You can see this thing like snowballing.

3111
02:01:31,879 --> 02:01:35,119
And for us, the big thing that Netflix did that was so well

3112
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:37,819
is after I met with these people that were high level,

3113
02:01:38,779 --> 02:01:40,849
I was the captain. "I'm the captain now."

3114
02:01:40,849 --> 02:01:42,056
So I went to all these teams and said,

3115
02:01:42,056 --> 02:01:43,939
"Hey manager, I need an engineer.

3116
02:01:43,939 --> 02:01:45,439
We need to get this done within the next couple of months

3117
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:47,479
because we got Black Mirror coming out."

3118
02:01:47,479 --> 02:01:49,639
So she would go, "Okay, here you go."

3119
02:01:49,639 --> 02:01:51,019
The map team, I need someone to help me

3120
02:01:51,019 --> 02:01:54,169
with being able to get data out of the LoLoMo for this.

3121
02:01:54,169 --> 02:01:55,579
And so it's like, "All right,

3122
02:01:55,579 --> 02:01:56,779
you're working with this engineering."

3123
02:01:56,779 --> 02:01:58,909
I'd go to the BMS team, "Okay, I need this engineer."

3124
02:01:58,909 --> 02:02:01,052
I'd go to the billboard team, "I need this engineer."

3125
02:02:01,052 --> 02:02:02,689
I go to all these little places

3126
02:02:02,689 --> 02:02:04,219
to get all these little pieces of data.

3127
02:02:04,219 --> 02:02:05,936
And then I was the captain, I was like,

3128
02:02:05,936 --> 02:02:07,189
"You're working on this, you're doing this,

3129
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:08,569
you're doing this, you're doing this, I'm doing this.

3130
02:02:08,569 --> 02:02:09,402
Let's go."

3131
02:02:09,402 --> 02:02:11,149
And so it's like that worked.

3132
02:02:11,149 --> 02:02:13,999
And we were able to go pretty fast for a big company.

3133
02:02:13,999 --> 02:02:16,099
And the fact that it required 20 engineers

3134
02:02:16,099 --> 02:02:18,652
to do such a simple task, we were able to do it in,

3135
02:02:19,489 --> 02:02:21,799
gosh, I'd say about three weeks worth of effort.

3136
02:02:21,799 --> 02:02:23,269
But that was still...

3137
02:02:23,269 --> 02:02:25,189
I thought that was amazing, comparatively,

3138
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:26,408
to how many people move.

3139
02:02:26,408 --> 02:02:28,459
- Well, because you have the freedom of the agency to do it.

3140
02:02:28,459 --> 02:02:30,859
You said the captain of the ship. That's really powerful.

3141
02:02:30,859 --> 02:02:32,749
For big companies, that's a risk.

3142
02:02:32,749 --> 02:02:34,339
Because you can fuck it up.

3143
02:02:34,339 --> 02:02:39,339
You might not see the bigger context legally or any,

3144
02:02:39,769 --> 02:02:41,959
the bigger context of the impact on the industry

3145
02:02:41,959 --> 02:02:43,466
or all the contracts that are made, all that.

3146
02:02:43,466 --> 02:02:45,169
So it's a risk, it's a risk,

3147
02:02:45,169 --> 02:02:46,789
but it's a risk you have to keep taking.

3148
02:02:46,789 --> 02:02:48,949
And then when you fuck up, you fix,

3149
02:02:48,949 --> 02:02:51,469
and then maybe pay the cost legally for that, whatever.

3150
02:02:51,469 --> 02:02:55,909
But the long term, that risk pays off

3151
02:02:55,909 --> 02:02:58,459
because you're going to keep creating a better

3152
02:02:58,459 --> 02:03:01,399
and better product, evolving where the industry is going,

3153
02:03:01,399 --> 02:03:04,519
constantly innovating ahead of where the industry is going

3154
02:03:04,519 --> 02:03:05,352
and so on.

3155
02:03:05,352 --> 02:03:06,185
Yeah.

3156
02:03:06,185 --> 02:03:07,159
- And not only that, I think one thing

3157
02:03:07,159 --> 02:03:09,589
that is just so important is that,

3158
02:03:09,589 --> 02:03:11,119
yes, the product will get better,

3159
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:13,129
but the people that you hire

3160
02:03:13,129 --> 02:03:15,739
and the people that you keep around are better

3161
02:03:15,739 --> 02:03:17,509
because they're the ones that show maturity.

3162
02:03:17,509 --> 02:03:18,499
They're the ones that can just...

3163
02:03:18,499 --> 02:03:20,899
You give them something and they can rally the troops

3164
02:03:20,899 --> 02:03:22,489
and make something happen.

3165
02:03:22,489 --> 02:03:25,219
That's a very great group of people to hire.

3166
02:03:25,219 --> 02:03:27,889
And so you also naturally select out great engineers

3167
02:03:27,889 --> 02:03:29,689
that aren't just simply good at coding,

3168
02:03:29,689 --> 02:03:31,999
they're good at coding and they're good at explaining

3169
02:03:31,999 --> 02:03:33,556
and they're good at convincing, and they're good...

3170
02:03:33,556 --> 02:03:36,469
And you have to create a very lean audience

3171
02:03:36,469 --> 02:03:37,879
that can move fast.

3172
02:03:37,879 --> 02:03:42,879
- And I think for great engineers, having to wait

3173
02:03:43,429 --> 02:03:46,549
for like, "Okay, let's schedule a meeting for next Wednesday

3174
02:03:46,549 --> 02:03:48,679
with the VPs and..."

3175
02:03:48,679 --> 02:03:50,119
That destroys their soul.

3176
02:03:50,119 --> 02:03:51,889
And they either don't want to contribute anymore

3177
02:03:51,889 --> 02:03:55,039
or they leave the companies or they just tune out

3178
02:03:55,039 --> 02:03:56,509
and take the golden handcuffs

3179
02:03:56,509 --> 02:04:01,159
and just buy a nice house and focus on a family.

3180
02:04:01,159 --> 02:04:03,139
- And I feel like I would die under that...

3181
02:04:03,139 --> 02:04:05,719
Honestly, that is my death sentence is

3182
02:04:05,719 --> 02:04:08,509
where it's just that there's no reason to try,

3183
02:04:08,509 --> 02:04:09,679
there's no reason to do anything.

3184
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:11,629
I'm just gonna go in there,

3185
02:04:11,629 --> 02:04:14,029
effectively zombie through my day and call it...

3186
02:04:14,029 --> 02:04:15,079
I don't want to live like that.

3187
02:04:15,079 --> 02:04:17,932
I want to feel like I'm trying to do something.

3188
02:04:18,829 --> 02:04:20,479
- I should also mention on top of that,

3189
02:04:20,479 --> 02:04:23,329
so you've brilliantly laid out

3190
02:04:23,329 --> 02:04:25,999
how incredible the challenge that Netflix has to solve.

3191
02:04:25,999 --> 02:04:27,532
On top of that with YouTube,

3192
02:04:28,819 --> 02:04:29,932
the metadata thing,

3193
02:04:30,799 --> 02:04:34,699
because users are able to upload video and there's an API

3194
02:04:34,699 --> 02:04:36,289
where they can upload automatically

3195
02:04:36,289 --> 02:04:38,779
and change all this kind of stuff automatically.

3196
02:04:38,779 --> 02:04:42,079
Every one of those things is an attack vector,

3197
02:04:42,079 --> 02:04:43,219
as we mentioned.

3198
02:04:43,219 --> 02:04:44,839
That's something they have to consider seriously

3199
02:04:44,839 --> 02:04:46,489
on the engineering side.

3200
02:04:46,489 --> 02:04:49,009
And on the legal side,

3201
02:04:49,009 --> 02:04:51,559
they can get into trouble all kinds of ways.

3202
02:04:51,559 --> 02:04:55,939
So they have to consider all of that, which is fascinating.

3203
02:04:55,939 --> 02:04:58,452
- The legal side is obvious, but it's not really like...

3204
02:04:58,452 --> 02:05:01,219
I would never have initially thought someone would,

3205
02:05:01,219 --> 02:05:04,729
say, upload images that you're not allowed to own or have.

3206
02:05:04,729 --> 02:05:06,229
But that guarantee you that happens.

3207
02:05:06,229 --> 02:05:08,239
Then you have the whole kid side, right?

3208
02:05:08,239 --> 02:05:10,429
I think about when you mark something as kid-friendly,

3209
02:05:10,429 --> 02:05:12,169
how many times have they snuck porn

3210
02:05:12,169 --> 02:05:13,939
into a Taylor Swift video or whatever?

3211
02:05:13,939 --> 02:05:14,899
That was like a few years back,

3212
02:05:14,899 --> 02:05:16,489
there was that whole Taylor Swift or whatever.

3213
02:05:16,489 --> 02:05:18,349
I forget what it was, I thought it was Taylor Swift.

3214
02:05:18,349 --> 02:05:20,149
But there'd be these mock videos

3215
02:05:20,149 --> 02:05:21,769
that'd come up and then, boom.

3216
02:05:21,769 --> 02:05:25,159
It's like, that is such an awful problem

3217
02:05:25,159 --> 02:05:26,629
and I'm so happy that is not a problem

3218
02:05:26,629 --> 02:05:28,309
I have to try to figure out.

3219
02:05:28,309 --> 02:05:29,599
- Yep. Okay.

3220
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,476
So yes, YouTube and Twitch and Netflix

3221
02:05:32,476 --> 02:05:34,759
are doing an incredible job.

3222
02:05:34,759 --> 02:05:38,182
You eventually chose,

3223
02:05:39,109 --> 02:05:41,809
the madman you are, to leave Netflix

3224
02:05:41,809 --> 02:05:43,549
and to start on a new journey

3225
02:05:43,549 --> 02:05:46,099
of being a wolf pack of one, start streaming.

3226
02:05:46,099 --> 02:05:48,199
What was that? What was the story of that?

3227
02:05:49,099 --> 02:05:53,059
- So I was streaming for almost seven years now.

3228
02:05:53,059 --> 02:05:54,379
It started actually at Netflix.

3229
02:05:54,379 --> 02:05:56,479
We did a charity, Extra Life,

3230
02:05:56,479 --> 02:05:58,999
shout out to Extra Life for starting my streaming career,

3231
02:05:58,999 --> 02:06:01,969
effectively is just you stream and whatever money you raise,

3232
02:06:01,969 --> 02:06:03,919
it goes to Kids with Cancer research.

3233
02:06:03,919 --> 02:06:06,079
They are a great charity in the sense

3234
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:07,489
that they take no overhead

3235
02:06:07,489 --> 02:06:09,019
and they raise their own donations

3236
02:06:09,019 --> 02:06:09,852
for their website and everything.

3237
02:06:09,852 --> 02:06:11,959
And so it's a very great, straightforward charity.

3238
02:06:11,959 --> 02:06:14,299
Really love what they've done.

3239
02:06:14,299 --> 02:06:17,479
It was super cool because I live in South Dakota now,

3240
02:06:17,479 --> 02:06:19,429
but I actually could choose a hospital directly

3241
02:06:19,429 --> 02:06:20,299
where the money goes to.

3242
02:06:20,299 --> 02:06:24,139
So there's a direct impact from A to B.

3243
02:06:24,139 --> 02:06:26,059
So it's a pretty cool organization.

3244
02:06:26,059 --> 02:06:29,049
And so my friend, Guy Cirino, Nice Try Guy

3245
02:06:29,049 --> 02:06:30,319
is what I like to call him,

3246
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:33,439
he was probably the single greatest engineer

3247
02:06:33,439 --> 02:06:34,519
I've ever met in my lifetime.

3248
02:06:34,519 --> 02:06:36,109
And he was just like, "Hey, come do this.

3249
02:06:36,109 --> 02:06:37,806
We're going to all do this." So I played Fortnite.

3250
02:06:37,806 --> 02:06:39,119
And so before I did that, I was like,

3251
02:06:39,119 --> 02:06:41,659
oh, I better learn how to stream first.

3252
02:06:41,659 --> 02:06:44,689
I better get affiliated so I can take subscriptions.

3253
02:06:44,689 --> 02:06:46,099
And then if anyone gives me a subscription,

3254
02:06:46,099 --> 02:06:47,899
I'll also pay that forward.

3255
02:06:47,899 --> 02:06:50,809
So June 2018 or something like that,

3256
02:06:50,809 --> 02:06:53,569
I start, I start streaming

3257
02:06:53,569 --> 02:06:55,309
and I start streaming some Fortnite.

3258
02:06:55,309 --> 02:06:56,989
End up getting affiliated,

3259
02:06:56,989 --> 02:06:58,819
end up doing the whole extra life thing.

3260
02:06:58,819 --> 02:07:00,169
I end up really enjoying it.

3261
02:07:00,169 --> 02:07:01,099
I'm like, "This is a lot of fun."

3262
02:07:01,099 --> 02:07:02,614
I'm playing Fortnite at that point. Okay?

3263
02:07:02,614 --> 02:07:05,569
So mind you, I'm a Fortnite streamer at that point,

3264
02:07:05,569 --> 02:07:06,829
and I start really enjoying it.

3265
02:07:06,829 --> 02:07:08,929
I keep doing it and then one day I decide

3266
02:07:08,929 --> 02:07:09,979
I'm gonna do some programming.

3267
02:07:09,979 --> 02:07:13,759
Because I really love Vim and I think I'm fast at Vim,

3268
02:07:13,759 --> 02:07:15,919
and maybe people think programming is kinda cool.

3269
02:07:15,919 --> 02:07:18,139
Because there was no really programming section

3270
02:07:18,139 --> 02:07:19,549
at that point.

3271
02:07:19,549 --> 02:07:20,602
And I did it.

3272
02:07:21,529 --> 02:07:23,779
I had like 30 people show up, which was just...

3273
02:07:23,779 --> 02:07:25,819
And it felt like incredible numbers at that point.

3274
02:07:25,819 --> 02:07:27,139
So I was like, "Oh my gosh,

3275
02:07:27,139 --> 02:07:29,646
there's like 30 people watching me program."

3276
02:07:29,646 --> 02:07:32,329
And so it just kept on going and it kept on happening

3277
02:07:32,329 --> 02:07:33,529
and it just kept on growing.

3278
02:07:33,529 --> 02:07:35,749
And I did it for year after year.

3279
02:07:35,749 --> 02:07:38,869
I would do my job, I would come home,

3280
02:07:38,869 --> 02:07:40,369
I'd eat dinner with the kiddos,

3281
02:07:40,369 --> 02:07:41,749
I would read them Lord of the Rings

3282
02:07:41,749 --> 02:07:43,309
and the Hobbit during that time,

3283
02:07:43,309 --> 02:07:45,949
I'd read to them for a half an hour, then I'd set that down.

3284
02:07:45,949 --> 02:07:47,569
And then three nights a week I would program

3285
02:07:47,569 --> 02:07:49,969
until like 2:00 in the morning or play video games

3286
02:07:49,969 --> 02:07:51,169
until 2:00 in the morning streaming

3287
02:07:51,169 --> 02:07:52,939
and building up this whole side thing.

3288
02:07:52,939 --> 02:07:55,249
And I did this for a long, long time,

3289
02:07:55,249 --> 02:07:58,519
and then eventually it just kept working out so well

3290
02:07:58,519 --> 02:07:59,419
and I started making YouTube videos.

3291
02:07:59,419 --> 02:08:01,249
And then that started getting better.

3292
02:08:01,249 --> 02:08:05,749
And it was just a long, long grind until April of last year.

3293
02:08:05,749 --> 02:08:07,549
I went to the Streamer Awards

3294
02:08:07,549 --> 02:08:10,129
and I got to announce the programming category

3295
02:08:10,129 --> 02:08:11,359
and Pirate SoftwareOne.

3296
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:13,159
It was awesome. It was a great time.

3297
02:08:13,159 --> 02:08:15,349
And during that time he gave me a challenge coin

3298
02:08:15,349 --> 02:08:17,899
and just said, "You just got to go for it.

3299
02:08:17,899 --> 02:08:19,279
Just go full time."

3300
02:08:19,279 --> 02:08:22,339
And so I just sat there and my wife can attest to it.

3301
02:08:22,339 --> 02:08:25,999
It was like an emotional turmoil thing

3302
02:08:25,999 --> 02:08:27,682
and it just took a lot of,

3303
02:08:29,779 --> 02:08:32,689
it was pretty awful because I didn't...

3304
02:08:32,689 --> 02:08:34,459
Netflix is very safe option.

3305
02:08:34,459 --> 02:08:37,099
It was both very fun. It was challenging.

3306
02:08:37,099 --> 02:08:39,169
I liked a lot of the people worked with

3307
02:08:39,169 --> 02:08:40,002
It was overall a really great thing.

3308
02:08:40,002 --> 02:08:43,609
I had a really great boss, really appreciated him.

3309
02:08:43,609 --> 02:08:46,519
I still have text him now and then he's really great guy.

3310
02:08:46,519 --> 02:08:48,889
So it's just like I'm leaving all these things

3311
02:08:48,889 --> 02:08:50,089
for something that's unsure.

3312
02:08:50,089 --> 02:08:53,479
And the reality is that streaming and all these things,

3313
02:08:53,479 --> 02:08:55,609
you know, people love you one day,

3314
02:08:55,609 --> 02:08:56,839
they could hate you the next day.

3315
02:08:56,839 --> 02:08:59,569
There's all this stuff that goes into

3316
02:08:59,569 --> 02:09:01,159
being on the public side.

3317
02:09:01,159 --> 02:09:02,599
And I had Netflix as the backing,

3318
02:09:02,599 --> 02:09:04,489
so it's like if public hated me the next day I'd be like,

3319
02:09:04,489 --> 02:09:05,689
deuces, I'm out.

3320
02:09:05,689 --> 02:09:06,679
I don't care.

3321
02:09:06,679 --> 02:09:08,569
Now it's like, now I'm gonna do this as a job.

3322
02:09:08,569 --> 02:09:11,946
And so there's a whole huge turmoil to this whole thing

3323
02:09:11,946 --> 02:09:13,699
that I kind of went through it.

3324
02:09:13,699 --> 02:09:17,989
And eventually I just said, okay, I'm gonna make this.

3325
02:09:17,989 --> 02:09:19,039
It resonated with me

3326
02:09:19,039 --> 02:09:21,442
when I first made the decision to join Netflix.

3327
02:09:22,279 --> 02:09:23,212
I'm getting older.

3328
02:09:24,199 --> 02:09:27,499
There's not a lot of chances to do something unusual.

3329
02:09:27,499 --> 02:09:30,769
Those chances go down constantly as you get older.

3330
02:09:30,769 --> 02:09:33,709
This might be the last crazy thing I get to do.

3331
02:09:33,709 --> 02:09:34,849
Let's just try it.

3332
02:09:34,849 --> 02:09:36,799
So in April I went full-time

3333
02:09:36,799 --> 02:09:39,199
and I guess I haven't looked back.

3334
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:42,919
I'm only not even a year into doing this as a full-time gig.

3335
02:09:42,919 --> 02:09:44,419
And it's just been a lot of fun.

3336
02:09:44,419 --> 02:09:49,039
And the biggest thing is just being able to really explore

3337
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:50,629
and do these things on stream

3338
02:09:50,629 --> 02:09:53,899
where people really enjoy watching and engaging.

3339
02:09:53,899 --> 02:09:56,539
It's been a great, hard, fun,

3340
02:09:56,539 --> 02:09:59,179
amazing, difficult experience.

3341
02:09:59,179 --> 02:10:00,409
- It's a really inspiring leap.

3342
02:10:00,409 --> 02:10:02,749
It's a really hard one to take for many reasons,

3343
02:10:02,749 --> 02:10:06,802
like you outlined, but also the loneliness of it,

3344
02:10:09,337 --> 02:10:11,419
I think it's a pretty lonely pursuit.

3345
02:10:11,419 --> 02:10:12,252
- It is. Yeah.

3346
02:10:12,252 --> 02:10:14,719
- Just you and the camera and the audience

3347
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:16,486
and the ups and downs of that.

3348
02:10:16,486 --> 02:10:18,589
And there's not really a team.

3349
02:10:18,589 --> 02:10:21,709
- I do have one lucky thing I'd say that, my editor, Flip,

3350
02:10:21,709 --> 02:10:22,745
shout out Flip.

3351
02:10:22,745 --> 02:10:23,953
- Flip, shout out. - He said it would

3352
02:10:23,953 --> 02:10:26,166
mean the world to him if I said, "Shout out, Flip."

3353
02:10:26,166 --> 02:10:27,211
- I love you, Flip.

3354
02:10:27,211 --> 02:10:28,399
- I love you, Flip. - We all love you.

3355
02:10:28,399 --> 02:10:29,232
- Oh, man.

3356
02:10:30,109 --> 02:10:33,349
He had, as he would say, he had nothing going for him.

3357
02:10:33,349 --> 02:10:35,629
He had a really hard growing up.

3358
02:10:35,629 --> 02:10:39,529
A lot of rough life decisions have gone into his life

3359
02:10:39,529 --> 02:10:40,686
and he's crawling back out of it.

3360
02:10:40,686 --> 02:10:43,072
And he just said, "Hey, I'll edit full-time for you."

3361
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:45,049
So I just said, "All right, like 50/50,

3362
02:10:45,049 --> 02:10:46,639
whatever I make on YouTube, you get.

3363
02:10:46,639 --> 02:10:47,599
We're gonna do this together."

3364
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:51,739
And we did that for years, making $0 a month pretty much.

3365
02:10:51,739 --> 02:10:54,409
And so it's just like that was an incredible jump

3366
02:10:54,409 --> 02:10:56,389
and now we get to work together.

3367
02:10:56,389 --> 02:10:58,129
So I do get that one team aspect

3368
02:10:58,129 --> 02:10:59,119
that I think is really nice.

3369
02:10:59,119 --> 02:11:02,029
But it's not like it was at Netflix

3370
02:11:02,029 --> 02:11:04,489
where I could hear about stuff people are building,

3371
02:11:04,489 --> 02:11:07,249
I don't have a team, I don't have product or cycles,

3372
02:11:07,249 --> 02:11:09,199
I don't have a manager that I have to try to make happy.

3373
02:11:09,199 --> 02:11:10,279
It's just like...

3374
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:11,899
It is very lonely.

3375
02:11:11,899 --> 02:11:13,489
And I don't think a lot of people realize

3376
02:11:13,489 --> 02:11:15,232
how lonely it actually can be.

3377
02:11:16,219 --> 02:11:18,829
- Yeah, so combine that loneliness with,

3378
02:11:18,829 --> 02:11:21,429
in my case, I don't know how many people attack you.

3379
02:11:23,297 --> 02:11:25,429
- I have a shockingly low amount of attack rate,

3380
02:11:25,429 --> 02:11:26,262
I feel like.

3381
02:11:26,262 --> 02:11:28,279
- Yeah, people generally...

3382
02:11:28,279 --> 02:11:30,529
I mean it's sometimes fun sort of teasing,

3383
02:11:30,529 --> 02:11:33,229
that kind of thing, but it's mostly just really...

3384
02:11:33,229 --> 02:11:34,849
You give so much love to the world

3385
02:11:34,849 --> 02:11:36,109
and inspire so many people,

3386
02:11:36,109 --> 02:11:39,289
even when you're making fun of stuff, yeah.

3387
02:11:39,289 --> 02:11:42,349
But with me taking the loneliness of it

3388
02:11:42,349 --> 02:11:44,839
combined with just really intense attacks, it's tough.

3389
02:11:44,839 --> 02:11:48,832
It can be rough. Psychologically, really a tough journey.

3390
02:11:50,269 --> 02:11:51,499
You miss working with a team,

3391
02:11:51,499 --> 02:11:55,042
just from even a software engineering side,

3392
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:59,464
where you can share code or talk over code?

3393
02:11:59,464 --> 02:12:00,297
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.

3394
02:12:00,297 --> 02:12:02,119
- Or the collaborative aspect of it?

3395
02:12:02,119 --> 02:12:04,669
- Yeah, multiple things there.

3396
02:12:04,669 --> 02:12:06,469
One, hey, we love you Lex,

3397
02:12:06,469 --> 02:12:08,722
so don't let the things get you down.

3398
02:12:09,575 --> 02:12:11,032
- Thank you. Thank you.

3399
02:12:11,032 --> 02:12:12,410
I love you too.

3400
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:15,428
- Thank you. Hey, little bonding moment here going on.

3401
02:12:15,428 --> 02:12:17,306
But one thing I really miss-

3402
02:12:17,306 --> 02:12:18,731
- Not in a sexual way, just to be clear.

3403
02:12:18,731 --> 02:12:20,742
- The tension is a little tense here.

3404
02:12:20,742 --> 02:12:21,929
- I'm getting uncomfortable.

3405
02:12:21,929 --> 02:12:23,839
Yeah. Anyway, team.

3406
02:12:23,839 --> 02:12:27,139
- It's just the one thing I really miss is just,

3407
02:12:27,139 --> 02:12:28,909
even when I hated how people did it,

3408
02:12:28,909 --> 02:12:31,821
just seeing how other people solved things,

3409
02:12:31,821 --> 02:12:35,689
it's really amazing just the raw creative power

3410
02:12:35,689 --> 02:12:38,869
so many people have, and just being like, oh, wow,

3411
02:12:38,869 --> 02:12:41,509
I would've never done it this way.

3412
02:12:41,509 --> 02:12:44,629
Crazy, right? Wow, this is awesome.

3413
02:12:44,629 --> 02:12:46,279
And then you kind of internally process this

3414
02:12:46,279 --> 02:12:48,589
and you're like, oh, I now have a new little tool

3415
02:12:48,589 --> 02:12:49,969
in my tool belt.

3416
02:12:49,969 --> 02:12:53,059
Because at some point it's really hard to find a mentor

3417
02:12:53,059 --> 02:12:54,169
when you're first, young

3418
02:12:54,169 --> 02:12:56,419
and you're just starting out programming.

3419
02:12:56,419 --> 02:12:58,309
I mean, anyone with a couple years of experience

3420
02:12:58,309 --> 02:13:00,289
will be not just a little bit better than you,

3421
02:13:00,289 --> 02:13:02,539
but infinitely better than you.

3422
02:13:02,539 --> 02:13:05,119
It feels like crazy how much better people are.

3423
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:07,309
And so you have to get mentors and you learn from people.

3424
02:13:07,309 --> 02:13:08,569
And then as you get better,

3425
02:13:08,569 --> 02:13:11,359
that amount of availability gets really small.

3426
02:13:11,359 --> 02:13:13,399
And so it's something that I really do miss is

3427
02:13:13,399 --> 02:13:16,879
kind of that forced hard problem solving together.

3428
02:13:16,879 --> 02:13:20,089
- I think there's also a skill to mining the wisdom

3429
02:13:20,089 --> 02:13:21,379
from other people.

3430
02:13:21,379 --> 02:13:26,379
I generally try to approach even junior people, young folks.

3431
02:13:27,889 --> 02:13:31,309
It's just mentally, at least for me, it works as a hack

3432
02:13:31,309 --> 02:13:35,239
to assume they're the smartest person in the world,

3433
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:36,589
way smarter than me.

3434
02:13:36,589 --> 02:13:38,839
And so I take every single word they say

3435
02:13:38,839 --> 02:13:40,669
as potential wisdom,

3436
02:13:40,669 --> 02:13:43,762
and that helps me sort of mine for potential wisdom there.

3437
02:13:44,599 --> 02:13:47,659
Because it's so easy once you get older to judge,

3438
02:13:47,659 --> 02:13:49,279
to be like, yeah, okay, okay.

3439
02:13:49,279 --> 02:13:51,122
I've been through that. I remember feeling like that.

3440
02:13:51,122 --> 02:13:53,689
I remember thinking that. That's incorrect, whatever.

3441
02:13:53,689 --> 02:13:56,599
But just kind of assume that I don't know

3442
02:13:56,599 --> 02:14:00,379
what the fuck I'm doing, and the other person is this sage.

3443
02:14:00,379 --> 02:14:02,689
And in that kind of interaction,

3444
02:14:02,689 --> 02:14:04,279
I think you could actually learn a lot.

3445
02:14:04,279 --> 02:14:09,039
And my favorite interactions is when we both think that way.

3446
02:14:09,039 --> 02:14:13,279
So from there, I think that's a catalyst

3447
02:14:13,279 --> 02:14:16,609
for a great, great collaboration and interaction.

3448
02:14:16,609 --> 02:14:19,549
- It just also makes everything much nicer.

3449
02:14:19,549 --> 02:14:21,049
It really stinks to work with someone

3450
02:14:21,049 --> 02:14:23,119
that's combative and negative.

3451
02:14:23,119 --> 02:14:25,369
I don't mind combativeness

3452
02:14:25,369 --> 02:14:27,139
if it's like I'm trying to figure out

3453
02:14:27,139 --> 02:14:30,739
what's best to do right now, versus combativeness

3454
02:14:30,739 --> 02:14:32,089
just because you're a negative person

3455
02:14:32,089 --> 02:14:33,919
and things have to be this one particular way,

3456
02:14:33,919 --> 02:14:35,299
because if they're not this one particular way,

3457
02:14:35,299 --> 02:14:36,436
it's the end of the world.

3458
02:14:36,436 --> 02:14:40,699
And that's actually really hard for me to work with.

3459
02:14:40,699 --> 02:14:44,569
- What's the origin story of ThePrimeagen name?

3460
02:14:44,569 --> 02:14:48,709
- The origin story of ThePrimeagen name was,

3461
02:14:48,709 --> 02:14:50,899
are you familiar with a video game called Turok?

3462
02:14:50,899 --> 02:14:52,252
Nintendo 64.

3463
02:14:52,252 --> 02:14:54,829
- Yeah - So Turok had Turok I

3464
02:14:54,829 --> 02:14:56,119
and then Turok II.

3465
02:14:56,119 --> 02:14:58,549
Turok II was a brutally hard game.

3466
02:14:58,549 --> 02:15:01,129
This is back when first-person shooters,

3467
02:15:01,129 --> 02:15:03,559
they would only give you a certain amount of health,

3468
02:15:03,559 --> 02:15:06,526
and you had to go discover health and get that health.

3469
02:15:06,526 --> 02:15:08,509
And you had to beat the whole game

3470
02:15:08,509 --> 02:15:09,619
without effectively dying.

3471
02:15:09,619 --> 02:15:11,629
That's an old, that's like the first version right there.

3472
02:15:11,629 --> 02:15:13,939
That's like Turok I and Turok II.

3473
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:17,479
- Turok is a renowned first-person shooter video game series

3474
02:15:17,479 --> 02:15:20,119
featuring dinosaurs, action, and sci-fi elements.

3475
02:15:20,119 --> 02:15:21,739
The franchise has evolved significantly

3476
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:24,649
since its inception in 1997.

3477
02:15:24,649 --> 02:15:25,482
- There you go.

3478
02:15:25,482 --> 02:15:27,359
So in 1998, there, you can see it right there.

3479
02:15:27,359 --> 02:15:30,619
- Turok II, Seed of Evil followed in 1998

3480
02:15:30,619 --> 02:15:33,379
featuring larger levels, more challenging puzzles,

3481
02:15:33,379 --> 02:15:34,489
and deadlier enemies.

3482
02:15:34,489 --> 02:15:35,389
- The notable difficulty,

3483
02:15:35,389 --> 02:15:38,419
it was very, very, very difficult.

3484
02:15:38,419 --> 02:15:41,689
So I spent, when I got it, it came in a black cartridge,

3485
02:15:41,689 --> 02:15:43,546
not like your standard gray Nintendo 64,

3486
02:15:43,546 --> 02:15:45,379
the black cartridge.

3487
02:15:45,379 --> 02:15:46,212
Badass game.

3488
02:15:46,212 --> 02:15:50,209
And I got it and I put it in and I played,

3489
02:15:50,209 --> 02:15:52,879
and I played every day for 10 hours a day,

3490
02:15:52,879 --> 02:15:54,409
for a month straight.

3491
02:15:54,409 --> 02:15:55,819
And I beat it.

3492
02:15:55,819 --> 02:15:57,946
And it was such an incredible, great experience.

3493
02:15:57,946 --> 02:16:01,369
And the last leader of Turok II is called the Primeagen.

3494
02:16:01,369 --> 02:16:04,039
And so when I was a kid, when you're in fifth grade,

3495
02:16:04,039 --> 02:16:06,739
that's super cool, named after the bad guy.

3496
02:16:06,739 --> 02:16:09,289
And so for a long time on any internet thing,

3497
02:16:09,289 --> 02:16:11,149
like Graal Online that I mentioned earlier,

3498
02:16:11,149 --> 02:16:12,379
the name was ThePrimeagen.

3499
02:16:12,379 --> 02:16:13,369
It was great.

3500
02:16:13,369 --> 02:16:16,979
And then I became an adult eventually, and it's just like,

3501
02:16:16,979 --> 02:16:20,010
okay, I'm an adult. My name's Michael Paulson underscore.

3502
02:16:20,010 --> 02:16:21,259
And that's what I was on the internet

3503
02:16:21,259 --> 02:16:23,449
for a long time was that.

3504
02:16:23,449 --> 02:16:26,632
And I remember it was like 2017,

3505
02:16:27,619 --> 02:16:30,292
2018, somewhere in there.

3506
02:16:32,929 --> 02:16:36,846
I remember just how bad the tech world had kind of become.

3507
02:16:36,846 --> 02:16:40,398
It was just like this super pretentious place,

3508
02:16:40,398 --> 02:16:42,349
tons of dick measuring,

3509
02:16:42,349 --> 02:16:44,869
just everything that just was the worst.

3510
02:16:44,869 --> 02:16:47,629
Ken Wheeler got canceled over playing the Circle game.

3511
02:16:47,629 --> 02:16:48,562
It was just like,

3512
02:16:50,370 --> 02:16:52,549
it is so hard to describe to people that weren't there,

3513
02:16:52,549 --> 02:16:54,259
but it was just the worst place to be.

3514
02:16:54,259 --> 02:16:56,689
Tech was extremely unfun.

3515
02:16:56,689 --> 02:16:58,879
It was extremely awful.

3516
02:16:58,879 --> 02:17:01,549
Everything was just so, it wasn't academic

3517
02:17:01,549 --> 02:17:02,568
because it was research.

3518
02:17:02,568 --> 02:17:06,138
It was like we're building the most sophisticated things,

3519
02:17:06,138 --> 02:17:07,759
and this is for the smart people

3520
02:17:07,759 --> 02:17:09,079
and everyone else is the dumb people.

3521
02:17:09,079 --> 02:17:10,915
Don't worry. We'll design for you, dummy.

3522
02:17:10,915 --> 02:17:13,099
We'll show you how to make the perfect architecture.

3523
02:17:13,099 --> 02:17:15,318
And I remember changing my Twitter handle

3524
02:17:15,318 --> 02:17:16,519
because I got so upset

3525
02:17:16,519 --> 02:17:18,459
and just went back to my video game name.

3526
02:17:18,459 --> 02:17:21,468
I was like, I want things to be fun.

3527
02:17:21,468 --> 02:17:22,879
I want this to stop.

3528
02:17:22,879 --> 02:17:26,299
And so when I started streaming tech,

3529
02:17:26,299 --> 02:17:30,318
my goal became to destroy whatever that tech mentality was,

3530
02:17:30,318 --> 02:17:32,509
because it includes nobody.

3531
02:17:32,509 --> 02:17:34,369
Everyone thinks that they're the smart people

3532
02:17:34,369 --> 02:17:35,539
and they design for the dummies.

3533
02:17:35,539 --> 02:17:38,718
And it's just like, no, I want tech to be this place

3534
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:42,019
where people feel like they can be creative, and excited,

3535
02:17:42,019 --> 02:17:43,159
and actually build something.

3536
02:17:43,159 --> 02:17:45,409
And if you're new, it's okay to be dumb

3537
02:17:45,409 --> 02:17:46,999
and ask dumb questions.

3538
02:17:46,999 --> 02:17:48,439
Learn from your dumbness.

3539
02:17:48,439 --> 02:17:51,199
No one's expecting you to be smart. Pick whatever you want.

3540
02:17:51,199 --> 02:17:52,579
Actually do something and have fun

3541
02:17:52,579 --> 02:17:54,318
and build your crazy ideas.

3542
02:17:54,318 --> 02:17:56,749
Oh, you're going to reinvent the wheel, reinvent the wheel,

3543
02:17:56,749 --> 02:17:59,299
understand what you're doing, learn it really good,

3544
02:17:59,299 --> 02:18:01,068
and interact and stuff.

3545
02:18:01,068 --> 02:18:03,499
And it was just so different than what was out there.

3546
02:18:03,499 --> 02:18:05,089
And the name...

3547
02:18:05,089 --> 02:18:07,279
Arnold Schwarzenegger talks about this thing where,

3548
02:18:07,279 --> 02:18:08,808
when he first started acting,

3549
02:18:08,808 --> 02:18:11,568
his name was the thing that people hated.

3550
02:18:11,568 --> 02:18:14,119
As he once said, you have a strange voice,

3551
02:18:14,119 --> 02:18:15,679
you have a strange body, and your name,

3552
02:18:15,679 --> 02:18:16,789
your name's unpronounceable.

3553
02:18:16,789 --> 02:18:18,468
No one's going to Schneitzinfinitzel,

3554
02:18:18,468 --> 02:18:19,302
no one's going to remember that.

3555
02:18:19,302 --> 02:18:20,359
- Yeah. - And he said,

3556
02:18:20,359 --> 02:18:22,909
but now the name is the strong part.

3557
02:18:22,909 --> 02:18:24,978
And for me, I've always felt akin to that,

3558
02:18:24,978 --> 02:18:26,179
though my name's not nearly as cool,

3559
02:18:26,179 --> 02:18:27,888
nor am I as popular as Arnold,

3560
02:18:27,888 --> 02:18:30,259
nor am I as tough or good-looking or successful.

3561
02:18:30,259 --> 02:18:32,449
But nonetheless, it's just the name

3562
02:18:32,449 --> 02:18:36,769
represented this counterculture movement within myself,

3563
02:18:36,769 --> 02:18:38,898
in which I just hated what was there

3564
02:18:38,898 --> 02:18:40,279
and I wanted to defeat it.

3565
02:18:40,279 --> 02:18:41,929
And so this has been the thing.

3566
02:18:41,929 --> 02:18:44,209
And now people remember me so well

3567
02:18:44,209 --> 02:18:46,249
because of how weird my name is.

3568
02:18:46,249 --> 02:18:48,769
And so it's just like for whatever reason,

3569
02:18:48,769 --> 02:18:50,376
it became its own thing.

3570
02:18:50,376 --> 02:18:52,699
And so that's the...

3571
02:18:52,699 --> 02:18:54,079
Now I would never change it,

3572
02:18:54,079 --> 02:18:55,218
and back then I would never change it

3573
02:18:55,218 --> 02:18:57,679
because it was my rage against the machine moment,

3574
02:18:57,679 --> 02:18:58,849
if you will.

3575
02:18:58,849 --> 02:19:01,009
- Yeah, I love that as a symbol of rage

3576
02:19:01,009 --> 02:19:04,609
against the machine and the rage being fun.

3577
02:19:04,609 --> 02:19:05,441
- Yeah.

3578
02:19:05,441 --> 02:19:07,699
I just want people to be creative and have fun again.

3579
02:19:07,699 --> 02:19:08,599
It's okay.

3580
02:19:08,599 --> 02:19:11,239
- What about the mustache? It's an epic mustache.

3581
02:19:11,239 --> 02:19:14,070
It's an epic stash. It has a life of its own.

3582
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:15,829
Is there an origin story

3583
02:19:15,829 --> 02:19:18,949
or did you guys discover each other at some point?

3584
02:19:18,949 --> 02:19:22,398
Or did it emerge from the darkness

3585
02:19:22,398 --> 02:19:24,379
of the struggle that is your life,

3586
02:19:24,379 --> 02:19:26,419
or where does it come from?

3587
02:19:26,419 --> 02:19:29,058
- Well, the original mustache is

3588
02:19:29,058 --> 02:19:30,439
that it was no-shave November

3589
02:19:30,439 --> 02:19:32,478
back before it became Movember.

3590
02:19:32,478 --> 02:19:34,339
It was no-shave November back in the day.

3591
02:19:34,339 --> 02:19:37,249
And after no-shave November, you had all this hair.

3592
02:19:37,249 --> 02:19:39,157
And so what's the natural thing you got to do?

3593
02:19:39,157 --> 02:19:41,179
You got to sport a mustache for a day. Right?

3594
02:19:41,179 --> 02:19:43,849
So whenever I'd forget to not shave for a long time,

3595
02:19:43,849 --> 02:19:46,039
and then I'd let it start growing out really big,

3596
02:19:46,039 --> 02:19:47,839
I just go, oh, this is kind of funny.

3597
02:19:47,839 --> 02:19:49,609
I'll have a mustache.

3598
02:19:49,609 --> 02:19:51,019
So one day when I was streaming,

3599
02:19:51,019 --> 02:19:53,239
it's just one of those times I just didn't shave,

3600
02:19:53,239 --> 02:19:54,589
and then I started just letting it go,

3601
02:19:54,589 --> 02:19:55,669
and then I got kind of a beard,

3602
02:19:55,669 --> 02:19:57,439
and then I just had a mustache.

3603
02:19:57,439 --> 02:19:59,560
When I did it, people were just like,

3604
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:01,646
yeah, it's mustache time. And I was just like, heck yeah,

3605
02:20:01,646 --> 02:20:04,489
it feels like a lifestyle decision.

3606
02:20:04,489 --> 02:20:05,719
This is the fun times.

3607
02:20:05,719 --> 02:20:07,759
And so all of a sudden it was just exciting

3608
02:20:07,759 --> 02:20:08,592
to have a mustache.

3609
02:20:08,592 --> 02:20:11,059
And I shaved it off and I was like, oh, okay.

3610
02:20:11,059 --> 02:20:13,489
But then part of me is like there's this weird energy

3611
02:20:13,489 --> 02:20:15,699
that comes from just having a mustache.

3612
02:20:15,699 --> 02:20:17,839
So I was like, I'm going back.

3613
02:20:17,839 --> 02:20:19,729
Told my wife, forgive her.

3614
02:20:19,729 --> 02:20:22,579
She was very not as thrilled about my decisions

3615
02:20:22,579 --> 02:20:23,989
to have a mustache long-term,

3616
02:20:23,989 --> 02:20:26,329
but I just decided to have it back

3617
02:20:26,329 --> 02:20:29,272
and it was the right thing.

3618
02:20:30,589 --> 02:20:33,199
It's always been the energy that I had was the mustache.

3619
02:20:33,199 --> 02:20:34,032
It was always been there.

3620
02:20:34,032 --> 02:20:36,979
It just never was visible until later on it feels like.

3621
02:20:36,979 --> 02:20:38,719
- Yeah, we're chatting offline

3622
02:20:38,719 --> 02:20:41,179
how one of the components of a successful relationship

3623
02:20:41,179 --> 02:20:44,239
is sacrifice and your wife was willing to take the sacrifice

3624
02:20:44,239 --> 02:20:45,769
of allowing you to have a mustache.

3625
02:20:45,769 --> 02:20:48,769
- I clearly was not willing to sacrifice not having one. So.

3626
02:20:50,089 --> 02:20:53,209
- You do this incredible thing

3627
02:20:53,209 --> 02:20:55,699
where you tried a bunch of different programming languages

3628
02:20:55,699 --> 02:20:56,542
when you stream.

3629
02:20:57,769 --> 02:20:58,899
You have like...

3630
02:20:59,959 --> 02:21:02,539
You go all out on certain programming languages

3631
02:21:02,539 --> 02:21:06,199
like Rust and then go and then try to pick a new one,

3632
02:21:06,199 --> 02:21:08,779
but also are experimenting constantly.

3633
02:21:08,779 --> 02:21:13,779
So maybe one question I could ask is about learning.

3634
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:17,329
What's your approach to learning a new programming language,

3635
02:21:17,329 --> 02:21:18,619
and maybe what's your advice

3636
02:21:18,619 --> 02:21:20,299
on learning a new programming language

3637
02:21:20,299 --> 02:21:23,449
when you begin that journey?

3638
02:21:23,449 --> 02:21:25,549
- So I've kind of done a bunch of different ways

3639
02:21:25,549 --> 02:21:28,069
to go through this learning process,

3640
02:21:28,069 --> 02:21:30,139
and I've tried a lot of different ones.

3641
02:21:30,139 --> 02:21:32,809
Something that is obviously successful

3642
02:21:32,809 --> 02:21:35,329
is just start building something.

3643
02:21:35,329 --> 02:21:37,129
Just put your hands on the keyboard,

3644
02:21:38,599 --> 02:21:40,459
especially if you already know how to program.

3645
02:21:40,459 --> 02:21:42,679
You're like, okay, I'm now using Zig.

3646
02:21:42,679 --> 02:21:44,779
How do I do a main function so I can just run the program?

3647
02:21:44,779 --> 02:21:45,799
Okay, now I know how to build.

3648
02:21:45,799 --> 02:21:47,929
Okay, how do I do an if statement? What does it look like?

3649
02:21:47,929 --> 02:21:49,849
Okay, how do I declare my own functions?

3650
02:21:49,849 --> 02:21:50,682
How do I do modules, right?

3651
02:21:50,682 --> 02:21:53,269
You just kind of Google your way through it, if you will,

3652
02:21:53,269 --> 02:21:56,329
to get to the end product and build something.

3653
02:21:56,329 --> 02:21:57,979
It's a great way to do things

3654
02:21:57,979 --> 02:21:59,839
because I find that repetition,

3655
02:21:59,839 --> 02:22:02,419
rote learning is obviously the best way to do this.

3656
02:22:02,419 --> 02:22:03,619
You have to kind of go over it a bunch

3657
02:22:03,619 --> 02:22:05,239
and you can definitely get out

3658
02:22:05,239 --> 02:22:06,409
and build a lot of stuff with that.

3659
02:22:06,409 --> 02:22:09,919
I like that initial kind of get used to things.

3660
02:22:09,919 --> 02:22:12,649
But on top of it, I find that, by doing that,

3661
02:22:12,649 --> 02:22:14,479
you also fall into traps.

3662
02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:18,529
You kind of Google and you try to solve a problem

3663
02:22:18,529 --> 02:22:21,919
in the language based on all of your previous experience.

3664
02:22:21,919 --> 02:22:25,819
And so you don't have what makes that language special.

3665
02:22:25,819 --> 02:22:27,889
You have what all the other languages make special.

3666
02:22:27,889 --> 02:22:29,119
And so you end up kind of

3667
02:22:29,119 --> 02:22:31,639
not really being able to use it very effectively,

3668
02:22:31,639 --> 02:22:33,079
but you can certainly kind of learn it

3669
02:22:33,079 --> 02:22:34,306
and get kind of good at it.

3670
02:22:34,306 --> 02:22:36,259
And so the second approach I've been doing lately,

3671
02:22:36,259 --> 02:22:38,149
and this has been inspired by the creator of Ghosty,

3672
02:22:38,149 --> 02:22:40,069
Mitchell Hashimoto, is to just start

3673
02:22:40,069 --> 02:22:42,289
by reading the language reference, the whole thing.

3674
02:22:42,289 --> 02:22:44,269
And so lately I've been just kind of going through

3675
02:22:44,269 --> 02:22:47,359
and just reading the entire manual for these languages.

3676
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:49,609
Like Zig, I'm almost done with that one.

3677
02:22:49,609 --> 02:22:52,069
It's like 8 to 10 hours of just sitting down reading,

3678
02:22:52,069 --> 02:22:53,989
and I'll whip out my computer and kind of practice

3679
02:22:53,989 --> 02:22:55,669
a couple of the things from the actual docs,

3680
02:22:55,669 --> 02:22:58,399
and that way I can learn all the things.

3681
02:22:58,399 --> 02:23:00,949
So then when I start building again, I'll remember,

3682
02:23:00,949 --> 02:23:02,629
okay, I know there's a thing over here,

3683
02:23:02,629 --> 02:23:03,619
let me go reread about it

3684
02:23:03,619 --> 02:23:05,599
because now I have it indexed in my brain somewhere

3685
02:23:05,599 --> 02:23:07,399
that will remember.

3686
02:23:07,399 --> 02:23:10,429
And so I don't think there's a right or wrong way.

3687
02:23:10,429 --> 02:23:12,319
I mean at the end of the day, the right way is always

3688
02:23:12,319 --> 02:23:13,849
that you have to build something eventually.

3689
02:23:13,849 --> 02:23:15,079
You cannot just read about it.

3690
02:23:15,079 --> 02:23:16,759
You have to put your hands on the keyboard,

3691
02:23:16,759 --> 02:23:18,019
you have to build something out.

3692
02:23:18,019 --> 02:23:20,179
And then once you do that, that's where you really discover

3693
02:23:20,179 --> 02:23:22,339
what makes it painful or what makes it great.

3694
02:23:22,339 --> 02:23:23,899
And if you don't have the breadth

3695
02:23:23,899 --> 02:23:24,889
of what the language offers,

3696
02:23:24,889 --> 02:23:27,769
you just may make it painful by simply being bad at it.

3697
02:23:27,769 --> 02:23:29,932
- Where exactly are you reading this-

3698
02:23:31,166 --> 02:23:32,128
- [ThePrimeagen] Language reference.

3699
02:23:32,128 --> 02:23:33,545
- The language reference.

3700
02:23:33,545 --> 02:23:34,378
- [ThePrimeagen] So it just goes through

3701
02:23:34,378 --> 02:23:36,739
every feature top to bottom. - That's a lot. Yeah.

3702
02:23:36,739 --> 02:23:37,999
- [ThePrimeagen] Every way it's described,

3703
02:23:37,999 --> 02:23:39,152
all the different things.

3704
02:23:39,152 --> 02:23:42,229
I think Zig's is, it's a decent size,

3705
02:23:42,229 --> 02:23:44,029
but it's not just simply read the words.

3706
02:23:44,029 --> 02:23:46,519
You want to internalize each concept as well.

3707
02:23:46,519 --> 02:23:48,589
So it takes a long time. So I'm a slow reader.

3708
02:23:48,589 --> 02:23:52,762
- So you're building, in AI terms, like a background model.

3709
02:23:55,069 --> 02:23:57,079
'Cause I don't think you can just start building

3710
02:23:57,079 --> 02:23:59,849
once you're done reading because you probably forgot

3711
02:24:01,369 --> 02:24:03,109
how to do a for loop.

3712
02:24:03,109 --> 02:24:05,629
You kind of forget the specifics.

3713
02:24:05,629 --> 02:24:08,869
You just are building up the design choices,

3714
02:24:08,869 --> 02:24:10,159
the set of features available,

3715
02:24:10,159 --> 02:24:11,329
what are the strengths and weaknesses,

3716
02:24:11,329 --> 02:24:12,829
all that kind of stuff.

3717
02:24:12,829 --> 02:24:15,139
And then you start building. That's really interesting.

3718
02:24:15,139 --> 02:24:16,639
Probably not the thing you would recommend

3719
02:24:16,639 --> 02:24:19,189
to a junior developer,

3720
02:24:19,189 --> 02:24:21,109
somebody who's just starting out at first.

3721
02:24:21,109 --> 02:24:23,036
- If you don't know what an if statement is,

3722
02:24:23,036 --> 02:24:23,869
that's not a good way to learn.

3723
02:24:23,869 --> 02:24:25,849
To me, the best way to learn then is

3724
02:24:25,849 --> 02:24:27,109
really hands on the keyboard

3725
02:24:27,109 --> 02:24:28,729
and building extremely simple things,

3726
02:24:28,729 --> 02:24:30,709
and slowly growing in complexity.

3727
02:24:30,709 --> 02:24:32,449
Because understanding what a class and methods

3728
02:24:32,449 --> 02:24:33,979
and instances versus the blueprint,

3729
02:24:33,979 --> 02:24:35,449
which is the class versus functions

3730
02:24:35,449 --> 02:24:38,061
versus modules versus all that stuff.

3731
02:24:38,061 --> 02:24:39,349
That just takes time to learn.

3732
02:24:39,349 --> 02:24:42,099
And so that's a completely different style of learning.

3733
02:24:43,039 --> 02:24:46,579
- I wonder because for me, learning right now,

3734
02:24:46,579 --> 02:24:50,209
AI is a huge help, but I already have a lot of experience.

3735
02:24:50,209 --> 02:24:52,579
I wonder, if you're starting from scratch,

3736
02:24:52,579 --> 02:24:53,599
whether that's a good idea.

3737
02:24:53,599 --> 02:24:55,609
But I still think it's probably a really good idea,

3738
02:24:55,609 --> 02:24:59,839
but basically generate some code using AI

3739
02:24:59,839 --> 02:25:02,839
and figure out what it's doing

3740
02:25:02,839 --> 02:25:04,439
by playing with different parts.

3741
02:25:05,389 --> 02:25:07,309
Maybe can you comment on that aspect,

3742
02:25:07,309 --> 02:25:12,079
like the use of AI as part of the learning process?

3743
02:25:12,079 --> 02:25:14,329
- This is where I have both the hopeful and the doomer take

3744
02:25:14,329 --> 02:25:15,929
at the exact same time. - Yeah.

3745
02:25:18,535 --> 02:25:21,139
- And it's the same thing with Google or Stack Overflow,

3746
02:25:21,139 --> 02:25:23,149
it's all the same kind of take,

3747
02:25:23,149 --> 02:25:26,089
which is it's just making things more democratized

3748
02:25:26,089 --> 02:25:27,289
in some sense.

3749
02:25:27,289 --> 02:25:28,909
I get to ask questions

3750
02:25:28,909 --> 02:25:31,279
in probably the most personal possible way

3751
02:25:31,279 --> 02:25:33,229
with my own voice, in my own words,

3752
02:25:33,229 --> 02:25:35,479
and it's able to produce out answers

3753
02:25:35,479 --> 02:25:37,189
and hopefully help guide me.

3754
02:25:37,189 --> 02:25:38,809
Now, regardless of just say the errors

3755
02:25:38,809 --> 02:25:42,019
and the incorrectness of it, ultimately just using it

3756
02:25:42,019 --> 02:25:45,979
as a learning tool and being able to just formulate

3757
02:25:45,979 --> 02:25:47,119
and read answers in your own voice,

3758
02:25:47,119 --> 02:25:48,649
I think is super powerful.

3759
02:25:48,649 --> 02:25:50,959
And I think it's super amazing.

3760
02:25:50,959 --> 02:25:55,699
But the part that I think is gonna be really difficult

3761
02:25:55,699 --> 02:25:58,769
is that we don't value

3762
02:25:59,719 --> 02:26:02,269
remembering things anymore as a society.

3763
02:26:02,269 --> 02:26:05,539
Since the internet came about, I can just look that up.

3764
02:26:05,539 --> 02:26:07,369
I can just look that up.

3765
02:26:07,369 --> 02:26:08,862
You don't need to memorize your times tables. Right?

3766
02:26:08,862 --> 02:26:11,509
You can just use a calculator. You can just do all that.

3767
02:26:11,509 --> 02:26:13,939
I remember I just was sitting on the airplane

3768
02:26:13,939 --> 02:26:16,669
and I watched someone do the world's most simple addition

3769
02:26:16,669 --> 02:26:18,679
and subtraction like 10 times on their phone.

3770
02:26:18,679 --> 02:26:20,889
And why are you not just...

3771
02:26:21,979 --> 02:26:22,812
You should already know,

3772
02:26:22,812 --> 02:26:23,806
you should be able to do these things.

3773
02:26:23,806 --> 02:26:26,719
And I realized that we kind of offload our brains, right?

3774
02:26:26,719 --> 02:26:28,129
Oh, I don't need to know these things

3775
02:26:28,129 --> 02:26:29,359
because I can look them up.

3776
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:31,639
And that's not a bad answer in some sense.

3777
02:26:31,639 --> 02:26:32,532
I can understand that.

3778
02:26:32,532 --> 02:26:35,269
I don't need them to remember every last thing,

3779
02:26:35,269 --> 02:26:36,799
but then it also makes me realize

3780
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:39,409
that you kind of develop this learned helplessness,

3781
02:26:39,409 --> 02:26:41,779
that a new error comes up.

3782
02:26:41,779 --> 02:26:43,089
I'll just ask the AI.

3783
02:26:43,089 --> 02:26:45,589
AI says, oh, okay, I got to fix this line. I fix the line.

3784
02:26:45,589 --> 02:26:46,639
You didn't actually learn anything.

3785
02:26:46,639 --> 02:26:48,229
You kind of just used it as a quick means

3786
02:26:48,229 --> 02:26:49,819
to get something out and move on.

3787
02:26:49,819 --> 02:26:52,369
And so you sacrifice knowledge for speed,

3788
02:26:52,369 --> 02:26:54,769
which is a great thing in some...

3789
02:26:54,769 --> 02:26:56,299
We have to make those trade-offs

3790
02:26:56,299 --> 02:26:57,919
all the time in engineering.

3791
02:26:57,919 --> 02:26:59,539
Sometimes you have to move fast

3792
02:26:59,539 --> 02:27:00,589
at the sacrifice of knowledge,

3793
02:27:00,589 --> 02:27:02,599
and I'm totally on board for that,

3794
02:27:02,599 --> 02:27:05,099
but I worry that what we'll create

3795
02:27:06,439 --> 02:27:09,139
is an entire generation of incompetent programmers

3796
02:27:09,139 --> 02:27:11,929
who can do some amount of things well,

3797
02:27:11,929 --> 02:27:14,449
but anything that is unique, bespoke,

3798
02:27:14,449 --> 02:27:17,029
or requires some extra like little elbow grease,

3799
02:27:17,029 --> 02:27:19,159
might become very difficult.

3800
02:27:19,159 --> 02:27:20,479
It might cause a whole chasm

3801
02:27:20,479 --> 02:27:23,359
where juniors remain juniors forever.

3802
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:25,339
And I don't want to see that. I want to see people grow.

3803
02:27:25,339 --> 02:27:28,069
I want to see people actually be able to take this

3804
02:27:28,069 --> 02:27:29,749
as a craftsmanship thing.

3805
02:27:29,749 --> 02:27:34,099
And so that's both my hope and my worry

3806
02:27:34,099 --> 02:27:36,949
is that AI think can do both really.

3807
02:27:36,949 --> 02:27:38,479
If you could ask whatever question you want

3808
02:27:38,479 --> 02:27:39,889
and you don't have to rely on, say, a book

3809
02:27:39,889 --> 02:27:41,029
to give you that exact answer.

3810
02:27:41,029 --> 02:27:42,259
And if the book just said it wrong

3811
02:27:42,259 --> 02:27:43,549
and you can't understand it, it's just like,

3812
02:27:43,549 --> 02:27:45,409
sorry, you don't get to learn what this is.

3813
02:27:45,409 --> 02:27:47,839
Like recursion for me, I spent way too much time

3814
02:27:47,839 --> 02:27:49,249
until someone gave me the right problem

3815
02:27:49,249 --> 02:27:50,479
to understand recursion.

3816
02:27:50,479 --> 02:27:52,219
You could imagine AI could have solved that for me

3817
02:27:52,219 --> 02:27:54,499
way faster because it could have gave me the right problem

3818
02:27:54,499 --> 02:27:56,719
and walked me through much better.

3819
02:27:56,719 --> 02:27:58,789
But what happened if I just always have recursion solved

3820
02:27:58,789 --> 02:28:00,739
by them and not actually learn it myself?

3821
02:28:00,739 --> 02:28:04,582
- So if I ask AI to generate code to do a certain thing,

3822
02:28:05,689 --> 02:28:08,089
actually a large percentage of time,

3823
02:28:08,089 --> 02:28:11,749
most of what AI generates is going to be correct for me,

3824
02:28:11,749 --> 02:28:16,749
but some percent of time it's not, fundamentally not.

3825
02:28:16,819 --> 02:28:19,099
And for me to recognize the difference between those two,

3826
02:28:19,099 --> 02:28:21,559
I think it takes a lot of experience.

3827
02:28:21,559 --> 02:28:24,586
I think to learn that skill of knowing,

3828
02:28:24,586 --> 02:28:29,509
no, no, no, a different new out of the box solution

3829
02:28:29,509 --> 02:28:31,369
is needed here than the one you're providing.

3830
02:28:31,369 --> 02:28:33,562
You're missing the point.

3831
02:28:35,119 --> 02:28:36,796
That's a skill, and how do you learn that?

3832
02:28:36,796 --> 02:28:39,199
You learn that by building from scratch.

3833
02:28:39,199 --> 02:28:41,929
So both are probably really necessary.

3834
02:28:41,929 --> 02:28:44,932
But I think as a first step of learning how to program,

3835
02:28:46,523 --> 02:28:48,289
it's pretty nice to generate a function,

3836
02:28:48,289 --> 02:28:50,389
to generate for loops and all that kind of stuff,

3837
02:28:50,389 --> 02:28:54,709
and then just fuck with the different lines and modify them

3838
02:28:54,709 --> 02:28:57,739
to try to adjust the behavior of the program,

3839
02:28:57,739 --> 02:29:01,969
and from the way the behavior of the program adjusts

3840
02:29:01,969 --> 02:29:04,609
or bugs are created, you learn about the syntax

3841
02:29:04,609 --> 02:29:08,119
of the language, the behavior of the language,

3842
02:29:08,119 --> 02:29:08,952
all that kind of stuff.

3843
02:29:08,952 --> 02:29:11,809
So I think it's a super powerful way to learn.

3844
02:29:11,809 --> 02:29:14,809
But yeah, you need to also write from scratch.

3845
02:29:14,809 --> 02:29:17,779
- At some point you have to take off the training wheels,

3846
02:29:17,779 --> 02:29:19,249
because I think what you're really spotting

3847
02:29:19,249 --> 02:29:21,889
is the difference between reading and writing code.

3848
02:29:21,889 --> 02:29:24,319
I can read a lot of languages very well.

3849
02:29:24,319 --> 02:29:25,459
I can see what's happening.

3850
02:29:25,459 --> 02:29:26,779
I can understand it,

3851
02:29:26,779 --> 02:29:28,969
but I would not be very good at writing it.

3852
02:29:28,969 --> 02:29:30,289
I can understand a lot of things about C++

3853
02:29:30,289 --> 02:29:32,599
and I can read it, but I'm just not that

3854
02:29:32,599 --> 02:29:34,459
because I just don't, I haven't done it in so long.

3855
02:29:34,459 --> 02:29:36,409
I can't remember where all the semicolons, and colons

3856
02:29:36,409 --> 02:29:39,379
and you do public and private,

3857
02:29:39,379 --> 02:29:41,239
and how should you do naming conventions?

3858
02:29:41,239 --> 02:29:43,549
All those things kind of add all together,

3859
02:29:43,549 --> 02:29:45,919
and then you're just like, oh, I'm really bad at writing it,

3860
02:29:45,919 --> 02:29:46,909
though I can read it.

3861
02:29:46,909 --> 02:29:50,689
And so there's a skill gap chasm

3862
02:29:50,689 --> 02:29:52,939
that exists between those two.

3863
02:29:52,939 --> 02:29:56,419
- All right. Well, let me talk about the various languages.

3864
02:29:56,419 --> 02:29:59,909
The cheesy, ridiculous question

3865
02:30:00,889 --> 02:30:03,262
of what's the best programming language?

3866
02:30:04,579 --> 02:30:06,079
Let's say, what's the best programming language

3867
02:30:06,079 --> 02:30:07,519
that everybody should learn?

3868
02:30:07,519 --> 02:30:09,979
Maybe let's go with the top five.

3869
02:30:09,979 --> 02:30:13,039
I'm gonna pull up the Stack Overflow developer survey,

3870
02:30:13,039 --> 02:30:13,879
because I think we have....

3871
02:30:13,879 --> 02:30:17,599
- Yeah, those are... - You don't like them?

3872
02:30:17,599 --> 02:30:19,969
- You gotta remember, because I mean, you're a data guy.

3873
02:30:19,969 --> 02:30:22,609
You know about biases and data.

3874
02:30:22,609 --> 02:30:25,249
What does Stack Overflow naturally bias towards?

3875
02:30:25,249 --> 02:30:26,599
- Well, they have the different slices

3876
02:30:26,599 --> 02:30:30,259
of professional developers, junior developers,

3877
02:30:30,259 --> 02:30:31,519
they have different slices.

3878
02:30:31,519 --> 02:30:32,856
Okay, what is the bias?

3879
02:30:32,856 --> 02:30:35,749
- I hear you, but who fills out a Stack Overflow survey?

3880
02:30:35,749 --> 02:30:37,669
Someone who participates on Stack Overflow.

3881
02:30:37,669 --> 02:30:39,799
Who's participating on Stack Overflow?

3882
02:30:39,799 --> 02:30:41,449
Largely very, very new people,

3883
02:30:41,449 --> 02:30:43,429
and that one guy that loves answering questions.

3884
02:30:43,429 --> 02:30:45,382
And so I'm not sure if Stack Overflow

3885
02:30:45,382 --> 02:30:47,199
is a great place to get data.

3886
02:30:47,199 --> 02:30:49,129
It could be a very biased set of data.

3887
02:30:49,129 --> 02:30:52,009
- Is it really only new people?

3888
02:30:52,009 --> 02:30:55,189
- I mean that's who's using Stack Overflow.

3889
02:30:55,189 --> 02:30:57,919
- All right. Most popular technologies.

3890
02:30:57,919 --> 02:30:59,359
On this...

3891
02:30:59,359 --> 02:31:02,209
- JavaScript, HTML, Python, SQL.

3892
02:31:02,209 --> 02:31:04,969
- SQL is the more general kind of...

3893
02:31:04,969 --> 02:31:07,229
I'm sure they're not doing the individual

3894
02:31:08,389 --> 02:31:09,806
sort of flavors of SQL.

3895
02:31:10,749 --> 02:31:12,709
By the way, pronounce SQL versus SQL?

3896
02:31:12,709 --> 02:31:14,126
- It's SQL.

3897
02:31:14,126 --> 02:31:15,292
- SQL? You SQL?

3898
02:31:15,292 --> 02:31:16,699
- SQL, I think is the correct way.

3899
02:31:16,699 --> 02:31:17,539
- SQL.

3900
02:31:17,539 --> 02:31:19,729
- I did SQL because I didn't know the audience.

3901
02:31:19,729 --> 02:31:21,619
I don't know if they can handle the truth,

3902
02:31:21,619 --> 02:31:22,519
which is its SQL

3903
02:31:22,519 --> 02:31:24,783
- The squeal of joy, squeal...

3904
02:31:24,783 --> 02:31:28,009
- SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL.

3905
02:31:28,009 --> 02:31:29,209
- By the way, I had a lot of joy

3906
02:31:29,209 --> 02:31:31,159
from earlier saying pig-fucker, for some reason.

3907
02:31:31,159 --> 02:31:32,820
- It's such a dig...

3908
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:34,477
I mean, can you believe - I had so fun to say-

3909
02:31:34,477 --> 02:31:35,579
- that was a real conversation that I had?

3910
02:31:35,579 --> 02:31:36,772
- Yeah, that was.

3911
02:31:37,999 --> 02:31:40,399
TypeScript, BAS,

3912
02:31:40,399 --> 02:31:42,241
Java, C Sharp, C++, C-PHP.

3913
02:31:42,241 --> 02:31:44,509
- It largely kind of aligns with the world you'd expect,

3914
02:31:44,509 --> 02:31:47,689
but Assembly, why is Assembly more popular than Ruby?

3915
02:31:47,689 --> 02:31:50,299
Who's writing just Assembly by...

3916
02:31:50,299 --> 02:31:51,679
No one writes Assembly by hand

3917
02:31:51,679 --> 02:31:55,399
other than maybe that one guy that's developing TLS 1.3

3918
02:31:55,399 --> 02:31:57,379
and hand rolling a cryptography algorithm

3919
02:31:57,379 --> 02:31:59,929
to be the fastest possible algorithm.

3920
02:31:59,929 --> 02:32:01,339
- Yeah. Assembly is a weird one.

3921
02:32:01,339 --> 02:32:04,039
Maybe people write it maybe in school,

3922
02:32:04,039 --> 02:32:06,049
but even in school now

3923
02:32:06,049 --> 02:32:09,349
for a operating systems course or something like that,

3924
02:32:09,349 --> 02:32:10,519
or system engineering.

3925
02:32:10,519 --> 02:32:12,889
I don't know if they write Assembly anymore.

3926
02:32:12,889 --> 02:32:15,589
I don't think so anyway.

3927
02:32:15,589 --> 02:32:18,589
- And Swift and Ruby being less popular than Assembly

3928
02:32:18,589 --> 02:32:20,239
seems ridiculous.

3929
02:32:20,239 --> 02:32:22,939
But nonetheless, okay, so you get my ideas behind that,

3930
02:32:22,939 --> 02:32:24,529
but as far as top five languages go,

3931
02:32:24,529 --> 02:32:25,489
that's probably too broad

3932
02:32:25,489 --> 02:32:27,079
because you could just name so many.

3933
02:32:27,079 --> 02:32:28,789
I think you should probably archetype it by

3934
02:32:28,789 --> 02:32:30,499
what do you want to do?

3935
02:32:30,499 --> 02:32:33,529
So if you want to get into game development,

3936
02:32:33,529 --> 02:32:37,369
perhaps C Sharp, C++ could be good choices.

3937
02:32:37,369 --> 02:32:40,219
Or JavaScript and doing Canvas games,

3938
02:32:40,219 --> 02:32:41,329
I could see that also working.

3939
02:32:41,329 --> 02:32:44,149
But you're limited by doing JavaScript obviously,

3940
02:32:44,149 --> 02:32:45,409
because you can't do as much

3941
02:32:45,409 --> 02:32:48,199
because the language is just not fast enough to do as much.

3942
02:32:48,199 --> 02:32:50,099
So it's like a good thing to remember.

3943
02:32:51,769 --> 02:32:53,749
If you're gonna be doing backend stuff,

3944
02:32:53,749 --> 02:32:56,599
if you want a job, if you're looking for a job,

3945
02:32:56,599 --> 02:33:00,409
maybe C Sharp slash Java, or JavaScript,

3946
02:33:00,409 --> 02:33:02,149
or Go would be great choices.

3947
02:33:02,149 --> 02:33:03,259
If you're looking to do embedded,

3948
02:33:03,259 --> 02:33:05,959
you probably want to do C, C++,

3949
02:33:05,959 --> 02:33:07,219
like that would probably be a good choice.

3950
02:33:07,219 --> 02:33:08,805
And so you kinda have to...

3951
02:33:08,805 --> 02:33:09,889
I think you have to first determine

3952
02:33:09,889 --> 02:33:11,359
what do you really want to get out.

3953
02:33:11,359 --> 02:33:12,679
- If you're just curious about programming,

3954
02:33:12,679 --> 02:33:14,959
which I talked to a lot of people who are,

3955
02:33:14,959 --> 02:33:16,309
yeah, you can consider jobs,

3956
02:33:16,309 --> 02:33:17,569
but basically their question is,

3957
02:33:17,569 --> 02:33:19,549
okay, what's the first language I should learn,

3958
02:33:19,549 --> 02:33:24,549
and maybe what are the several languages I should explore?

3959
02:33:25,309 --> 02:33:26,142
- Can I say something

3960
02:33:26,142 --> 02:33:27,019
that's gonna make a lot of people angry?

3961
02:33:27,019 --> 02:33:27,982
- Yeah, sure.

3962
02:33:27,982 --> 02:33:29,419
- I think the first language people should learn

3963
02:33:29,419 --> 02:33:32,359
if they have no idea about anything is JavaScript.

3964
02:33:32,359 --> 02:33:34,609
- Yeah. Why would that make people angry?

3965
02:33:34,609 --> 02:33:36,589
- Oh, because people just, first off,

3966
02:33:36,589 --> 02:33:38,539
I'm not supposed to say anything nice about JavaScript.

3967
02:33:38,539 --> 02:33:39,949
- Yeah, usually that's the meme,

3968
02:33:39,949 --> 02:33:41,179
that you hate JavaScript, right?

3969
02:33:41,179 --> 02:33:43,489
- Yeah. No, JavaScript's a beautiful language.

3970
02:33:43,489 --> 02:33:45,589
And it has a lot of things that are very great for it,

3971
02:33:45,589 --> 02:33:47,539
and one of them is that you can express anything

3972
02:33:47,539 --> 02:33:49,219
with very little effort.

3973
02:33:49,219 --> 02:33:52,579
And so someone that's new, I think it's really great

3974
02:33:52,579 --> 02:33:56,779
to be able to draw a box and move a box.

3975
02:33:56,779 --> 02:33:58,699
That's great. You get to see it visually.

3976
02:33:58,699 --> 02:33:59,899
I think that's one thing that's really great

3977
02:33:59,899 --> 02:34:01,819
about JavaScript is that you can do that.

3978
02:34:01,819 --> 02:34:04,032
Then you can go, okay, I want to learn about the backend.

3979
02:34:04,032 --> 02:34:05,419
I want to make a request now.

3980
02:34:05,419 --> 02:34:06,526
You can write a quick backend in it.

3981
02:34:06,526 --> 02:34:07,909
Now you're starting to get familiar

3982
02:34:07,909 --> 02:34:08,959
with programming a little bit.

3983
02:34:08,959 --> 02:34:10,609
I can save this to a database.

3984
02:34:10,609 --> 02:34:11,539
I can bring it down.

3985
02:34:11,539 --> 02:34:13,696
I can put it on a screen and I can animate it all around,

3986
02:34:13,696 --> 02:34:17,149
and I can even put it on a canvas and render it in 2D or 3D.

3987
02:34:17,149 --> 02:34:19,699
So it's like there's so much variety of what you can do

3988
02:34:19,699 --> 02:34:21,259
with JavaScript.

3989
02:34:21,259 --> 02:34:24,229
It's a great way to get introduced into programming.

3990
02:34:24,229 --> 02:34:25,519
But then at some point you have to go,

3991
02:34:25,519 --> 02:34:28,849
okay, I now need to learn more about this whole thing.

3992
02:34:28,849 --> 02:34:31,486
- I mean, yeah, just like you said, you can make games,

3993
02:34:31,486 --> 02:34:34,669
you can do front end, backend for web development.

3994
02:34:34,669 --> 02:34:35,719
- You can even do embedded.

3995
02:34:35,719 --> 02:34:36,649
They actually have...

3996
02:34:36,649 --> 02:34:40,429
Like there's Wes Bos is building his Roomba or something

3997
02:34:40,429 --> 02:34:42,769
and programming it with JavaScript and React,

3998
02:34:42,769 --> 02:34:44,809
which is just the world's worst language

3999
02:34:44,809 --> 02:34:47,059
to choose for embed, but you can still do it.

4000
02:34:48,289 --> 02:34:51,619
- Also, we mentioned sort of in terms of applications,

4001
02:34:51,619 --> 02:34:54,949
anything that relates to data or machine learning,

4002
02:34:54,949 --> 02:34:57,619
Python is the sort of the leader there,

4003
02:34:57,619 --> 02:34:58,452
so that's a great one.

4004
02:34:58,452 --> 02:35:01,399
- It seems like Python, CUDA stuff and C++

4005
02:35:01,399 --> 02:35:02,329
would be a dynamite in that,

4006
02:35:02,329 --> 02:35:04,400
because a lot of these Python libraries are assumed

4007
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:08,659
you're just smuggling in C++ underneath the hood or C.

4008
02:35:08,659 --> 02:35:11,839
- Okay, so JavaScript. I'll say Python.

4009
02:35:11,839 --> 02:35:13,849
- Python's a great one too. You can get quite far with it,

4010
02:35:13,849 --> 02:35:15,791
but you can't write the front end.

4011
02:35:15,791 --> 02:35:17,329
What happened if you love the front end?

4012
02:35:17,329 --> 02:35:19,699
What happened if you really just want to design things

4013
02:35:19,699 --> 02:35:21,379
and you just didn't know that?

4014
02:35:21,379 --> 02:35:23,779
- Well, it's okay. So for that, JavaScript.

4015
02:35:23,779 --> 02:35:24,709
- But Python's a good choice

4016
02:35:24,709 --> 02:35:25,879
because you can't do the ML stuff

4017
02:35:25,879 --> 02:35:27,199
in JavaScript nearly as easy.

4018
02:35:27,199 --> 02:35:30,619
- Do we count HTML and CSS as programming languages?

4019
02:35:30,619 --> 02:35:34,129
- I think there's some technical definition that it is.

4020
02:35:34,129 --> 02:35:37,279
If you use this certain amalgamation of CSS plus HTML,

4021
02:35:37,279 --> 02:35:40,279
it actually has, it can be a Turing complete language.

4022
02:35:40,279 --> 02:35:42,049
But I mean for practical purposes, no.

4023
02:35:42,049 --> 02:35:43,642
HTML is not a language.

4024
02:35:46,039 --> 02:35:48,259
For me, yes, the Turing test is a good one,

4025
02:35:48,259 --> 02:35:51,949
but for those that are just not wanting to be as academic,

4026
02:35:51,949 --> 02:35:54,079
if I can't write a function and an if statement,

4027
02:35:54,079 --> 02:35:55,939
I don't feel like that's...

4028
02:35:55,939 --> 02:35:57,889
If I can't loop, if, and function,

4029
02:35:57,889 --> 02:35:58,999
I don't feel like that's a good,

4030
02:35:58,999 --> 02:36:00,349
that's a programming language.

4031
02:36:00,349 --> 02:36:02,599
- Although modern HTML has a lot of features.

4032
02:36:02,599 --> 02:36:04,249
- It's crazy how much it has,

4033
02:36:04,249 --> 02:36:06,589
but it's more of a specification than anything else.

4034
02:36:06,589 --> 02:36:08,959
I specify it to be a pop-up.

4035
02:36:08,959 --> 02:36:11,779
I specify it to have this kind of accessibility,

4036
02:36:11,779 --> 02:36:12,682
this kind of look.

4037
02:36:14,329 --> 02:36:16,129
Under these conditions look like this,

4038
02:36:16,129 --> 02:36:17,912
transform like this, move down here.

4039
02:36:17,912 --> 02:36:18,745
- I don't know.

4040
02:36:18,745 --> 02:36:20,239
I kind of like these popular programming languages

4041
02:36:20,239 --> 02:36:21,072
in this list.

4042
02:36:21,072 --> 02:36:22,099
I like JavaScript.

4043
02:36:22,099 --> 02:36:23,659
- You like Bash?

4044
02:36:23,659 --> 02:36:25,699
- Oh, yeah. I like Bash a lot. Yeah. Why?

4045
02:36:25,699 --> 02:36:28,489
- Okay, Bash is kind of one of those ones where it's like,

4046
02:36:28,489 --> 02:36:30,199
do you really like it?

4047
02:36:30,199 --> 02:36:31,909
I like it up until I need an array.

4048
02:36:31,909 --> 02:36:34,159
- Oh, as a programming language, just no,

4049
02:36:34,159 --> 02:36:36,445
but I like the command line.

4050
02:36:36,445 --> 02:36:37,669
- Okay.

4051
02:36:37,669 --> 02:36:39,623
- Do you like Bash? No, nobody likes Bash.

4052
02:36:39,623 --> 02:36:42,019
(Lex and ThePrimeagen laugh)

4053
02:36:42,019 --> 02:36:42,852
Do you mean-

4054
02:36:42,852 --> 02:36:45,289
- Someone is so offended right now.

4055
02:36:45,289 --> 02:36:47,632
- It means do you use it a lot? Yes.

4056
02:36:49,279 --> 02:36:51,029
I mean, it's good to learn, right?

4057
02:36:51,029 --> 02:36:52,369
It is good to- - It is.

4058
02:36:52,369 --> 02:36:53,899
- Be comfortable in the command line

4059
02:36:53,899 --> 02:36:55,729
because it's a bit of a superpower.

4060
02:36:55,729 --> 02:36:59,329
It's like, I think I follow on Twitter, FFmpeg.

4061
02:36:59,329 --> 02:37:00,357
- Great account.

4062
02:37:00,357 --> 02:37:01,939
(Lex chuckles)

4063
02:37:01,939 --> 02:37:04,939
- There's certain Twitter accounts that are just legit.

4064
02:37:04,939 --> 02:37:08,869
And I think FFmpeg,

4065
02:37:08,869 --> 02:37:11,449
they have all these sort of parameters

4066
02:37:11,449 --> 02:37:13,279
that you can add on the command line,

4067
02:37:13,279 --> 02:37:15,800
that it's like one of those cryptic languages

4068
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:19,459
that only very few wizards understand.

4069
02:37:19,459 --> 02:37:21,046
But once you begin to slowly understand,

4070
02:37:21,046 --> 02:37:24,109
and I'm only at the very sort of beginning stage

4071
02:37:24,109 --> 02:37:25,879
of that journey to mastery,

4072
02:37:25,879 --> 02:37:28,803
the powers you gain at every step,

4073
02:37:28,803 --> 02:37:31,129
it grows exponentially, it feels like.

4074
02:37:31,129 --> 02:37:33,919
I mean, FFmpeg is just this incredible,

4075
02:37:33,919 --> 02:37:35,569
what would you call a library system?

4076
02:37:35,569 --> 02:37:38,329
There's just the people behind them

4077
02:37:38,329 --> 02:37:40,339
must be just brilliant masterminds

4078
02:37:40,339 --> 02:37:42,079
because they have to work with all these codecs,

4079
02:37:42,079 --> 02:37:43,819
with all these containers,

4080
02:37:43,819 --> 02:37:48,769
with all the mysteries of the media codec universe

4081
02:37:48,769 --> 02:37:50,269
they're masters of.

4082
02:37:50,269 --> 02:37:51,709
And they understand compression,

4083
02:37:51,709 --> 02:37:56,709
which is another super fascinating technical set of problems

4084
02:37:56,809 --> 02:38:00,769
that, I don't know, just FFmpeg just fills me with joy

4085
02:38:00,769 --> 02:38:01,602
that it exists.

4086
02:38:01,602 --> 02:38:04,159
But you need kind of Bash type comfort,

4087
02:38:04,159 --> 02:38:06,409
command line comfort, to work with it

4088
02:38:06,409 --> 02:38:08,989
to really unlock its power, yeah.

4089
02:38:08,989 --> 02:38:11,239
- I think FFmpeg is probably

4090
02:38:11,239 --> 02:38:14,599
one of the most consequential libraries of our day,

4091
02:38:14,599 --> 02:38:19,399
and the Twitter account is so unhinged.

4092
02:38:19,399 --> 02:38:21,109
It is the most amazing thing to see

4093
02:38:21,109 --> 02:38:24,589
because I think FFmpeg does not get the love it deserves.

4094
02:38:24,589 --> 02:38:26,209
Every single application, OBS,

4095
02:38:26,209 --> 02:38:28,009
probably FFmpeg underneath the hood.

4096
02:38:28,909 --> 02:38:30,859
Everything, FFmpeg underneath the hood,

4097
02:38:31,909 --> 02:38:34,999
and yet they do not get the love they deserve.

4098
02:38:34,999 --> 02:38:36,829
I just love it. I just think they're the best.

4099
02:38:36,829 --> 02:38:39,139
- Yeah, I would say JavaScript, HTML, CSS,

4100
02:38:39,139 --> 02:38:42,926
Python, SQL, I mean that is SQL,

4101
02:38:42,926 --> 02:38:45,072
SQL is a programming language.

4102
02:38:45,072 --> 02:38:49,219
It's an incredibly sophisticated programming language. Yeah?

4103
02:38:49,219 --> 02:38:50,362
- SQL is interesting.

4104
02:38:52,333 --> 02:38:54,019
I believe you can classify it as a programming language.

4105
02:38:54,019 --> 02:38:55,039
It does have, if.

4106
02:38:55,039 --> 02:38:55,999
You have case statements

4107
02:38:55,999 --> 02:38:57,623
and it's pretty crazy what you can do with it.

4108
02:38:57,623 --> 02:38:59,098
- You could do functions, you can do all that stuff.

4109
02:38:59,098 --> 02:39:00,989
You shouldn't. - Yeah, for stored procedures,

4110
02:39:00,989 --> 02:39:02,739
that's how you make your life hell.

4111
02:39:04,249 --> 02:39:08,809
I will say that all the top languages right there,

4112
02:39:08,809 --> 02:39:13,809
none of them are strict static typed languages.

4113
02:39:13,939 --> 02:39:17,089
And so even TypeScript, I don't like this any.

4114
02:39:17,089 --> 02:39:18,799
And so for people that are learning,

4115
02:39:18,799 --> 02:39:20,839
doing something that's much more strict would be great.

4116
02:39:20,839 --> 02:39:22,822
Something like Go, Rust,

4117
02:39:24,529 --> 02:39:26,569
I mean even C Sharp, C++.

4118
02:39:26,569 --> 02:39:29,389
Anything that kind of changes your perspective of types

4119
02:39:29,389 --> 02:39:31,579
I think is really helpful to kind of go through.

4120
02:39:31,579 --> 02:39:32,929
They're not getting nearly as much love

4121
02:39:32,929 --> 02:39:34,399
on this most popular language list,

4122
02:39:34,399 --> 02:39:35,899
but I think they're very fantastic.

4123
02:39:35,899 --> 02:39:38,239
- All right, well, if I put a gun to your head,

4124
02:39:38,239 --> 02:39:41,179
top five languages, let's list them out.

4125
02:39:41,179 --> 02:39:44,299
There's a bright-eyed 20-year-old asking you,

4126
02:39:44,299 --> 02:39:47,032
what are the top languages, five languages to learn?

4127
02:39:47,959 --> 02:39:50,029
- If I were to pick five languages

4128
02:39:50,029 --> 02:39:52,329
that I think people should learn, or at least,

4129
02:39:53,299 --> 02:39:54,529
let's restate it this way,

4130
02:39:54,529 --> 02:39:55,939
I'm gonna say a couple languages

4131
02:39:55,939 --> 02:39:58,849
and you should at least explore some of them.

4132
02:39:58,849 --> 02:40:01,819
I think you should explore a loosey language,

4133
02:40:01,819 --> 02:40:03,889
so Python slash JavaScript,

4134
02:40:03,889 --> 02:40:06,649
where there is truly only one type, which is a boxed value,

4135
02:40:06,649 --> 02:40:08,719
which is a multivariate, different types

4136
02:40:08,719 --> 02:40:09,709
underneath the hood.

4137
02:40:09,709 --> 02:40:11,042
- What did you call it? A loosey language?

4138
02:40:11,042 --> 02:40:12,232
- A loosey-goosey language.

4139
02:40:12,232 --> 02:40:14,599
It's a dynamic language,

4140
02:40:14,599 --> 02:40:16,849
and so I think it's really good to explore one of those too.

4141
02:40:16,849 --> 02:40:18,589
So I'd put Python or JavaScript right there.

4142
02:40:18,589 --> 02:40:20,389
Even Lua, throw Lua in the bunch.

4143
02:40:20,389 --> 02:40:22,789
I think you should explore a strict language,

4144
02:40:22,789 --> 02:40:25,492
so I'd do something like Rust, Go.

4145
02:40:26,719 --> 02:40:28,249
I think those are both really, really great.

4146
02:40:28,249 --> 02:40:29,329
- C++?

4147
02:40:29,329 --> 02:40:30,439
- You can do C++.

4148
02:40:30,439 --> 02:40:32,239
You can do some type erasure in C++.

4149
02:40:32,239 --> 02:40:34,416
You can do it with Go as well, but for the most part

4150
02:40:34,416 --> 02:40:36,857
it's a great language to do that in.

4151
02:40:36,857 --> 02:40:38,899
It can get a little wild. New C++ seems great.

4152
02:40:38,899 --> 02:40:41,569
Everyone keeps telling me new C++ is great.

4153
02:40:41,569 --> 02:40:43,189
It has every feature you've ever wanted

4154
02:40:43,189 --> 02:40:44,599
and all the features you don't want.

4155
02:40:44,599 --> 02:40:45,482
- Yeah, exactly.

4156
02:40:45,482 --> 02:40:48,109
I mean there's smart pointers, there's dumb pointers,

4157
02:40:48,109 --> 02:40:49,579
there's all kinds of pointers.

4158
02:40:49,579 --> 02:40:52,219
There's no memory leaks. That's not an issue.

4159
02:40:52,219 --> 02:40:53,959
- Foot guns, face guns, soft beds.

4160
02:40:53,959 --> 02:40:55,039
There's everything in there.

4161
02:40:55,039 --> 02:40:56,719
- Unless you like memory leaks,

4162
02:40:56,719 --> 02:40:59,175
it has that too if you want that kind of thing. It's great.

4163
02:40:59,175 --> 02:41:00,008
- Okay. How about this one?

4164
02:41:00,008 --> 02:41:03,739
Languages that I actually want to really learn,

4165
02:41:03,739 --> 02:41:06,199
that at least sit in my curiosity bank.

4166
02:41:06,199 --> 02:41:07,789
There's three languages,

4167
02:41:07,789 --> 02:41:12,769
which is going to be Swift, Elixir, OCaml,

4168
02:41:12,769 --> 02:41:13,849
and then I'm going to throw Odin in there,

4169
02:41:13,849 --> 02:41:16,309
just because Ginger Bill is great.

4170
02:41:16,309 --> 02:41:17,899
But Elixir and OCaml,

4171
02:41:17,899 --> 02:41:19,879
I don't have a strong functional language

4172
02:41:19,879 --> 02:41:21,199
underneath my belt.

4173
02:41:21,199 --> 02:41:22,939
That's something that I just genuinely lack.

4174
02:41:22,939 --> 02:41:25,219
- Yeah, I've heard incredible things about Elixir,

4175
02:41:25,219 --> 02:41:27,199
about Odin, about OCaml.

4176
02:41:27,199 --> 02:41:30,619
Obviously, I'm a person, as you know, who loves Lisp.

4177
02:41:30,619 --> 02:41:31,489
- [ThePrimeagen] I have never done Lisp.

4178
02:41:31,489 --> 02:41:34,519
Lisp could be in that category too, just, or Closure

4179
02:41:34,519 --> 02:41:36,679
I think at this point is what everyone tells you to use.

4180
02:41:36,679 --> 02:41:38,866
- So in the case of Lisp,

4181
02:41:38,866 --> 02:41:40,219
I don't want to speak negatively about Lisp,

4182
02:41:40,219 --> 02:41:42,649
but it's important about modern community,

4183
02:41:42,649 --> 02:41:44,419
what the community looks like.

4184
02:41:44,419 --> 02:41:46,879
It seems like there's an excited, maybe small,

4185
02:41:46,879 --> 02:41:49,899
but an excited community around Elixir, Odin, and OCaml,

4186
02:41:49,899 --> 02:41:51,443
so that helps.

4187
02:41:51,443 --> 02:41:53,959
Because then you can post shit on Twitter that you're like,

4188
02:41:53,959 --> 02:41:55,339
I accomplished this.

4189
02:41:55,339 --> 02:41:57,979
People get excited and it's nice. It's a good feeling.

4190
02:41:57,979 --> 02:41:59,299
- You can post something on Twitter

4191
02:41:59,299 --> 02:42:00,739
and you'll get a thousand likes

4192
02:42:00,739 --> 02:42:02,869
if you do something cool on Elixir,

4193
02:42:02,869 --> 02:42:05,809
which is that's a pretty big amount of people

4194
02:42:05,809 --> 02:42:08,629
to like a post for such a niche topic.

4195
02:42:08,629 --> 02:42:10,429
Programming's already a pretty small topic.

4196
02:42:10,429 --> 02:42:11,509
Then you get into functional program.

4197
02:42:11,509 --> 02:42:14,509
That's a small topic in a small topic.

4198
02:42:14,509 --> 02:42:15,799
- Yeah. I don't get that much.

4199
02:42:15,799 --> 02:42:17,419
If I post something about Emacs,

4200
02:42:17,419 --> 02:42:19,309
I'll get crickets if I post something about...

4201
02:42:19,309 --> 02:42:22,249
If I proudly use Neovim,

4202
02:42:22,249 --> 02:42:24,589
there'd be a lot of people like, good job.

4203
02:42:24,589 --> 02:42:26,779
- Because it is the best editor.

4204
02:42:26,779 --> 02:42:28,309
- Yeah, maybe it's just hype.

4205
02:42:28,309 --> 02:42:30,649
- Come back to the Civil War, Lex.

4206
02:42:30,649 --> 02:42:32,389
- Yeah, sometimes you have to sacrifice

4207
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:35,899
and go from the superior editor that is Emacs

4208
02:42:35,899 --> 02:42:38,569
and choose Neovim just to be popular.

4209
02:42:38,569 --> 02:42:40,489
You sacrifice integrity and values

4210
02:42:40,489 --> 02:42:42,683
and quality for just popularity.

4211
02:42:42,683 --> 02:42:44,273
It's a choice you made. - Absolutely.

4212
02:42:44,273 --> 02:42:45,362
I love how you put it.

4213
02:42:45,362 --> 02:42:48,061
- Okay. Anyway, what were we talking about?

4214
02:42:48,061 --> 02:42:50,509
I like how you're doing this in bunches. That's great.

4215
02:42:50,509 --> 02:42:53,059
- Right now, my kind of side honeys

4216
02:42:53,059 --> 02:42:54,769
that I'm exploring- - Side honey?

4217
02:42:54,769 --> 02:42:56,839
- Yeah, side honeys. They're not my mainstay.

4218
02:42:56,839 --> 02:42:58,969
Right now Go's kind of my favorite one

4219
02:42:58,969 --> 02:43:00,799
to build a web app in.

4220
02:43:00,799 --> 02:43:02,149
If I'm gonna build some sort of backend

4221
02:43:02,149 --> 02:43:05,719
with a lot of complicated logic, Go's just so convenient.

4222
02:43:05,719 --> 02:43:07,519
But I get really frustrated with its ability

4223
02:43:07,519 --> 02:43:09,919
to express everything that I need.

4224
02:43:09,919 --> 02:43:11,702
If you have a list, a heterogeneous list,

4225
02:43:11,702 --> 02:43:13,462
a list that contains two types,

4226
02:43:14,569 --> 02:43:16,639
Go's just really not that fun to use.

4227
02:43:16,639 --> 02:43:21,589
And I could see, so the ones I'm exploring is Jai or J,

4228
02:43:21,589 --> 02:43:25,789
or the language as Jonathan Blow says, and Zig.

4229
02:43:25,789 --> 02:43:27,529
And both of them have a lot of power to them.

4230
02:43:27,529 --> 02:43:28,879
They're both very interesting.

4231
02:43:28,879 --> 02:43:30,829
They definitely have foot guns in them.

4232
02:43:30,829 --> 02:43:34,669
They're definitely more, they don't take it easy on you.

4233
02:43:34,669 --> 02:43:37,519
Zig seems like it's a really amazing language,

4234
02:43:37,519 --> 02:43:38,539
and so does Jai.

4235
02:43:38,539 --> 02:43:39,949
They're both very cool.

4236
02:43:39,949 --> 02:43:44,419
- Yeah. Actually, I saw Dave Plummer's testing of close

4237
02:43:44,419 --> 02:43:47,749
to 100 languages for speed, and Zig came out on top.

4238
02:43:47,749 --> 02:43:49,006
- Yeah. That was a mistake.

4239
02:43:49,006 --> 02:43:51,169
I mean, when I say mistake, nothing against Dave Plummer.

4240
02:43:51,169 --> 02:43:53,119
He's an extremely talented engineer.

4241
02:43:53,119 --> 02:43:56,149
It's just that Zig, C, C++,

4242
02:43:56,149 --> 02:43:57,679
all those languages that were being tested,

4243
02:43:57,679 --> 02:43:59,269
they're all LLVM backends, right?

4244
02:43:59,269 --> 02:44:01,219
That's the one that actually turns the thing

4245
02:44:01,219 --> 02:44:02,899
into the executable part.

4246
02:44:02,899 --> 02:44:04,249
And if there's a variation in speed,

4247
02:44:04,249 --> 02:44:06,619
it just means in one language you didn't quite express

4248
02:44:06,619 --> 02:44:09,319
what you are supposed to correctly.

4249
02:44:09,319 --> 02:44:10,639
There's the language ball test

4250
02:44:10,639 --> 02:44:12,319
that's been bouncing around on Twitter.

4251
02:44:12,319 --> 02:44:14,569
Zig was like sixth or seventh below

4252
02:44:14,569 --> 02:44:16,729
I forget what language it is.

4253
02:44:16,729 --> 02:44:18,109
I played around with the example,

4254
02:44:18,109 --> 02:44:21,649
added the word "no alias" to the argument,

4255
02:44:21,649 --> 02:44:23,839
which means that the piece of memory

4256
02:44:23,839 --> 02:44:24,949
that's coming into this function,

4257
02:44:24,949 --> 02:44:26,959
there's no global pointers, there's nothing to it,

4258
02:44:26,959 --> 02:44:27,949
and so the compiler can make

4259
02:44:27,949 --> 02:44:30,559
these really cool optimizations.

4260
02:44:30,559 --> 02:44:32,692
And I made it faster than the C version.

4261
02:44:33,559 --> 02:44:36,079
So it just means that it's just not correctly specified

4262
02:44:36,079 --> 02:44:37,219
is all that means.

4263
02:44:37,219 --> 02:44:39,019
- Yeah, but it's still exciting.

4264
02:44:39,019 --> 02:44:41,239
To me, the competition between Zig, Rust,

4265
02:44:41,239 --> 02:44:44,119
and C++ is really interesting.

4266
02:44:44,119 --> 02:44:45,409
Part of it's for speed.

4267
02:44:45,409 --> 02:44:48,169
Part of it's how easy it is to write performant code.

4268
02:44:48,169 --> 02:44:49,069
- I'll say something that's...

4269
02:44:49,069 --> 02:44:50,989
The reason why I think Zig is so interesting

4270
02:44:50,989 --> 02:44:53,509
comparatively to say C or Rust.

4271
02:44:53,509 --> 02:44:55,159
C is the ultimate language.

4272
02:44:55,159 --> 02:44:57,589
It can do anything, you have pre-process or macros.

4273
02:44:57,589 --> 02:44:59,029
You can do quite a bit with it,

4274
02:44:59,029 --> 02:45:01,249
but it's also really difficult.

4275
02:45:01,249 --> 02:45:03,079
And it's also really simple and you can learn it.

4276
02:45:03,079 --> 02:45:04,819
So it's kind of its own unique beast.

4277
02:45:04,819 --> 02:45:07,639
And when you get really good at C, C is a magical language

4278
02:45:07,639 --> 02:45:09,709
and people are really great at it

4279
02:45:09,709 --> 02:45:11,449
and people speak very highly of it.

4280
02:45:11,449 --> 02:45:13,399
Rust is like this ultra safe language.

4281
02:45:13,399 --> 02:45:15,559
What you can do in C, you just can't even express in Rust.

4282
02:45:15,559 --> 02:45:18,349
Rust is gonna be the safe man that holds you at night,

4283
02:45:18,349 --> 02:45:19,189
keeping you warm, right?

4284
02:45:19,189 --> 02:45:20,929
It's gonna be just the greatest.

4285
02:45:20,929 --> 02:45:23,689
But somewhere in the middle lies Zig. Zig has optionals.

4286
02:45:23,689 --> 02:45:24,522
If you're not familiar with optionals,

4287
02:45:24,522 --> 02:45:27,769
that just simply means there's a value here or there's not,

4288
02:45:27,769 --> 02:45:30,289
but you first have to check that before you can use it.

4289
02:45:30,289 --> 02:45:31,969
So it prevents that whole null pointer

4290
02:45:31,969 --> 02:45:33,649
dereferencing segfault problem.

4291
02:45:33,649 --> 02:45:36,409
And that's not available in C, just by default,

4292
02:45:36,409 --> 02:45:37,939
you have to kind of build that thing in.

4293
02:45:37,939 --> 02:45:40,939
It is the only option in Rust,

4294
02:45:40,939 --> 02:45:42,619
but Zig says, "Hey, if you have a pointer,

4295
02:45:42,619 --> 02:45:43,879
you can't express it as null

4296
02:45:43,879 --> 02:45:45,559
unless if you market that it can be null."

4297
02:45:45,559 --> 02:45:47,599
There's ways around it, there's other types of pointers

4298
02:45:47,599 --> 02:45:49,159
and stuff like that that can do that.

4299
02:45:49,159 --> 02:45:49,999
But for the most part,

4300
02:45:49,999 --> 02:45:53,389
Zig will give you safety for the most part.

4301
02:45:53,389 --> 02:45:55,789
So it's like a little bit of safety, but more like C.

4302
02:45:55,789 --> 02:45:58,969
So it kind of gives you everything you want in that region

4303
02:45:58,969 --> 02:46:01,549
where you can express safe code and unsafe code.

4304
02:46:01,549 --> 02:46:05,119
It's very easy to write. It's very pretty.

4305
02:46:05,119 --> 02:46:07,069
Or at least the idea behind it is very pretty.

4306
02:46:07,069 --> 02:46:09,139
The language itself is bland, but.

4307
02:46:09,139 --> 02:46:10,639
- Wow, there's beauty in everything-

4308
02:46:10,639 --> 02:46:12,259
- Yeah. - Prime.

4309
02:46:12,259 --> 02:46:15,049
You've programmed in Rust a lot.

4310
02:46:15,049 --> 02:46:16,549
What do you love about Rust?

4311
02:46:16,549 --> 02:46:18,289
What are the strengths? What are the weaknesses?

4312
02:46:18,289 --> 02:46:20,689
Maybe you can speak about memory management

4313
02:46:20,689 --> 02:46:22,039
that you already mentioned,

4314
02:46:22,039 --> 02:46:23,629
the challenge of memory management

4315
02:46:23,629 --> 02:46:26,239
that several of these languages address,

4316
02:46:26,239 --> 02:46:28,159
but yeah, what do you love about Rust?

4317
02:46:28,159 --> 02:46:29,719
- What I love about Rust,

4318
02:46:29,719 --> 02:46:34,069
I love the ability to free the memory

4319
02:46:34,069 --> 02:46:36,799
that you're using is directly tied to the stack.

4320
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:39,979
So whenever you create something, there's a stack variable

4321
02:46:39,979 --> 02:46:41,719
or there's some amount of stack memory,

4322
02:46:41,719 --> 02:46:43,849
whether it's a pointer off to the heap,

4323
02:46:43,849 --> 02:46:45,169
a pointer and a length.

4324
02:46:45,169 --> 02:46:47,239
So some amount of memory on the stack

4325
02:46:47,239 --> 02:46:48,679
and then some memory on the heap

4326
02:46:48,679 --> 02:46:51,289
because a string is not all on the stack,

4327
02:46:51,289 --> 02:46:52,999
it's some on the heap, some on the stack.

4328
02:46:52,999 --> 02:46:55,669
And when that stack variable goes out of scope

4329
02:46:55,669 --> 02:46:58,969
and gets cleaned up, it also cleans up what's on the heap.

4330
02:46:58,969 --> 02:47:01,519
So it kind of simplifies this whole idea of,

4331
02:47:01,519 --> 02:47:03,259
whoops, I forgot to free my memory.

4332
02:47:03,259 --> 02:47:04,429
It just does it for you.

4333
02:47:04,429 --> 02:47:05,899
- So it's not a garbage collector,

4334
02:47:05,899 --> 02:47:07,549
which will do it sometime later.

4335
02:47:07,549 --> 02:47:10,429
It's not like C where you have to call it yourself,

4336
02:47:10,429 --> 02:47:11,809
it's somewhere in between.

4337
02:47:11,809 --> 02:47:14,119
Now, there's a lot of strategies people use,

4338
02:47:14,119 --> 02:47:16,969
arenas and all that that make that C part much easier.

4339
02:47:16,969 --> 02:47:18,049
I'm just not even mentioning it,

4340
02:47:18,049 --> 02:47:19,789
but it just makes it a lot easier.

4341
02:47:19,789 --> 02:47:21,679
But Rust does that really beautifully

4342
02:47:21,679 --> 02:47:24,709
and it's just like a really cool idea about it

4343
02:47:24,709 --> 02:47:25,819
and I really like that.

4344
02:47:25,819 --> 02:47:27,919
And the second thing that I think Rust does really,

4345
02:47:27,919 --> 02:47:32,919
is such a good thing is that mutability of something

4346
02:47:33,019 --> 02:47:35,869
is you have to specify it.

4347
02:47:35,869 --> 02:47:38,839
So you don't just create a variable and then mutate it.

4348
02:47:38,839 --> 02:47:40,459
You have to say this is not only a variable,

4349
02:47:40,459 --> 02:47:41,689
it's a mutable variable.

4350
02:47:41,689 --> 02:47:44,149
And I think that just makes code really readable

4351
02:47:44,149 --> 02:47:45,559
and really understandable.

4352
02:47:45,559 --> 02:47:46,759
Because anything that does not have

4353
02:47:46,759 --> 02:47:48,049
the word mute next to it,

4354
02:47:48,049 --> 02:47:49,912
you know for a fact it cannot change.

4355
02:47:52,069 --> 02:47:53,089
There's some rules around that,

4356
02:47:53,089 --> 02:47:54,049
but you get the general idea.

4357
02:47:54,049 --> 02:47:54,919
- Unlike most programming languages,

4358
02:47:54,919 --> 02:47:56,869
you have to explicitly state

4359
02:47:56,869 --> 02:47:59,745
that this is going to be changed.

4360
02:47:59,745 --> 02:48:00,578
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.

4361
02:48:00,578 --> 02:48:01,411
- Yeah. That's really interesting.

4362
02:48:01,411 --> 02:48:03,979
I mean it's safe, it's trying to be,

4363
02:48:03,979 --> 02:48:08,979
and the safety might be, create limitations.

4364
02:48:08,989 --> 02:48:12,379
Let us consult the AI overlords.

4365
02:48:12,379 --> 02:48:14,539
Rust is a blazing fast memory efficient systems

4366
02:48:14,539 --> 02:48:16,969
programming language that emphasizes performance,

4367
02:48:16,969 --> 02:48:18,952
type safety and concurrency.

4368
02:48:22,219 --> 02:48:23,839
The language enforces memory safety

4369
02:48:23,839 --> 02:48:26,299
without using a garbage collector, as you said,

4370
02:48:26,299 --> 02:48:29,329
instead utilizing the unique, quote, "borrow checker"

4371
02:48:29,329 --> 02:48:33,259
that tracks object lifetimes at compile time.

4372
02:48:33,259 --> 02:48:36,649
This prevents common programming errors like null point

4373
02:48:36,649 --> 02:48:39,292
or dereferencing and memory leaks and so on, yeah.

4374
02:48:40,489 --> 02:48:43,429
So you've also spoken about metaprogramming.

4375
02:48:43,429 --> 02:48:44,959
Which of these languages do you like

4376
02:48:44,959 --> 02:48:46,309
for the metaprogramming?

4377
02:48:46,309 --> 02:48:49,759
I love metaprogramming in C++, but it's a giant mess.

4378
02:48:49,759 --> 02:48:54,019
At least when I program C++ 17 standard, I believe,

4379
02:48:54,019 --> 02:48:57,229
it's just a mess, especially a mess to debug.

4380
02:48:57,229 --> 02:48:58,999
- Yeah, I would consider myself

4381
02:48:58,999 --> 02:49:00,799
kind of a metaprogramming newbie.

4382
02:49:00,799 --> 02:49:03,349
I have only solved some amount of problems with it.

4383
02:49:04,309 --> 02:49:05,526
That's kind of like what this year is for,

4384
02:49:05,526 --> 02:49:07,609
is for me to really, I want to see

4385
02:49:07,609 --> 02:49:09,049
where the ends can go in that.

4386
02:49:09,049 --> 02:49:11,569
So I don't have a strong opinion on this one.

4387
02:49:11,569 --> 02:49:13,789
Zig, one thing I really like about Zig

4388
02:49:13,789 --> 02:49:17,089
is that the metaprogramming is also the language itself.

4389
02:49:17,089 --> 02:49:19,939
So you don't have to, there's not an alternative.

4390
02:49:19,939 --> 02:49:21,679
So with Rust there's an alternative.

4391
02:49:21,679 --> 02:49:24,619
When you create a macro, you have to do the macro syntax.

4392
02:49:24,619 --> 02:49:26,086
With Zig, it's just, it is the thing,

4393
02:49:26,086 --> 02:49:28,099
you just program it and you add the word comp time

4394
02:49:28,099 --> 02:49:30,199
if you want it to be a compile time only.

4395
02:49:30,199 --> 02:49:34,579
So you can create the list of prime numbers

4396
02:49:34,579 --> 02:49:35,869
at compile time in Zig,

4397
02:49:35,869 --> 02:49:38,539
which is kind of an interesting, unique thing.

4398
02:49:38,539 --> 02:49:40,219
So you have code that executes at compile time

4399
02:49:40,219 --> 02:49:41,359
and then you can take advantage

4400
02:49:41,359 --> 02:49:43,549
of the result of it at runtime.

4401
02:49:43,549 --> 02:49:45,409
So neat, right?

4402
02:49:45,409 --> 02:49:47,389
That's how I'd look at it.

4403
02:49:47,389 --> 02:49:49,459
But again, I haven't used it to the point

4404
02:49:49,459 --> 02:49:52,759
where I feel like I can super authoritatively talk about it.

4405
02:49:52,759 --> 02:49:54,289
- You have been undecided,

4406
02:49:54,289 --> 02:49:56,719
what language are you going for this year?

4407
02:49:56,719 --> 02:49:58,969
- I'm gonna keep Go as my mainstay,

4408
02:49:58,969 --> 02:50:01,159
my two side honeys, Jai and Zig.

4409
02:50:01,159 --> 02:50:04,939
I'm going to explore and try to build out a service in them

4410
02:50:04,939 --> 02:50:07,487
that can do a bunch of talking to, say, ChatGPT

4411
02:50:07,487 --> 02:50:09,769
and ElevenLabs and send stuff down to client

4412
02:50:09,769 --> 02:50:10,969
and work with web sockets.

4413
02:50:10,969 --> 02:50:13,909
And I want to make sure that, I just want to see

4414
02:50:13,909 --> 02:50:15,469
how do they perform in this realm.

4415
02:50:15,469 --> 02:50:17,239
And I may be using the language incorrectly,

4416
02:50:17,239 --> 02:50:20,749
like Jai, it's not really been designed for the web world.

4417
02:50:20,749 --> 02:50:24,229
I just got done writing the ability to read Twitch Chat

4418
02:50:24,229 --> 02:50:26,179
and it required me to do Berkeley sockets.

4419
02:50:26,179 --> 02:50:28,129
So if you're unfamiliar with Berkeley sockets,

4420
02:50:28,129 --> 02:50:30,859
it's like the old way of doing it, it's how you do it in C.

4421
02:50:30,859 --> 02:50:32,929
So you have to kind of go through the whole nine yards

4422
02:50:32,929 --> 02:50:34,979
of creating your own connection.

4423
02:50:34,979 --> 02:50:36,619
I had to create my own connection,

4424
02:50:36,619 --> 02:50:38,149
I have to read from the socket,

4425
02:50:38,149 --> 02:50:40,002
then I have to parse out all the IRC, right?

4426
02:50:40,002 --> 02:50:41,509
You have to kind of build it from scratch.

4427
02:50:41,509 --> 02:50:44,389
There's not like a new TCP connection to this server.

4428
02:50:44,389 --> 02:50:45,859
You have to be like, "I'm creating a socket."

4429
02:50:45,859 --> 02:50:48,409
You're gonna be of the IPv4 family

4430
02:50:48,409 --> 02:50:50,809
and TCP and you're gonna do, you know,

4431
02:50:50,809 --> 02:50:52,309
I'm gonna now have to take your address

4432
02:50:52,309 --> 02:50:54,676
and go look up your address with DNS, get that address back

4433
02:50:54,676 --> 02:50:56,299
and then connect to a TCP.

4434
02:50:56,299 --> 02:50:58,069
So it's a lot more manual still.

4435
02:50:58,069 --> 02:51:00,589
It's a lot more raw in that area, but it's fun.

4436
02:51:00,589 --> 02:51:03,529
- What are some epic projects you've built on stream

4437
02:51:03,529 --> 02:51:05,599
that jump to memory?

4438
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:07,099
- My most favorite...

4439
02:51:07,099 --> 02:51:07,969
Sorry for interrupting you.

4440
02:51:07,969 --> 02:51:10,849
So I'm really jazzed right now.

4441
02:51:10,849 --> 02:51:11,682
- Let's go.

4442
02:51:11,682 --> 02:51:12,739
- Okay. So jazzed.

4443
02:51:12,739 --> 02:51:13,999
- Jazz hands.

4444
02:51:13,999 --> 02:51:17,182
- My most favorite project was the one I did last year.

4445
02:51:18,769 --> 02:51:21,079
Someone built a Doom ASCII port.

4446
02:51:21,079 --> 02:51:23,539
So you could play Doom with ASCII.

4447
02:51:23,539 --> 02:51:25,579
So that means you could play it in your terminal.

4448
02:51:25,579 --> 02:51:27,619
Very, very fun, very excite.

4449
02:51:27,619 --> 02:51:31,639
So I made a Go program that could spawn out the Doom ASCII,

4450
02:51:31,639 --> 02:51:34,459
then I took that Doom ASCII and I sent it to the browser

4451
02:51:34,459 --> 02:51:37,339
so that people could play Doom ASCII in the browser,

4452
02:51:37,339 --> 02:51:39,379
but then I made it so that Twitch chat

4453
02:51:39,379 --> 02:51:42,589
could control that instance of Doom ASCII

4454
02:51:42,589 --> 02:51:44,029
by piping in Twitch chat,

4455
02:51:44,029 --> 02:51:46,249
taking the average of the movements over so much time

4456
02:51:46,249 --> 02:51:48,739
and replaying it as if it was a controller.

4457
02:51:48,739 --> 02:51:52,729
And I had Twitch chat beat level one by spamming it.

4458
02:51:52,729 --> 02:51:53,659
But the fun part was

4459
02:51:53,659 --> 02:51:55,579
I used a bunch of fun encoding techniques.

4460
02:51:55,579 --> 02:51:58,459
I used quad trees to be able to take smaller amounts

4461
02:51:58,459 --> 02:51:59,989
to use run length in coding.

4462
02:51:59,989 --> 02:52:02,419
Tried to create my own compression algorithm

4463
02:52:02,419 --> 02:52:05,479
because if you're sending out a bunch of ASCII stuff,

4464
02:52:05,479 --> 02:52:06,439
it's still pretty expensive

4465
02:52:06,439 --> 02:52:09,319
because you have to represent color, color's not cheap.

4466
02:52:09,319 --> 02:52:10,616
On top of it you have to represent what does it look like?

4467
02:52:10,616 --> 02:52:12,769
What does the ASCII look like?

4468
02:52:12,769 --> 02:52:15,139
Well, I realized there's all these fun techniques you can do

4469
02:52:15,139 --> 02:52:18,569
for compression like the shape of the ASCII you send down

4470
02:52:20,389 --> 02:52:22,789
in a lot of these engines are actually just proportional

4471
02:52:22,789 --> 02:52:24,859
to the lumosity of that pixel.

4472
02:52:24,859 --> 02:52:27,139
So you'd use an eight to represent

4473
02:52:27,139 --> 02:52:29,389
or a pound sign to represent white,

4474
02:52:29,389 --> 02:52:31,819
but black, you're gonna want to do a period

4475
02:52:31,819 --> 02:52:33,859
or a comma or a bar, something smaller.

4476
02:52:33,859 --> 02:52:35,989
So it's like I then developed all these

4477
02:52:35,989 --> 02:52:38,299
different compression algorithms that turn a bunch of data,

4478
02:52:38,299 --> 02:52:40,852
which would take, I forget how much it would take.

4479
02:52:40,852 --> 02:52:42,798
It'd take gigabytes upon gigabytes

4480
02:52:42,798 --> 02:52:44,299
to be able to send out to thousands of people

4481
02:52:44,299 --> 02:52:46,009
to all see the same image at the same time,

4482
02:52:46,009 --> 02:52:48,199
to all be able to interact with Doom at the same time.

4483
02:52:48,199 --> 02:52:51,139
I turned it from gigabytes into kilobytes

4484
02:52:51,139 --> 02:52:52,099
by just trying to figure out

4485
02:52:52,099 --> 02:52:54,499
how to make it as small as possible and send it all out.

4486
02:52:54,499 --> 02:52:57,259
It was super fun. Absolutely had a great time.

4487
02:52:57,259 --> 02:52:59,989
- So you're actually sending it to all the people in chat.

4488
02:52:59,989 --> 02:53:03,019
So where's that pipeline,

4489
02:53:03,019 --> 02:53:06,379
how chat is able to control the Doom thing?

4490
02:53:06,379 --> 02:53:07,579
- Twitch chat.

4491
02:53:07,579 --> 02:53:11,179
Yeah, so they would go, people would spam W

4492
02:53:11,179 --> 02:53:15,019
and if you said W, it would hold down W for 150 milliseconds

4493
02:53:15,019 --> 02:53:18,499
if the majority of people during that time period said W.

4494
02:53:18,499 --> 02:53:19,699
- Nice. Okay.

4495
02:53:19,699 --> 02:53:21,859
And how are they getting the input

4496
02:53:21,859 --> 02:53:23,359
of where you are on screen?

4497
02:53:23,359 --> 02:53:25,969
- So originally I was gonna send that through Twitch,

4498
02:53:25,969 --> 02:53:27,919
but Twitch is like five seconds behind,

4499
02:53:27,919 --> 02:53:29,869
so that's why I piped it out to a website

4500
02:53:29,869 --> 02:53:31,579
- Ahhh. - so everybody could see

4501
02:53:31,579 --> 02:53:33,559
from my computer to the website

4502
02:53:33,559 --> 02:53:37,099
and typical lag was right around 70 milliseconds.

4503
02:53:37,099 --> 02:53:39,829
So it's like they could mostly see what was happening

4504
02:53:39,829 --> 02:53:40,939
in that short period of time.

4505
02:53:40,939 --> 02:53:42,349
It was pretty exciting.

4506
02:53:42,349 --> 02:53:43,639
So we had 1,000 people,

4507
02:53:43,639 --> 02:53:46,699
or I had somewhere between 1,000 to 1,400 people

4508
02:53:46,699 --> 02:53:49,759
smashing Ws and pressing F to fire and turning

4509
02:53:49,759 --> 02:53:51,469
and we killed some zombies.

4510
02:53:51,469 --> 02:53:53,389
We blew up the barrel at the very end of level one

4511
02:53:53,389 --> 02:53:54,229
to kill the Imp.

4512
02:53:54,229 --> 02:53:57,079
- How are you getting the Ws from the Twitch chat?

4513
02:53:57,079 --> 02:53:58,152
Is there an API?

4514
02:53:58,152 --> 02:54:01,399
- I was using IRC, so just a little TCP socket

4515
02:54:01,399 --> 02:54:03,169
and then you just parse out IRC.

4516
02:54:03,169 --> 02:54:05,029
- Okay. And there's very little lag there.

4517
02:54:05,029 --> 02:54:05,862
Okay.

4518
02:54:05,862 --> 02:54:07,759
- Yeah, I think it's a couple hundred milliseconds though.

4519
02:54:07,759 --> 02:54:09,919
It's enough that it actually made it a little bit difficult

4520
02:54:09,919 --> 02:54:11,659
because people would often overturn

4521
02:54:11,659 --> 02:54:13,399
and then go forward and miss the door

4522
02:54:13,399 --> 02:54:15,149
and then they had to go back and...

4523
02:54:16,279 --> 02:54:17,112
- That's awesome.

4524
02:54:17,112 --> 02:54:17,945
- It was awesome.

4525
02:54:17,945 --> 02:54:20,209
So that was my favorite I think project of all time

4526
02:54:20,209 --> 02:54:23,419
just because I never got to do a lot of encoding.

4527
02:54:23,419 --> 02:54:26,239
Encoding's kind of like, what do you normally do?

4528
02:54:26,239 --> 02:54:27,259
Okay, I need to send something down.

4529
02:54:27,259 --> 02:54:29,059
I don't know, gzip it, server will just do it.

4530
02:54:29,059 --> 02:54:30,139
Server just does the right thing.

4531
02:54:30,139 --> 02:54:31,192
I don't need to think about it.

4532
02:54:31,192 --> 02:54:33,589
So instead it's like I think about it,

4533
02:54:33,589 --> 02:54:34,549
I'm gonna send the right thing.

4534
02:54:34,549 --> 02:54:36,979
- Yeah, you have to think about the compression. Yeah.

4535
02:54:36,979 --> 02:54:37,812
And there you go.

4536
02:54:37,812 --> 02:54:39,679
That's some more love towards FFmpeg

4537
02:54:39,679 --> 02:54:41,779
because they have to think about that a lot.

4538
02:54:41,779 --> 02:54:44,479
- Ultimately inspired by FFmpeg and their awesomeness.

4539
02:54:46,879 --> 02:54:49,972
- So can you speak to just the chat community in general?

4540
02:54:51,426 --> 02:54:53,779
A big part of what you do

4541
02:54:53,779 --> 02:54:56,869
in terms of streaming is the humans

4542
02:54:56,869 --> 02:54:59,539
that are communicating with you live.

4543
02:54:59,539 --> 02:55:02,779
Can you talk to the different chat communities?

4544
02:55:02,779 --> 02:55:06,049
First of all, which is the best chat community,

4545
02:55:06,049 --> 02:55:08,119
YouTube, Twitch, or X?

4546
02:55:08,119 --> 02:55:10,429
- This is where I feel bad for YouTube,

4547
02:55:10,429 --> 02:55:12,919
because I do think it's technically the worst,

4548
02:55:12,919 --> 02:55:14,089
but it's not YouTube's fault.

4549
02:55:14,089 --> 02:55:15,619
And let me kind of explain why.

4550
02:55:15,619 --> 02:55:17,779
- And then I will explain why you're wrong.

4551
02:55:17,779 --> 02:55:19,159
But go ahead. YouTube is great.

4552
02:55:19,159 --> 02:55:21,739
- I know you love YouTube but let explain why,

4553
02:55:21,739 --> 02:55:25,642
is that when you go on Twitch, you go to anyone's channel,

4554
02:55:27,169 --> 02:55:30,739
they have this cultural human centipede thing

4555
02:55:30,739 --> 02:55:33,919
that's happening where as the memes flow in,

4556
02:55:33,919 --> 02:55:37,339
all of Twitch reacts and morphs to all those memes.

4557
02:55:37,339 --> 02:55:40,759
So every channel you go to has this same culture.

4558
02:55:40,759 --> 02:55:42,979
There's a lot of similar emotes and everything,

4559
02:55:42,979 --> 02:55:44,599
so it's very tight-knit.

4560
02:55:44,599 --> 02:55:48,079
So when I stream, I get all the same jokes

4561
02:55:48,079 --> 02:55:49,739
that you would pretty much see if you saw,

4562
02:55:49,739 --> 02:55:51,889
I don't know, Sodapoppin or some big streamer,

4563
02:55:51,889 --> 02:55:55,039
Asmongold, whoever, Portahteh software streaming.

4564
02:55:55,039 --> 02:55:56,869
All the same memes would all flow

4565
02:55:56,869 --> 02:55:58,639
through the exact same kind of pipe.

4566
02:55:58,639 --> 02:56:01,639
And so it's a very holistic kind of community.

4567
02:56:01,639 --> 02:56:02,959
So every time you're making jokes,

4568
02:56:02,959 --> 02:56:05,599
you're making jokes that are in the ether.

4569
02:56:05,599 --> 02:56:06,889
Twitter kind of has that too.

4570
02:56:06,889 --> 02:56:08,809
Tech Twitter kind of has a set of jokes

4571
02:56:08,809 --> 02:56:10,459
and so you can kind of see it.

4572
02:56:10,459 --> 02:56:11,899
The problem with Twitter chat is

4573
02:56:11,899 --> 02:56:14,209
that there's just nobody there right now.

4574
02:56:14,209 --> 02:56:16,519
Typically just to put it into perspective,

4575
02:56:16,519 --> 02:56:17,842
I have somewhere between,

4576
02:56:19,489 --> 02:56:24,469
somewhere between like 1,500 to 3,000 people on Twitch,

4577
02:56:24,469 --> 02:56:26,929
somewhere between 800 to 2,000 on YouTube,

4578
02:56:26,929 --> 02:56:29,209
and like 50 people on Twitter.

4579
02:56:29,209 --> 02:56:31,699
So the difference is massive.

4580
02:56:31,699 --> 02:56:34,939
But Twitter has that same thing that's developing

4581
02:56:34,939 --> 02:56:37,339
where there's memes that are constantly flowing through it.

4582
02:56:37,339 --> 02:56:39,859
And so they're very highly connected.

4583
02:56:39,859 --> 02:56:42,259
YouTube just doesn't seem to have that.

4584
02:56:42,259 --> 02:56:44,479
They're just a bunch of people and people go to YouTube

4585
02:56:44,479 --> 02:56:45,319
for various reasons.

4586
02:56:45,319 --> 02:56:46,789
I'm going to YouTube to learn.

4587
02:56:46,789 --> 02:56:48,319
So they come in and they want to learn.

4588
02:56:48,319 --> 02:56:50,509
So they're not on the meme train,

4589
02:56:50,509 --> 02:56:52,489
they're not in this cultural zeitgeist train.

4590
02:56:52,489 --> 02:56:54,739
They're just like, "But why would you use this if statement

4591
02:56:54,739 --> 02:56:56,565
when a switch statement in this one particular case?"

4592
02:56:56,565 --> 02:56:57,859
And you're just like, well, that's not

4593
02:56:57,859 --> 02:56:59,269
what I'm trying to do here.

4594
02:56:59,269 --> 02:57:02,389
- Yeah, you want to captain the meme train

4595
02:57:02,389 --> 02:57:04,459
or you want to ride on the meme train.

4596
02:57:04,459 --> 02:57:05,499
- Yeah, or you just want to be able

4597
02:57:05,499 --> 02:57:08,629
to create a culture on your chat

4598
02:57:08,629 --> 02:57:10,039
because your chat's gonna be some variation

4599
02:57:10,039 --> 02:57:12,886
of that kind of zeitgeist that's flowing through Twitch.

4600
02:57:12,886 --> 02:57:16,459
And it kind of is very contiguous between X and Twitch.

4601
02:57:16,459 --> 02:57:18,409
It just feels really out of sync with YouTube.

4602
02:57:18,409 --> 02:57:21,199
And then YouTube particularly does a bad job.

4603
02:57:21,199 --> 02:57:24,319
And some people would argue a good job because you can swim.

4604
02:57:24,319 --> 02:57:25,849
Swim being, you can actually change

4605
02:57:25,849 --> 02:57:26,682
what timestamp you're at.

4606
02:57:26,682 --> 02:57:28,339
So all of a sudden you'll be like,

4607
02:57:28,339 --> 02:57:33,339
oh yeah, something about driving to soccer in my minivan.

4608
02:57:33,769 --> 02:57:36,649
And then 20 minutes later you'll be talking about Zig

4609
02:57:36,649 --> 02:57:37,482
and then someone's like,

4610
02:57:37,482 --> 02:57:39,859
"I personally use whatever to drive to soccer."

4611
02:57:39,859 --> 02:57:42,019
And you're like, "What are we talking about?"

4612
02:57:42,019 --> 02:57:44,329
So YouTube is a very disjointed chat as well

4613
02:57:44,329 --> 02:57:46,759
because it depends on where they're at within the video.

4614
02:57:46,759 --> 02:57:49,672
Swim comes from Netflix, by the way, call it swim.

4615
02:57:50,809 --> 02:57:51,642
- The term?

4616
02:57:51,642 --> 02:57:54,709
- Yeah, people said swim.

4617
02:57:54,709 --> 02:57:56,209
- Oh, so you're, okay.

4618
02:57:56,209 --> 02:57:57,499
- Swimming through the...

4619
02:57:57,499 --> 02:57:59,149
- Yeah. So you're not just making up the term.

4620
02:57:59,149 --> 02:57:59,991
Thank you. Wow.

4621
02:57:59,991 --> 02:58:00,824
- Yeah, but it's probably made up

4622
02:58:00,824 --> 02:58:02,259
and probably only 10 people said it at Netflix,

4623
02:58:02,259 --> 02:58:03,970
so no one's gonna know it and they're gonna be like,

4624
02:58:03,970 --> 02:58:07,427
"Yeah, right. That doesn't happen on Netflix."

4625
02:58:07,427 --> 02:58:09,349
- So going back to projects,

4626
02:58:09,349 --> 02:58:11,599
what projects on stream or in general?

4627
02:58:11,599 --> 02:58:15,259
- No, you need to answer why YouTube chat's the best chat.

4628
02:58:15,259 --> 02:58:16,309
- Well, you kind of convinced me.

4629
02:58:16,309 --> 02:58:18,292
Okay, why YouTube is the best chat.

4630
02:58:20,509 --> 02:58:22,489
Well, I think I'm just a hater.

4631
02:58:22,489 --> 02:58:24,229
That's basically what it boils down to

4632
02:58:24,229 --> 02:58:25,729
and I'm just talking shit. - Love it.

4633
02:58:25,729 --> 02:58:30,109
- And I'm probably just from the outside shooting in

4634
02:58:30,109 --> 02:58:34,729
because Twitch is such a fun culture of memes.

4635
02:58:34,729 --> 02:58:37,079
And so it's just fun to shoot from the outside

4636
02:58:39,092 --> 02:58:40,942
to egg the house of Twitch.

4637
02:58:41,839 --> 02:58:45,019
And then I just sit back on my lawn chair

4638
02:58:45,019 --> 02:58:48,199
with the small YouTube community just talking shit.

4639
02:58:48,199 --> 02:58:49,588
No, you're absolutely right.

4640
02:58:49,588 --> 02:58:53,839
There's a real sense of community that Twitch can form.

4641
02:58:53,839 --> 02:58:55,819
But I just like the openness of YouTube.

4642
02:58:55,819 --> 02:58:59,809
It's just better at opening to the world.

4643
02:58:59,809 --> 02:59:04,019
It's more accessible, it's easier to share.

4644
02:59:04,019 --> 02:59:05,869
It's just a more established platform, that's all.

4645
02:59:05,869 --> 02:59:06,919
- Fully on that team.

4646
02:59:10,999 --> 02:59:11,959
- For the open world.

4647
02:59:11,959 --> 02:59:14,449
I can send it to people that don't usually watch

4648
02:59:14,449 --> 02:59:16,369
video game streaming or that kind of stuff.

4649
02:59:16,369 --> 02:59:18,035
- Yeah. If you send a Twitch link, they're like,

4650
02:59:18,035 --> 02:59:18,949
"I don't like video games."

4651
02:59:18,949 --> 02:59:21,816
And you're like, "Well actually it's not video games."

4652
02:59:22,729 --> 02:59:24,919
That talk happens every single time you mention Twitch

4653
02:59:24,919 --> 02:59:27,259
because Twitch does have a perspective

4654
02:59:27,259 --> 02:59:29,179
about it that YouTube does not.

4655
02:59:29,179 --> 02:59:34,179
- I was just on Joe Rogan's podcast and I think it came up,

4656
02:59:34,999 --> 02:59:38,779
he asked something like, "Is Twitch still a thing?"

4657
02:59:38,779 --> 02:59:41,089
So that just gives you an example.

4658
02:59:41,089 --> 02:59:43,616
And then Jamie said,

4659
02:59:43,616 --> 02:59:45,052
"Yeah, yeah, it's definitely still a thing.

4660
02:59:45,052 --> 02:59:47,149
It's still growing and so on."

4661
02:59:47,149 --> 02:59:50,659
And so yeah, there's just a big slice of humans

4662
02:59:50,659 --> 02:59:55,189
that don't participate in the Twitch sphere.

4663
02:59:55,189 --> 02:59:57,499
Yeah, I just like talking shit so yeah.

4664
02:59:57,499 --> 02:59:58,399
- That's a beautiful answer.

4665
02:59:58,399 --> 03:00:02,269
- But it's cool that you sort of make it accessible

4666
03:00:02,269 --> 03:00:03,649
on all these different platforms.

4667
03:00:03,649 --> 03:00:05,359
And I have high hopes for X, but yeah,

4668
03:00:05,359 --> 03:00:08,839
it's feature-wise still has a lot of growing up to do.

4669
03:00:08,839 --> 03:00:11,332
- And just why do people use X?

4670
03:00:12,199 --> 03:00:14,539
You typically are going there for a text-based interaction

4671
03:00:14,539 --> 03:00:15,372
you want to look through.

4672
03:00:15,372 --> 03:00:19,279
So I also think they just have a user expectation change

4673
03:00:19,279 --> 03:00:20,112
that needs to happen.

4674
03:00:20,112 --> 03:00:21,859
And that just takes a while.

4675
03:00:21,859 --> 03:00:23,839
That's gonna take a little bit before people get to it.

4676
03:00:23,839 --> 03:00:26,629
I think their idea of audio first is a great first step

4677
03:00:26,629 --> 03:00:30,529
where people can listen to it and have the phone away maybe.

4678
03:00:30,529 --> 03:00:32,599
There's a lot of changes that have to happen

4679
03:00:32,599 --> 03:00:34,429
before X can be successful in that.

4680
03:00:34,429 --> 03:00:37,129
- I mean, X has this incredible comment section

4681
03:00:37,129 --> 03:00:38,239
just like Reddit, right?

4682
03:00:38,239 --> 03:00:39,072
So it's like...

4683
03:00:39,979 --> 03:00:42,469
- You said incredible. That's not Reddit.

4684
03:00:42,469 --> 03:00:43,669
Comment section, correct.

4685
03:00:43,669 --> 03:00:44,869
- Comment, yeah.

4686
03:00:44,869 --> 03:00:48,879
Incredibly dynamic and vibrant even if it's...

4687
03:00:50,089 --> 03:00:55,089
Yeah. What is the technological platform?

4688
03:00:55,249 --> 03:00:59,509
How does the interface and the technology

4689
03:00:59,509 --> 03:01:02,749
shape the discourse?

4690
03:01:02,749 --> 03:01:03,859
It's fascinating

4691
03:01:03,859 --> 03:01:08,029
because X has a different style than Reddit,

4692
03:01:08,029 --> 03:01:09,889
different style than Facebook,

4693
03:01:09,889 --> 03:01:12,439
different style than Instagram.

4694
03:01:12,439 --> 03:01:13,272
It's interesting.

4695
03:01:13,272 --> 03:01:17,209
And all those common sections are different technologically,

4696
03:01:17,209 --> 03:01:19,279
like how the sorting is done,

4697
03:01:19,279 --> 03:01:24,279
how easy it is to sort of build a community around it?

4698
03:01:24,979 --> 03:01:27,649
Because YouTube is not really a community.

4699
03:01:27,649 --> 03:01:31,249
Every single video on YouTube has its own mini community.

4700
03:01:31,249 --> 03:01:34,238
You're all talking on just that one video.

4701
03:01:34,238 --> 03:01:37,189
But you can't jump across.

4702
03:01:37,189 --> 03:01:38,676
- There's not like, "Hey Bill, hey George."

4703
03:01:38,676 --> 03:01:41,719
There's no crosstalk that happens in multiple videos.

4704
03:01:41,719 --> 03:01:44,479
- Yeah. But the community is awesome.

4705
03:01:44,479 --> 03:01:45,319
I love community.

4706
03:01:45,319 --> 03:01:46,579
I love the feeling of community

4707
03:01:46,579 --> 03:01:49,189
and I guess that's what Twitch really provides.

4708
03:01:49,189 --> 03:01:50,779
- YouTube also does have it though.

4709
03:01:50,779 --> 03:01:53,029
They have an aggregate community.

4710
03:01:53,029 --> 03:01:55,517
There's a lot of fun comments and all that on the videos

4711
03:01:55,517 --> 03:01:58,429
and a lot of thumbs up and then you see the fun discourse

4712
03:01:58,429 --> 03:02:00,919
that happens and it's like that's the community,

4713
03:02:00,919 --> 03:02:03,122
it's just only a certain slice sees it.

4714
03:02:03,122 --> 03:02:07,549
- I think that's even more so on YouTube for live-streaming.

4715
03:02:07,549 --> 03:02:10,429
All the same folks show up and they talk shit,

4716
03:02:10,429 --> 03:02:13,579
they celebrate, the meme train arrives.

4717
03:02:13,579 --> 03:02:14,599
- Yeah.

4718
03:02:14,599 --> 03:02:19,189
- Okay. So now, what projects shape you as a programmer?

4719
03:02:19,189 --> 03:02:24,189
Whether the ones you streamed or offline.

4720
03:02:24,499 --> 03:02:25,332
- For me, I don't know

4721
03:02:25,332 --> 03:02:27,019
if there's a one project I can point to,

4722
03:02:27,019 --> 03:02:30,676
but I can point to a specific spot where I think it happens

4723
03:02:30,676 --> 03:02:33,379
and where I think you can learn a lot from.

4724
03:02:33,379 --> 03:02:35,689
Any small program you write will be somewhere

4725
03:02:35,689 --> 03:02:37,489
between 1,000 to 5,000 lines of code

4726
03:02:37,489 --> 03:02:40,309
I consider a pretty dang small project.

4727
03:02:40,309 --> 03:02:42,529
You can correlate this to any feature

4728
03:02:42,529 --> 03:02:44,749
within a larger system as well.

4729
03:02:44,749 --> 03:02:47,449
A specific feature on a website could be a thousand lines,

4730
03:02:47,449 --> 03:02:48,889
a couple thousand lines.

4731
03:02:48,889 --> 03:02:51,949
- There's a point in which all of your choices add up.

4732
03:02:51,949 --> 03:02:53,779
And I typically find that

4733
03:02:53,779 --> 03:02:56,119
right around 5 to 10,000 lines of code.

4734
03:02:56,119 --> 03:02:58,159
The choices you've made either weigh you down

4735
03:02:58,159 --> 03:02:59,392
or kind of free you up.

4736
03:03:00,499 --> 03:03:01,699
And so it's right in that,

4737
03:03:01,699 --> 03:03:03,859
that I feel like I learned the most is

4738
03:03:03,859 --> 03:03:06,349
because I love getting to that point in a project

4739
03:03:06,349 --> 03:03:08,269
or in some small part of the code base

4740
03:03:08,269 --> 03:03:10,219
because at that point I get to test, A,

4741
03:03:10,219 --> 03:03:12,979
how good were my initial gut decisions about

4742
03:03:12,979 --> 03:03:14,389
how I designed the software,

4743
03:03:14,389 --> 03:03:16,759
but B, now I need to go back and think about

4744
03:03:16,759 --> 03:03:18,409
how am I going to do testing across this

4745
03:03:18,409 --> 03:03:19,309
in a more effective way?

4746
03:03:19,309 --> 03:03:21,499
How can I scale this out to 20,000 lines of code?

4747
03:03:21,499 --> 03:03:23,269
How can I do all these things

4748
03:03:23,269 --> 03:03:25,849
with what I've got or do I need to kind of rethink it?

4749
03:03:25,849 --> 03:03:27,649
And I find that that's really

4750
03:03:27,649 --> 03:03:30,289
where the best learning happens is that everybody

4751
03:03:30,289 --> 03:03:33,499
has probably a different number that exists,

4752
03:03:33,499 --> 03:03:35,419
and as you go to each one of these numbers

4753
03:03:35,419 --> 03:03:39,439
or how well or holistic you want your project to be,

4754
03:03:39,439 --> 03:03:41,299
I think that you'll come up with different numbers.

4755
03:03:41,299 --> 03:03:43,129
And I think that number should just get bigger

4756
03:03:43,129 --> 03:03:44,449
as you get more experienced.

4757
03:03:44,449 --> 03:03:47,479
Because there's projects that are a million lines of code,

4758
03:03:47,479 --> 03:03:49,909
but they're most certainly not holistic, right?

4759
03:03:49,909 --> 03:03:51,949
Every part of the code base is some age

4760
03:03:51,949 --> 03:03:55,309
at some capsule of time with some sort of programming style.

4761
03:03:55,309 --> 03:03:58,699
Some is more functional, more class-based, more,

4762
03:03:58,699 --> 03:04:02,149
God help your soul if it's pre-processor macros in C++.

4763
03:04:02,149 --> 03:04:04,759
There's all these different kind of things you'll find

4764
03:04:04,759 --> 03:04:05,686
throughout time.

4765
03:04:05,686 --> 03:04:09,439
And so that's why I try to think about it as the feature

4766
03:04:09,439 --> 03:04:10,849
or the thing you're working on.

4767
03:04:10,849 --> 03:04:13,309
It's usually about 5,000 lines is

4768
03:04:13,309 --> 03:04:15,409
where I find that things get kind of,

4769
03:04:15,409 --> 03:04:16,879
did I make good or bad decisions?

4770
03:04:16,879 --> 03:04:18,319
And that's where I do all my learning is, right,

4771
03:04:18,319 --> 03:04:19,999
on that phase. I'm trying to get it to the point

4772
03:04:19,999 --> 03:04:21,319
where I should be able to shoot from the hip

4773
03:04:21,319 --> 03:04:24,079
and do 20,000 lines and not be upset about it.

4774
03:04:24,079 --> 03:04:25,189
- So first of all,

4775
03:04:25,189 --> 03:04:28,489
just enjoying the thing you create part, yeah.

4776
03:04:28,489 --> 03:04:31,069
About there you can sit back and see

4777
03:04:31,069 --> 03:04:33,979
all the parts dancing together.

4778
03:04:33,979 --> 03:04:35,992
For me, also debugging,

4779
03:04:37,069 --> 03:04:40,249
you get to see the choices you make materialize

4780
03:04:40,249 --> 03:04:42,289
as like how easy it is to debug.

4781
03:04:42,289 --> 03:04:43,669
I'm a big proponent,

4782
03:04:43,669 --> 03:04:45,919
I think you've mentioned this in the past,

4783
03:04:45,919 --> 03:04:48,649
I put asserts everywhere.

4784
03:04:48,649 --> 03:04:50,749
- No. You are the reason why I do that.

4785
03:04:50,749 --> 03:04:52,129
You were like the first one.

4786
03:04:52,129 --> 03:04:53,089
Keep on going, sorry.

4787
03:04:53,089 --> 03:04:54,112
- Really? Okay.

4788
03:04:55,939 --> 03:04:58,489
So for me, one of the joys,

4789
03:04:58,489 --> 03:05:00,829
whether it's try catch box,

4790
03:05:00,829 --> 03:05:03,379
whether it's assert, whether it's with the testing,

4791
03:05:05,239 --> 03:05:07,369
I get to see the payoff

4792
03:05:07,369 --> 03:05:11,689
of all the minefield of asserts

4793
03:05:11,689 --> 03:05:14,449
I've laid out before me in my kingdom

4794
03:05:14,449 --> 03:05:17,839
by how quickly I can debug a system as it grows larger.

4795
03:05:17,839 --> 03:05:21,619
And I can first of all discover errors

4796
03:05:21,619 --> 03:05:23,749
before they become real bugs

4797
03:05:23,749 --> 03:05:26,839
and also how quickly I can solve those errors.

4798
03:05:26,839 --> 03:05:28,249
And that brings me joy.

4799
03:05:28,249 --> 03:05:30,109
For me, a lot of the joys of programming

4800
03:05:30,109 --> 03:05:35,109
is creating powerful systems that don't break down,

4801
03:05:36,169 --> 03:05:37,609
that work correctly,

4802
03:05:37,609 --> 03:05:39,889
that work correctly in majority of the cases.

4803
03:05:39,889 --> 03:05:43,759
And there, sort of the stress testing the system

4804
03:05:43,759 --> 03:05:46,129
and getting all of the signals

4805
03:05:46,129 --> 03:05:48,779
from that system that everything is working correctly

4806
03:05:50,086 --> 03:05:51,499
is something that fills me with joy

4807
03:05:51,499 --> 03:05:54,199
and makes sure that the system actually works.

4808
03:05:54,199 --> 03:05:57,919
So yeah, that, I don't know if it's 5, 10,000 lines of code,

4809
03:05:57,919 --> 03:06:00,859
if it's Java or C++ it's millions lines of code.

4810
03:06:00,859 --> 03:06:03,316
But yeah, in Python,

4811
03:06:03,316 --> 03:06:05,359
yeah, I would say 10,000 lines of code.

4812
03:06:05,359 --> 03:06:07,759
That's when you first get to see the magic.

4813
03:06:07,759 --> 03:06:08,592
But anyway, you were saying?

4814
03:06:08,592 --> 03:06:10,009
- Okay, so you and John Carmack

4815
03:06:10,009 --> 03:06:11,269
had a conversation about asserts.

4816
03:06:11,269 --> 03:06:12,102
- Yes.

4817
03:06:12,102 --> 03:06:14,149
- You talked about this idea of putting asserts everywhere

4818
03:06:14,149 --> 03:06:16,609
that effectively crash the program

4819
03:06:16,609 --> 03:06:20,299
when you have some state in your program

4820
03:06:20,299 --> 03:06:21,379
that should not be represented

4821
03:06:21,379 --> 03:06:23,689
and you have made this choice actively.

4822
03:06:23,689 --> 03:06:25,549
And so I've never done that before.

4823
03:06:25,549 --> 03:06:27,139
And I know this is like an old technique

4824
03:06:27,139 --> 03:06:29,299
and I obviously must be too young

4825
03:06:29,299 --> 03:06:31,189
or too dumb to know that this was a thing people did.

4826
03:06:31,189 --> 03:06:33,469
I grew up in Java and I think that's probably why

4827
03:06:33,469 --> 03:06:35,119
I didn't run into this.

4828
03:06:35,119 --> 03:06:36,529
So I saw that and I was like,

4829
03:06:36,529 --> 03:06:38,329
I'm curious about how to use asserts more.

4830
03:06:38,329 --> 03:06:40,309
And then I ran into a person named Joran.

4831
03:06:40,309 --> 03:06:42,559
He's the CEO and creator of TigerBeetle.

4832
03:06:42,559 --> 03:06:46,729
It's like the world's fastest, greatest financial database.

4833
03:06:46,729 --> 03:06:48,049
And it was spawned out of a company

4834
03:06:48,049 --> 03:06:49,999
that needed to do a bunch of financial transactions.

4835
03:06:49,999 --> 03:06:51,889
And it's written in Zig and what they do is

4836
03:06:51,889 --> 03:06:54,859
they do deterministic simulation testing

4837
03:06:54,859 --> 03:06:58,549
and they just use NASA's kind of guarantee

4838
03:06:58,549 --> 03:07:00,049
for creating really great software.

4839
03:07:00,049 --> 03:07:01,609
So don't use U size,

4840
03:07:01,609 --> 03:07:04,159
specify your exact size of int you expect everywhere.

4841
03:07:04,159 --> 03:07:07,669
All these kind of things they do to be very specific.

4842
03:07:07,669 --> 03:07:09,319
And one of them is that every function

4843
03:07:09,319 --> 03:07:12,079
should contain two asserts.

4844
03:07:12,079 --> 03:07:13,549
Whether it's positive space

4845
03:07:13,549 --> 03:07:16,879
like these things should happen or negative space,

4846
03:07:16,879 --> 03:07:20,119
like this pointer should never be null.

4847
03:07:20,119 --> 03:07:22,819
You're programming into things that should never happen.

4848
03:07:22,819 --> 03:07:24,259
Normally, you would just never specify that.

4849
03:07:24,259 --> 03:07:25,609
You'd never think about that.

4850
03:07:25,609 --> 03:07:28,354
So every single function everywhere has all these asserts

4851
03:07:28,354 --> 03:07:31,549
and these asserts run both in production and in testing.

4852
03:07:31,549 --> 03:07:32,809
They're always on.

4853
03:07:32,809 --> 03:07:35,399
And then they take deterministic simulation testing

4854
03:07:37,369 --> 03:07:41,149
and run like 200 years of just random data,

4855
03:07:41,149 --> 03:07:43,069
just complete slop going through the system

4856
03:07:43,069 --> 03:07:44,449
and seeing how far it goes.

4857
03:07:44,449 --> 03:07:45,499
And when an assert happens,

4858
03:07:45,499 --> 03:07:47,179
they're like, here's the input that caused it,

4859
03:07:47,179 --> 03:07:49,039
here's every last little bit that happened,

4860
03:07:49,039 --> 03:07:51,439
and now you can identify where this went wrong.

4861
03:07:51,439 --> 03:07:52,759
And it was so cool.

4862
03:07:52,759 --> 03:07:55,489
So between you, John Carmack and Joran,

4863
03:07:55,489 --> 03:07:57,139
that's where I got like, okay, I got to really...

4864
03:07:57,139 --> 03:07:59,299
And NASA, I'll throw NASA a bone as well.

4865
03:07:59,299 --> 03:08:01,489
NASA can join in on that one.

4866
03:08:01,489 --> 03:08:03,852
I was like, okay, I want to try this. And I did try it. I

4867
03:08:03,852 --> 03:08:05,899
built this big reverse proxy

4868
03:08:05,899 --> 03:08:08,026
for me trying to do some game development stuff.

4869
03:08:08,026 --> 03:08:11,119
And I just went ham on the asserts.

4870
03:08:11,119 --> 03:08:13,069
And then I built the whole simulation testing thing

4871
03:08:13,069 --> 03:08:14,419
that could do everything deterministically.

4872
03:08:14,419 --> 03:08:16,969
So even the result of requests

4873
03:08:16,969 --> 03:08:18,199
would all come in specific orders.

4874
03:08:18,199 --> 03:08:19,639
And I found a bunch of bugs

4875
03:08:19,639 --> 03:08:20,749
that I just would never have found.

4876
03:08:20,749 --> 03:08:22,039
And then I did it for a game I was making.

4877
03:08:22,039 --> 03:08:24,199
I found some bugs where my cursor went off-screen,

4878
03:08:24,199 --> 03:08:25,459
it would cause all these different problems

4879
03:08:25,459 --> 03:08:26,689
because I just never tested them.

4880
03:08:26,689 --> 03:08:28,459
And it's super fun

4881
03:08:28,459 --> 03:08:30,289
and it's like a really great way to program.

4882
03:08:30,289 --> 03:08:32,809
- Yeah, I think it's a skillset you grow over time.

4883
03:08:32,809 --> 03:08:36,589
It's not just that you have to specify the preconditions,

4884
03:08:36,589 --> 03:08:38,152
everything that has to be true,

4885
03:08:39,289 --> 03:08:42,262
it's also adding things that are like,

4886
03:08:43,219 --> 03:08:45,829
you might not even think about.

4887
03:08:45,829 --> 03:08:49,909
You have to sort of anticipate really weird things.

4888
03:08:49,909 --> 03:08:51,469
And if you add asserts,

4889
03:08:51,469 --> 03:08:52,999
especially in complicated functions

4890
03:08:52,999 --> 03:08:55,469
or in complicated classes that

4891
03:08:57,559 --> 03:09:00,139
are able to catch really weird things,

4892
03:09:00,139 --> 03:09:02,629
that's going to save you so many headaches

4893
03:09:02,629 --> 03:09:06,262
and it's going to help you learn about your own code.

4894
03:09:07,129 --> 03:09:08,389
This is one of the things,

4895
03:09:08,389 --> 03:09:11,149
I think it was Jonathan Blow

4896
03:09:11,149 --> 03:09:14,389
that either in conversation with you

4897
03:09:14,389 --> 03:09:17,299
or was it in a presentation,

4898
03:09:17,299 --> 03:09:19,819
he said that when he's starting in a project,

4899
03:09:19,819 --> 03:09:24,502
he usually doesn't know how to implement it,

4900
03:09:26,479 --> 03:09:27,862
how it's going to work.

4901
03:09:28,789 --> 03:09:30,529
And I think he was saying

4902
03:09:30,529 --> 03:09:32,359
that he wants a programming language.

4903
03:09:32,359 --> 03:09:35,479
This might have been a criticism of C++, I'm not sure,

4904
03:09:35,479 --> 03:09:36,859
where he wants a programming language

4905
03:09:36,859 --> 03:09:40,939
that makes it as painless as possible for him

4906
03:09:40,939 --> 03:09:44,029
to not know what he's doing, how he's going to implement it,

4907
03:09:44,029 --> 03:09:46,729
and to quickly get to a place where he figures it out.

4908
03:09:47,809 --> 03:09:51,769
I think there's a fundamental part of programming is

4909
03:09:51,769 --> 03:09:55,969
building stuff while not really knowing

4910
03:09:55,969 --> 03:09:59,029
what the next thing you're doing is.

4911
03:09:59,029 --> 03:10:01,879
You kind of have a loose design, maybe a strict design,

4912
03:10:01,879 --> 03:10:04,519
but really you're solving puzzles that are not...

4913
03:10:04,519 --> 03:10:07,879
It is a dark room in a fundamental sense.

4914
03:10:07,879 --> 03:10:11,149
And there you have to anticipate the kind of weirdnesses

4915
03:10:11,149 --> 03:10:14,929
that might emerge while not really knowing everything.

4916
03:10:14,929 --> 03:10:19,222
Just this full fog, fog of war.

4917
03:10:20,749 --> 03:10:23,479
And there that's a real skill to anticipate

4918
03:10:23,479 --> 03:10:26,119
the kind of issues that might arise

4919
03:10:26,119 --> 03:10:27,829
and put a asserts on top of them.

4920
03:10:27,829 --> 03:10:31,282
And it's also like spiritually, for me,

4921
03:10:32,479 --> 03:10:34,969
been a really nice way of programming a building

4922
03:10:34,969 --> 03:10:39,816
of living life as having very strict asserts

4923
03:10:40,969 --> 03:10:45,109
that say, "You're gonna fix this problem if it ever arises.

4924
03:10:45,109 --> 03:10:46,519
You can't just look the other way."

4925
03:10:46,519 --> 03:10:49,669
This idea of treating warnings as errors.

4926
03:10:49,669 --> 03:10:52,249
Make sure your code compiles without any warnings.

4927
03:10:52,249 --> 03:10:53,082
That was a big leap for me.

4928
03:10:53,082 --> 03:10:55,909
It's like, but there's so many of them

4929
03:10:55,909 --> 03:10:57,392
and it's not really that important.

4930
03:10:57,392 --> 03:11:01,459
It's like, no, no, no warnings.

4931
03:11:01,459 --> 03:11:04,849
Make sure you treat every single problem,

4932
03:11:04,849 --> 03:11:07,429
even fuzzy problems seriously,

4933
03:11:07,429 --> 03:11:11,196
because that's actually long-term is going to create code

4934
03:11:11,196 --> 03:11:14,689
that's much easier to work with, much more fun to work with,

4935
03:11:14,689 --> 03:11:17,209
much more robust, resilient to all kinds of weirdnesses,

4936
03:11:17,209 --> 03:11:18,042
all that kind of stuff.

4937
03:11:18,042 --> 03:11:20,929
So it's a different way of approaching coding,

4938
03:11:20,929 --> 03:11:23,119
probably more NASA-like

4939
03:11:23,119 --> 03:11:26,929
versus web programming style.

4940
03:11:26,929 --> 03:11:30,409
But yeah, it has made programming for me personally,

4941
03:11:30,409 --> 03:11:31,849
much more fun

4942
03:11:31,849 --> 03:11:34,639
because one of the most painful things about programming

4943
03:11:34,639 --> 03:11:39,639
is creating when you get past 10,000, 20,000 lines of code

4944
03:11:39,829 --> 03:11:41,182
and you have to find a bug.

4945
03:11:42,679 --> 03:11:45,109
And that bug can take hours,

4946
03:11:45,109 --> 03:11:46,789
it could take days to find,

4947
03:11:46,789 --> 03:11:47,869
and that's torture.

4948
03:11:47,869 --> 03:11:49,879
- Yeah, when your system gets sufficiently large,

4949
03:11:49,879 --> 03:11:53,002
some of these bugs are just, they are very difficult.

4950
03:11:54,199 --> 03:11:55,549
Bless anyone's soul that's working

4951
03:11:55,549 --> 03:11:58,189
on million line code bases, because it does.

4952
03:11:58,189 --> 03:12:01,129
I can't tell you how many times I've spent multiple days

4953
03:12:01,129 --> 03:12:02,779
just trying to figure out the root cause of the bug.

4954
03:12:02,779 --> 03:12:03,612
Not even the fix.

4955
03:12:03,612 --> 03:12:06,829
Just like why does this happen? And that's hard.

4956
03:12:06,829 --> 03:12:07,662
So I love that.

4957
03:12:07,662 --> 03:12:10,459
I just love the asserts because I'm not good at them,

4958
03:12:10,459 --> 03:12:11,629
I can see it's definitely a skill

4959
03:12:11,629 --> 03:12:14,719
that I don't put into practice constantly,

4960
03:12:14,719 --> 03:12:17,329
which means it's just not like a muscle memory type thing.

4961
03:12:17,329 --> 03:12:20,209
And so it's just one of those things I just love.

4962
03:12:20,209 --> 03:12:23,239
It's such a fascinating way to approach a problem,

4963
03:12:23,239 --> 03:12:24,529
because I would've never thought,

4964
03:12:24,529 --> 03:12:25,699
you know what I'm gonna do?

4965
03:12:25,699 --> 03:12:27,346
If I'm wrong, I'm gonna crash this thing

4966
03:12:27,346 --> 03:12:28,879
and I'm gonna crash it right here

4967
03:12:28,879 --> 03:12:30,709
because I should never be wrong.

4968
03:12:30,709 --> 03:12:31,542
But instead you're like,

4969
03:12:31,542 --> 03:12:33,049
"Oh, actually that makes perfect sense.

4970
03:12:33,049 --> 03:12:34,189
I should crash this thing.

4971
03:12:34,189 --> 03:12:35,599
I've done something terribly wrong here.

4972
03:12:35,599 --> 03:12:37,189
Why would this ever exist?"

4973
03:12:37,189 --> 03:12:38,022
And then you're like,

4974
03:12:38,022 --> 03:12:39,739
"This is gonna solve a whole class of problems."

4975
03:12:39,739 --> 03:12:41,599
- Yeah, and especially if it's in production,

4976
03:12:41,599 --> 03:12:44,389
it's like, well a user's going to see this crash.

4977
03:12:44,389 --> 03:12:46,909
It's like, yeah, well you should minimize

4978
03:12:46,909 --> 03:12:50,509
the number of times any user ever sees the crash,

4979
03:12:50,509 --> 03:12:54,799
not by having a nice blue screen or whatever the fuck,

4980
03:12:54,799 --> 03:12:57,829
but actually stopping everything.

4981
03:12:57,829 --> 03:13:01,509
And that's going to create an incentive for you

4982
03:13:01,509 --> 03:13:03,499
to never have that happen.

4983
03:13:03,499 --> 03:13:05,089
You're actually going to put in the time

4984
03:13:05,089 --> 03:13:06,799
to make sure it never happens.

4985
03:13:06,799 --> 03:13:08,446
- And the nice part is with the web and all that,

4986
03:13:08,446 --> 03:13:10,466
you can always pop up something and say,

4987
03:13:10,466 --> 03:13:12,259
"Hey, things have gone very, very wrong

4988
03:13:12,259 --> 03:13:13,219
or unable to recover."

4989
03:13:13,219 --> 03:13:15,079
You can give them a nice message and then log it off

4990
03:13:15,079 --> 03:13:16,969
so you can see it, and then measure

4991
03:13:16,969 --> 03:13:18,829
how often are you doing it.

4992
03:13:18,829 --> 03:13:22,189
I understand that there's a bit of interestingness

4993
03:13:22,189 --> 03:13:25,492
to a web project like do you want to always crash a server?

4994
03:13:26,989 --> 03:13:29,119
There's a bit of a gamble if you release a bad version

4995
03:13:29,119 --> 03:13:31,489
and you crash all your servers constantly.

4996
03:13:31,489 --> 03:13:33,289
That's a pain you're going to have to accept.

4997
03:13:33,289 --> 03:13:36,529
- I think this is more applicable for single systems

4998
03:13:36,529 --> 03:13:38,689
like robots and so on.

4999
03:13:38,689 --> 03:13:42,259
You have struggled with ADHD.

5000
03:13:42,259 --> 03:13:45,109
I think a lot of people are really inspired

5001
03:13:45,109 --> 03:13:48,839
by the fact that you're able to be productive and flourish

5002
03:13:50,749 --> 03:13:52,369
while having ADHD.

5003
03:13:52,369 --> 03:13:54,079
How'd you overcome it?

5004
03:13:54,079 --> 03:13:56,929
- Well, there's a lot of things that ADHD affects

5005
03:13:56,929 --> 03:13:57,762
and so

5006
03:14:00,439 --> 03:14:02,539
I'll start with some of the easiest things,

5007
03:14:02,539 --> 03:14:03,919
because there's directly applicable,

5008
03:14:03,919 --> 03:14:06,109
then these kind of collateral damage applicable things

5009
03:14:06,109 --> 03:14:07,039
that happen.

5010
03:14:07,039 --> 03:14:11,359
So one thing that has really helped me with ADHD

5011
03:14:11,359 --> 03:14:12,289
is maturity.

5012
03:14:12,289 --> 03:14:16,159
I think that's just a thing that everyone needs more of.

5013
03:14:16,159 --> 03:14:19,249
Meaning that I found myself getting so wiggly

5014
03:14:19,249 --> 03:14:21,796
and so out of control when I would try to sit down and read,

5015
03:14:21,796 --> 03:14:23,479
and I just couldn't handle it.

5016
03:14:23,479 --> 03:14:26,629
I just felt like I'd read a page and didn't read anything.

5017
03:14:26,629 --> 03:14:27,716
The part of me that just went,

5018
03:14:27,716 --> 03:14:29,809
"Oh man, gosh, I just can't even do this."

5019
03:14:29,809 --> 03:14:31,736
I had to just simply quit listening to it and said,

5020
03:14:31,736 --> 03:14:33,229
"Nope, I'm rereading this page."

5021
03:14:33,229 --> 03:14:35,599
I remember reading some pages in college

5022
03:14:35,599 --> 03:14:39,019
like 18 times in a row, just like I'm going to force myself

5023
03:14:39,019 --> 03:14:40,276
to just do this the correct way.

5024
03:14:40,276 --> 03:14:43,369
And so there's an aspect of maturity that really helps,

5025
03:14:43,369 --> 03:14:46,009
no matter what, I will do the thing I'm going to do

5026
03:14:46,009 --> 03:14:47,329
and I'm going to do it well

5027
03:14:47,329 --> 03:14:50,719
and maybe it takes me a lot longer and that's okay.

5028
03:14:50,719 --> 03:14:51,769
That's not the point of it.

5029
03:14:51,769 --> 03:14:53,506
It's that I'm doing it and that's the point.

5030
03:14:53,506 --> 03:14:56,449
And so that's one thing that I think just generally helps.

5031
03:14:56,449 --> 03:14:59,359
And ADHD, no ADHD,

5032
03:14:59,359 --> 03:15:02,029
the resilience, emotional resilience

5033
03:15:02,029 --> 03:15:04,969
is just a really important aspect that just helps.

5034
03:15:04,969 --> 03:15:06,589
And so I think that has been a large part

5035
03:15:06,589 --> 03:15:08,089
that really helps me.

5036
03:15:08,089 --> 03:15:11,779
There's things that I still obviously struggle with.

5037
03:15:11,779 --> 03:15:15,259
It's clear where I'm really bad at stuff,

5038
03:15:15,259 --> 03:15:16,092
and

5039
03:15:20,239 --> 03:15:22,609
just trying to think through all the different things

5040
03:15:22,609 --> 03:15:24,679
that I'm bad at.

5041
03:15:24,679 --> 03:15:26,266
There's more things I'm bad at than I'm good at.

5042
03:15:26,266 --> 03:15:28,279
And so programming obviously has something

5043
03:15:28,279 --> 03:15:30,409
that just allows me to remain focused

5044
03:15:30,409 --> 03:15:32,269
and it's like a strength of mine.

5045
03:15:32,269 --> 03:15:34,039
And so I started off

5046
03:15:34,039 --> 03:15:35,449
where I could just do it for a little bit

5047
03:15:35,449 --> 03:15:37,459
and then just through kind of that emotional resilience,

5048
03:15:37,459 --> 03:15:38,749
I was able to start doing it more and more.

5049
03:15:38,749 --> 03:15:41,599
And so now I can just do it for like 10, 12, 15 hours

5050
03:15:41,599 --> 03:15:43,806
at a time and I absolutely love it.

5051
03:15:43,806 --> 03:15:46,069
And so it's become kind of like a joy.

5052
03:15:46,069 --> 03:15:48,499
It's like playing a musical instrument. I'm really into it.

5053
03:15:48,499 --> 03:15:51,416
But then if it came down to,

5054
03:15:51,416 --> 03:15:54,409
"Hey, you need to go schedule your own dentistry

5055
03:15:54,409 --> 03:15:56,119
and go do all these other things

5056
03:15:56,119 --> 03:15:58,579
or make sure the kids have this type of stuff ready

5057
03:15:58,579 --> 03:16:01,609
for the meals you need to pack throughout the week.

5058
03:16:01,609 --> 03:16:05,359
I'm historically very bad at that

5059
03:16:05,359 --> 03:16:07,639
and will probably continue to be very bad at that.

5060
03:16:07,639 --> 03:16:10,789
And so I must say that one of the reasons

5061
03:16:10,789 --> 03:16:13,759
why I excel so much is because I also have a wife

5062
03:16:13,759 --> 03:16:15,919
who is so good to me

5063
03:16:15,919 --> 03:16:18,709
and she helps clear out a lot of the things in my life

5064
03:16:18,709 --> 03:16:22,399
that cause a lot of me kind of getting snowballed

5065
03:16:22,399 --> 03:16:23,659
into a weird spot

5066
03:16:23,659 --> 03:16:25,849
where I'm just distracted getting nothing done.

5067
03:16:25,849 --> 03:16:27,109
And so she's really helped me.

5068
03:16:27,109 --> 03:16:28,549
So it would be foolish of me to claim

5069
03:16:28,549 --> 03:16:31,069
that I've defeated the ADHD by myself,

5070
03:16:31,069 --> 03:16:34,609
but instead I find that the places

5071
03:16:34,609 --> 03:16:37,249
that I can really control I've done a very good job at,

5072
03:16:37,249 --> 03:16:39,859
and the things that I obviously need to do much better at,

5073
03:16:39,859 --> 03:16:41,509
my wife has helped me a whole bunch.

5074
03:16:41,509 --> 03:16:42,859
And so I've kind of cheated.

5075
03:16:42,859 --> 03:16:44,989
Maybe I found a cheat code, a loving wife.

5076
03:16:44,989 --> 03:16:47,779
But that has been the thing that has really helped.

5077
03:16:47,779 --> 03:16:49,279
- You said a lot of interesting things.

5078
03:16:49,279 --> 03:16:52,999
So on the reading and for me it's also audiobook side,

5079
03:16:52,999 --> 03:16:56,569
I do the same thing and I've gotten much better at it,

5080
03:16:56,569 --> 03:16:59,689
which is I tune out mentally

5081
03:16:59,689 --> 03:17:02,446
and I read a page

5082
03:17:02,446 --> 03:17:04,670
and you don't understand anything on the page.

5083
03:17:04,670 --> 03:17:07,129
You didn't actually read it.

5084
03:17:07,129 --> 03:17:10,939
And yeah, I forced myself to just reread it

5085
03:17:10,939 --> 03:17:12,559
or re-listen to an audiobook,

5086
03:17:12,559 --> 03:17:15,739
which is a much more common problem for me now,

5087
03:17:15,739 --> 03:17:18,409
and forcing myself to really pay attention.

5088
03:17:18,409 --> 03:17:20,149
Because I listen to audiobooks often when I run

5089
03:17:20,149 --> 03:17:23,239
and it's so easy to just tune out.

5090
03:17:23,239 --> 03:17:24,079
It's a skill.

5091
03:17:24,079 --> 03:17:25,549
I didn't realize how much of a skill

5092
03:17:25,549 --> 03:17:27,589
listening to an audiobook is,

5093
03:17:27,589 --> 03:17:30,229
especially when there's other sensory inputs

5094
03:17:30,229 --> 03:17:31,459
like when you run.

5095
03:17:31,459 --> 03:17:34,879
So I have to force myself to really pay attention

5096
03:17:34,879 --> 03:17:35,929
to every single word.

5097
03:17:35,929 --> 03:17:39,109
And if I don't, like tune out and don't remember

5098
03:17:39,109 --> 03:17:41,269
what I just listened to in the past 30 seconds,

5099
03:17:41,269 --> 03:17:43,579
I force myself to re-listen to it.

5100
03:17:43,579 --> 03:17:46,549
And sometimes that means five times

5101
03:17:46,549 --> 03:17:48,626
until, it's like punishing myself to like,

5102
03:17:48,626 --> 03:17:50,479
"You're gonna listen to this boring shit over and over

5103
03:17:50,479 --> 03:17:55,479
until you get good at that little skill of like zoom in."

5104
03:17:55,519 --> 03:17:58,039
And you're like, yeah, there's people,

5105
03:17:58,039 --> 03:18:00,709
they're doing stuff, there's nature, it doesn't matter.

5106
03:18:00,709 --> 03:18:03,529
You're listening to every single word and loading it in

5107
03:18:03,529 --> 03:18:05,209
and trying to stay focused,

5108
03:18:05,209 --> 03:18:07,849
even there's just so many distractions all around you, yeah.

5109
03:18:07,849 --> 03:18:08,968
- It's definitely a learned skill

5110
03:18:08,968 --> 03:18:10,276
and it takes a lot of time.

5111
03:18:10,276 --> 03:18:13,249
And when I say, "Oh, I was able to do from here to here,"

5112
03:18:13,249 --> 03:18:15,039
I'm speaking over the course of like five years

5113
03:18:15,039 --> 03:18:16,639
of doing this every day.

5114
03:18:16,639 --> 03:18:17,749
It's not some small...

5115
03:18:17,749 --> 03:18:19,399
There's no...

5116
03:18:19,399 --> 03:18:21,559
The nice part about that decision though is

5117
03:18:21,559 --> 03:18:23,452
you can make that decision today.

5118
03:18:24,319 --> 03:18:25,159
You can make it right now.

5119
03:18:25,159 --> 03:18:26,059
You're going to be like, "From here on out,

5120
03:18:26,059 --> 03:18:27,529
I'll never make that mistake again.

5121
03:18:27,529 --> 03:18:29,659
I will say I'm going to read 50 pages,

5122
03:18:29,659 --> 03:18:31,099
I will sit down and read 50 pages,

5123
03:18:31,099 --> 03:18:32,089
and when I get distracted

5124
03:18:32,089 --> 03:18:33,559
I'll go back to the last place I remember

5125
03:18:33,559 --> 03:18:34,392
and I'll start again."

5126
03:18:34,392 --> 03:18:36,019
And like that's a decision you can make.

5127
03:18:36,019 --> 03:18:39,469
That's a mature, non-emotional decision to make.

5128
03:18:39,469 --> 03:18:42,949
And you can do that, it just may be really painful

5129
03:18:42,949 --> 03:18:45,439
for the first couple years of making said decisions.

5130
03:18:45,439 --> 03:18:47,419
And then it gets easier and then it gets easier,

5131
03:18:47,419 --> 03:18:50,659
and then it becomes more natural to change yourself.

5132
03:18:50,659 --> 03:18:54,259
- Yeah, and with every medium, with every platform,

5133
03:18:54,259 --> 03:18:55,792
I think it's like a new skill.

5134
03:18:57,053 --> 03:18:59,749
For me, like using social media has been that,

5135
03:18:59,749 --> 03:19:02,449
just like I end up like doom scrolling

5136
03:19:02,449 --> 03:19:04,612
too easily on platforms.

5137
03:19:05,689 --> 03:19:08,719
And one solution is not to look at all,

5138
03:19:08,719 --> 03:19:11,479
which is kind of what I lean on mostly these days,

5139
03:19:11,479 --> 03:19:13,519
but I feel like I should be able to check,

5140
03:19:13,519 --> 03:19:16,369
just read, okay, feel a thing,

5141
03:19:16,369 --> 03:19:18,769
learn a thing, and then put it down,

5142
03:19:18,769 --> 03:19:23,179
versus you have this glazed look over your eye

5143
03:19:23,179 --> 03:19:25,039
and you're not really paying attention anymore

5144
03:19:25,039 --> 03:19:27,739
and you're dead inside and you feel horrible afterwards.

5145
03:19:27,739 --> 03:19:28,732
I don't understand.

5146
03:19:30,109 --> 03:19:32,179
- The horrible afterwards is real serious.

5147
03:19:32,179 --> 03:19:33,529
I've definitely...

5148
03:19:33,529 --> 03:19:36,559
I can 100% notice that I am a more anxious person

5149
03:19:36,559 --> 03:19:38,269
the more time I spend scrolling.

5150
03:19:38,269 --> 03:19:40,542
- Yeah, yeah. - I can just feel it.

5151
03:19:40,542 --> 03:19:42,872
It's like something inside of me that's kind of...

5152
03:19:42,872 --> 03:19:43,705
I don't know how to say it

5153
03:19:43,705 --> 03:19:44,539
other than it like wants to get out

5154
03:19:44,539 --> 03:19:45,519
but I don't really know what that is.

5155
03:19:45,519 --> 03:19:47,962
It's not anger, but it's not...

5156
03:19:47,962 --> 03:19:49,699
It's very anxious.

5157
03:19:49,699 --> 03:19:51,979
- It's like the opposite of the feeling I have

5158
03:19:51,979 --> 03:19:53,659
when I wake up in the morning and I'm feeling good,

5159
03:19:53,659 --> 03:19:57,709
and I look out in nature and look at the sun

5160
03:19:57,709 --> 03:20:00,796
and just, and there's like a bird chirping

5161
03:20:00,796 --> 03:20:02,659
and this kind of thing.

5162
03:20:02,659 --> 03:20:04,249
Scrolling through social media,

5163
03:20:04,249 --> 03:20:06,679
even if it's like super positive stuff or whatever,

5164
03:20:06,679 --> 03:20:09,229
it's still not the same feeling as the bird chirping.

5165
03:20:09,229 --> 03:20:10,999
Bird chirping on Instagram

5166
03:20:10,999 --> 03:20:13,759
is a different bird chirping than in real life,

5167
03:20:13,759 --> 03:20:15,889
'cause bird chirping on Instagram, I'll start swiping

5168
03:20:15,889 --> 03:20:19,249
until there's demons of different types

5169
03:20:19,249 --> 03:20:23,329
fighting inside my head and then different anxiety,

5170
03:20:23,329 --> 03:20:25,249
insecurity, whatever the hell.

5171
03:20:25,249 --> 03:20:28,249
Just the mixture of chaos

5172
03:20:28,249 --> 03:20:31,032
versus the bird chirping in real life.

5173
03:20:31,032 --> 03:20:31,865
That is beautiful.

5174
03:20:31,865 --> 03:20:34,129
But again, that's the same thing as with the audiobook.

5175
03:20:34,129 --> 03:20:35,289
It boils down to...

5176
03:20:36,483 --> 03:20:37,999
Man, these people that talk about meditation,

5177
03:20:37,999 --> 03:20:39,169
I think that's probably...

5178
03:20:39,169 --> 03:20:40,459
They're onto something,

5179
03:20:40,459 --> 03:20:44,129
because that's what it is be able to like focus

5180
03:20:46,519 --> 03:20:48,919
calmly and deliberately on a thing,

5181
03:20:48,919 --> 03:20:53,866
whether it's reading or audiobook or existence.

5182
03:20:55,039 --> 03:20:56,839
When they sort of observe the breath,

5183
03:20:56,839 --> 03:20:59,189
you're able to silent out everything else

5184
03:21:00,144 --> 03:21:01,549
and remove everything else from focus.

5185
03:21:01,549 --> 03:21:02,939
Yeah. That's a skill.

5186
03:21:02,939 --> 03:21:03,772
That's a skill.

5187
03:21:03,772 --> 03:21:05,899
- I heard it put really beautifully, which is that

5188
03:21:05,899 --> 03:21:08,839
we in America really have misunderstood liberty

5189
03:21:08,839 --> 03:21:10,039
because we typically have liberty

5190
03:21:10,039 --> 03:21:12,169
as just the freedom to do whatever you want.

5191
03:21:12,169 --> 03:21:13,069
And the argument was

5192
03:21:13,069 --> 03:21:15,109
that it's not the freedom to do whatever you want,

5193
03:21:15,109 --> 03:21:17,869
it's the freedom to be able to do what you will.

5194
03:21:17,869 --> 03:21:21,829
And how often is what you actually want to do, you don't do

5195
03:21:21,829 --> 03:21:23,239
because you get trapped doing something

5196
03:21:23,239 --> 03:21:24,319
that you've convinced yourself

5197
03:21:24,319 --> 03:21:26,119
in this quick moment you want to do?

5198
03:21:26,119 --> 03:21:27,769
And so it's like, "I want liberty.

5199
03:21:27,769 --> 03:21:30,769
I want the ability to control my energy

5200
03:21:30,769 --> 03:21:33,649
and to be able to do the thing I want to do,

5201
03:21:33,649 --> 03:21:35,509
not to get distracted and destroyed

5202
03:21:35,509 --> 03:21:37,669
in all the millions of distractions."

5203
03:21:37,669 --> 03:21:40,279
And some of us get handed a worse deck of cards,

5204
03:21:40,279 --> 03:21:41,599
some of us get a better deck of cards,

5205
03:21:41,599 --> 03:21:42,499
but I don't think there's anybody

5206
03:21:42,499 --> 03:21:45,109
that doesn't struggle with it in the technological age.

5207
03:21:45,109 --> 03:21:46,519
- Yeah, and that's the skill.

5208
03:21:46,519 --> 03:21:50,239
What can you say to the skill of achieving focus

5209
03:21:50,239 --> 03:21:51,709
in programming?

5210
03:21:51,709 --> 03:21:55,549
Do you have a process of how you sit down

5211
03:21:55,549 --> 03:21:57,709
and try to sort of approach a problem?

5212
03:21:57,709 --> 03:22:01,279
So, all the different, not just distractions

5213
03:22:01,279 --> 03:22:04,419
but the challenges of starting a project,

5214
03:22:04,419 --> 03:22:06,529
of thinking through the design,

5215
03:22:06,529 --> 03:22:08,449
how to maintain real focus,

5216
03:22:08,449 --> 03:22:11,302
because it's really difficult intellectual endeavor.

5217
03:22:12,259 --> 03:22:14,149
- At this point I'm lucky,

5218
03:22:14,149 --> 03:22:16,279
but when I first started I can remember

5219
03:22:16,279 --> 03:22:19,969
that every last part of programming,

5220
03:22:19,969 --> 03:22:21,679
I had to go look up, I had to go read,

5221
03:22:21,679 --> 03:22:24,169
I had side quests at all time.

5222
03:22:24,169 --> 03:22:25,849
Every step was a side quest.

5223
03:22:25,849 --> 03:22:27,049
Why is my screen blinking

5224
03:22:27,049 --> 03:22:28,189
when I'm trying to render this thing out?

5225
03:22:28,189 --> 03:22:29,449
Oh, I didn't know about double buffering.

5226
03:22:29,449 --> 03:22:30,499
Why is this happening?

5227
03:22:30,499 --> 03:22:31,849
How do I even write to the screen?

5228
03:22:31,849 --> 03:22:32,682
How do I...

5229
03:22:32,682 --> 03:22:33,949
Everything was a question.

5230
03:22:33,949 --> 03:22:35,779
I had more questions than answers.

5231
03:22:35,779 --> 03:22:38,506
And so I constantly had the problem of side quests,

5232
03:22:38,506 --> 03:22:41,029
and I find that to be a very exhausting thing.

5233
03:22:41,029 --> 03:22:44,689
But as I learned my instrument very, very well,

5234
03:22:44,689 --> 03:22:46,849
I don't have as many side quests.

5235
03:22:46,849 --> 03:22:49,099
I become more and more able to just focus

5236
03:22:49,099 --> 03:22:50,506
on the thing I want to do.

5237
03:22:50,506 --> 03:22:52,212
And I find that to be something

5238
03:22:52,212 --> 03:22:54,559
that is just super, super useful.

5239
03:22:54,559 --> 03:22:56,119
So, when I say I'm kind of lucky,

5240
03:22:56,119 --> 03:22:59,149
meaning that I've spent so much of my life

5241
03:22:59,149 --> 03:23:01,009
preparing for this moment

5242
03:23:01,009 --> 03:23:03,499
that now when I have the opportunity to do something,

5243
03:23:03,499 --> 03:23:04,882
I can just do that thing and I don't...

5244
03:23:04,882 --> 03:23:06,439
Like I can be just on an airplane

5245
03:23:06,439 --> 03:23:07,489
and I can just program for hours.

5246
03:23:07,489 --> 03:23:08,689
I don't have to look up a single thing.

5247
03:23:08,689 --> 03:23:09,522
I don't have to do anything.

5248
03:23:09,522 --> 03:23:10,759
I don't even have to test the code.

5249
03:23:10,759 --> 03:23:13,579
I can write 1,000 lines of code on an airplane

5250
03:23:13,579 --> 03:23:14,569
and I'm very confident

5251
03:23:14,569 --> 03:23:17,029
that it's gonna be 98% pretty dang good.

5252
03:23:17,029 --> 03:23:18,169
And I'm very happy about that

5253
03:23:18,169 --> 03:23:20,689
because that allows me just to be in the moment

5254
03:23:20,689 --> 03:23:22,699
solving the problem I'm trying to solve.

5255
03:23:22,699 --> 03:23:26,989
Then I have 100% of my brain power solving a problem.

5256
03:23:26,989 --> 03:23:27,822
And this is why I also...

5257
03:23:27,822 --> 03:23:28,819
It's the same reason why I recommend

5258
03:23:28,819 --> 03:23:31,219
learning how to type and learning your editor so well

5259
03:23:31,219 --> 03:23:32,809
you don't even have to think about the action

5260
03:23:32,809 --> 03:23:34,489
because the people that have to...

5261
03:23:34,489 --> 03:23:36,169
Even if you just look down,

5262
03:23:36,169 --> 03:23:38,179
that's still mental processing power

5263
03:23:38,179 --> 03:23:40,129
you have to spend looking at a keyboard

5264
03:23:40,129 --> 03:23:42,199
in which you already know where the key is.

5265
03:23:42,199 --> 03:23:43,032
You do.

5266
03:23:43,032 --> 03:23:45,319
At this point, if you've been typing for thousands of hours,

5267
03:23:45,319 --> 03:23:47,239
you know where the key is, just stop looking down,

5268
03:23:47,239 --> 03:23:48,349
you'll learn really quickly.

5269
03:23:48,349 --> 03:23:50,096
And so it's like this thing where it's like,

5270
03:23:50,096 --> 03:23:52,249
"I'm not gonna spend all that time

5271
03:23:52,249 --> 03:23:56,029
and all that mental effort looking up the thing.

5272
03:23:56,029 --> 03:23:57,199
I'm gonna just memorize...

5273
03:23:57,199 --> 03:24:00,642
I'm just gonna get it in me, and then I can go fast."

5274
03:24:00,642 --> 03:24:02,775
And it feels good.

5275
03:24:02,775 --> 03:24:03,919
And so that's how I'd kind of defeat that is

5276
03:24:03,919 --> 03:24:05,269
because now I get to do something

5277
03:24:05,269 --> 03:24:07,399
where it's like there's no more questions.

5278
03:24:07,399 --> 03:24:09,979
It's now me just expressing myself

5279
03:24:09,979 --> 03:24:12,289
into this medium and it feels really good.

5280
03:24:12,289 --> 03:24:14,689
- I'm sure there's still like things that pull at you,

5281
03:24:14,689 --> 03:24:17,006
like curiosities, distractions, like,

5282
03:24:17,006 --> 03:24:18,542
"Ooh, I wonder how..."

5283
03:24:20,359 --> 03:24:22,189
Anytime you have access to the internet,

5284
03:24:22,189 --> 03:24:23,689
you're gonna get like-

5285
03:24:23,689 --> 03:24:25,069
- Twitter's a big one on that one. Yeah.

5286
03:24:25,069 --> 03:24:27,019
- You're gonna get curious about stuff,

5287
03:24:27,019 --> 03:24:30,319
including, I guess you're speaking about everything

5288
03:24:30,319 --> 03:24:31,519
in the editors optimize,

5289
03:24:31,519 --> 03:24:33,439
but, okay, you can always improve stuff.

5290
03:24:33,439 --> 03:24:36,259
You can always find better plugins and macros

5291
03:24:36,259 --> 03:24:38,029
and, "Oh, let me... You know what,

5292
03:24:38,029 --> 03:24:40,982
this thing that took this pain point,

5293
03:24:40,982 --> 03:24:43,189
I just found this tiny pain point,

5294
03:24:43,189 --> 03:24:46,549
let me spend the next five days creating a plugin

5295
03:24:46,549 --> 03:24:48,359
for my editor or whatever the fuck

5296
03:24:49,279 --> 03:24:51,679
to remove that one pain point,"

5297
03:24:51,679 --> 03:24:54,229
when you should have just kept going

5298
03:24:54,229 --> 03:24:55,939
as opposed to taking side quests.

5299
03:24:55,939 --> 03:25:00,649
- So, I have a rule which is I do not edit my RC

5300
03:25:00,649 --> 03:25:02,359
other than some kind of cataclysmic thing,

5301
03:25:02,359 --> 03:25:03,886
like someone updates a plugin, I didn't know they updated it

5302
03:25:03,886 --> 03:25:05,629
and now there's like a hard error in my editor

5303
03:25:05,629 --> 03:25:07,222
and I have to move forward.

5304
03:25:08,449 --> 03:25:11,602
But I have a rule where I will edit my RC,

5305
03:25:11,602 --> 03:25:13,762
my Neovim RC or anything once a year.

5306
03:25:14,629 --> 03:25:17,869
Something that bothers me, I'll write it down,

5307
03:25:17,869 --> 03:25:18,956
I'll remember it. I'll be like,

5308
03:25:18,956 --> 03:25:19,999
"Okay, I want to change that,"

5309
03:25:19,999 --> 03:25:21,859
but I will just not go back to it.

5310
03:25:21,859 --> 03:25:23,929
Now, every now and then I'll break that rule if I know,

5311
03:25:23,929 --> 03:25:25,429
if like, "Oh, I want a new remap

5312
03:25:25,429 --> 03:25:26,869
to be able to do this one command

5313
03:25:26,869 --> 03:25:29,269
and that takes literally 13 seconds, like copy paste,

5314
03:25:29,269 --> 03:25:30,559
do this, bop-bop-bop, done.

5315
03:25:30,559 --> 03:25:31,579
Okay, I have this new remap,

5316
03:25:31,579 --> 03:25:33,439
it made perfect sense in this situation,

5317
03:25:33,439 --> 03:25:34,789
but I don't go plug-in exploring.

5318
03:25:34,789 --> 03:25:36,379
I don't try to solve every problem.

5319
03:25:36,379 --> 03:25:39,559
I don't want a perfect editor because that is a pursuit

5320
03:25:39,559 --> 03:25:40,969
that will never stop.

5321
03:25:40,969 --> 03:25:43,849
I just go, "This is good, good breakpoint,

5322
03:25:43,849 --> 03:25:44,682
I won't do it again."

5323
03:25:44,682 --> 03:25:48,529
So, last month I probably spent a hundred hours

5324
03:25:48,529 --> 03:25:50,719
just editing every possible thing I could

5325
03:25:50,719 --> 03:25:54,679
about how I start up my system and make...

5326
03:25:54,679 --> 03:25:58,159
I can have a computer from zero to 60 in almost no time now

5327
03:25:58,159 --> 03:25:59,826
everything the way I exactly want it,

5328
03:25:59,826 --> 03:26:02,329
Neovim and everything all perfectly set up.

5329
03:26:02,329 --> 03:26:04,759
Happy enough, I'm not going to touch that system again.

5330
03:26:04,759 --> 03:26:07,159
Maybe I'll touch it next year. Maybe I'll take a year off.

5331
03:26:07,159 --> 03:26:08,689
It's just I'm fine with that.

5332
03:26:08,689 --> 03:26:10,429
I'm fine with not being perfect.

5333
03:26:10,429 --> 03:26:13,429
- All right, zero to 60, let's talk about the perfect setup.

5334
03:26:15,199 --> 03:26:17,719
What's your perfect programming setup,

5335
03:26:17,719 --> 03:26:21,529
keyboard operating system, how many screens, chair?

5336
03:26:21,529 --> 03:26:24,469
- All right, I like all these.

5337
03:26:24,469 --> 03:26:26,149
- IDE, let's go.

5338
03:26:26,149 --> 03:26:26,982
- So, keyboard,

5339
03:26:26,982 --> 03:26:28,516
you're using my favorite keyboard right there,

5340
03:26:28,516 --> 03:26:30,052
the Kinesis Advantage.

5341
03:26:30,949 --> 03:26:33,349
Saved my career. Beautiful keyboard.

5342
03:26:33,349 --> 03:26:36,019
Concavity and thumb clusters are just so important

5343
03:26:36,019 --> 03:26:37,729
because if you really think about it,

5344
03:26:37,729 --> 03:26:39,319
especially if you're using qwerty,

5345
03:26:39,319 --> 03:26:42,109
when you're pressing the symbols on a standard keyboard,

5346
03:26:42,109 --> 03:26:43,309
you're just doing this the whole time:

5347
03:26:43,309 --> 03:26:45,409
Backspace, Enter, symbols.

5348
03:26:45,409 --> 03:26:46,242
You're just doing this,

5349
03:26:46,242 --> 03:26:48,079
and it just screws up your wrist constantly doing this.

5350
03:26:48,079 --> 03:26:50,299
And this when you're constantly doing like Ctrl and Shift.

5351
03:26:50,299 --> 03:26:51,859
And it just is like messing you up,

5352
03:26:51,859 --> 03:26:53,299
so it's just like right here.

5353
03:26:53,299 --> 03:26:54,889
That's so much nicer in life.

5354
03:26:54,889 --> 03:26:57,799
So, keyboard most important, I'd say.

5355
03:26:57,799 --> 03:26:58,699
Get that one done.

5356
03:26:58,699 --> 03:27:01,609
- For people who don't know, Kinesis keyboard,

5357
03:27:01,609 --> 03:27:04,399
I think the thing that you experience the most

5358
03:27:04,399 --> 03:27:06,529
is exactly the thing you just said now,

5359
03:27:06,529 --> 03:27:09,949
which is the backspace is really easy to press

5360
03:27:09,949 --> 03:27:12,229
versus what it is on normal keyboards.

5361
03:27:12,229 --> 03:27:17,119
So, backspace in general symbolizes you're deleting a thing,

5362
03:27:17,119 --> 03:27:19,279
it symbolizes a mistake.

5363
03:27:19,279 --> 03:27:22,309
Not symbolizes, it usually means a mistake.

5364
03:27:22,309 --> 03:27:25,899
And so not only did you just make a mistake

5365
03:27:25,899 --> 03:27:26,899
in what you were typing,

5366
03:27:26,899 --> 03:27:29,449
you also have to take a physically painful action,

5367
03:27:29,449 --> 03:27:33,649
annoying action to fix that mistake.

5368
03:27:33,649 --> 03:27:35,389
And for most of us, we make a lot of mistakes,

5369
03:27:35,389 --> 03:27:39,079
so Kinesis just makes it pleasant and fast

5370
03:27:39,079 --> 03:27:43,009
and easy physically to correct the mistake.

5371
03:27:43,009 --> 03:27:45,679
That's probably for me the number one reason of Kinesis.

5372
03:27:45,679 --> 03:27:48,166
Everything else, yeah, super plus with the macros

5373
03:27:48,166 --> 03:27:50,269
and the positioning, the concavity like you mentioned,

5374
03:27:50,269 --> 03:27:54,889
but their mistakes are pleasant.

5375
03:27:54,889 --> 03:27:57,922
- Yeah. I am on that team, so that's why I love that.

5376
03:27:58,858 --> 03:28:00,559
I would say that's one of the most important things.

5377
03:28:00,559 --> 03:28:02,779
The next thing that I find to be very, very important

5378
03:28:02,779 --> 03:28:04,819
is that one monitor.

5379
03:28:04,819 --> 03:28:06,109
I'm a one monitor kind of guy.

5380
03:28:06,109 --> 03:28:07,039
- What? Really?

5381
03:28:07,039 --> 03:28:08,899
- So, when I program, when I do anything...

5382
03:28:08,899 --> 03:28:10,819
Now, when I stream, I obviously have a second computer

5383
03:28:10,819 --> 03:28:12,666
that runs the stream because I sometimes crash my computer,

5384
03:28:12,666 --> 03:28:14,179
I have to restart or whatever.

5385
03:28:14,179 --> 03:28:16,729
So, I do have a second screen there that I put stuff up,

5386
03:28:16,729 --> 03:28:17,749
but most of the time you'll notice

5387
03:28:17,749 --> 03:28:20,539
that even when I'm streaming, you've been there,

5388
03:28:20,539 --> 03:28:24,349
I have to physically switch to the streaming chat channel

5389
03:28:24,349 --> 03:28:25,489
for me to read it, and that's

5390
03:28:25,489 --> 03:28:27,529
because I'm operating off of one screen.

5391
03:28:27,529 --> 03:28:32,529
And so I have this whole style in which I like to navigate,

5392
03:28:33,079 --> 03:28:34,399
inspired by StarCraft,

5393
03:28:34,399 --> 03:28:36,199
is that I believe in the press one key,

5394
03:28:36,199 --> 03:28:38,719
go where you want to be mentality.

5395
03:28:38,719 --> 03:28:41,664
And so everything about my setup is press one key.

5396
03:28:41,664 --> 03:28:45,289
So, when I want to go to Twitch chat, Alt+2, Twitch chat.

5397
03:28:45,289 --> 03:28:46,879
When I want to go to my browser, Alt+1.

5398
03:28:46,879 --> 03:28:47,779
That's my browser.

5399
03:28:47,779 --> 03:28:49,339
Alt+3, that's where I go to my programming.

5400
03:28:49,339 --> 03:28:51,289
That's power finger, obviously.

5401
03:28:51,289 --> 03:28:53,929
The big middle finger right there, just smash it down.

5402
03:28:53,929 --> 03:28:55,459
Alt+6 is going to be gimp,

5403
03:28:55,459 --> 03:28:57,799
so my GNU image manipulation program,

5404
03:28:57,799 --> 03:28:59,689
so if I want to draw, I go there.

5405
03:28:59,689 --> 03:29:01,699
When I used to have Slack, it was Alt+5.

5406
03:29:01,699 --> 03:29:02,929
If I have a spare terminal

5407
03:29:02,929 --> 03:29:05,359
where I need to run some extra things, that's Alt+4.

5408
03:29:05,359 --> 03:29:06,889
I had all these kind of...

5409
03:29:06,889 --> 03:29:09,349
Everything is perfectly mapped out to single-key.

5410
03:29:09,349 --> 03:29:12,229
And then when it comes down to using, say, Tmux,

5411
03:29:12,229 --> 03:29:15,379
I have all my terminals into one single terminal.

5412
03:29:15,379 --> 03:29:18,439
And now I'm able to kind of switch between there.

5413
03:29:18,439 --> 03:29:20,599
Prefix one goes to my Vim editor.

5414
03:29:20,599 --> 03:29:24,169
Whatever project I'm in, it's always the first Tmux tab,

5415
03:29:24,169 --> 03:29:25,002
if you will.

5416
03:29:25,002 --> 03:29:26,899
I'm not sure... They call it a session, but I'm not sure

5417
03:29:26,899 --> 03:29:28,802
how to describe it if you're not familiar with Tmux.

5418
03:29:28,802 --> 03:29:30,079
A tab.

5419
03:29:30,079 --> 03:29:32,449
Second one is like my spare terminal,

5420
03:29:32,449 --> 03:29:34,489
third one is my long-running process terminal,

5421
03:29:34,489 --> 03:29:36,259
my fourth one is a long-running process terminal.

5422
03:29:36,259 --> 03:29:38,479
So, I have it all set up, so every project I go to

5423
03:29:38,479 --> 03:29:40,939
automatically spawns session one: Vim,

5424
03:29:40,939 --> 03:29:42,259
session two: spare terminal,

5425
03:29:42,259 --> 03:29:44,237
session three will also open it,

5426
03:29:44,237 --> 03:29:46,489
so it's like, brrrrr, everything's just ready to rock.

5427
03:29:46,489 --> 03:29:48,439
Everything has been optimized to where I do that.

5428
03:29:48,439 --> 03:29:51,289
If I want to go to a project, it's Ctrl+F,

5429
03:29:51,289 --> 03:29:53,869
and any terminal will bring up a fuzzy find list

5430
03:29:53,869 --> 03:29:56,209
of every one of my folders on my operating system

5431
03:29:56,209 --> 03:29:58,399
in which I can go to with just a couple keystrokes

5432
03:29:58,399 --> 03:30:00,019
and, boom, I'm in that one now.

5433
03:30:00,019 --> 03:30:02,179
And so it's very oriented to find

5434
03:30:02,179 --> 03:30:03,896
where I need to be as quickly as possible.

5435
03:30:03,896 --> 03:30:04,749
- Via keyboard.

5436
03:30:04,749 --> 03:30:05,582
- Via keyboard.

5437
03:30:05,582 --> 03:30:08,149
Then in Vim I developed a plugin called Harpoon,

5438
03:30:08,149 --> 03:30:09,529
which is I press one button

5439
03:30:09,529 --> 03:30:14,529
and I can pin one of the files to like a temporary buffer.

5440
03:30:14,659 --> 03:30:18,799
I think Projectile is potentially close to this in Emacs.

5441
03:30:18,799 --> 03:30:19,909
I can't remember if Projectile...

5442
03:30:19,909 --> 03:30:23,299
I think Projectile is closer to my sessionizing script.

5443
03:30:23,299 --> 03:30:27,379
Anyways, so now I have four pinned files

5444
03:30:27,379 --> 03:30:29,239
in which I can go to any of those pinned files

5445
03:30:29,239 --> 03:30:30,739
with just a single keystroke.

5446
03:30:30,739 --> 03:30:32,449
And so now it's just like...

5447
03:30:32,449 --> 03:30:33,859
Because every time you develop a feature,

5448
03:30:33,859 --> 03:30:35,059
usually you have like three files

5449
03:30:35,059 --> 03:30:36,619
you're kind of primarily working in.

5450
03:30:36,619 --> 03:30:39,769
And I can fuzzy find for the other files and that's that,

5451
03:30:39,769 --> 03:30:41,692
but usually I just have like these three power files

5452
03:30:41,692 --> 03:30:43,579
that I'm always swapping in between.

5453
03:30:43,579 --> 03:30:45,506
And so it's like now everything is just,

5454
03:30:45,506 --> 03:30:47,232
"I want go to the browser." That's one press.

5455
03:30:47,232 --> 03:30:48,656
"I want to go to my workstation." That's one press.

5456
03:30:48,656 --> 03:30:50,149
"I want to go to a specific folder,

5457
03:30:50,149 --> 03:30:51,649
I need to change folders."

5458
03:30:51,649 --> 03:30:54,709
Sometimes you work between two different projects,

5459
03:30:54,709 --> 03:30:57,049
so in Tmux that's prefix,

5460
03:30:57,049 --> 03:30:59,539
capital L will swap between your last two.

5461
03:30:59,539 --> 03:31:00,372
So, I have alternate projects,

5462
03:31:00,372 --> 03:31:03,469
so I can even swap between projects in pretty much one key.

5463
03:31:03,469 --> 03:31:06,079
So, it's just like do-do-do, just trying to optimize it,

5464
03:31:06,079 --> 03:31:07,279
so I don't think as much,

5465
03:31:07,279 --> 03:31:10,879
because I think search fatigue is a massive fail

5466
03:31:10,879 --> 03:31:11,712
where you have to look for it.

5467
03:31:11,712 --> 03:31:14,839
When I see people on a Mac do this

5468
03:31:14,839 --> 03:31:17,059
and then explode all the different ones,

5469
03:31:17,059 --> 03:31:17,959
that gives me anxiety.

5470
03:31:17,959 --> 03:31:19,609
I'm like, "Why are you using your eyeballs

5471
03:31:19,609 --> 03:31:20,993
to search for what you want to do?"

5472
03:31:20,993 --> 03:31:22,579
Make it into a key press

5473
03:31:22,579 --> 03:31:24,949
and never think about it again, ever.

5474
03:31:24,949 --> 03:31:26,029
- You're making me think a lot

5475
03:31:26,029 --> 03:31:28,759
whether I can live with your system,

5476
03:31:28,759 --> 03:31:30,859
whether it's better because it feels better.

5477
03:31:30,859 --> 03:31:32,199
- It at least intellectually feels better.

5478
03:31:32,199 --> 03:31:33,806
It may not be great for some people.

5479
03:31:33,806 --> 03:31:35,539
- Well, there's a few profound things you said,

5480
03:31:35,539 --> 03:31:36,982
which is like really what,

5481
03:31:38,209 --> 03:31:41,989
the number of windows or tasks you're switching between,

5482
03:31:41,989 --> 03:31:42,822
whether it's programming,

5483
03:31:42,822 --> 03:31:44,239
the number of files you're working on,

5484
03:31:44,239 --> 03:31:46,689
it's small at any one time,

5485
03:31:46,689 --> 03:31:50,929
at any one space of 20 minutes or something like that.

5486
03:31:50,929 --> 03:31:52,849
So, okay, that's a profound truth.

5487
03:31:52,849 --> 03:31:54,386
Sometimes we think like,

5488
03:31:54,386 --> 03:31:56,869
"Oh I need the full freedom to search,"

5489
03:31:56,869 --> 03:31:57,702
but you don't.

5490
03:31:57,702 --> 03:32:00,379
You usually work on a very small slice.

5491
03:32:00,379 --> 03:32:02,046
But I guess the trade-off there...

5492
03:32:02,046 --> 03:32:05,149
I always have three monitors, not when I'm traveling,

5493
03:32:05,149 --> 03:32:08,509
but my happy place is three monitors.

5494
03:32:08,509 --> 03:32:11,419
It's like, do you really need all of them

5495
03:32:11,419 --> 03:32:12,799
to be present there?

5496
03:32:12,799 --> 03:32:14,449
So, you're turning your head.

5497
03:32:14,449 --> 03:32:17,929
Now, the monitors I have is two vertical ones,

5498
03:32:17,929 --> 03:32:21,739
which is just better for certain kinds of content.

5499
03:32:21,739 --> 03:32:24,166
They're positioned vertically, so you can read.

5500
03:32:24,166 --> 03:32:26,509
You can use your eyes to scan quickly.

5501
03:32:26,509 --> 03:32:27,859
- Interesting. So, I don't even do that.

5502
03:32:27,859 --> 03:32:29,059
I even have it so zoomed in

5503
03:32:29,059 --> 03:32:31,429
that I probably only have like maybe 25 lines of code

5504
03:32:31,429 --> 03:32:34,129
at any one time on my 27-inch monitor.

5505
03:32:34,129 --> 03:32:35,409
- Yeah, I think that's...

5506
03:32:37,189 --> 03:32:40,429
I think I feel fundamentally constrained

5507
03:32:40,429 --> 03:32:42,139
when I can't see more

5508
03:32:42,139 --> 03:32:46,549
because your eyes are just good at jumping.

5509
03:32:46,549 --> 03:32:48,109
Like, okay.

5510
03:32:48,109 --> 03:32:48,959
Like you could...

5511
03:32:49,806 --> 03:32:52,494
- Why not search? Why not press a couple of keystrokes?

5512
03:32:52,494 --> 03:32:55,062
Ctrl+U, Ctrl+D, jump up and down by a half page.

5513
03:32:55,062 --> 03:32:58,819
- Because the ape visual system was designed to...

5514
03:32:58,819 --> 03:33:00,712
You're loading a lot of information.

5515
03:33:02,779 --> 03:33:05,479
If every time you have to investigate this table,

5516
03:33:05,479 --> 03:33:08,662
what's on this table, you have to press a keystroke,

5517
03:33:10,339 --> 03:33:12,259
you could develop the skillset

5518
03:33:12,259 --> 03:33:15,979
that integrates that information but it's really...

5519
03:33:15,979 --> 03:33:17,239
There is an effective thing

5520
03:33:17,239 --> 03:33:19,909
where if you have a sheet of paper like this

5521
03:33:19,909 --> 03:33:22,849
and I'm looking at it,

5522
03:33:22,849 --> 03:33:26,719
my eyes will be able to load in

5523
03:33:26,719 --> 03:33:30,562
the structure of the information,

5524
03:33:31,758 --> 03:33:33,019
the topics of the information.

5525
03:33:33,019 --> 03:33:35,629
You just can do it faster, I think.

5526
03:33:35,629 --> 03:33:39,049
There's a big cost because it's an extra monitor,

5527
03:33:39,049 --> 03:33:41,509
but there is some stuff that's vertical

5528
03:33:41,509 --> 03:33:42,892
when vertically positioned.

5529
03:33:44,389 --> 03:33:45,612
See, code is an iffy one code

5530
03:33:45,612 --> 03:33:47,599
because code, you really,

5531
03:33:47,599 --> 03:33:50,682
25 lines at a time, I think you can do a lot.

5532
03:33:50,682 --> 03:33:53,659
This is more for like articles

5533
03:33:53,659 --> 03:33:57,199
and especially with visual information in them

5534
03:33:57,199 --> 03:33:59,599
or documentation, you can just jump faster.

5535
03:33:59,599 --> 03:34:00,432
But I'm trying to...

5536
03:34:00,432 --> 03:34:02,809
As you were speaking so eloquently,

5537
03:34:02,809 --> 03:34:04,106
I was like wondering,

5538
03:34:04,106 --> 03:34:09,106
"Am I just like deceiving myself that I need that?

5539
03:34:09,949 --> 03:34:12,979
Can I just keyboard shortcut-ify everything

5540
03:34:12,979 --> 03:34:15,469
and just have everything on one monitor?"

5541
03:34:15,469 --> 03:34:17,059
That's something I should probably try

5542
03:34:17,059 --> 03:34:18,229
because I'm a big proponent

5543
03:34:18,229 --> 03:34:20,599
of just automating everything with the keyboard

5544
03:34:20,599 --> 03:34:22,339
because you can just move really, really fast,

5545
03:34:22,339 --> 03:34:23,739
and you don't have to think.

5546
03:34:24,949 --> 03:34:27,922
Because I also do creative stuff,

5547
03:34:29,370 --> 03:34:33,109
whether it's recording music or video editing.

5548
03:34:33,109 --> 03:34:35,119
It's hard...

5549
03:34:35,119 --> 03:34:38,149
Some of these programs still make it super easy for you.

5550
03:34:38,149 --> 03:34:40,939
On Windows, with AutoHotkey you can do quite a lot,

5551
03:34:40,939 --> 03:34:42,559
but still there's limitations on

5552
03:34:42,559 --> 03:34:44,149
how much you can do with the keyboard.

5553
03:34:44,149 --> 03:34:47,702
So, it really is a pain in the ass to have to use the mouse,

5554
03:34:47,702 --> 03:34:49,702
but, man, you're really making me think.

5555
03:34:51,079 --> 03:34:53,269
- Even the text one, the reading one,

5556
03:34:53,269 --> 03:34:55,102
fundamentally I think I agree with you,

5557
03:34:55,102 --> 03:34:55,935
that you can see a lot more

5558
03:34:55,935 --> 03:34:58,069
and you can kind of look up and down,

5559
03:34:58,069 --> 03:34:58,909
and see those two things.

5560
03:34:58,909 --> 03:35:02,269
And probably in articles or things like that,

5561
03:35:02,269 --> 03:35:04,249
if there's a graph down here that's really big

5562
03:35:04,249 --> 03:35:05,809
that take up your whole screen plus text,

5563
03:35:05,809 --> 03:35:08,389
I could see why that would be very beneficial to zoom out,

5564
03:35:08,389 --> 03:35:09,649
to be able to have all that information,

5565
03:35:09,649 --> 03:35:12,859
but for me, I can only look at like a square inch.

5566
03:35:12,859 --> 03:35:14,719
Really, that's all my eyes can actually focus on.

5567
03:35:14,719 --> 03:35:16,132
So, when I'm reading, I'm right here.

5568
03:35:16,132 --> 03:35:18,829
Then I have to structurally try to pattern match

5569
03:35:18,829 --> 03:35:19,662
what I think the information looks like.

5570
03:35:19,662 --> 03:35:21,649
Then I have to start reading it.

5571
03:35:21,649 --> 03:35:24,469
So, I'm not exactly sure if I actually get any real benefit

5572
03:35:24,469 --> 03:35:26,479
of having a lot of stuff on screen,

5573
03:35:26,479 --> 03:35:29,419
as opposed to I can relax my eyes so much

5574
03:35:29,419 --> 03:35:30,469
I don't even have to focus.

5575
03:35:30,469 --> 03:35:34,309
The words are so big. I actually program pretty zoomed in.

5576
03:35:34,309 --> 03:35:36,829
My text is bigger than this when I program,

5577
03:35:36,829 --> 03:35:39,979
and so it's just that it's so comfortable,

5578
03:35:39,979 --> 03:35:43,135
I don't even have to exert any effort to read the code.

5579
03:35:43,135 --> 03:35:44,749
- But you have to kind of train your brain to know

5580
03:35:44,749 --> 03:35:49,749
that you can navigate spatially using keys.

5581
03:35:50,599 --> 03:35:53,539
- Yeah, Neovim by the way.

5582
03:35:53,539 --> 03:35:56,119
- Oh, maybe it has everything to do with Neovim. Okay.

5583
03:35:56,119 --> 03:35:58,189
- All right. And then Neovim is obviously the next big one.

5584
03:35:58,189 --> 03:35:59,209
I love Neovim.

5585
03:35:59,209 --> 03:36:02,269
Reason being is that I think you can make all the arguments

5586
03:36:02,269 --> 03:36:03,979
that you want about which editor is the best.

5587
03:36:03,979 --> 03:36:05,479
I do not think you can make an argument

5588
03:36:05,479 --> 03:36:07,129
that Vim motions aren't superior.

5589
03:36:07,129 --> 03:36:09,619
- Here we go. Can you explain Vim motions?

5590
03:36:09,619 --> 03:36:10,452
What is this?

5591
03:36:10,452 --> 03:36:11,285
So, Neovim.

5592
03:36:11,285 --> 03:36:13,821
Vim is an old school editor.

5593
03:36:13,821 --> 03:36:14,741
Neovim-

5594
03:36:14,741 --> 03:36:16,369
- It's a modern take on an old school editor.

5595
03:36:16,369 --> 03:36:19,459
- Yeah. And what's ELI5?

5596
03:36:24,079 --> 03:36:26,507
What does it take to work with Neovim?

5597
03:36:26,507 --> 03:36:27,340
- Oh, okay.

5598
03:36:27,340 --> 03:36:28,549
I thought you were talking about a Vim motion there.

5599
03:36:28,549 --> 03:36:29,382
That's how...

5600
03:36:30,306 --> 03:36:32,276
I know, but you know that meme that's just like,

5601
03:36:32,276 --> 03:36:34,639
"Hey, Jarvis, can I tell you about Vim motions?"

5602
03:36:34,639 --> 03:36:36,199
Because they can't fit anything else in their head

5603
03:36:36,199 --> 03:36:37,609
because they only have Vim motions.

5604
03:36:37,609 --> 03:36:39,769
You said EL5, explain it like I'm five,

5605
03:36:39,769 --> 03:36:40,602
but in my head it's like,

5606
03:36:40,602 --> 03:36:42,439
"Okay, E is jump to the end of the word,

5607
03:36:42,439 --> 03:36:43,358
L is the one more..."

5608
03:36:43,358 --> 03:36:45,829
Dude, I'm so broken that I'm like, "Okay, Vim motion,"

5609
03:36:45,829 --> 03:36:46,829
when I hear letters.

5610
03:36:47,749 --> 03:36:51,199
Yeah, so, you can think of it like this is that

5611
03:36:51,199 --> 03:36:55,969
Vim has a language to describe movements in text

5612
03:36:55,969 --> 03:36:59,149
because its primary mode of operation is manipulating

5613
03:36:59,149 --> 03:37:00,709
or editing text.

5614
03:37:00,709 --> 03:37:03,919
So, it is a well-thought through set of movements,

5615
03:37:03,919 --> 03:37:05,689
deleting, yanking, pasting,

5616
03:37:05,689 --> 03:37:08,869
copying, all that kind of stuff that goes in,

5617
03:37:08,869 --> 03:37:10,609
motions that are optimized for working

5618
03:37:10,609 --> 03:37:12,302
with pretty much code.

5619
03:37:12,302 --> 03:37:14,629
A good example, say you have three lines of code

5620
03:37:14,629 --> 03:37:16,099
you want to delete.

5621
03:37:16,099 --> 03:37:18,679
If you're in VS Code, take your little beautiful mouse,

5622
03:37:18,679 --> 03:37:20,779
highlight those things, press the backspace.

5623
03:37:20,779 --> 03:37:22,849
That's lovely. Your hand left the keyboard.

5624
03:37:22,849 --> 03:37:25,249
Very simple to do though. It's very beginner friendly.

5625
03:37:25,249 --> 03:37:27,019
I was a huge Vim hater, by the way,

5626
03:37:27,019 --> 03:37:28,549
so I just want you to know that before we go into this.

5627
03:37:28,549 --> 03:37:30,799
I was probably the biggest Vim hater.

5628
03:37:30,799 --> 03:37:34,429
If there was Saul to Apostle Paul,

5629
03:37:34,429 --> 03:37:36,889
I am like the Saul to Apostle Paul of Vim,

5630
03:37:36,889 --> 03:37:39,619
just so you can see how big the gap was.

5631
03:37:39,619 --> 03:37:41,359
Or you can do something that's like...

5632
03:37:41,359 --> 03:37:42,799
I don't know what the VS Code shortcut is,

5633
03:37:42,799 --> 03:37:44,779
but I'm sure there's some keys you can press

5634
03:37:44,779 --> 03:37:46,249
to delete the current line you're on.

5635
03:37:46,249 --> 03:37:48,709
Delete, delete, delete, you can just do that.

5636
03:37:48,709 --> 03:37:51,469
In Vim, I can go DAP, delete around paragraph.

5637
03:37:51,469 --> 03:37:52,999
All contiguous code in that thing.

5638
03:37:52,999 --> 03:37:54,739
I'm going to delete, so D,

5639
03:37:54,739 --> 03:37:57,019
then I can choose my motion I want to take,

5640
03:37:57,019 --> 03:37:58,639
AP, around paragraph.

5641
03:37:58,639 --> 03:38:02,389
Or maybe I want to DF, meaning jump up to the next character

5642
03:38:02,389 --> 03:38:04,039
that matches the next character I'm going to press.

5643
03:38:04,039 --> 03:38:06,619
So, DF opening parenthesis will delete everything

5644
03:38:06,619 --> 03:38:09,439
from your cursor up to the first opening parenthesis.

5645
03:38:09,439 --> 03:38:11,449
So, you get to describe your motion

5646
03:38:11,449 --> 03:38:12,439
in these little keystrokes.

5647
03:38:12,439 --> 03:38:14,299
And as you get really good...

5648
03:38:14,299 --> 03:38:16,099
You've seen people that can master Fortnite,

5649
03:38:16,099 --> 03:38:17,989
it's the same thing with mastering Vim motions.

5650
03:38:17,989 --> 03:38:19,669
When you get so good, you no longer think

5651
03:38:19,669 --> 03:38:21,169
about each individual movement,

5652
03:38:21,169 --> 03:38:22,969
and instead you're just like, "Get rid of the paragraph,

5653
03:38:22,969 --> 03:38:25,819
jump here, jump this, highlight this, yank this, do this,"

5654
03:38:25,819 --> 03:38:29,209
it becomes so fast that you can superiorly edit text

5655
03:38:29,209 --> 03:38:30,349
at a very fast rate.

5656
03:38:30,349 --> 03:38:31,669
And there comes a point

5657
03:38:31,669 --> 03:38:33,799
when you know your language really well,

5658
03:38:33,799 --> 03:38:36,079
you know the problem you're really working on really well,

5659
03:38:36,079 --> 03:38:38,179
where editing text and getting code out

5660
03:38:38,179 --> 03:38:40,579
actually becomes one of the many bottlenecks.

5661
03:38:40,579 --> 03:38:42,162
People always talk about, "Well, most of the time I think."

5662
03:38:42,162 --> 03:38:44,719
Most of the time I'm not thinking, I'm programming.

5663
03:38:44,719 --> 03:38:46,669
I know what I want to do, I want to go as fast as possible

5664
03:38:46,669 --> 03:38:48,139
because I've been just doing it for so long

5665
03:38:48,139 --> 03:38:50,869
and I'm so familiar with the general space

5666
03:38:50,869 --> 03:38:53,119
that it becomes a huge problem for me.

5667
03:38:53,119 --> 03:38:53,952
I cannot tell you how many times

5668
03:38:53,952 --> 03:38:56,152
that I've been purely bottlenecked by the fact

5669
03:38:56,152 --> 03:38:58,199
that I just can't type fast enough

5670
03:38:59,196 --> 03:39:01,129
and I just need to get it out of my head

5671
03:39:01,129 --> 03:39:02,086
onto the text editor.

5672
03:39:02,086 --> 03:39:05,629
And so that's why I think Vim motions are superior

5673
03:39:05,629 --> 03:39:06,619
in all aspects.

5674
03:39:06,619 --> 03:39:08,719
Keep your hands on the keyboard, on the home row,

5675
03:39:08,719 --> 03:39:11,449
and it can manipulate text in very wide and fast ways.

5676
03:39:11,449 --> 03:39:13,609
- Oh, so, this is not just about writing text,

5677
03:39:13,609 --> 03:39:14,659
this is about modifying text.

5678
03:39:14,659 --> 03:39:16,129
It's primarily about modifying text.

5679
03:39:16,129 --> 03:39:17,779
- Yes. - And I'm sure

5680
03:39:17,779 --> 03:39:19,729
that most editors including Emacs,

5681
03:39:19,729 --> 03:39:22,459
including VS Code can do all those same things,

5682
03:39:22,459 --> 03:39:25,189
but there is something...

5683
03:39:25,189 --> 03:39:28,249
They just don't encourage you to discover those things.

5684
03:39:28,249 --> 03:39:31,909
That's like an important thing about a lot of technologies

5685
03:39:31,909 --> 03:39:34,429
and programming languages

5686
03:39:34,429 --> 03:39:37,342
that a lot of them can do a lot of the stuff,

5687
03:39:38,179 --> 03:39:40,609
but it's something about whether it's the community

5688
03:39:40,609 --> 03:39:42,769
or the style of the language or anything like this

5689
03:39:42,769 --> 03:39:46,489
that encourages you to not be lazy in the beginning

5690
03:39:46,489 --> 03:39:50,329
and learn the fast way to edit text,

5691
03:39:50,329 --> 03:39:54,169
in this particular example, how to use the keyboard.

5692
03:39:54,169 --> 03:39:58,429
That's a fascinating just reality of how technology is used.

5693
03:39:58,429 --> 03:40:00,709
You want to be encouraged to find the fast thing

5694
03:40:00,709 --> 03:40:04,039
as quickly as possible so that long term

5695
03:40:04,039 --> 03:40:06,649
it's efficient and fun to use the thing.

5696
03:40:06,649 --> 03:40:09,769
- It takes a long time for dividends, like a long time,

5697
03:40:09,769 --> 03:40:11,929
but on top of that, notice I didn't say Vim.

5698
03:40:11,929 --> 03:40:13,099
I'm not saying, "Go use Vim,"

5699
03:40:13,099 --> 03:40:14,536
I'm saying, "Vim motions."

5700
03:40:15,409 --> 03:40:18,109
Let me give you one more example. I'm a big fan.

5701
03:40:18,109 --> 03:40:22,219
Let's say you have a line that contains some variable,

5702
03:40:22,219 --> 03:40:23,869
some function you're calling something

5703
03:40:23,869 --> 03:40:26,329
that takes in a string. And you need to do that again,

5704
03:40:26,329 --> 03:40:30,319
so you would typically copy that line,

5705
03:40:30,319 --> 03:40:31,999
you'd paste that line below,

5706
03:40:31,999 --> 03:40:34,639
you'd go into the string and you'd change the string.

5707
03:40:34,639 --> 03:40:36,139
Let's say it's calling some sort of configuration,

5708
03:40:36,139 --> 03:40:37,279
you need to call it three times

5709
03:40:37,279 --> 03:40:39,109
with three different configuring strings.

5710
03:40:39,109 --> 03:40:42,106
In Vim, I like to do shift-V to highlight the whole line,

5711
03:40:42,106 --> 03:40:43,099
and then Y.

5712
03:40:43,099 --> 03:40:45,199
Some people do YY, but I don't like to do double ones.

5713
03:40:45,199 --> 03:40:46,789
I like to be able to do two different fingers

5714
03:40:46,789 --> 03:40:50,209
because you can do that way faster than one finger twice.

5715
03:40:50,209 --> 03:40:51,529
It's just a little optimization for me

5716
03:40:51,529 --> 03:40:54,379
because you can't press that as fast.

5717
03:40:54,379 --> 03:40:56,569
So, anyways, I'm very optimized in my approach,

5718
03:40:56,569 --> 03:40:58,729
so I yank the line, paste the line.

5719
03:40:58,729 --> 03:41:00,949
CI double-quotes will delete everything

5720
03:41:00,949 --> 03:41:02,839
inside the first occurring string.

5721
03:41:02,839 --> 03:41:05,029
Then I can type the string, escape, save.

5722
03:41:05,029 --> 03:41:07,309
And so it's like so optimized

5723
03:41:07,309 --> 03:41:09,319
that I can just jump so fast in between that,

5724
03:41:09,319 --> 03:41:11,719
whereas the copying and pasting line

5725
03:41:11,719 --> 03:41:12,919
is probably the same speed,

5726
03:41:12,919 --> 03:41:14,689
but the navigating to the string,

5727
03:41:14,689 --> 03:41:17,299
deleting what's currently in the string, and then...

5728
03:41:17,299 --> 03:41:19,156
That's such a fast motion in Vim,

5729
03:41:19,156 --> 03:41:20,719
and I just do that all the time.

5730
03:41:20,719 --> 03:41:23,064
- To backtrack, really dumb question,

5731
03:41:23,064 --> 03:41:27,199
CI, what's the difference between typing the letters

5732
03:41:27,199 --> 03:41:29,599
and using the letters to navigate and edit?

5733
03:41:29,599 --> 03:41:31,249
How do you switch between the two modes?

5734
03:41:31,249 --> 03:41:32,359
- Okay, so insert mode means

5735
03:41:32,359 --> 03:41:34,009
that you're just putting in text,

5736
03:41:34,009 --> 03:41:37,399
and then normal mode means that you're moving your cursor.

5737
03:41:37,399 --> 03:41:38,929
- [Lex] And how do you switch between the two?

5738
03:41:38,929 --> 03:41:43,159
- Escape. Escape goes from insert mode into normal mode.

5739
03:41:43,159 --> 03:41:45,579
And to go into insert mode press I

5740
03:41:45,579 --> 03:41:47,509
to take your current cursor and go to the beginning,

5741
03:41:47,509 --> 03:41:48,919
A to go to the end of the year Cursor,

5742
03:41:48,919 --> 03:41:50,239
capital A to go to the end of the line,

5743
03:41:50,239 --> 03:41:51,949
capital I to go to the beginning of line,

5744
03:41:51,949 --> 03:41:54,069
O to put a new line below and then put your cursor

5745
03:41:54,069 --> 03:41:55,699
at the proper intended for the language,

5746
03:41:55,699 --> 03:41:57,829
Shift+O to shift your current line down,

5747
03:41:57,829 --> 03:41:59,569
and then put a new line in.

5748
03:41:59,569 --> 03:42:00,978
You can see, there's a lot-

5749
03:42:00,978 --> 03:42:02,809
- So, you're pressing Escape a lot.

5750
03:42:02,809 --> 03:42:04,089
- Yeah, I mapped mine. I do Ctrl+C.

5751
03:42:04,089 --> 03:42:07,489
Ctrl+C does the same thing except for in one edge case.

5752
03:42:07,489 --> 03:42:08,509
People hate that.

5753
03:42:08,509 --> 03:42:10,039
I got used to it just due to the fact

5754
03:42:10,039 --> 03:42:11,059
that I was using IntelliJ,

5755
03:42:11,059 --> 03:42:13,219
and I really hate pressing the Escape key,

5756
03:42:13,219 --> 03:42:14,479
so I just got used to pressing escapee.

5757
03:42:14,479 --> 03:42:16,399
- That seems like an essential thing to do

5758
03:42:16,399 --> 03:42:19,489
if you're using Neovim to map escape to something.

5759
03:42:19,489 --> 03:42:21,559
- Cap lock would be your standard go-to.

5760
03:42:21,559 --> 03:42:24,169
- Oh yeah, I map it too. Cool. I got you. I got you.

5761
03:42:24,169 --> 03:42:26,056
- Yeah, so then it's just really easy to press it,

5762
03:42:26,056 --> 03:42:29,059
and boom, boom, boom, not a big deal at all.

5763
03:42:29,059 --> 03:42:31,339
But yeah, I think that if you're willing to learn it,

5764
03:42:31,339 --> 03:42:32,389
Vim motions are superior,

5765
03:42:32,389 --> 03:42:33,859
but if you're not willing to learn it,

5766
03:42:33,859 --> 03:42:34,969
then they're not superior.

5767
03:42:34,969 --> 03:42:36,679
You should just not do it.

5768
03:42:36,679 --> 03:42:38,569
If you're willing to endure pain, it's good.

5769
03:42:38,569 --> 03:42:40,579
If you're not, it's actually way worse.

5770
03:42:40,579 --> 03:42:42,349
It's 100 worse.

5771
03:42:42,349 --> 03:42:45,139
- Right, so if you like pain, you use Neovim.

5772
03:42:45,139 --> 03:42:46,095
Totally. I understand.

5773
03:42:46,095 --> 03:42:46,928
- You're totally on-board. - 100%.

5774
03:42:46,928 --> 03:42:47,761
- See, now you get it.

5775
03:42:47,761 --> 03:42:50,119
- If you like joy, you use Emacs.

5776
03:42:50,119 --> 03:42:53,569
- Sorry, sorry, did Emacs ever get a good text editor?

5777
03:42:53,569 --> 03:42:54,919
I know they're a great operating system,

5778
03:42:54,919 --> 03:42:56,989
but I never caught up if they got a good text editor.

5779
03:42:56,989 --> 03:42:58,132
- Operating system?

5780
03:42:59,239 --> 03:43:01,369
I think you've been miseducated my friend.

5781
03:43:01,369 --> 03:43:03,969
So, at least 30 minutes on Emacs versus Neovim

5782
03:43:03,969 --> 03:43:07,189
is what Reddit requested.

5783
03:43:07,189 --> 03:43:08,779
Have you actually used Emacs

5784
03:43:08,779 --> 03:43:10,879
in order to be able to talk so much shit or no?

5785
03:43:10,879 --> 03:43:12,349
- I used it for a year.

5786
03:43:12,349 --> 03:43:13,409
- You used it for a year?

5787
03:43:13,409 --> 03:43:16,009
- Yeah, yeah. Doom Emacs, Spacemacs and regular Emacs.

5788
03:43:16,009 --> 03:43:18,919
- But you don't even know Lisp, so did you really use it?

5789
03:43:18,919 --> 03:43:21,296
- I kind of hacked my way through kind of like,

5790
03:43:21,296 --> 03:43:22,962
"Okay, so this is how to configure..."

5791
03:43:22,962 --> 03:43:25,306
You can kind of get your way through and do all that.

5792
03:43:25,306 --> 03:43:28,609
- So, you recommend to mastering Neovim

5793
03:43:28,609 --> 03:43:30,529
and really learn the depths of it,

5794
03:43:30,529 --> 03:43:32,689
but Emacs is okay to just kind of use

5795
03:43:32,689 --> 03:43:34,579
before making a judgment.

5796
03:43:34,579 --> 03:43:36,499
I think everybody... - You got me on that one?

5797
03:43:36,499 --> 03:43:40,459
- Yeah, no, and what's Neovim written? It's Lua?

5798
03:43:40,459 --> 03:43:42,319
- Yeah, so Lua would be the configuration language,

5799
03:43:42,319 --> 03:43:43,189
but you have...

5800
03:43:43,189 --> 03:43:45,439
It's written in C, but you have Lua 4.

5801
03:43:45,439 --> 03:43:46,939
And Lua is just a dead simple language.

5802
03:43:46,939 --> 03:43:48,229
Anyone can program Lua.

5803
03:43:48,229 --> 03:43:50,299
- I actually don't know why...

5804
03:43:50,299 --> 03:43:51,889
I think it's because my love for Lisp

5805
03:43:51,889 --> 03:43:52,789
that I went with Emacs.

5806
03:43:52,789 --> 03:43:56,362
I think you just choose a path and you walk down that path.

5807
03:43:57,499 --> 03:44:02,499
And because there's just such a vibrant,

5808
03:44:02,659 --> 03:44:04,549
intense battle between the two communities,

5809
03:44:04,549 --> 03:44:06,439
you just start fighting

5810
03:44:06,439 --> 03:44:08,659
just because everybody else is fighting.

5811
03:44:08,659 --> 03:44:11,899
And then one day you're an old warrior on a horse,

5812
03:44:11,899 --> 03:44:15,016
and you're wondering, "What was this all for?"

5813
03:44:16,159 --> 03:44:19,369
And it's quite sad,

5814
03:44:19,369 --> 03:44:20,299
in all seriousness,

5815
03:44:20,299 --> 03:44:22,852
that I haven't to this day tried Neovim.

5816
03:44:24,859 --> 03:44:26,509
I think because there is a learning curve.

5817
03:44:26,509 --> 03:44:28,999
There's a learning curve to a lot of these editors.

5818
03:44:28,999 --> 03:44:30,789
- Yeah. To really learn it.

5819
03:44:30,789 --> 03:44:31,846
- To really learn it.

5820
03:44:31,846 --> 03:44:34,939
And I think this is some of the criticism

5821
03:44:34,939 --> 03:44:38,779
of maybe VS Code or Sublime or Atom

5822
03:44:38,779 --> 03:44:41,059
that it's so easy to not learn it,

5823
03:44:41,059 --> 03:44:44,299
to just kind of halfass use it.

5824
03:44:44,299 --> 03:44:47,719
And there is a big benefit to having editors

5825
03:44:47,719 --> 03:44:49,789
that force you to have some learning curve,

5826
03:44:49,789 --> 03:44:52,492
where you take the art,

5827
03:44:53,329 --> 03:44:57,139
the science, the procedure of editing seriously.

5828
03:44:57,139 --> 03:44:58,849
Because you spend so much time in it,

5829
03:44:58,849 --> 03:45:02,119
you might as well learn how to use the thing.

5830
03:45:02,119 --> 03:45:03,529
- My big takeaway really,

5831
03:45:03,529 --> 03:45:05,749
what I'm trying to say with all these words is

5832
03:45:05,749 --> 03:45:08,089
that I honestly don't actually think that...

5833
03:45:08,089 --> 03:45:10,969
The editor obviously does not make the programmer,

5834
03:45:10,969 --> 03:45:13,609
but I think it says a lot about your character

5835
03:45:13,609 --> 03:45:15,469
as a programmer if you don't know

5836
03:45:15,469 --> 03:45:17,182
how to use your editor well.

5837
03:45:18,529 --> 03:45:20,029
There's something about a person

5838
03:45:20,029 --> 03:45:22,639
who's willing to commit their life to programming,

5839
03:45:22,639 --> 03:45:27,109
and spending literally 50,000 hours

5840
03:45:27,109 --> 03:45:29,599
doing an activity over the course of their lifetime,

5841
03:45:29,599 --> 03:45:31,459
and never take the time to learn their editor

5842
03:45:31,459 --> 03:45:32,929
through and through.

5843
03:45:32,929 --> 03:45:34,129
It just seems strange.

5844
03:45:34,129 --> 03:45:35,959
You'd never see that in another world,

5845
03:45:35,959 --> 03:45:38,179
where people would be able to build something

5846
03:45:38,179 --> 03:45:40,279
or do something and just completely forget

5847
03:45:40,279 --> 03:45:41,112
how these things work,

5848
03:45:41,112 --> 03:45:44,329
and only just focus on one part of their craft.

5849
03:45:44,329 --> 03:45:46,519
And so, to me, it's just like it doesn't matter

5850
03:45:46,519 --> 03:45:50,149
how you use it, I want to see the person

5851
03:45:50,149 --> 03:45:51,799
that just knows how to use it,

5852
03:45:51,799 --> 03:45:53,089
and they know how to use it well.

5853
03:45:53,089 --> 03:45:55,099
When there's a problem, they can say why the problem exists,

5854
03:45:55,099 --> 03:45:56,329
and then go and fix the problem.

5855
03:45:56,329 --> 03:45:57,995
To me, that's like, There you go. You've done it.

5856
03:45:57,995 --> 03:46:01,519
You now know your tool, go forth and conquer with said tool.

5857
03:46:01,519 --> 03:46:04,122
- Especially for tools you use a lot.

5858
03:46:04,122 --> 03:46:04,955
(ThePrimeagen chuckles)

5859
03:46:04,955 --> 03:46:07,699
You have to look at your whole life, your life, whatever,

5860
03:46:07,699 --> 03:46:11,089
if you're a developer or anything,

5861
03:46:11,089 --> 03:46:13,849
what is the thing you do a lot?

5862
03:46:13,849 --> 03:46:14,749
- Meetings.

5863
03:46:14,749 --> 03:46:17,149
- Yeah, yeah.

5864
03:46:17,149 --> 03:46:18,079
- Sorry. Keep going, keep going.

5865
03:46:18,079 --> 03:46:21,469
- Ask a question like: how can this be done a lot better?

5866
03:46:21,469 --> 03:46:24,589
Because every single day you do this

5867
03:46:24,589 --> 03:46:25,702
for hours a day,

5868
03:46:27,169 --> 03:46:29,989
how many hours did you spend on thinking

5869
03:46:29,989 --> 03:46:33,109
how to do this better or whether to do it at all,

5870
03:46:33,109 --> 03:46:34,309
in the case of meetings?

5871
03:46:36,169 --> 03:46:38,719
People surprisingly just don't do this enough.

5872
03:46:38,719 --> 03:46:41,089
I see this, just to go back to jujitsu,

5873
03:46:41,089 --> 03:46:42,859
there's a lot of people that show up

5874
03:46:42,859 --> 03:46:46,579
and do jujitsu or martial arts, and they do it the same way

5875
03:46:46,579 --> 03:46:47,599
over and over and over,

5876
03:46:47,599 --> 03:46:49,429
and they invest tremendous amount of energy.

5877
03:46:49,429 --> 03:46:51,236
And they don't ask like,

5878
03:46:51,236 --> 03:46:54,499
"How do I do it differently to improve faster?"

5879
03:46:54,499 --> 03:46:56,539
In the case of jujitsu or any kind of sport,

5880
03:46:56,539 --> 03:46:58,792
same with practicing the piano or the guitar,

5881
03:47:00,655 --> 03:47:03,659
they just religiously put in a lot of time

5882
03:47:04,549 --> 03:47:07,519
and derive a lot of joy from getting better.

5883
03:47:07,519 --> 03:47:09,866
They don't enough ask the meta question of like,

5884
03:47:09,866 --> 03:47:12,139
"How can I do this better?"

5885
03:47:12,139 --> 03:47:15,049
And with editors, it's surprisingly

5886
03:47:15,049 --> 03:47:17,449
how often people do just that.

5887
03:47:17,449 --> 03:47:20,809
With typing, it's surprising how many people do just that.

5888
03:47:20,809 --> 03:47:25,609
Like you said, they're pecking or looking down.

5889
03:47:25,609 --> 03:47:29,689
It's like the quality of life improvement you can have

5890
03:47:29,689 --> 03:47:31,879
by learning to touch type,

5891
03:47:31,879 --> 03:47:33,679
by just like typing without looking.

5892
03:47:34,879 --> 03:47:36,349
It's immeasurable.

5893
03:47:36,349 --> 03:47:37,789
You're bringing a lot of joy to your life

5894
03:47:37,789 --> 03:47:40,219
because all of us are typing a lot.

5895
03:47:40,219 --> 03:47:43,609
And the reason, by the way,

5896
03:47:43,609 --> 03:47:46,669
I was extremely efficient with Emacs.

5897
03:47:46,669 --> 03:47:49,459
I'm sure you know, all jokes aside,

5898
03:47:49,459 --> 03:47:54,459
it feels like Neovim has more room

5899
03:47:54,529 --> 03:47:57,319
for the kind of efficiency I've had with Emacs

5900
03:47:57,319 --> 03:47:59,929
to be able to move really fast as you described me to edit.

5901
03:47:59,929 --> 03:48:01,099
There is a real joy.

5902
03:48:01,099 --> 03:48:02,782
It's not just efficiency,

5903
03:48:04,963 --> 03:48:06,769
it's a freedom that you can get

5904
03:48:06,769 --> 03:48:09,169
when you get really good with an editor.

5905
03:48:09,169 --> 03:48:12,749
The reason I chose to go with VS Code is it felt like

5906
03:48:13,879 --> 03:48:18,879
there's going to be an acceleration of features

5907
03:48:19,459 --> 03:48:21,259
to which Neovim or Emacs

5908
03:48:21,259 --> 03:48:23,089
will not be able to catch up, in the...

5909
03:48:23,089 --> 03:48:24,469
And I don't mean in the next five years,

5910
03:48:24,469 --> 03:48:25,942
I mean in the next 30 years.

5911
03:48:26,839 --> 03:48:29,689
And it felt like I almost wanted to take the pain

5912
03:48:29,689 --> 03:48:31,456
of learning new editors constantly

5913
03:48:31,456 --> 03:48:33,529
and just switching and learning that,

5914
03:48:33,529 --> 03:48:36,216
because I was getting so comfortable in Emacs,

5915
03:48:36,216 --> 03:48:38,719
with this Kinesis keyboard, everything, all the shortcuts,

5916
03:48:38,719 --> 03:48:39,869
I know how to program, and it felt like this is not...

5917
03:48:42,649 --> 03:48:44,839
Neovim will not be here in 50 years.

5918
03:48:44,839 --> 03:48:46,669
Possibly might be, I don't know,

5919
03:48:46,669 --> 03:48:48,799
but it felt like you want to learn

5920
03:48:48,799 --> 03:48:52,159
these constant different technologies.

5921
03:48:52,159 --> 03:48:54,602
Cursor is a great example of that.

5922
03:48:54,602 --> 03:48:56,779
I primarily am using Cursor now.

5923
03:48:56,779 --> 03:48:58,852
I go back between VS Code and Cursor.

5924
03:49:00,049 --> 03:49:03,682
Just the skill of using AI is a real skill,

5925
03:49:06,139 --> 03:49:08,569
from the shortcuts to the timing

5926
03:49:08,569 --> 03:49:11,719
to the layout of the windows to how I think about

5927
03:49:11,719 --> 03:49:15,439
where, when and how to use the AI that doesn't distract me,

5928
03:49:15,439 --> 03:49:16,879
that it empowers me,

5929
03:49:16,879 --> 03:49:19,339
not just for the fuck of it or for the fun of it,

5930
03:49:19,339 --> 03:49:21,889
for the actual measure of productivity.

5931
03:49:21,889 --> 03:49:22,722
It's a skill.

5932
03:49:22,722 --> 03:49:25,939
And I feel like I would be stuck

5933
03:49:25,939 --> 03:49:30,229
in a local maximum of comfort if I stayed with Emacs.

5934
03:49:30,229 --> 03:49:33,709
And maybe the same should be true for me with Neovim.

5935
03:49:33,709 --> 03:49:35,149
I should try it seriously.

5936
03:49:35,149 --> 03:49:38,449
I'm sure there's a plugin, like a copilot type of situation

5937
03:49:38,449 --> 03:49:39,979
that you could set up with Neovim.

5938
03:49:39,979 --> 03:49:41,989
I should possibly consider that.

5939
03:49:41,989 --> 03:49:44,889
But Cursor is doing a lot of really fascinating stuff

5940
03:49:44,889 --> 03:49:49,469
on the IDE side, not just sort of generate code

5941
03:49:50,329 --> 03:49:54,229
and edit that code manually,

5942
03:49:54,229 --> 03:49:57,829
it's like continuously be able to rewrite code.

5943
03:49:57,829 --> 03:50:00,439
It's the idea of tab, tab, tab, tab,

5944
03:50:00,439 --> 03:50:03,559
move the Cursor around, but also modify parts of code

5945
03:50:03,559 --> 03:50:05,599
and do the diff really nicely,

5946
03:50:05,599 --> 03:50:07,459
that whether it's Cursor or VS Code

5947
03:50:07,459 --> 03:50:10,819
that wins that battle out with Copilot, I don't know.

5948
03:50:10,819 --> 03:50:14,089
But that feels like a fundamentally different experience

5949
03:50:14,089 --> 03:50:16,789
than the really efficient, joyful experience

5950
03:50:16,789 --> 03:50:17,839
that you just described

5951
03:50:17,839 --> 03:50:20,839
in your selling me on this is Neovim.

5952
03:50:20,839 --> 03:50:23,779
That doesn't have an AI in the picture,

5953
03:50:23,779 --> 03:50:27,079
obviously immediately, but you can, yeah, absolutely.

5954
03:50:27,079 --> 03:50:28,439
- I would 100% agree that

5955
03:50:30,049 --> 03:50:33,229
Cursor seems like such a cool product.

5956
03:50:33,229 --> 03:50:35,569
I actually think there's a lot of really neat things

5957
03:50:35,569 --> 03:50:37,077
coming down with all of that.

5958
03:50:37,077 --> 03:50:39,559
And I could change from Neovim.

5959
03:50:39,559 --> 03:50:41,339
I don't use Neovim because I love Neovim,

5960
03:50:41,339 --> 03:50:44,389
I use Neovim because I love the instrument I play.

5961
03:50:44,389 --> 03:50:46,549
And so it's like if Cursor can meet those needs,

5962
03:50:46,549 --> 03:50:47,959
I could see myself moving over.

5963
03:50:47,959 --> 03:50:51,889
I don't have some sort of obsessed attachment with it.

5964
03:50:51,889 --> 03:50:55,556
I am curious though that every time I use AI...

5965
03:50:55,556 --> 03:50:57,259
I think I just have skill issues.

5966
03:50:57,259 --> 03:50:58,999
I think I'm just so riddled with skill issues

5967
03:50:58,999 --> 03:51:01,818
when it comes to using AI, I have yet to be able to use it

5968
03:51:01,818 --> 03:51:03,829
in a way that I really love it.

5969
03:51:03,829 --> 03:51:05,449
- We'll talk about it, but before then-

5970
03:51:05,449 --> 03:51:08,629
- Oh, ball to sit on. I forgot to say that, ball to sit on.

5971
03:51:08,629 --> 03:51:10,339
Desk needs to be properly heighted.

5972
03:51:10,339 --> 03:51:13,729
One monitor. Eyes should be two-thirds way up the screen.

5973
03:51:13,729 --> 03:51:15,679
I don't like to turn my head.

5974
03:51:15,679 --> 03:51:20,679
I prefer my hands in a pistol neutral position.

5975
03:51:21,139 --> 03:51:22,099
And there we go.

5976
03:51:22,099 --> 03:51:23,629
- A ball to sit on. Yoga ball.

5977
03:51:23,629 --> 03:51:24,462
- Yoga ball.

5978
03:51:24,462 --> 03:51:25,295
- What's that about?

5979
03:51:25,295 --> 03:51:27,349
- It just helps just maintain good posture,

5980
03:51:27,349 --> 03:51:29,862
because when I have something to lean against, I do this.

5981
03:51:30,799 --> 03:51:33,139
- You're for hours sitting without...

5982
03:51:33,139 --> 03:51:34,279
Wait, what are you doing?

5983
03:51:34,279 --> 03:51:36,979
- I sit on the ball, and then I bounce.

5984
03:51:36,979 --> 03:51:38,763
- Is your back leaning on a thing?

5985
03:51:38,763 --> 03:51:39,596
- No.

5986
03:51:39,596 --> 03:51:40,429
- What the fuck?

5987
03:51:40,429 --> 03:51:41,396
- Well, how else do you-

5988
03:51:43,244 --> 03:51:46,669
- You're the only person in the world sitting on a yoga ball

5989
03:51:46,669 --> 03:51:49,909
as you program for hours. You do realize this, right?

5990
03:51:49,909 --> 03:51:50,872
- It feels great.

5991
03:51:52,189 --> 03:51:56,119
The problem is whenever I get a back, I just slouch

5992
03:51:56,119 --> 03:51:57,799
and I find myself just getting uncomfortable.

5993
03:51:57,799 --> 03:52:00,289
And I'm like, "I'm uncomfortable."

5994
03:52:00,289 --> 03:52:02,752
My shoulders are getting goofed up.

5995
03:52:03,619 --> 03:52:06,469
I'm chicken necking constantly.

5996
03:52:06,469 --> 03:52:07,448
It's just like...

5997
03:52:07,448 --> 03:52:08,329
- But you're able to keep your posture

5998
03:52:08,329 --> 03:52:09,649
for hours on the yoga ball?

5999
03:52:09,649 --> 03:52:11,509
- Yeah. And so I can just do that.

6000
03:52:11,509 --> 03:52:12,979
And then I find myself, if I slouch,

6001
03:52:12,979 --> 03:52:13,999
I'm like, "Okay, Nope. Got to get back.

6002
03:52:13,999 --> 03:52:16,399
- Do you have incredible back muscles or what?

6003
03:52:16,399 --> 03:52:18,529
- No, well, I don't think

6004
03:52:18,529 --> 03:52:20,539
it takes incredible back muscles to-

6005
03:52:20,539 --> 03:52:22,009
- Keep posture. - remain upright.

6006
03:52:22,009 --> 03:52:24,019
Yeah, I think that's a pretty basic human function.

6007
03:52:24,019 --> 03:52:26,269
I would not consider myself a strong person.

6008
03:52:26,269 --> 03:52:28,159
- Yeah. Basic human function.

6009
03:52:28,159 --> 03:52:28,992
I don't know.

6010
03:52:29,929 --> 03:52:31,759
- [ThePrimeagen] Facts and logic.

6011
03:52:31,759 --> 03:52:35,362
- Okay, cool. With one screen.

6012
03:52:36,379 --> 03:52:38,839
Neovim. What operating system?

6013
03:52:38,839 --> 03:52:42,412
- Linux, just because I want a good window manager.

6014
03:52:44,269 --> 03:52:46,579
That's the whole press one button, bring up Chrome.

6015
03:52:46,579 --> 03:52:47,959
I just use i3.

6016
03:52:47,959 --> 03:52:51,049
I'm sure I could use something better than i3.

6017
03:52:51,049 --> 03:52:52,459
People always tell me all these window managers

6018
03:52:52,459 --> 03:52:53,292
are really great.

6019
03:52:53,292 --> 03:52:55,549
But I just have those three screens I switch between,

6020
03:52:55,549 --> 03:52:57,649
so it doesn't really... I don't really care what I use,

6021
03:52:57,649 --> 03:52:59,239
just long as I can press one button and go.

6022
03:52:59,239 --> 03:53:01,489
- Yeah, I'm the same, so half and half.

6023
03:53:01,489 --> 03:53:05,089
Half Linux, the other half Windows with Linux,

6024
03:53:05,089 --> 03:53:07,759
meaning WSL.

6025
03:53:07,759 --> 03:53:09,499
What's that? Windows Subsystem for Linux.

6026
03:53:09,499 --> 03:53:10,789
- Weasel.

6027
03:53:10,789 --> 03:53:11,622
- Weasel.

6028
03:53:12,589 --> 03:53:14,209
See, no, there's got to be a better one

6029
03:53:14,209 --> 03:53:15,042
that's more positive.

6030
03:53:15,042 --> 03:53:16,249
Weasel just sounds-

6031
03:53:16,249 --> 03:53:19,312
- Seems right up Microsoft's alley. That seems perfect.

6032
03:53:21,799 --> 03:53:25,159
- People often accuse me of being a shill for somebody,

6033
03:53:25,159 --> 03:53:26,329
sometimes dictators.

6034
03:53:26,329 --> 03:53:28,519
If I'm a shill for anybody, it's for Windows.

6035
03:53:28,519 --> 03:53:29,352
There you go.

6036
03:53:29,352 --> 03:53:31,198
I get paychecks every week from-

6037
03:53:31,198 --> 03:53:33,979
- Dang. Bought by Bill Gates.

6038
03:53:33,979 --> 03:53:35,539
- Well, he's not Microsoft anymore.

6039
03:53:35,539 --> 03:53:37,039
- [ThePrimeagen] I know.

6040
03:53:37,039 --> 03:53:39,199
- Developers, developers, develop. No, I'm just joking.

6041
03:53:39,199 --> 03:53:42,349
I think, man, I need to try Mac.

6042
03:53:42,349 --> 03:53:43,432
I need to try.

6043
03:53:45,229 --> 03:53:48,949
I'm surrounded by people with iPhones.

6044
03:53:48,949 --> 03:53:50,539
I use Android. - I use the Android.

6045
03:53:50,539 --> 03:53:52,069
- Yeah. There you go.

6046
03:53:52,069 --> 03:53:52,902
See? Oh.

6047
03:53:52,902 --> 03:53:53,749
- We're losers together.

6048
03:53:53,749 --> 03:53:56,092
- Losers on a sinking ship.

6049
03:53:57,739 --> 03:54:02,739
Okay, just to stay on Neovim for a sec

6050
03:54:02,869 --> 03:54:06,589
and to give love and a shout-out to your friend, Teej.

6051
03:54:06,589 --> 03:54:07,849
- [ThePrimeagen] He Streams, by the way.

6052
03:54:07,849 --> 03:54:11,029
- He's a streamer. And I subscribed.

6053
03:54:11,029 --> 03:54:12,649
And I've been enjoying it.

6054
03:54:12,649 --> 03:54:16,309
My allegiance is slowly shifting from you to him.

6055
03:54:16,309 --> 03:54:18,592
The quality is far superior with him,

6056
03:54:19,429 --> 03:54:22,429
the looks, the intelligence, the skillset,

6057
03:54:22,429 --> 03:54:24,319
everything, just far superior.

6058
03:54:24,319 --> 03:54:26,869
No. Okay, so he...

6059
03:54:26,869 --> 03:54:28,449
- You know you're making his day.

6060
03:54:28,449 --> 03:54:29,809
(Lex laughs)

6061
03:54:29,809 --> 03:54:30,642
- All right.

6062
03:54:33,019 --> 03:54:34,999
He mentioned that he loves Neovim

6063
03:54:34,999 --> 03:54:37,189
because it gives him the ability to eliminate

6064
03:54:37,189 --> 03:54:39,349
having to do things he doesn't like.

6065
03:54:39,349 --> 03:54:41,969
That's just a nice way to frame

6066
03:54:43,579 --> 03:54:45,112
what this automation process

6067
03:54:45,112 --> 03:54:49,789
that you described of automating a way,

6068
03:54:49,789 --> 03:54:53,422
assigning shortcuts to things that are painful,

6069
03:54:54,379 --> 03:54:56,029
that procedure.

6070
03:54:56,029 --> 03:54:57,919
I wonder if you agree with that.

6071
03:54:57,919 --> 03:54:58,752
- Fully agree.

6072
03:54:58,752 --> 03:54:59,899
We have very similar mentalities

6073
03:54:59,899 --> 03:55:02,959
when it comes to usage of Neovim, why people should use it,

6074
03:55:02,959 --> 03:55:04,939
all that kind of stuff, and how to even use it well.

6075
03:55:04,939 --> 03:55:07,609
He definitely takes it probably to a further degree.

6076
03:55:07,609 --> 03:55:09,922
He spends more time automating and all that.

6077
03:55:10,969 --> 03:55:12,799
I don't necessarily derive a lot of joy

6078
03:55:12,799 --> 03:55:14,452
from getting the perfect setup.

6079
03:55:16,039 --> 03:55:17,269
But a lot to learn from.

6080
03:55:17,269 --> 03:55:18,619
He's very, very good at what he does.

6081
03:55:18,619 --> 03:55:20,719
He is by far probably one of these...

6082
03:55:20,719 --> 03:55:24,289
He's 30 years old, been programming for not too many years,

6083
03:55:24,289 --> 03:55:26,539
and he is one of the most talented developers for sure.

6084
03:55:26,539 --> 03:55:29,362
It's very shocking to see how smart someone can be.

6085
03:55:30,199 --> 03:55:33,979
- People should check him out at teej_dv.

6086
03:55:33,979 --> 03:55:35,686
- Yep. - Teej.

6087
03:55:35,686 --> 03:55:38,133
- DV, is last name is DeVries. DeVries.

6088
03:55:38,133 --> 03:55:39,589
- Oh, it's not developer. Okay, cool.

6089
03:55:39,589 --> 03:55:41,179
- Yeah, yeah, it's just TJ.

6090
03:55:41,179 --> 03:55:44,063
That's just his name just spelled fun.

6091
03:55:44,063 --> 03:55:45,139
- All right, Teej. What do you love about him?

6092
03:55:45,139 --> 03:55:48,289
- Wow. How much did he pay you to ask these questions?

6093
03:55:48,289 --> 03:55:50,119
- Thousands of dollars.

6094
03:55:50,119 --> 03:55:51,969
- Just so many dollars. - Thousands.

6095
03:55:52,963 --> 03:55:54,813
I can't even count that many dollars.

6096
03:55:56,509 --> 03:55:59,269
- Trust, obviously trust is the biggest thing, especially

6097
03:55:59,269 --> 03:56:03,349
in the, quote, unquote, "streaming" YouTube world,

6098
03:56:03,349 --> 03:56:04,182
if you will.

6099
03:56:04,182 --> 03:56:05,659
It's very easy to find people

6100
03:56:05,659 --> 03:56:08,809
that will want to be a part of stuff.

6101
03:56:08,809 --> 03:56:11,059
People tend to latch onto things, and it's very hard

6102
03:56:11,059 --> 03:56:13,339
to find someone that you can really, really trust.

6103
03:56:13,339 --> 03:56:16,099
And so he's just somebody whom I can genuinely trust.

6104
03:56:16,099 --> 03:56:17,602
He will always tell the truth.

6105
03:56:18,499 --> 03:56:20,749
He's all the right things for a good friend

6106
03:56:20,749 --> 03:56:22,669
in this kind of endeavor.

6107
03:56:22,669 --> 03:56:24,209
- As a good friend, he told me

6108
03:56:25,669 --> 03:56:27,817
questions I could backstab you with.

6109
03:56:27,817 --> 03:56:30,612
- Okay, I hate him. I forgot how much I don't trust him.

6110
03:56:32,269 --> 03:56:34,699
- Speaking of a harpoon, you mentioned it.

6111
03:56:34,699 --> 03:56:37,799
He said to ask you

6112
03:56:40,339 --> 03:56:43,039
basically how many years or decades it's going to take

6113
03:56:43,039 --> 03:56:46,069
to transition to Harpoon 2 to actually release it,

6114
03:56:46,069 --> 03:56:46,902
develop it, and so on.

6115
03:56:46,902 --> 03:56:49,609
Can you describe what Harpoon is

6116
03:56:49,609 --> 03:56:52,609
and why your seem to be incapable

6117
03:56:52,609 --> 03:56:54,142
of finishing a single project?

6118
03:56:55,572 --> 03:56:57,379
- That was a lovely framed question.

6119
03:56:57,379 --> 03:56:58,789
Harpoon 2 is actually done.

6120
03:56:58,789 --> 03:57:00,949
This is what I did: To avoid the swirl

6121
03:57:00,949 --> 03:57:03,649
in the thousands of questions I will inevitably get,

6122
03:57:03,649 --> 03:57:05,479
I kept the master branch as Harpoon 1,

6123
03:57:05,479 --> 03:57:08,389
and I've kept Harpoon 2 as Harpoon 2 branch.

6124
03:57:08,389 --> 03:57:10,056
And people that don't read the read me to say

6125
03:57:10,056 --> 03:57:13,702
that I just use Harpoon 2 now, that's their fault.

6126
03:57:15,049 --> 03:57:16,562
That's it.

6127
03:57:16,562 --> 03:57:18,589
I really don't like answering hundreds of questions

6128
03:57:18,589 --> 03:57:20,479
about open source stuff.

6129
03:57:20,479 --> 03:57:22,369
I used to love doing open source and all that,

6130
03:57:22,369 --> 03:57:25,069
but I got my soul crushed during the Falcor years,

6131
03:57:25,069 --> 03:57:26,899
and so I guess I'm just allergic

6132
03:57:26,899 --> 03:57:30,499
to being a really active maintainer.

6133
03:57:30,499 --> 03:57:31,496
I build everything just for me.

6134
03:57:31,496 --> 03:57:34,429
Harpoon's just literally just built for me.

6135
03:57:34,429 --> 03:57:37,309
I spent three months trying to figure out

6136
03:57:37,309 --> 03:57:39,889
the most optimal navigation for files,

6137
03:57:39,889 --> 03:57:40,939
and that's what I came up with.

6138
03:57:40,939 --> 03:57:43,069
Harpoon, it's a take on alternate file.

6139
03:57:43,069 --> 03:57:44,959
If you're familiar with the alternate file,

6140
03:57:44,959 --> 03:57:46,579
typically you'll have this in all editors

6141
03:57:46,579 --> 03:57:49,879
where you can go back to the file you were just in.

6142
03:57:49,879 --> 03:57:51,859
And so that means you can have effectively two files

6143
03:57:51,859 --> 03:57:54,079
you swap back and forth in. You've probably used it a bunch;

6144
03:57:54,079 --> 03:57:55,489
really fast way to navigate.

6145
03:57:55,489 --> 03:57:57,079
Pretty nice thing to do.

6146
03:57:57,079 --> 03:58:01,399
I want alternate file, but three of them or four of them,

6147
03:58:01,399 --> 03:58:02,559
and so that's all Harpoon is

6148
03:58:02,559 --> 03:58:04,549
is just being able to pin a file.

6149
03:58:04,549 --> 03:58:06,469
And so I have one button to press to go to a file,

6150
03:58:06,469 --> 03:58:07,399
another for another, another for another.

6151
03:58:07,399 --> 03:58:08,899
And so I can have up to four.

6152
03:58:08,899 --> 03:58:10,999
I just had my four power fingers.

6153
03:58:10,999 --> 03:58:13,699
For Dvorak, what is that? That's HTNS.

6154
03:58:13,699 --> 03:58:15,919
If I go Ctrl H, T, N, or S,

6155
03:58:15,919 --> 03:58:17,119
it goes to one of the four files.

6156
03:58:17,119 --> 03:58:18,649
And that's it. That's all it is.

6157
03:58:18,649 --> 03:58:20,959
And you can technically make it so you can add in functions

6158
03:58:20,959 --> 03:58:22,519
and be able to execute things externally.

6159
03:58:22,519 --> 03:58:24,259
You can open up terminals,

6160
03:58:24,259 --> 03:58:25,909
you can send requests off to servers.

6161
03:58:25,909 --> 03:58:27,709
You can do anything you want with it,

6162
03:58:27,709 --> 03:58:30,589
I just have it primarily designed for opening files.

6163
03:58:30,589 --> 03:58:32,659
- Since you mentioned it, what keyboard layout do you use?

6164
03:58:32,659 --> 03:58:33,679
You use Dvorak?

6165
03:58:33,679 --> 03:58:36,259
- I use Dvorak, but I used a custom version of Dvorak.

6166
03:58:36,259 --> 03:58:39,439
The reason why I used it is in 2017,

6167
03:58:39,439 --> 03:58:41,659
we are just having my second kid,

6168
03:58:41,659 --> 03:58:44,659
it was Christmas and I'm having so much pain in my arm

6169
03:58:44,659 --> 03:58:46,166
and I'm sitting there freaking out like,

6170
03:58:46,166 --> 03:58:48,169
"Oh my gosh, is this the end of my career?

6171
03:58:48,169 --> 03:58:50,526
Am I done programming? Is this all over?"

6172
03:58:50,526 --> 03:58:52,159
And so I decided that I was going

6173
03:58:52,159 --> 03:58:54,199
to create my own keyboard layout optimized

6174
03:58:54,199 --> 03:58:56,479
to prevent the pain that I'm experiencing,

6175
03:58:56,479 --> 03:58:58,189
so I used to Dvorak as the base

6176
03:58:58,189 --> 03:59:00,799
and then laid out the symbols in a symmetrical,

6177
03:59:00,799 --> 03:59:04,489
reasonable way so that it's opening, closing,

6178
03:59:04,489 --> 03:59:06,228
opening, closing, opening, closing.

6179
03:59:06,228 --> 03:59:08,269
And they all are right here.

6180
03:59:08,269 --> 03:59:11,299
I actually have to hold shift to press a number.

6181
03:59:11,299 --> 03:59:13,699
Symbols are actually my first thing I get to press.

6182
03:59:13,699 --> 03:59:18,409
And so it's very optimized for a laptop keyboard layout

6183
03:59:18,409 --> 03:59:21,739
so I can use my laptop in a very efficient, nice way.

6184
03:59:21,739 --> 03:59:24,019
That's how I got started on Dvorak and all that.

6185
03:59:24,019 --> 03:59:26,089
I wouldn't actually recommend it

6186
03:59:26,089 --> 03:59:27,469
because I didn't have a Kinesis at the time.

6187
03:59:27,469 --> 03:59:29,476
I didn't even know Kinesis existed at that time.

6188
03:59:29,476 --> 03:59:33,379
And so when I discovered Kinesis in also 2017,

6189
03:59:33,379 --> 03:59:34,789
that's when I was like, "Oh, okay."

6190
03:59:34,789 --> 03:59:37,039
- Would you recommend Kinesis to people?

6191
03:59:37,039 --> 03:59:39,559
- I'm technically sponsored by Kinesis,

6192
03:59:39,559 --> 03:59:43,459
so it's hard for someone to believe someone

6193
03:59:43,459 --> 03:59:44,292
that's sponsored by it.

6194
03:59:44,292 --> 03:59:45,919
But I did use it before I ever became sponsored.

6195
03:59:45,919 --> 03:59:48,146
They're the only sponsor that I reached out to and said,

6196
03:59:48,146 --> 03:59:50,299
"I need a sponsorship from you.

6197
03:59:50,299 --> 03:59:52,669
I'm going to use you either way.

6198
03:59:52,669 --> 03:59:54,475
You can say no, but I really love it."

6199
03:59:54,475 --> 03:59:56,599
And for the first three years of using Kinesis,

6200
03:59:56,599 --> 04:00:01,279
they gave me free Kinesises, Kenisi, as my sponsorship.

6201
04:00:01,279 --> 04:00:03,619
- Kenisi. Yeah, I'm always torn.

6202
04:00:03,619 --> 04:00:05,839
I tried to leave so many times.

6203
04:00:05,839 --> 04:00:07,579
- You can't. It's too good.

6204
04:00:07,579 --> 04:00:10,309
- But, see, I have this absurd situation

6205
04:00:10,309 --> 04:00:11,842
of traveling with it.

6206
04:00:13,489 --> 04:00:14,779
- I relate. (chuckles)

6207
04:00:14,779 --> 04:00:18,290
- Yeah. I'm literally going to the war zone in Ukraine.

6208
04:00:18,290 --> 04:00:22,192
I have a Kinesis keyboard, (chuckles)

6209
04:00:23,269 --> 04:00:27,559
a laptop, and just a few other small things and that's it.

6210
04:00:27,559 --> 04:00:30,619
And it's like is Kinesis keyboard really going to be 30%

6211
04:00:30,619 --> 04:00:33,832
of volume that you're bringing to a war zone?

6212
04:00:34,729 --> 04:00:36,174
- Looks like the answer is yes.

6213
04:00:36,174 --> 04:00:39,292
- Yeah. Do you really derive that much value?

6214
04:00:40,699 --> 04:00:42,769
I think it's probably spiritual or psychological for me.

6215
04:00:42,769 --> 04:00:43,909
It feels like home.

6216
04:00:43,909 --> 04:00:46,369
There's comfort associated with it.

6217
04:00:46,369 --> 04:00:47,689
I try to leave.

6218
04:00:47,689 --> 04:00:49,132
- I love this experience.

6219
04:00:50,929 --> 04:00:53,089
It's like a relationship you have with the thing.

6220
04:00:53,089 --> 04:00:54,379
- It is.

6221
04:00:54,379 --> 04:00:55,279
But I'm trying to figure out

6222
04:00:55,279 --> 04:00:57,612
if it's a toxic relationship or not.

6223
04:00:57,612 --> 04:00:59,779
I think it's mostly love. I think it's love.

6224
04:00:59,779 --> 04:01:01,909
Like all relationship, there's some

6225
04:01:01,909 --> 04:01:03,619
push and pull complications, but-

6226
04:01:03,619 --> 04:01:05,869
- They say that distance makes the heart grow fonder,

6227
04:01:05,869 --> 04:01:07,729
so maybe sometimes the Kinesis keyboard

6228
04:01:07,729 --> 04:01:10,609
needs to stay at home and the laptop keyboard can be the one

6229
04:01:10,609 --> 04:01:13,339
so that your heart grows even more fond

6230
04:01:13,339 --> 04:01:15,319
and that connection grows even deeper.

6231
04:01:15,319 --> 04:01:17,269
- I already miss it as you say it, so I don't know.

6232
04:01:17,269 --> 04:01:20,239
I think it's coming along to all the trips.

6233
04:01:20,239 --> 04:01:21,979
If it breaks down, though...

6234
04:01:21,979 --> 04:01:24,289
I was worried that Kinesis was shut down as a company.

6235
04:01:24,289 --> 04:01:25,999
I'm like, what's the business model here?

6236
04:01:25,999 --> 04:01:28,729
Who actually uses these keyboards?

6237
04:01:28,729 --> 04:01:30,619
But apparently they're still going strong.

6238
04:01:30,619 --> 04:01:33,649
- Yeah. Who uses these keyboards?

6239
04:01:33,649 --> 04:01:35,052
As you use the keyboard

6240
04:01:35,052 --> 04:01:37,339
"I have to take it with me everywhere."

6241
04:01:37,339 --> 04:01:39,409
I wonder who uses these keyboards.

6242
04:01:39,409 --> 04:01:40,729
- Yeah. Yep.

6243
04:01:40,729 --> 04:01:44,119
I should mention that one of the things

6244
04:01:44,119 --> 04:01:45,679
when I first became a fan of yours,

6245
04:01:45,679 --> 04:01:48,709
I heard you talk about coffee and term...

6246
04:01:48,709 --> 04:01:51,019
I still don't, by the way, understand

6247
04:01:51,019 --> 04:01:54,619
what you're even talking about. I need to actually use it.

6248
04:01:54,619 --> 04:01:58,372
But you run, amongst many things, a coffee company.

6249
04:02:00,714 --> 04:02:02,449
Man, this smells so good.

6250
04:02:02,449 --> 04:02:05,839
This one is dark mode, dark roast, whole coffee beans.

6251
04:02:05,839 --> 04:02:10,839
There is seg origin, dash, dash location. Brazil.

6252
04:02:11,369 --> 04:02:13,339
- Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff on there.

6253
04:02:13,339 --> 04:02:16,039
- Stuff on there that's very devy.

6254
04:02:16,039 --> 04:02:18,499
Shop, server, web.

6255
04:02:18,499 --> 04:02:22,759
Can you legit, as such, order coffee via SSH?

6256
04:02:22,759 --> 04:02:23,592
- As of right now,

6257
04:02:23,592 --> 04:02:26,392
it's the only way you can get the coffee is via SSH.

6258
04:02:27,679 --> 04:02:30,469
Okay, can I just origin, origin story you?

6259
04:02:30,469 --> 04:02:32,264
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right.

6260
04:02:32,264 --> 04:02:34,729
I was going to do some kind of command line.

6261
04:02:34,729 --> 04:02:37,379
Command to request or dash dash help or something or-

6262
04:02:39,537 --> 04:02:41,209
- Command coffee? - Command coffee.

6263
04:02:41,209 --> 04:02:46,209
- Okay, TJ and I, again, same Teej, Teej TV, about...

6264
04:02:46,639 --> 04:02:49,279
By the way, very amazing designs done by David Hill.

6265
04:02:49,279 --> 04:02:53,329
They're very, very good. Let me give the basic ideas.

6266
04:02:53,329 --> 04:02:56,119
It must've been about a year and a half ago,

6267
04:02:56,119 --> 04:02:57,446
TJ and I were talking like,

6268
04:02:57,446 --> 04:02:59,929
"Hey, every one of these people

6269
04:02:59,929 --> 04:03:01,249
that have some sort of following,

6270
04:03:01,249 --> 04:03:02,329
some sort of online presence,

6271
04:03:02,329 --> 04:03:04,216
they're always selling a thing,"

6272
04:03:04,216 --> 04:03:05,419
but I got nothing to sell.

6273
04:03:05,419 --> 04:03:06,889
I don't really want to do merch.

6274
04:03:06,889 --> 04:03:08,539
I've never really enjoyed doing merch.

6275
04:03:08,539 --> 04:03:10,189
I just find that, I don't know,

6276
04:03:10,189 --> 04:03:11,749
it's just not as much fun for me.

6277
04:03:11,749 --> 04:03:13,911
- Don't want to have a tequila?

6278
04:03:13,911 --> 04:03:14,744
- I don't want a tequila.

6279
04:03:14,744 --> 04:03:16,186
I want something that- - Like The Rock.

6280
04:03:16,186 --> 04:03:17,299
- And I also want something

6281
04:03:17,299 --> 04:03:19,849
that I really don't feel bad about selling.

6282
04:03:19,849 --> 04:03:22,309
There's a lot of people that will go on the internet

6283
04:03:22,309 --> 04:03:23,932
and they'll shill for a whole bunch of products like,

6284
04:03:23,932 --> 04:03:25,699
"Oh, okay, try this, try this."

6285
04:03:25,699 --> 04:03:27,739
And this is why I've only ever really done Kinesis is

6286
04:03:27,739 --> 04:03:29,869
because it's like, well, I can point to something

6287
04:03:29,869 --> 04:03:32,299
that was really bad in my life, I was very scared,

6288
04:03:32,299 --> 04:03:33,529
and now it's not bad anymore.

6289
04:03:33,529 --> 04:03:35,059
It's like, okay, that one made sense.

6290
04:03:35,059 --> 04:03:38,929
But everything else always has been... It's harder for me.

6291
04:03:38,929 --> 04:03:41,239
And so we just talked for so long, and we love Neovim,

6292
04:03:41,239 --> 04:03:42,476
so we're just like,

6293
04:03:42,476 --> 04:03:44,419
"Why haven't we could do something from Neovim?"

6294
04:03:44,419 --> 04:03:46,129
And we're laughing about that,

6295
04:03:46,129 --> 04:03:48,739
ordering from Neovim is just so ridiculous.

6296
04:03:48,739 --> 04:03:51,116
And then at some point, we're just like,

6297
04:03:51,116 --> 04:03:52,279
"Well, wait a second.

6298
04:03:52,279 --> 04:03:56,299
And maybe we could do coffee. Every developer loves coffee.

6299
04:03:56,299 --> 04:03:58,879
Maybe we could figure out this coffee business."

6300
04:03:58,879 --> 04:04:03,709
And so I had a good friend named Dax, THDXR.

6301
04:04:03,709 --> 04:04:08,119
Dax, yeah, Dax. The most sassiest man alive.

6302
04:04:08,119 --> 04:04:08,952
- Sassiest?

6303
04:04:08,952 --> 04:04:10,159
- Oh yeah, he has a lot of sass.

6304
04:04:10,159 --> 04:04:10,999
- Beard?

6305
04:04:10,999 --> 04:04:12,099
- Yep, he has a beard.

6306
04:04:14,359 --> 04:04:16,489
He does SST. He does a lot of stuff.

6307
04:04:16,489 --> 04:04:19,789
Very, very talented. We'll call him DevOps engineer.

6308
04:04:19,789 --> 04:04:22,879
He's more than that. But very talented guy.

6309
04:04:22,879 --> 04:04:26,389
Him and another person named Adamdotdev, vegan, by the way,

6310
04:04:26,389 --> 04:04:28,939
great guy. We take him to Korean barbecue all the time.

6311
04:04:28,939 --> 04:04:30,499
He eats nothing.

6312
04:04:30,499 --> 04:04:31,909
- That's great.

6313
04:04:31,909 --> 04:04:34,369
- And Liz, she has been super important

6314
04:04:34,369 --> 04:04:36,019
to the terminal coffee company.

6315
04:04:36,019 --> 04:04:38,149
I think without her, we would not have been able to do

6316
04:04:38,149 --> 04:04:39,139
what we have done.

6317
04:04:39,139 --> 04:04:42,499
And then also David Hill, designer, he does Laravel.

6318
04:04:42,499 --> 04:04:44,869
He designs for Laravel. Very talented designer.

6319
04:04:44,869 --> 04:04:47,209
And so we all came together.

6320
04:04:47,209 --> 04:04:50,599
And we were just laughing about how could we do something

6321
04:04:50,599 --> 04:04:54,499
that's just ridiculous? And that's what we came up with.

6322
04:04:54,499 --> 04:04:56,869
Yeah, there you go. You just open the website.

6323
04:04:56,869 --> 04:04:58,282
You literally cannot order.

6324
04:04:59,449 --> 04:05:01,999
We actually do not allow you to order.

6325
04:05:01,999 --> 04:05:06,289
- The website is something that looks like the terminal.

6326
04:05:06,289 --> 04:05:09,049
Use command below to order your delicious whole coffee bean.

6327
04:05:09,049 --> 04:05:11,209
SSH terminal.shop.

6328
04:05:11,209 --> 04:05:13,399
- Yeah. You can only SSH into it.

6329
04:05:13,399 --> 04:05:15,679
You have to copy that command and throw it in there.

6330
04:05:15,679 --> 04:05:17,359
If you want to add in the little terminal shop

6331
04:05:17,359 --> 04:05:18,606
for your known hosts, you could do that.

6332
04:05:18,606 --> 04:05:21,199
- How do you handle payment?

6333
04:05:21,199 --> 04:05:22,849
- Through Stripe.

6334
04:05:22,849 --> 04:05:24,799
And so one of the things, we'll be adding a mobile checkout

6335
04:05:24,799 --> 04:05:26,869
to where I'll show a QR code in the terminal

6336
04:05:26,869 --> 04:05:29,539
and you can just check out on your phone, but right now,

6337
04:05:29,539 --> 04:05:31,789
you enter in your credentials, it goes to Stripe.

6338
04:05:31,789 --> 04:05:33,359
- [Lex] Via all terminal, like SSH.

6339
04:05:33,359 --> 04:05:35,959
- Yeah, SSH, obviously it stands for Secure Shell.

6340
04:05:35,959 --> 04:05:39,649
It uses elliptical quantum safe algorithms

6341
04:05:39,649 --> 04:05:42,289
to ensure that your data's not being intercepted.

6342
04:05:42,289 --> 04:05:43,732
- Yeah, but does he use AI?

6343
04:05:45,289 --> 04:05:47,092
- I'm pretty sure Dax uses AI.

6344
04:05:47,974 --> 04:05:51,169
- Quantum AI? - Can this-

6345
04:05:51,169 --> 04:05:54,769
- Fusion quantum AI? - Can this even be a company

6346
04:05:54,769 --> 04:05:56,119
if it's not using AI?

6347
04:05:56,119 --> 04:05:58,459
- We have some crypto chains with some quantum AI

6348
04:05:58,459 --> 04:06:00,128
that's powered by Fusion, - Great.

6349
04:06:00,128 --> 04:06:01,729
- so it's pretty wild.

6350
04:06:01,729 --> 04:06:04,399
Anyway, yeah, we just came together where we thought,

6351
04:06:04,399 --> 04:06:05,232
what is the...

6352
04:06:05,232 --> 04:06:07,219
That was from the Mike Tyson fight.

6353
04:06:07,219 --> 04:06:09,949
It was literally that night Mike Tyson kissed the reporter

6354
04:06:09,949 --> 04:06:13,069
and then walked out without any clothes.

6355
04:06:13,069 --> 04:06:15,013
We did an ad for somebody.

6356
04:06:15,013 --> 04:06:15,846
- Nice. - But we decided

6357
04:06:15,846 --> 04:06:17,569
to make a coffee shop, and then we thought

6358
04:06:17,569 --> 04:06:18,979
instead of just making it Neovim,

6359
04:06:18,979 --> 04:06:22,789
what if we made it from SSH?

6360
04:06:22,789 --> 04:06:25,429
Because everybody has SSH. You have VS Code.

6361
04:06:25,429 --> 04:06:28,312
Launch VS Code. You can order coffee from within VS Code.

6362
04:06:29,149 --> 04:06:31,909
Because your little bottom terminal that has access to SSH,

6363
04:06:31,909 --> 04:06:32,742
bada bing, bada boom.

6364
04:06:32,742 --> 04:06:35,152
It's fun, and so we really-

6365
04:06:36,319 --> 04:06:37,519
- I love this. - We just wanted to do

6366
04:06:37,519 --> 04:06:40,909
something where there's no level and there's no world

6367
04:06:40,909 --> 04:06:42,619
that makes me feel bad about selling this

6368
04:06:42,619 --> 04:06:43,669
and people buying it.

6369
04:06:43,669 --> 04:06:46,009
It's good, ethical coffee.

6370
04:06:46,009 --> 04:06:48,949
We developed the entire supply chain and everything.

6371
04:06:48,949 --> 04:06:50,812
It's all packaged, it's all boutique.

6372
04:06:51,867 --> 04:06:53,689
It's pretty high-end coffee.

6373
04:06:53,689 --> 04:06:54,919
It tastes really, really good.

6374
04:06:54,919 --> 04:06:56,779
- At this point, I don't like drinking other coffee.

6375
04:06:56,779 --> 04:06:59,059
I get upset about it because it's not as good.

6376
04:06:59,059 --> 04:07:01,789
And so it's funny that I've fallen for my own stuff.

6377
04:07:01,789 --> 04:07:04,519
I'm high on my own supply pretty hard right now.

6378
04:07:04,519 --> 04:07:06,079
I just got done ordering 16 bags

6379
04:07:06,079 --> 04:07:08,179
and gave it out to my family to try to convince them.

6380
04:07:08,179 --> 04:07:10,379
But it's just something where it's like

6381
04:07:11,479 --> 04:07:13,009
I didn't sell you a software product

6382
04:07:13,009 --> 04:07:14,539
that's going to influence your startup

6383
04:07:14,539 --> 04:07:16,819
that could potentially lead to disaster,

6384
04:07:16,819 --> 04:07:19,459
I didn't convince you to do a bunch of stuff

6385
04:07:19,459 --> 04:07:21,566
that's going to change your career, I just said,

6386
04:07:21,566 --> 04:07:22,429
"Hey, here's some coffee."

6387
04:07:22,429 --> 04:07:24,616
And it's like a fun experience.

6388
04:07:24,616 --> 04:07:26,046
- Yeah, it's fun, everything.

6389
04:07:26,046 --> 04:07:27,859
The humor on it is great.

6390
04:07:27,859 --> 04:07:30,023
People should go to terminal.shop.

6391
04:07:30,023 --> 04:07:31,729
- SSH terminal.shop.

6392
04:07:31,729 --> 04:07:34,189
- I'm speaking to people that don't know what SSH is.

6393
04:07:34,189 --> 04:07:37,279
And there, you can read the command

6394
04:07:37,279 --> 04:07:40,309
and then figure out how to use SSH in order to...

6395
04:07:40,309 --> 04:07:41,909
It's a kind of documentation, right?

6396
04:07:41,909 --> 04:07:44,029
- Yeah. - On the website.

6397
04:07:44,029 --> 04:07:45,232
- If you can't use SSH,

6398
04:07:46,069 --> 04:07:48,499
you probably should just not worry about buying our coffee.

6399
04:07:48,499 --> 04:07:49,332
Like that's the-

6400
04:07:49,332 --> 04:07:50,479
- You can learn. - You can learn.

6401
04:07:50,479 --> 04:07:52,459
If you're active and you're a computer person,

6402
04:07:52,459 --> 04:07:53,539
you'd like to launch the terminal

6403
04:07:53,539 --> 04:07:55,039
and feel like a hacker, go for it.

6404
04:07:55,039 --> 04:07:56,809
We even have subscriptions.

6405
04:07:56,809 --> 04:07:58,459
- What I would love to see...

6406
04:07:58,459 --> 04:08:01,579
This is how it came up I think on the cursor conversation,

6407
04:08:01,579 --> 04:08:05,872
is that I would love it if an AI agent did this,

6408
04:08:07,249 --> 04:08:11,269
like Anthropos computer use or something like that,

6409
04:08:11,269 --> 04:08:13,399
actually took the action of ordering the coffee

6410
04:08:13,399 --> 04:08:14,479
while it was programming.

6411
04:08:14,479 --> 04:08:16,129
- Yeah, like, "Hey, order me some coffee,"

6412
04:08:16,129 --> 04:08:17,096
and it actually go off.

6413
04:08:17,096 --> 04:08:18,529
"Give me dark roast." Order coffee.

6414
04:08:18,529 --> 04:08:20,819
It could actually go through the whole flow of order.

6415
04:08:20,819 --> 04:08:21,949
- Yeah, the whole flow.

6416
04:08:21,949 --> 04:08:24,868
But even better, if you didn't ask it to order coffee,

6417
04:08:24,868 --> 04:08:26,359
you asked it to do something,

6418
04:08:26,359 --> 04:08:30,919
and as a tangent, as a side quest it did that.

6419
04:08:30,919 --> 04:08:32,869
Which is computer use does that.

6420
04:08:32,869 --> 04:08:36,642
They showed off that it's able to go to I think Google

6421
04:08:38,209 --> 04:08:39,709
for some images, take a pause,

6422
04:08:39,709 --> 04:08:42,079
and then continue doing other stuff.

6423
04:08:42,079 --> 04:08:44,569
Anyway, yeah, super cool idea. Love it.

6424
04:08:44,569 --> 04:08:46,756
Speaking of which, let's talk AI.

6425
04:08:46,756 --> 04:08:47,589
- All right.

6426
04:08:47,589 --> 04:08:52,589
- You've been both positive and negative on the role of AI

6427
04:08:52,639 --> 04:08:55,339
in the whole programming software engineering experience.

6428
04:08:55,339 --> 04:08:57,949
As it stands today, what do you think?

6429
04:08:57,949 --> 04:08:59,929
What's your general view about AI?

6430
04:08:59,929 --> 04:09:03,379
What is it effective at? What is it not so good at?

6431
04:09:03,379 --> 04:09:06,319
- Okay, my general view is

6432
04:09:06,319 --> 04:09:08,539
it comes down to something that's pretty simple,

6433
04:09:08,539 --> 04:09:12,379
which is that if you're doing something

6434
04:09:12,379 --> 04:09:17,002
in which is very predictable, AI is really nice.

6435
04:09:17,899 --> 04:09:20,869
When you're doing something that is just not predictable,

6436
04:09:20,869 --> 04:09:23,749
AI is not very nice to use.

6437
04:09:23,749 --> 04:09:25,999
If you're using anything that's more cutting edge,

6438
04:09:25,999 --> 04:09:27,349
AI will not be using it,

6439
04:09:27,349 --> 04:09:30,229
or AI won't be very good at doing stuff with it.

6440
04:09:30,229 --> 04:09:33,469
It's not great at Zig because Zig is just,

6441
04:09:33,469 --> 04:09:36,289
say, less documented. It's really great at TypeScript.

6442
04:09:36,289 --> 04:09:40,429
I think there's a lot of interesting things

6443
04:09:40,429 --> 04:09:42,709
that are going to come down through AI

6444
04:09:42,709 --> 04:09:45,079
that I think a lot of people aren't really prepared for

6445
04:09:45,079 --> 04:09:46,292
or thinking through.

6446
04:09:46,292 --> 04:09:49,769
TJ's the genesis of this idea, but the idea that

6447
04:09:49,769 --> 04:09:52,759
I think there's going to be a lot of market manipulation,

6448
04:09:52,759 --> 04:09:54,079
if you will, through AI.

6449
04:09:54,079 --> 04:09:57,679
Meaning, hey, you want to research,

6450
04:09:57,679 --> 04:10:00,169
say, best woodworking tools.

6451
04:10:00,169 --> 04:10:01,669
Someone's going to be buying an ad spot.

6452
04:10:01,669 --> 04:10:04,729
Someone's going to be buying premium training data.

6453
04:10:04,729 --> 04:10:07,506
They're the ones that get the big boosts in the LLMs.

6454
04:10:07,506 --> 04:10:09,439
But LLMs don't really have to market as an advertisement

6455
04:10:09,439 --> 04:10:12,649
because it's not really directly an advertisement,

6456
04:10:12,649 --> 04:10:15,259
they just had a more premium spot, per se,

6457
04:10:15,259 --> 04:10:18,079
in the training data; a little bit extra learning to it.

6458
04:10:18,079 --> 04:10:19,699
It's like there's a lot of things about AI

6459
04:10:19,699 --> 04:10:22,401
that I fear upcoming.

6460
04:10:22,401 --> 04:10:25,819
A lot of it just comes down to people not learning

6461
04:10:25,819 --> 04:10:26,659
or making the trade-off

6462
04:10:26,659 --> 04:10:29,299
where productivity is the only thing that matters.

6463
04:10:29,299 --> 04:10:30,619
And I don't think productivity

6464
04:10:30,619 --> 04:10:31,579
is the only thing that matters.

6465
04:10:31,579 --> 04:10:33,799
If you want to build something complex and difficult,

6466
04:10:33,799 --> 04:10:35,509
productivity is not the only thing.

6467
04:10:35,509 --> 04:10:37,309
You actually are going to have to do deep learning

6468
04:10:37,309 --> 04:10:39,709
and pursue it beyond the basics.

6469
04:10:39,709 --> 04:10:44,479
And so I see AI as this really cool thing.

6470
04:10:44,479 --> 04:10:46,399
It feels like a magic trick.

6471
04:10:46,399 --> 04:10:47,689
I remember the first time I used it,

6472
04:10:47,689 --> 04:10:50,179
I got early access to GitHub Copilot.

6473
04:10:50,179 --> 04:10:52,489
In fact, Nat Friedman saw my Twitch clip of me

6474
04:10:52,489 --> 04:10:56,029
asking GitHub for it, and he sent me early access himself.

6475
04:10:56,029 --> 04:10:57,109
It was awesome.

6476
04:10:57,109 --> 04:11:00,136
And when I used it, it predicted an if statement correct

6477
04:11:00,136 --> 04:11:02,899
and my mind was just absolutely blown

6478
04:11:02,899 --> 04:11:04,729
because I had nothing before then,

6479
04:11:04,729 --> 04:11:06,166
and now it's just like first time ever.

6480
04:11:06,166 --> 04:11:07,042
And I just remember thinking, man,

6481
04:11:07,042 --> 04:11:09,649
this is going to change programming so much.

6482
04:11:09,649 --> 04:11:12,409
And then the more I used it, the more I just...

6483
04:11:12,409 --> 04:11:14,842
For me personally, I kept introducing bugs,

6484
04:11:16,039 --> 04:11:17,389
and I couldn't figure out why.

6485
04:11:17,389 --> 04:11:19,669
And what I realized is that I developed

6486
04:11:19,669 --> 04:11:23,209
I wasn't copiloting well, I was autopiloting much better.

6487
04:11:23,209 --> 04:11:24,679
And my ability to read code

6488
04:11:24,679 --> 04:11:27,199
versus my ability to critically think and write code,

6489
04:11:27,199 --> 04:11:28,969
they're definitely different sets of skill levels.

6490
04:11:28,969 --> 04:11:32,209
I don't consider as well when I just read code

6491
04:11:32,209 --> 04:11:33,306
as opposed to what I write code.

6492
04:11:33,306 --> 04:11:35,059
And so I struggled there.

6493
04:11:35,059 --> 04:11:37,339
- I do think that's a skill set.

6494
04:11:37,339 --> 04:11:39,199
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah. Skill issue for sure.

6495
04:11:39,199 --> 04:11:40,249
- Skill issue.

6496
04:11:40,249 --> 04:11:43,399
For people who are not aware, that's a hashtag thing

6497
04:11:43,399 --> 04:11:45,529
sometimes used mockingly in this case.

6498
04:11:45,529 --> 04:11:49,519
There's several layers mockingly, but also seriously,

6499
04:11:49,519 --> 04:11:52,219
meaning the criticism is grounded in the fact

6500
04:11:52,219 --> 04:11:53,269
that you lack the skill

6501
04:11:53,269 --> 04:11:56,392
versus some kind of fundamental truth.

6502
04:11:56,392 --> 04:11:57,349
Yes. - Yes.

6503
04:11:57,349 --> 04:11:59,509
- I think that that's the reason

6504
04:11:59,509 --> 04:12:04,509
I use actually Copilot cursor a lot

6505
04:12:04,759 --> 04:12:08,419
is for developing the skill of editing AI

6506
04:12:08,419 --> 04:12:11,749
so I can just learn how to do that better and better.

6507
04:12:11,749 --> 04:12:13,699
Because I think as I do that better and better,

6508
04:12:13,699 --> 04:12:17,572
I start to utilize AI better.

6509
04:12:18,949 --> 04:12:22,582
At this time, it is a bit of a boilerplate code thing,

6510
04:12:24,529 --> 04:12:28,579
but you can do out of the box novel design decisions

6511
04:12:28,579 --> 04:12:32,569
or tricky design decisions from scratch

6512
04:12:32,569 --> 04:12:36,609
but fill out stuff using AI

6513
04:12:37,729 --> 04:12:40,939
and then just learn the skill of modifying.

6514
04:12:40,939 --> 04:12:42,339
I personally just...

6515
04:12:43,999 --> 04:12:46,429
It's more fun to program with AI.

6516
04:12:46,429 --> 04:12:49,939
Even when I delete a lot of the code, it's more fun.

6517
04:12:49,939 --> 04:12:51,922
It's less lonely.

6518
04:12:53,734 --> 04:12:57,259
It's what I imagine pair programming to be.

6519
04:12:57,259 --> 04:12:58,489
And I've never done it,

6520
04:12:58,489 --> 04:13:01,909
but it just feels like

6521
04:13:01,909 --> 04:13:03,889
that friction that you get

6522
04:13:03,889 --> 04:13:07,699
when you're staring at an empty thing is not there.

6523
04:13:07,699 --> 04:13:11,539
Empty function, empty class,

6524
04:13:11,539 --> 04:13:16,249
it's just more fun, less lonely.

6525
04:13:16,249 --> 04:13:20,719
And I do think that a lot of the easier type of coding,

6526
04:13:20,719 --> 04:13:24,232
it really helps with like interacting with APIs,

6527
04:13:26,239 --> 04:13:29,089
basic things that I would usually have to look up

6528
04:13:29,089 --> 04:13:32,119
to stack overflow for.

6529
04:13:32,119 --> 04:13:33,952
It's just really fast at that.

6530
04:13:35,119 --> 04:13:38,749
As example, just interacting with the YouTube API.

6531
04:13:38,749 --> 04:13:42,259
The YouTube API documentation is not very good.

6532
04:13:42,259 --> 04:13:44,809
And you can just load it all in there

6533
04:13:44,809 --> 04:13:49,399
and ask it to generate a set of functions

6534
04:13:49,399 --> 04:13:54,139
that access the API, all kinds of read and write operations,

6535
04:13:54,139 --> 04:13:55,762
and it figures it all out.

6536
04:13:56,839 --> 04:13:58,309
Well, you do have to read.

6537
04:13:58,309 --> 04:14:00,796
You have to read and check everything.

6538
04:14:00,796 --> 04:14:04,309
And you start to develop the skill of understanding

6539
04:14:04,309 --> 04:14:07,492
where it misinterpreted the task.

6540
04:14:09,679 --> 04:14:10,512
What is that skill?

6541
04:14:10,512 --> 04:14:11,345
I don't even know.

6542
04:14:11,345 --> 04:14:14,929
You have to be empathic

6543
04:14:14,929 --> 04:14:19,579
about what the AI, what its limitations are.

6544
04:14:19,579 --> 04:14:23,266
A lot of the times that has to do with prompt engineering.

6545
04:14:25,579 --> 04:14:29,116
You have to at the same time understand

6546
04:14:32,719 --> 04:14:35,659
what the AI is aware of.

6547
04:14:35,659 --> 04:14:39,349
What did you actually give it as data

6548
04:14:39,349 --> 04:14:41,779
to be able to generate the code?

6549
04:14:41,779 --> 04:14:43,519
A lot of times, we don't realize

6550
04:14:43,519 --> 04:14:45,079
that we're not giving it enough information.

6551
04:14:45,079 --> 04:14:46,481
- Yeah. - So you've to like...

6552
04:14:46,481 --> 04:14:48,084
Okay, okay, all right.

6553
04:14:48,084 --> 04:14:49,219
You have to be empathic.

6554
04:14:49,219 --> 04:14:54,219
Be like, okay, these are the files it's aware of.

6555
04:14:54,409 --> 04:14:57,742
This is the specifics of the question you asked it.

6556
04:14:58,819 --> 04:15:02,449
You have to imagine you're an intern

6557
04:15:02,449 --> 04:15:06,079
that doesn't know anything else.

6558
04:15:06,079 --> 04:15:08,779
Oftentimes, we want the AI to just figure out the things

6559
04:15:08,779 --> 04:15:10,699
that's left unspoken.

6560
04:15:10,699 --> 04:15:12,469
But you can't know those things,

6561
04:15:12,469 --> 04:15:14,569
you have to specify those things.

6562
04:15:14,569 --> 04:15:17,779
And so you have to actually be much more deliberate

6563
04:15:17,779 --> 04:15:21,889
and rigorous in the things you specify, is to spell it out.

6564
04:15:21,889 --> 04:15:26,389
And so I just have this sea of prompts that I have saved up,

6565
04:15:26,389 --> 04:15:29,929
and I'm building these library of different templates

6566
04:15:29,929 --> 04:15:31,999
for prompts and it's a mess.

6567
04:15:31,999 --> 04:15:33,679
And I'm sure there's a lot of developers

6568
04:15:33,679 --> 04:15:35,989
that have this similar kind of mess.

6569
04:15:35,989 --> 04:15:38,119
A lot of it has to do long-term with the tooling

6570
04:15:38,119 --> 04:15:39,559
that's going to improve that.

6571
04:15:39,559 --> 04:15:41,659
One, the systems are going to get much more intelligent

6572
04:15:41,659 --> 04:15:44,179
when you don't need the nuance.

6573
04:15:44,179 --> 04:15:46,129
And two, there's going to be the tooling

6574
04:15:46,129 --> 04:15:48,019
that allows you to specify those things

6575
04:15:48,019 --> 04:15:50,809
and load it in correctly and give all the context

6576
04:15:50,809 --> 04:15:53,569
that the system needs in order to make the good decisions.

6577
04:15:53,569 --> 04:15:56,546
And maybe the system asks you follow up questions with,

6578
04:15:56,546 --> 04:15:58,519
"Here's things you didn't make clear,"

6579
04:15:58,519 --> 04:15:59,659
all that kind of stuff.

6580
04:15:59,659 --> 04:16:01,222
A lot of that has to do with the interface,

6581
04:16:01,222 --> 04:16:03,289
with the actual design of the tools.

6582
04:16:03,289 --> 04:16:04,819
Like we said with Cursor,

6583
04:16:04,819 --> 04:16:07,009
it's going to keep getting better and better and better.

6584
04:16:07,009 --> 04:16:11,759
My sense is developers in general should be learning this

6585
04:16:14,302 --> 04:16:15,469
to not be left behind,

6586
04:16:15,469 --> 04:16:19,692
to see how that can be used as a superpower

6587
04:16:21,679 --> 04:16:24,439
to boost their productivity, their effectiveness,

6588
04:16:24,439 --> 04:16:25,579
their joy of programming

6589
04:16:25,579 --> 04:16:29,029
versus be seen as a competitor to them

6590
04:16:29,029 --> 04:16:30,859
or something like that.

6591
04:16:30,859 --> 04:16:34,312
But for me already,

6592
04:16:38,299 --> 04:16:40,282
it's been a big boost to productivity.

6593
04:16:41,389 --> 04:16:43,069
If you measure the actual

6594
04:16:43,069 --> 04:16:47,419
how quickly you're able to get a thing done,

6595
04:16:47,419 --> 04:16:48,289
it's been a big...

6596
04:16:48,289 --> 04:16:52,072
And measured not across minutes and hours but days also.

6597
04:16:53,119 --> 04:16:54,472
Sometimes there's things I have to do

6598
04:16:54,472 --> 04:16:55,789
that are not that important

6599
04:16:55,789 --> 04:16:58,972
that I'll just out of procrastination will push off.

6600
04:16:59,850 --> 04:17:00,859
- I know that. - And AI helps me

6601
04:17:00,859 --> 04:17:02,569
actually get it done,

6602
04:17:02,569 --> 04:17:04,909
because that thing, the empty page,

6603
04:17:04,909 --> 04:17:06,289
like I mentioned before,

6604
04:17:06,289 --> 04:17:09,199
it helps me write the thing, get it done,

6605
04:17:09,199 --> 04:17:12,559
get it tested, ship the thing.

6606
04:17:12,559 --> 04:17:14,569
Maybe it's just because it's just less lonely

6607
04:17:14,569 --> 04:17:15,469
to work with an AI.

6608
04:17:15,469 --> 04:17:16,302
I don't know.

6609
04:17:17,509 --> 04:17:19,189
I don't know if any of that made sense, but-

6610
04:17:19,189 --> 04:17:20,479
- It all made perfect sense.

6611
04:17:20,479 --> 04:17:22,669
I really do like that phrase, it makes it less lonely.

6612
04:17:22,669 --> 04:17:24,889
I think there's something to that that's interesting

6613
04:17:24,889 --> 04:17:26,599
having just some level of interaction

6614
04:17:26,599 --> 04:17:29,029
that's not just like an LSP autocomplete,

6615
04:17:29,029 --> 04:17:31,249
having something that's actually a little bit more

6616
04:17:31,249 --> 04:17:33,589
than just that where it actually is thinking through

6617
04:17:33,589 --> 04:17:35,306
and you can see a different thought and you're like,

6618
04:17:35,306 --> 04:17:37,549
"Oh wow, that's a way different approach

6619
04:17:37,549 --> 04:17:38,382
than I would've taken.

6620
04:17:38,382 --> 04:17:40,729
Hey, that's cool. I like these kind things."

6621
04:17:40,729 --> 04:17:44,002
And the thing is that I'm not a AI negative person.

6622
04:17:44,959 --> 04:17:47,272
I can see why people really, really like it.

6623
04:17:50,209 --> 04:17:54,469
I used Copilot from when Nat gave me the access

6624
04:17:54,469 --> 04:17:56,569
all the way up until about six months ago.

6625
04:17:56,569 --> 04:17:57,709
I used it for quite some time.

6626
04:17:57,709 --> 04:18:00,529
And I really did enjoy the things I used out of it.

6627
04:18:00,529 --> 04:18:03,379
It did the opposite for me.

6628
04:18:03,379 --> 04:18:06,079
I felt like I was more reviewing than writing

6629
04:18:06,079 --> 04:18:10,099
and I felt like I was more just letting things slide

6630
04:18:10,099 --> 04:18:13,339
where I just didn't really think too heavily about stuff.

6631
04:18:13,339 --> 04:18:15,499
And just I wasn't as engaged.

6632
04:18:15,499 --> 04:18:17,359
And so I'm like, "Okay, something's kind wrong here."

6633
04:18:17,359 --> 04:18:19,009
And that's just a me personal thing.

6634
04:18:19,009 --> 04:18:20,089
I recognize that is not

6635
04:18:20,089 --> 04:18:22,039
how someone should approach these things.

6636
04:18:22,039 --> 04:18:23,119
That's not a good reason for

6637
04:18:23,119 --> 04:18:25,099
why you should or should not use AI.

6638
04:18:25,099 --> 04:18:26,449
I just don't think that that's right.

6639
04:18:26,449 --> 04:18:27,469
I could probably correct that

6640
04:18:27,469 --> 04:18:29,179
and figure out a better way to do it.

6641
04:18:29,179 --> 04:18:31,519
I've been meaning to have another AI round,

6642
04:18:31,519 --> 04:18:32,989
and so I've been thinking about

6643
04:18:32,989 --> 04:18:35,749
maybe I just need to spend two weeks in Cursor

6644
04:18:35,749 --> 04:18:37,969
and just fully embrace what does it mean

6645
04:18:37,969 --> 04:18:39,019
to be somebody like this?

6646
04:18:39,019 --> 04:18:43,039
And what can I do with these new powers?

6647
04:18:43,039 --> 04:18:45,762
Have they improved to the point where they're actually good?

6648
04:18:46,668 --> 04:18:48,409
And for me, because a lot of the decisions I make,

6649
04:18:48,409 --> 04:18:50,119
a lot of the little functions I'm writing, it's not

6650
04:18:50,119 --> 04:18:52,819
because trying to write this function to solve this problem,

6651
04:18:52,819 --> 04:18:55,069
it's because I'm writing these functions or this set

6652
04:18:55,069 --> 04:18:56,299
not just to solve this problem

6653
04:18:56,299 --> 04:18:58,999
but because I know in about another 2,000 lines

6654
04:18:58,999 --> 04:19:00,349
of code of building all these other things,

6655
04:19:00,349 --> 04:19:02,689
I'm going to need to start doing this next activity.

6656
04:19:02,689 --> 04:19:05,659
It's like I'm trying to really try to chess move myself

6657
04:19:05,659 --> 04:19:09,019
into the exact things that, as I let things go faster,

6658
04:19:09,019 --> 04:19:11,479
I kind of fall apart on that chess move.

6659
04:19:11,479 --> 04:19:14,209
And again, skill issues for on my behalf.

6660
04:19:14,209 --> 04:19:15,889
And I mean it in the truest sense of the word

6661
04:19:15,889 --> 04:19:17,659
where it's like I'm making a critique

6662
04:19:17,659 --> 04:19:20,327
because I don't use it well enough.

6663
04:19:20,327 --> 04:19:21,650
- The better you're at programming...

6664
04:19:21,650 --> 04:19:22,878
I don't know if this is a general rule,

6665
04:19:22,878 --> 04:19:23,966
this is my anecdote data.

6666
04:19:23,966 --> 04:19:24,949
The better you're programming,

6667
04:19:24,949 --> 04:19:28,669
the less you want to use the AI, the more gets in the way.

6668
04:19:28,669 --> 04:19:29,749
Like the good programmers...

6669
04:19:29,749 --> 04:19:31,549
- It's fair enough, as far as I can tell.

6670
04:19:31,549 --> 04:19:34,759
- The more beginner programmers are much more happy

6671
04:19:34,759 --> 04:19:35,902
to use AI.

6672
04:19:37,069 --> 04:19:40,759
When I use AI, it's for basic for just...

6673
04:19:40,759 --> 04:19:42,739
I don't know if there's a better term.

6674
04:19:42,739 --> 04:19:46,009
It's not boilerplate, but it's pretty easy programming.

6675
04:19:46,009 --> 04:19:48,509
And that kind of programming is much easier to do.

6676
04:19:49,900 --> 04:19:51,469
The 10X, not to use the meme,

6677
04:19:51,469 --> 04:19:55,279
programmers that I know that are ultra productive

6678
04:19:55,279 --> 04:19:57,799
and brilliant people, they hate AI.

6679
04:19:57,799 --> 04:20:01,279
They're like, "This is nowhere close to what's needed."

6680
04:20:01,279 --> 04:20:02,239
There's something to that.

6681
04:20:02,239 --> 04:20:07,239
I still think they should be using AI just for the learning

6682
04:20:07,639 --> 04:20:10,602
because it's going to get smarter, it's going to get better.

6683
04:20:11,659 --> 04:20:12,662
It's the same thing,

6684
04:20:12,662 --> 04:20:15,589
it's like when you super optimize Neovim

6685
04:20:15,589 --> 04:20:17,659
or super optimize Emacs,

6686
04:20:17,659 --> 04:20:21,109
you may not discover new things that are in the pipeline,

6687
04:20:21,109 --> 04:20:23,419
so it's always good to be training in that way.

6688
04:20:23,419 --> 04:20:25,969
- Let me ask you a question here just for my understanding.

6689
04:20:25,969 --> 04:20:26,869
You talked about this idea

6690
04:20:26,869 --> 04:20:29,749
that you have all these LLM prompts,

6691
04:20:29,749 --> 04:20:31,939
all this big backlog of messy LLM prompts

6692
04:20:31,939 --> 04:20:33,649
that you have these templates for

6693
04:20:33,649 --> 04:20:35,362
that you can do various actions.

6694
04:20:36,220 --> 04:20:38,329
You have these strategies of making itself explain itself

6695
04:20:38,329 --> 04:20:39,729
and then do the right thing.

6696
04:20:40,639 --> 04:20:41,509
As far as I can tell,

6697
04:20:41,509 --> 04:20:43,819
that's really built into a lot of people.

6698
04:20:43,819 --> 04:20:45,439
Well, then you make this phrase where you're like,

6699
04:20:45,439 --> 04:20:47,599
but then at some point, the interface is gonna get better,

6700
04:20:47,599 --> 04:20:49,129
and maybe it can do a lot of these things better

6701
04:20:49,129 --> 04:20:50,599
where I won't need that.

6702
04:20:50,599 --> 04:20:51,649
Then my question is,

6703
04:20:51,649 --> 04:20:55,549
well, is anyone actually falling behind

6704
04:20:55,549 --> 04:20:57,679
for not using AI then?

6705
04:20:57,679 --> 04:20:59,539
Because if the interface is going to change so greatly

6706
04:20:59,539 --> 04:21:01,849
that all of your habits need to fundamentally change

6707
04:21:01,849 --> 04:21:03,229
and it will be able to clarify

6708
04:21:03,229 --> 04:21:04,309
and make all those statements,

6709
04:21:04,309 --> 04:21:06,379
have I actually fallen behind at all?

6710
04:21:06,379 --> 04:21:08,929
Or will the next gen actually just be so different

6711
04:21:08,929 --> 04:21:11,809
from the current one that it's like, yeah,

6712
04:21:11,809 --> 04:21:14,899
you're over there actually doing punch card AI right now.

6713
04:21:14,899 --> 04:21:17,059
I'm going to come in at compiler time AI,

6714
04:21:17,059 --> 04:21:19,882
so different that it's like what's a punch card?

6715
04:21:20,839 --> 04:21:23,089
- Obviously open question. It's a fascinating one.

6716
04:21:23,089 --> 04:21:27,109
I personally think, yes, you're falling behind.

6717
04:21:27,109 --> 04:21:27,942
Not you,

6718
04:21:27,942 --> 04:21:29,866
but if you're not- - It could be me.

6719
04:21:29,866 --> 04:21:30,829
it could be me. - not playing with it,

6720
04:21:30,829 --> 04:21:31,662
you're falling behind

6721
04:21:31,662 --> 04:21:34,319
because the thing I'm doing with the prompts

6722
04:21:35,659 --> 04:21:38,929
is you're learning,

6723
04:21:38,929 --> 04:21:43,252
you're building up this intuition about how AI works.

6724
04:21:44,179 --> 04:21:48,079
You're understanding what is its strengths and weaknesses?

6725
04:21:48,079 --> 04:21:49,309
Not even the current version,

6726
04:21:49,309 --> 04:21:51,082
but the next version and so on.

6727
04:21:53,359 --> 04:21:57,142
What does it mean to teach an AI system about the world?

6728
04:21:58,099 --> 04:22:01,549
What kind of information does it need

6729
04:22:01,549 --> 04:22:03,199
to make effective decisions?

6730
04:22:03,199 --> 04:22:06,649
I think that does transfer to smarter and smarter models.

6731
04:22:06,649 --> 04:22:10,819
You'll need to make less rigorous

6732
04:22:10,819 --> 04:22:13,969
and specific in details instructions over time,

6733
04:22:13,969 --> 04:22:18,169
but you still have to have that kind of thing.

6734
04:22:18,169 --> 04:22:21,019
I think it's a skill of almost empathy with an AI system

6735
04:22:21,019 --> 04:22:22,449
because it doesn't know...

6736
04:22:23,299 --> 04:22:26,299
You know what it's missing? It's missing common sense.

6737
04:22:26,299 --> 04:22:28,219
It's missing long-term memory.

6738
04:22:28,219 --> 04:22:32,209
A lot of things, when we talk to other humans,

6739
04:22:32,209 --> 04:22:35,089
they have a basic common sense about reality,

6740
04:22:35,089 --> 04:22:39,469
and AI systems often lack that kind of common sense.

6741
04:22:39,469 --> 04:22:42,769
And they also don't remember things.

6742
04:22:42,769 --> 04:22:44,239
You have to realize

6743
04:22:44,239 --> 04:22:48,949
there's a constant blank slate happening.

6744
04:22:48,949 --> 04:22:52,829
It's almost just a skill of talking to an AI system

6745
04:22:54,469 --> 04:22:55,699
that I'm training.

6746
04:22:55,699 --> 04:22:58,309
And by having to write all those prompts

6747
04:22:58,309 --> 04:22:59,869
and communicating back and forth

6748
04:22:59,869 --> 04:23:02,239
to understand what kind of prompts work better or not,

6749
04:23:02,239 --> 04:23:04,039
you build up that intuition.

6750
04:23:04,039 --> 04:23:08,029
And also just raw the skill of reading somebody else's code.

6751
04:23:08,029 --> 04:23:10,219
Maybe for people who work on large teams,

6752
04:23:10,219 --> 04:23:11,719
that's a skill that's already developed.

6753
04:23:11,719 --> 04:23:13,489
For me, not so much,

6754
04:23:13,489 --> 04:23:16,309
so learning how to modify the code

6755
04:23:16,309 --> 04:23:20,119
that somebody else written is a real skill.

6756
04:23:20,119 --> 04:23:22,909
And also, the other thing you mentioned,

6757
04:23:22,909 --> 04:23:26,629
which is considering another perspective

6758
04:23:26,629 --> 04:23:28,489
on a piece of code is really nice,

6759
04:23:28,489 --> 04:23:30,919
but it is also a skill to understand,

6760
04:23:30,919 --> 04:23:32,482
okay, this is what you did.

6761
04:23:33,439 --> 04:23:37,489
There's a skill to asking a question that code

6762
04:23:37,489 --> 04:23:42,109
that's been generated such that you can have a conversation

6763
04:23:42,109 --> 04:23:44,419
about the approach that was taken.

6764
04:23:44,419 --> 04:23:48,349
I think there's just a lot of subtle, little skills involved

6765
04:23:48,349 --> 04:23:51,382
in a cooperative endeavor to code,

6766
04:23:53,179 --> 04:23:55,759
kind of like there was a real skill issue

6767
04:23:55,759 --> 04:23:57,889
between you and Teej when you guys did the video

6768
04:23:57,889 --> 04:23:59,302
of two idiots, one keyboard.

6769
04:24:00,349 --> 04:24:01,489
People should go watch that video,

6770
04:24:01,489 --> 04:24:04,159
where you guys obviously sucked at it.

6771
04:24:04,159 --> 04:24:05,779
- Yeah, co-using.

6772
04:24:05,779 --> 04:24:07,189
- That was pretty cool, which you guys did,

6773
04:24:07,189 --> 04:24:10,579
which is controlling one Neovim interface

6774
04:24:10,579 --> 04:24:11,959
from two different keyboards.

6775
04:24:11,959 --> 04:24:13,759
- Yeah, and then we each get an allowance

6776
04:24:13,759 --> 04:24:15,949
of certain characters or motions we could perform.

6777
04:24:15,949 --> 04:24:18,709
- Yeah. And so you both had to communicate together.

6778
04:24:18,709 --> 04:24:19,819
That's a real skill.

6779
04:24:19,819 --> 04:24:23,152
I'm sure you can get super efficient with that,

6780
04:24:23,152 --> 04:24:25,939
but it just takes time to learn that kind of thing.

6781
04:24:25,939 --> 04:24:28,399
So yeah, I think there's some value to it,

6782
04:24:28,399 --> 04:24:30,262
but I think there's a learning curve.

6783
04:24:33,469 --> 04:24:35,029
- I do want one thing to be pretty clear

6784
04:24:35,029 --> 04:24:36,829
is that I actually use AI quite a bit.

6785
04:24:36,829 --> 04:24:38,206
I just don't use it for programming.

6786
04:24:38,206 --> 04:24:40,579
And so one thing I've been trying to get it to is

6787
04:24:40,579 --> 04:24:42,409
to be able to have a long interview

6788
04:24:42,409 --> 04:24:44,119
or understand what Twitch Chat is saying

6789
04:24:44,119 --> 04:24:46,159
and become Twitch chat and be able to speak

6790
04:24:46,159 --> 04:24:47,509
as if it is Twitch chat.

6791
04:24:47,509 --> 04:24:50,059
Try to learn how to prompt it in different ways.

6792
04:24:50,059 --> 04:24:53,479
And so I think those things for me are just really fun.

6793
04:24:53,479 --> 04:24:55,279
I tried to get it to learn how to play tower defense.

6794
04:24:55,279 --> 04:24:56,569
I made a tower defense game in Zig

6795
04:24:56,569 --> 04:24:58,009
and then made it play tower defense,

6796
04:24:58,009 --> 04:25:01,459
and then played a Claude 3.5 against OpenAI.

6797
04:25:01,459 --> 04:25:03,379
Claude 3.5 would do better during the daytimes,

6798
04:25:03,379 --> 04:25:05,809
and OpenAI did better during the nighttimes.

6799
04:25:05,809 --> 04:25:08,419
I don't know why, I have no idea what was going on there,

6800
04:25:08,419 --> 04:25:10,396
but one would just start winning

6801
04:25:10,396 --> 04:25:11,659
and the other one would start losing.

6802
04:25:11,659 --> 04:25:12,919
It was just very strange.

6803
04:25:12,919 --> 04:25:16,009
And so it's just this, I'm learning to prompt well,

6804
04:25:16,009 --> 04:25:18,349
but I'm learning to prompt in a very different axis.

6805
04:25:18,349 --> 04:25:20,239
I just don't find it very useful yet

6806
04:25:20,239 --> 04:25:21,529
in programming. - In programming.

6807
04:25:21,529 --> 04:25:23,792
And I should also say that I'm using it

6808
04:25:26,359 --> 04:25:29,209
in every walk of life, in every context.

6809
04:25:29,209 --> 04:25:33,289
I use that same kind of exploration about prompts and so on,

6810
04:25:33,289 --> 04:25:35,119
I'm using and learning.

6811
04:25:35,119 --> 04:25:38,839
I think it legit is a whole field in itself.

6812
04:25:38,839 --> 04:25:39,949
- Yeah. - Prompt engineering

6813
04:25:39,949 --> 04:25:41,779
and how to interact with AI systems,

6814
04:25:41,779 --> 04:25:44,089
I think it's worth the investment.

6815
04:25:44,089 --> 04:25:45,169
Can you actually speak to that?

6816
04:25:45,169 --> 04:25:49,219
Because I saw you're basically pulling

6817
04:25:49,219 --> 04:25:53,862
from Twitch chat and having an LLM speak.

6818
04:25:55,609 --> 04:25:57,169
I didn't realize, I thought you're,

6819
04:25:57,169 --> 04:26:00,979
you're not reading the exact chat messages.

6820
04:26:00,979 --> 04:26:02,569
- Yeah. - You're doing kind of,

6821
04:26:02,569 --> 04:26:04,129
some kind of summarization?

6822
04:26:04,129 --> 04:26:06,409
- Yeah, so I try to go like a....

6823
04:26:06,409 --> 04:26:08,929
I ended up making like eight queries off to OpenAI

6824
04:26:08,929 --> 04:26:10,939
where it's just like the first thing is like

6825
04:26:10,939 --> 04:26:13,076
I have it have it like a default personality.

6826
04:26:13,076 --> 04:26:15,199
"Hey, you're Randall, the manager,

6827
04:26:15,199 --> 04:26:16,849
you're a software engineering manager."

6828
04:26:16,849 --> 04:26:18,739
Kind of explain their position, what they like,

6829
04:26:18,739 --> 04:26:20,246
what they don't like, and then be like,

6830
04:26:20,246 --> 04:26:22,639
"These are the list of thoughts you have in your head

6831
04:26:22,639 --> 04:26:24,109
and you need to talk to this person

6832
04:26:24,109 --> 04:26:25,129
and ask them a question."

6833
04:26:25,129 --> 04:26:26,959
- This is amazing. - "Give me 10

6834
04:26:26,959 --> 04:26:29,389
of these responses that you think are probably thoughts

6835
04:26:29,389 --> 04:26:32,269
that you have and you want to ask."

6836
04:26:32,269 --> 04:26:34,699
Make it kind of give you a list and then be like, "Okay."

6837
04:26:34,699 --> 04:26:36,229
Then re-prompt and be like, "Hey, you're Randall,

6838
04:26:36,229 --> 04:26:38,269
you're this, this, this, this, this.

6839
04:26:38,269 --> 04:26:40,639
You have these 10 questions before you

6840
04:26:40,639 --> 04:26:42,499
and now you need to select one of them

6841
04:26:42,499 --> 04:26:44,749
and reword it in a way that sounds more like you,

6842
04:26:44,749 --> 04:26:46,216
the engineering manager."

6843
04:26:48,199 --> 04:26:50,239
And I'm constantly trying to make it iterate on itself

6844
04:26:50,239 --> 04:26:52,309
as opposed to just one-shotting it.

6845
04:26:52,309 --> 04:26:54,289
And I found if I iterate too much,

6846
04:26:54,289 --> 04:26:58,309
it loses what it was originally trying to ask

6847
04:26:58,309 --> 04:26:59,239
if I don't do it enough

6848
04:26:59,239 --> 04:27:01,039
and it's just too degenerate from Twitch chat.

6849
04:27:01,039 --> 04:27:03,889
And so it's like I have a lot of improvement

6850
04:27:03,889 --> 04:27:05,939
to do with this idea- - Just to clarify,

6851
04:27:06,829 --> 04:27:09,319
you're feeding in Twitch chat,

6852
04:27:09,319 --> 04:27:10,399
these are the thoughts.

6853
04:27:10,399 --> 04:27:12,769
You're a manager,

6854
04:27:12,769 --> 04:27:14,479
these are the thoughts you have in your head,

6855
04:27:14,479 --> 04:27:17,359
pick out some of the most profound thoughts?

6856
04:27:17,359 --> 04:27:19,969
- Effectively. It's like depending on what I want it to do.

6857
04:27:19,969 --> 04:27:21,619
I'm trying to work on a better system still for it.

6858
04:27:21,619 --> 04:27:22,625
- [Lex] Kind of brilliant.

6859
04:27:22,625 --> 04:27:24,499
- And so it's like, how can I give voice to Twitch chat?

6860
04:27:24,499 --> 04:27:27,559
Can I make it so that I can create adversarial characters

6861
04:27:27,559 --> 04:27:29,869
against Twitch chat or for Twitch chat?

6862
04:27:29,869 --> 04:27:31,519
Can I incorporate YouTube? All that kind of stuff.

6863
04:27:31,519 --> 04:27:33,799
And how do you describe to an LLM

6864
04:27:33,799 --> 04:27:35,659
to role-play into its position?

6865
04:27:35,659 --> 04:27:39,049
And so just thinking through those kinds of things.

6866
04:27:39,049 --> 04:27:41,359
So maybe I am having some prompt skills,

6867
04:27:41,359 --> 04:27:43,849
but it's just not in the coding world yet.

6868
04:27:43,849 --> 04:27:45,679
- Sure. - One day I'll get there.

6869
04:27:45,679 --> 04:27:49,249
- I saw that you were playing with different voices.

6870
04:27:49,249 --> 04:27:51,619
There was like a sexy voice?

6871
04:27:51,619 --> 04:27:53,479
- That started off as a French voice-

6872
04:27:53,479 --> 04:27:54,409
- French voice? - and then it turns out

6873
04:27:54,409 --> 04:27:57,139
ElevenLabs just cannot do a French lady.

6874
04:27:57,139 --> 04:27:59,299
And when you do multilingual French lady,

6875
04:27:59,299 --> 04:28:01,432
she starts talking.

6876
04:28:03,589 --> 04:28:05,089
It's like, "What? What is this?"

6877
04:28:05,089 --> 04:28:07,049
- I tuned into one of your streams

6878
04:28:08,629 --> 04:28:10,499
and there's this lady

6879
04:28:12,521 --> 04:28:13,849
in a sexualized way.

6880
04:28:13,849 --> 04:28:14,869
- It became too funny.

6881
04:28:14,869 --> 04:28:17,449
And so we call her Not French Stormy Daniels.

6882
04:28:17,449 --> 04:28:18,739
- Oh, nice. - Yeah.

6883
04:28:18,739 --> 04:28:21,889
But I want to go back to the AI and some of the aspects.

6884
04:28:21,889 --> 04:28:23,899
- [Lex] Sure. - And so my big gripe with AI

6885
04:28:23,899 --> 04:28:25,939
has nothing to do with its capabilities.

6886
04:28:25,939 --> 04:28:27,799
It's exactly capable, as it should be capable,

6887
04:28:27,799 --> 04:28:29,779
because that's what people programmed it as.

6888
04:28:29,779 --> 04:28:31,619
The things that I really dislike is,

6889
04:28:31,619 --> 04:28:33,716
A, there's a whole group of people that are just like,

6890
04:28:33,716 --> 04:28:34,819
"The end is nigh.

6891
04:28:34,819 --> 04:28:37,169
AI is here, you just need to stop programming."

6892
04:28:38,556 --> 04:28:41,089
I cannot tell you, even you mentioned Pieter Levels earlier,

6893
04:28:41,089 --> 04:28:42,259
he made some sort of tweet

6894
04:28:42,259 --> 04:28:44,726
and one of the person's responses was,

6895
04:28:44,726 --> 04:28:49,726
"No one in 2025 or whatever should be acquiring hard skills.

6896
04:28:50,599 --> 04:28:53,449
You should rely on everything for the AI effectively."

6897
04:28:53,449 --> 04:28:56,479
And it's just like these are really damning pieces of advice

6898
04:28:56,479 --> 04:28:57,499
for young people.

6899
04:28:57,499 --> 04:28:58,489
Young people are being told

6900
04:28:58,489 --> 04:29:00,199
that you should never become an expert in anything,

6901
04:29:00,199 --> 04:29:01,399
you should always offload.

6902
04:29:01,399 --> 04:29:04,009
And the problem is that anyone worth any of their salt

6903
04:29:04,009 --> 04:29:07,549
will tell you that AI, though can produce code,

6904
04:29:07,549 --> 04:29:10,129
is going to get it wrong in a huge number of cases.

6905
04:29:10,129 --> 04:29:12,769
And as the code becomes bigger or more complex

6906
04:29:12,769 --> 04:29:14,119
or more input, it's going to just start

6907
04:29:14,119 --> 04:29:17,059
kind of sloshing back and forth between bugs.

6908
04:29:17,059 --> 04:29:20,479
And so if you don't have those hard skills

6909
04:29:20,479 --> 04:29:23,059
and you're not ultimately the driver at the end of the day,

6910
04:29:23,059 --> 04:29:24,496
you're going to really find some hard times,

6911
04:29:24,496 --> 04:29:27,439
and your ability to progress will be directly bound

6912
04:29:27,439 --> 04:29:29,539
to how good the LLMs are.

6913
04:29:29,539 --> 04:29:32,299
So if you believe that the LLMs will be vastly superior

6914
04:29:32,299 --> 04:29:35,209
to humans in the next year, maybe that's a good bet.

6915
04:29:35,209 --> 04:29:37,669
But if they aren't, then your skill ceiling

6916
04:29:37,669 --> 04:29:39,199
is bound to whatever they are.

6917
04:29:39,199 --> 04:29:41,032
And even beyond that,

6918
04:29:43,043 --> 04:29:45,769
there's just a level of information problem, which is like,

6919
04:29:45,769 --> 04:29:48,019
Can the thing actually navigate larger...

6920
04:29:48,019 --> 04:29:50,179
Do we even have enough compute power

6921
04:29:50,179 --> 04:29:52,579
to be able to solve things at this real scale?

6922
04:29:52,579 --> 04:29:54,956
And even if we did, if everybody started using it right now,

6923
04:29:54,956 --> 04:29:56,209
"Do we even have the compute power

6924
04:29:56,209 --> 04:29:57,462
for everybody to use it right now?

6925
04:29:57,462 --> 04:29:59,719
There's a lot of kind of bounding questions,

6926
04:29:59,719 --> 04:30:03,139
there's privacy concerns, and I just don't want people

6927
04:30:03,139 --> 04:30:04,549
to make the immediate,

6928
04:30:04,549 --> 04:30:06,799
or what appears to be the obvious choice,

6929
04:30:06,799 --> 04:30:08,059
where you don't need hard skills,

6930
04:30:08,059 --> 04:30:09,109
you don't need these things.

6931
04:30:09,109 --> 04:30:10,159
Our life is already gonna be...

6932
04:30:10,159 --> 04:30:11,779
We just need to only think creatively.

6933
04:30:11,779 --> 04:30:13,339
It's like, no, I don't think so.

6934
04:30:13,339 --> 04:30:14,809
I think these hard skills are going to be around

6935
04:30:14,809 --> 04:30:16,369
for quite some time

6936
04:30:16,369 --> 04:30:19,009
even with a massive improvement in the AI,

6937
04:30:19,009 --> 04:30:21,919
you're going to really be needed to step in regularly

6938
04:30:21,919 --> 04:30:24,619
for quite some time as far as I can tell.

6939
04:30:24,619 --> 04:30:26,629
- But I also think even on top of that,

6940
04:30:26,629 --> 04:30:30,229
just even acquiring the hard skills or whether that means,

6941
04:30:30,229 --> 04:30:31,789
programming from scratch, for example,

6942
04:30:31,789 --> 04:30:33,289
in the context of programming,

6943
04:30:34,699 --> 04:30:39,289
that's going to make you better at steering the AI,

6944
04:30:39,289 --> 04:30:41,419
not just correcting the AI, but steering the AI.

6945
04:30:41,419 --> 04:30:43,249
I think there is some kind of,

6946
04:30:43,249 --> 04:30:45,709
if you know how a computer works,

6947
04:30:45,709 --> 04:30:48,289
you can program Python better.

6948
04:30:48,289 --> 04:30:49,759
It's maybe counterintuitive,

6949
04:30:49,759 --> 04:30:52,639
but if you know the low level abstractions,

6950
04:30:52,639 --> 04:30:54,742
some intuition around that,

6951
04:30:55,789 --> 04:30:58,379
you can steer the high level abstractions better.

6952
04:30:58,379 --> 04:30:59,599
- Yeah. - But that just seems

6953
04:30:59,599 --> 04:31:00,432
to be the case.

6954
04:31:00,432 --> 04:31:04,429
Unless of course AI becomes like truly super intelligent

6955
04:31:04,429 --> 04:31:06,109
like many levels above,

6956
04:31:06,109 --> 04:31:08,569
but it's very unlikely in the short term.

6957
04:31:08,569 --> 04:31:11,299
And in the long term it's still good

6958
04:31:11,299 --> 04:31:13,069
as it gets better and better and better

6959
04:31:13,069 --> 04:31:16,189
to be able to ride the wave of the improvement.

6960
04:31:16,189 --> 04:31:18,409
- Yeah, I'm on that team very much so.

6961
04:31:18,409 --> 04:31:19,789
- A lot of people have written to me,

6962
04:31:19,789 --> 04:31:21,199
I think a lot of developers,

6963
04:31:21,199 --> 04:31:22,979
programmers are really concerned

6964
04:31:23,839 --> 04:31:26,279
about the future of their profession

6965
04:31:27,379 --> 04:31:30,006
in the context of quickly improving AI systems.

6966
04:31:30,006 --> 04:31:33,652
So do you think AI will eventually replace programmers?

6967
04:31:34,609 --> 04:31:35,986
- The hard part about that phrase is

6968
04:31:35,986 --> 04:31:38,269
you use the term eventually,

6969
04:31:38,269 --> 04:31:41,839
meaning do I think in five years, 10 years, a hundred years?

6970
04:31:41,839 --> 04:31:43,579
What does that term actually mean?

6971
04:31:43,579 --> 04:31:46,219
I think at some point if we are able to scale,

6972
04:31:46,219 --> 04:31:49,099
if all things continue at the current rate of improvement,

6973
04:31:49,099 --> 04:31:51,559
there does come a point where programming

6974
04:31:51,559 --> 04:31:54,709
as a hard skill does become unnecessary.

6975
04:31:54,709 --> 04:31:58,039
At some eventual point, way, way down the road, yes.

6976
04:31:58,039 --> 04:31:59,539
I don't know what that point looks like.

6977
04:31:59,539 --> 04:32:01,069
I don't know when it's going to happen.

6978
04:32:01,069 --> 04:32:03,634
I don't even attempt to make predictions about that.

6979
04:32:03,634 --> 04:32:06,534
But there are still some leaps and bounds we need to make.

6980
04:32:08,839 --> 04:32:10,759
I mean even just societally,

6981
04:32:10,759 --> 04:32:11,592
there's plenty of companies

6982
04:32:11,592 --> 04:32:13,702
that don't even allow you to use AI.

6983
04:32:14,552 --> 04:32:16,489
I mean, there's just practical problems that exist.

6984
04:32:16,489 --> 04:32:18,979
So that's a question I just try not to answer

6985
04:32:18,979 --> 04:32:20,419
in the direct sense.

6986
04:32:20,419 --> 04:32:23,629
There will come a day if humanity continues

6987
04:32:23,629 --> 04:32:27,199
and all things continue in a good positive direction,

6988
04:32:27,199 --> 04:32:28,969
where a lot of skills will go out the window

6989
04:32:28,969 --> 04:32:31,219
due to immense computing systems.

6990
04:32:31,219 --> 04:32:33,109
So, yeah, I'll give you that one.

6991
04:32:33,109 --> 04:32:36,379
But it's just like if I don't think it has anything

6992
04:32:36,379 --> 04:32:40,129
in the near term, there's been no computer improvement

6993
04:32:40,129 --> 04:32:43,249
up to this date that did not result in more jobs.

6994
04:32:43,249 --> 04:32:44,082
- Yeah, absolutely.

6995
04:32:44,082 --> 04:32:46,159
I would say that I think it depends

6996
04:32:46,159 --> 04:32:47,929
how you define programming also,

6997
04:32:47,929 --> 04:32:52,559
because when the community

6998
04:32:53,539 --> 04:32:58,539
moves from assembly to C, from C to,

6999
04:32:58,699 --> 04:33:03,699
I don't know, Python and JavaScript,

7000
04:33:04,129 --> 04:33:05,899
that's evolution.

7001
04:33:05,899 --> 04:33:07,458
That's really painful for a lot of people

7002
04:33:07,458 --> 04:33:12,458
who are used to programming that lower-level language,

7003
04:33:12,919 --> 04:33:14,688
so there's going to be a continuous evolution.

7004
04:33:14,688 --> 04:33:16,938
And maybe that means with AI,

7005
04:33:16,938 --> 04:33:19,039
there's going to be more and more evolution

7006
04:33:19,039 --> 04:33:21,438
towards natural language as part of the tool chain

7007
04:33:21,438 --> 04:33:25,132
like being able to learn how to write proper prompts.

7008
04:33:27,049 --> 04:33:31,399
Yeah, because natural language is still a language.

7009
04:33:31,399 --> 04:33:33,739
And in the long term, it's possible

7010
04:33:33,739 --> 04:33:37,309
that a large percentage of programming is natural language.

7011
04:33:37,309 --> 04:33:38,899
There are probably still going to be

7012
04:33:38,899 --> 04:33:40,309
some percentage that's not,

7013
04:33:40,309 --> 04:33:42,708
that's going to be extremely structured language.

7014
04:33:42,708 --> 04:33:43,969
- Right now, I don't think we are

7015
04:33:43,969 --> 04:33:46,249
anywhere near natural language being possible

7016
04:33:46,249 --> 04:33:47,839
because it's ambiguous.

7017
04:33:47,839 --> 04:33:49,368
And I think what we'll end up seeing

7018
04:33:49,368 --> 04:33:51,649
as people push really hard into this,

7019
04:33:51,649 --> 04:33:53,629
you're going to see some sort of pseudo-lang,

7020
04:33:53,629 --> 04:33:56,989
which is going to be a language for AIs in which you prompt,

7021
04:33:56,989 --> 04:33:59,089
which is going to be less ambiguous.

7022
04:33:59,089 --> 04:34:02,118
People keep striving towards the less ambiguous state.

7023
04:34:02,118 --> 04:34:04,008
And at that point you're just programming

7024
04:34:04,008 --> 04:34:05,749
or just programming yet another evolution

7025
04:34:05,749 --> 04:34:07,519
into a higher order language.

7026
04:34:07,519 --> 04:34:08,958
And perhaps that is a future

7027
04:34:08,958 --> 04:34:11,989
in which people will have a more terse language.

7028
04:34:11,989 --> 04:34:14,438
I'm just not sure how much more terse it can get.

7029
04:34:16,339 --> 04:34:17,561
I mean, all I see is that

7030
04:34:17,561 --> 04:34:21,049
if you say natural language can be used in the pipeline,

7031
04:34:21,049 --> 04:34:22,999
you've just made that many more people

7032
04:34:22,999 --> 04:34:25,519
can become programmers, which means that much more software

7033
04:34:25,519 --> 04:34:27,139
will eventually be created,

7034
04:34:27,139 --> 04:34:28,879
which means there's that much more software

7035
04:34:28,879 --> 04:34:30,559
that will need to be maintained,

7036
04:34:30,559 --> 04:34:34,008
and just becomes a real big snowballing effect.

7037
04:34:34,008 --> 04:34:36,975
- But there's just people who are programmers

7038
04:34:36,975 --> 04:34:39,559
who are worried about their jobs.

7039
04:34:39,559 --> 04:34:41,799
Not a complete replacement, but maybe a rapid evolution

7040
04:34:41,799 --> 04:34:43,219
of what it means to be a programmer.

7041
04:34:43,219 --> 04:34:47,598
Like you mentioned, if natural language becomes a way

7042
04:34:47,598 --> 04:34:50,212
that you can communicate or you can program,

7043
04:34:51,258 --> 04:34:54,618
that means the pool of people

7044
04:34:54,618 --> 04:34:57,409
who can get programming jobs changes rapidly,

7045
04:34:57,409 --> 04:34:58,879
so they're really concerned.

7046
04:34:58,879 --> 04:34:59,929
- And to some extent,

7047
04:35:00,979 --> 04:35:05,508
because no matter how much we want to say how good AI is,

7048
04:35:05,508 --> 04:35:08,208
there comes a point where there exists a bug,

7049
04:35:08,208 --> 04:35:10,069
there exists a large piece of software

7050
04:35:10,069 --> 04:35:12,559
in which to describe the change

7051
04:35:12,559 --> 04:35:16,249
requires just pages and pages of description

7052
04:35:16,249 --> 04:35:19,098
to the point where it is significantly just faster or easier

7053
04:35:19,098 --> 04:35:20,989
for someone to just whip something out.

7054
04:35:20,989 --> 04:35:22,429
There's definitely a balance there,

7055
04:35:22,429 --> 04:35:24,289
it's not like a perfect trade-off.

7056
04:35:24,289 --> 04:35:28,789
And so I think people need to quit worrying

7057
04:35:28,789 --> 04:35:31,579
and think about how they can integrate it and try,

7058
04:35:31,579 --> 04:35:33,169
like prove it to themselves.

7059
04:35:33,169 --> 04:35:34,909
Do they actually make themselves irrelevant?

7060
04:35:34,909 --> 04:35:37,489
- And if you truly make yourself irrelevant,

7061
04:35:37,489 --> 04:35:39,438
I would challenge you that you're already,

7062
04:35:39,438 --> 04:35:40,489
you're just doing something

7063
04:35:40,489 --> 04:35:44,389
that was just slightly too complicated to automate.

7064
04:35:44,389 --> 04:35:46,938
If you're only writing just straight up crud apps

7065
04:35:46,938 --> 04:35:50,239
from backend to front end and simple table displays,

7066
04:35:50,239 --> 04:35:53,569
yeah, maybe we just couldn't quite automate that away

7067
04:35:53,569 --> 04:35:55,489
and now we just have something

7068
04:35:55,489 --> 04:35:56,868
that can just do that a little bit better,

7069
04:35:56,868 --> 04:35:58,579
so now that's automated away,

7070
04:35:58,579 --> 04:35:59,989
but that's not really programming.

7071
04:35:59,989 --> 04:36:02,929
That's almost like building Legos at that point,

7072
04:36:02,929 --> 04:36:04,429
where the designs are already set,

7073
04:36:04,429 --> 04:36:06,438
you just simply have to move piece from bag

7074
04:36:06,438 --> 04:36:08,269
into correct position.

7075
04:36:08,269 --> 04:36:09,399
- Yeah.

7076
04:36:09,399 --> 04:36:10,969
Is there something you recommend

7077
04:36:10,969 --> 04:36:15,969
how a developer or programmer could avoid the situation

7078
04:36:16,129 --> 04:36:20,179
where AI can automate them away?

7079
04:36:20,179 --> 04:36:23,659
- I think that the bigger the project you can manage,

7080
04:36:23,659 --> 04:36:26,419
the bigger the thing you can build, the more understanding

7081
04:36:26,419 --> 04:36:28,729
both down and up the stack you can go,

7082
04:36:28,729 --> 04:36:31,278
the more valuable you become.

7083
04:36:31,278 --> 04:36:33,859
Because if you understand how to build something

7084
04:36:33,859 --> 04:36:34,729
in the front end,

7085
04:36:34,729 --> 04:36:38,028
okay, well, now you kick off some LLM task of some sort,

7086
04:36:38,028 --> 04:36:39,679
that's going to go off and make a change to the front end.

7087
04:36:39,679 --> 04:36:40,969
Okay, while it's doing that,

7088
04:36:40,969 --> 04:36:43,039
you can go and kick off something in the CLI tool,

7089
04:36:43,039 --> 04:36:45,139
you can go and you can go kick off something somewhere else.

7090
04:36:45,139 --> 04:36:46,938
And as these things come back with results,

7091
04:36:46,938 --> 04:36:48,019
you can review the results,

7092
04:36:48,019 --> 04:36:49,489
make sure it's the way you want it,

7093
04:36:49,489 --> 04:36:51,258
change it, commit it, go to the next.

7094
04:36:51,258 --> 04:36:53,539
You only become more, as you said in the end,

7095
04:36:53,539 --> 04:36:55,669
more productive if we reach this state

7096
04:36:55,669 --> 04:36:57,589
where it's truly able to do that.

7097
04:36:57,589 --> 04:37:01,339
- I think there is like a skill to working together with AI,

7098
04:37:01,339 --> 04:37:03,258
which is why I'm kind of excited

7099
04:37:03,258 --> 04:37:05,641
to watch you keep trying to do it.

7100
04:37:05,641 --> 04:37:06,547
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.

7101
04:37:06,547 --> 04:37:09,528
- It's like we don't know how it fits exactly,

7102
04:37:09,528 --> 04:37:14,528
but it feels like AI should be a boost to productivity.

7103
04:37:14,629 --> 04:37:17,389
And I definitely think it's a boost

7104
04:37:17,389 --> 04:37:19,789
to just the joy of programming.

7105
04:37:19,789 --> 04:37:21,319
I think there's a lot of people,

7106
04:37:21,319 --> 04:37:24,199
yeah, it's a job, but it's also a source of meaning,

7107
04:37:24,199 --> 04:37:26,149
a source of joy.

7108
04:37:26,149 --> 04:37:28,758
Programming is fun, you're creating something cool,

7109
04:37:28,758 --> 04:37:31,429
and also potentially that a lot of people use.

7110
04:37:31,429 --> 04:37:32,866
- There's this one thing that just really frustrates me,

7111
04:37:32,866 --> 04:37:35,329
and this is kind of going into the Devin category,

7112
04:37:35,329 --> 04:37:38,929
which is that I want an intern that cares.

7113
04:37:38,929 --> 04:37:39,859
- [Lex] Yeah.

7114
04:37:39,859 --> 04:37:42,469
- You don't get that out of an LLM. It does not care.

7115
04:37:42,469 --> 04:37:45,949
Meaning that I don't want it just to make a UI for me

7116
04:37:45,949 --> 04:37:48,469
that displays these icons like I asked, I want it to care,

7117
04:37:48,469 --> 04:37:51,528
I want it to think about it, I want it to present to me

7118
04:37:51,528 --> 04:37:53,508
and me being like, "Oh yeah, yeah, that's great."

7119
04:37:53,508 --> 04:37:55,452
And then me to make changes. And then later on it's like,

7120
04:37:55,452 --> 04:37:56,926
"Actually, I really rethought about this

7121
04:37:56,926 --> 04:37:59,028
and actually it'd be way better if we change..."

7122
04:37:59,028 --> 04:38:01,669
It doesn't actually care about the craft.

7123
04:38:01,669 --> 04:38:03,229
But when you work with an intern

7124
04:38:03,229 --> 04:38:05,389
or you work with somebody else, they care.

7125
04:38:05,389 --> 04:38:07,016
When they factor something, they actually go over and go,

7126
04:38:07,016 --> 04:38:08,569
"Oh yeah, this is actually kind of bad.

7127
04:38:08,569 --> 04:38:09,649
I'm going to come back to that."

7128
04:38:09,649 --> 04:38:10,938
They finish this, they go back over here

7129
04:38:10,938 --> 04:38:12,079
and they make this even better.

7130
04:38:12,079 --> 04:38:14,598
They actually care about the thing itself.

7131
04:38:14,598 --> 04:38:16,098
It's a completely different experience.

7132
04:38:16,098 --> 04:38:18,708
I just want something that also cares

7133
04:38:18,708 --> 04:38:20,089
that wants to make the thing better,

7134
04:38:20,089 --> 04:38:21,949
not just simply accomplish the task.

7135
04:38:21,949 --> 04:38:24,708
And I know I'm asking way too much that's not...

7136
04:38:24,708 --> 04:38:27,002
Now we're getting into Blade Runner's level AI.

7137
04:38:27,002 --> 04:38:28,302
I just want something that

7138
04:38:29,299 --> 04:38:31,129
it just feels like I'm missing that,

7139
04:38:31,129 --> 04:38:33,979
where it's just like it will complete the task

7140
04:38:33,979 --> 04:38:36,499
to whatever level it understood what I was prompting,

7141
04:38:36,499 --> 04:38:39,589
but it doesn't actually care about it.

7142
04:38:39,589 --> 04:38:44,589
- I mean, there's so many aspects to caring

7143
04:38:45,199 --> 04:38:49,609
versus the trivial version of that is a kind of restlessness

7144
04:38:49,609 --> 04:38:51,618
where you want to keep improving,

7145
04:38:51,618 --> 04:38:55,039
and I think that is very much AI could do,

7146
04:38:55,039 --> 04:38:56,516
where it constantly just ask itself,

7147
04:38:56,516 --> 04:38:58,368
"Can I make this better?"

7148
04:38:58,368 --> 04:39:00,499
And if it keeps doing that,

7149
04:39:00,499 --> 04:39:03,258
it probably is going to take it to some ridiculous place,

7150
04:39:03,258 --> 04:39:07,192
so actually it's also knowing when to stop.

7151
04:39:08,208 --> 04:39:12,859
I think developing something you can call taste,

7152
04:39:12,859 --> 04:39:16,278
which is like trying, working extremely hard,

7153
04:39:16,278 --> 04:39:19,339
constantly improving until it just feels right.

7154
04:39:19,339 --> 04:39:20,171
This is it.

7155
04:39:20,171 --> 04:39:23,268
And I think that is a thing that AI is not good at

7156
04:39:23,268 --> 04:39:25,596
where it's just like, "Yes, this is it."

7157
04:39:25,596 --> 04:39:27,149
- I've had write iterated three times and three was the-

7158
04:39:27,149 --> 04:39:29,872
- Yeah, that's it. We're now there.

7159
04:39:31,718 --> 04:39:34,879
And I think ultimately that is what humans are amazing at,

7160
04:39:34,879 --> 04:39:38,736
which is like knowing when something is right

7161
04:39:38,736 --> 04:39:40,699
like, "This is it."

7162
04:39:40,699 --> 04:39:42,799
Especially as you understand,

7163
04:39:42,799 --> 04:39:44,899
as you develop taste in a particular industry,

7164
04:39:44,899 --> 04:39:47,659
in a particular context application, knowing like,

7165
04:39:47,659 --> 04:39:48,832
This is it. Yeah.

7166
04:39:49,879 --> 04:39:53,479
The rounded corners on this button, that's exactly that.

7167
04:39:53,479 --> 04:39:54,739
That's beautiful.

7168
04:39:54,739 --> 04:39:57,889
So it's just a sense of beauty, a sense of function,

7169
04:39:57,889 --> 04:40:00,289
and efficiency, and so on.

7170
04:40:00,289 --> 04:40:03,049
Yeah, but humans could do

7171
04:40:03,049 --> 04:40:05,479
almost like supervision of AI systems in that context.

7172
04:40:05,479 --> 04:40:06,409
- Yeah.

7173
04:40:06,409 --> 04:40:11,239
- Yeah. You've ranted about Devin just full of rage.

7174
04:40:12,709 --> 04:40:13,542
- I mean, first off,

7175
04:40:13,542 --> 04:40:14,869
the people that run Devin are extremely nice.

7176
04:40:14,869 --> 04:40:16,309
I want that to be understood.

7177
04:40:16,309 --> 04:40:17,749
I don't have some sort of upsetness

7178
04:40:17,749 --> 04:40:19,499
against them or anything like that.

7179
04:40:20,779 --> 04:40:25,489
Second, Devin, it's like the full package

7180
04:40:25,489 --> 04:40:26,629
when it comes to programming.

7181
04:40:26,629 --> 04:40:29,329
So it's going to have, you're going to give it a task

7182
04:40:29,329 --> 04:40:31,699
and a repo, and it's going to go through,

7183
04:40:31,699 --> 04:40:34,069
it's going to try to understand the repo and the task,

7184
04:40:34,069 --> 04:40:36,589
make the change to the repo by exploring it,

7185
04:40:36,589 --> 04:40:38,899
then actually make a commit to GitHub

7186
04:40:38,899 --> 04:40:42,169
and explain what it did, so that you can have like...

7187
04:40:42,169 --> 04:40:44,209
So hopefully you have this whole offline thing,

7188
04:40:44,209 --> 04:40:46,579
which is the other part of this AI part

7189
04:40:46,579 --> 04:40:49,136
that I actually really like, where it's just like,

7190
04:40:49,136 --> 04:40:50,089
"Go fix this thing."

7191
04:40:50,089 --> 04:40:52,519
Then I can just go and unbroke and fix this one thing

7192
04:40:52,519 --> 04:40:54,649
and come back and go, "Okay, good enough, merge, boom."

7193
04:40:54,649 --> 04:40:57,649
I want that kind of running, being able to complete things.

7194
04:40:57,649 --> 04:40:59,269
I think the ideal solution is that

7195
04:40:59,269 --> 04:41:00,829
you can start giving it small bugs

7196
04:41:00,829 --> 04:41:03,319
and it goes and fixes these bugs and you can just come back

7197
04:41:03,319 --> 04:41:05,629
to these backlog tickets that no one ever does,

7198
04:41:05,629 --> 04:41:08,059
and it actually starts going through these backlog tickets,

7199
04:41:08,059 --> 04:41:09,499
and it's actually a really amazing experience.

7200
04:41:09,499 --> 04:41:11,179
So I love the idea.

7201
04:41:11,179 --> 04:41:14,029
I think we can all agree that that sounds great,

7202
04:41:14,029 --> 04:41:17,479
but every time I've done it and I've asked it for many

7203
04:41:17,479 --> 04:41:19,549
and I try to keep narrowing down the problems,

7204
04:41:19,549 --> 04:41:21,889
the more narrow the problem, the better it does.

7205
04:41:21,889 --> 04:41:24,019
So if I'm like, just add one singular icon.

7206
04:41:24,019 --> 04:41:25,429
And when it gets clicked,

7207
04:41:25,429 --> 04:41:28,879
I want you to do this just console, click me.

7208
04:41:28,879 --> 04:41:30,589
At least create me an SVG

7209
04:41:30,589 --> 04:41:32,419
and place it so it's nicely placed.

7210
04:41:32,419 --> 04:41:33,529
The more narrow the task,

7211
04:41:33,529 --> 04:41:35,429
the more likely it's to be successful.

7212
04:41:36,529 --> 04:41:38,029
There's like a certain level of specifying

7213
04:41:38,029 --> 04:41:40,369
where if you specify too much, it just like can't do it.

7214
04:41:40,369 --> 04:41:42,949
If you specify too little, it just does weird things.

7215
04:41:42,949 --> 04:41:45,439
So it's kind of like this very kind of fun,

7216
04:41:45,439 --> 04:41:47,239
unique way you have to play the balance game.

7217
04:41:47,239 --> 04:41:49,399
But so far, every time I do these things,

7218
04:41:49,399 --> 04:41:50,966
I always end up going,

7219
04:41:50,966 --> 04:41:52,819
"Gosh, I should just get better at Tailwind

7220
04:41:52,819 --> 04:41:54,379
and write it myself,"

7221
04:41:54,379 --> 04:41:55,819
because I always go back and I just rewrite it,

7222
04:41:55,819 --> 04:41:56,652
and then it's just like,

7223
04:41:56,652 --> 04:41:58,939
"Dang it. What am I saving at the end?"

7224
04:41:58,939 --> 04:42:00,709
I feel like I'm not saving anything yet.

7225
04:42:00,709 --> 04:42:03,619
And it's just like this, "I want it so bad."

7226
04:42:03,619 --> 04:42:05,119
I actually want AI to be great

7227
04:42:05,119 --> 04:42:06,649
because then I can really go fast.

7228
04:42:06,649 --> 04:42:09,026
I mean, I can go amazing fast, but then I always just go,

7229
04:42:09,026 --> 04:42:11,359
"Gosh, I should have just learned Tailwind myself

7230
04:42:11,359 --> 04:42:14,089
to like the nth degree and just go fast."

7231
04:42:14,089 --> 04:42:17,629
- Yeah, we should also mention that debugging,

7232
04:42:17,629 --> 04:42:19,829
this might be intuitive or counterintuitive,

7233
04:42:21,199 --> 04:42:23,809
AI is really bad at.

7234
04:42:23,809 --> 04:42:25,009
- Yeah. - Like that is

7235
04:42:25,009 --> 04:42:25,999
one of the hardest...

7236
04:42:25,999 --> 04:42:29,689
It actually makes you realize how special humans are

7237
04:42:29,689 --> 04:42:31,939
and how difficult the task of debugging is.

7238
04:42:31,939 --> 04:42:36,259
Obviously, for trivial debugging, maybe you can find bugs,

7239
04:42:36,259 --> 04:42:39,419
but that is the real art of programming

7240
04:42:40,819 --> 04:42:43,612
is finding bugs, logical bugs,

7241
04:42:45,379 --> 04:42:49,729
extremely complicated rare bugs, edge cases.

7242
04:42:49,729 --> 04:42:51,979
AI can assist, but man,

7243
04:42:51,979 --> 04:42:55,399
the hard ones really require so much context,

7244
04:42:55,399 --> 04:42:58,702
so much experience, so much intuition from,

7245
04:42:59,959 --> 04:43:03,109
again, operating in a fog full of uncertainty.

7246
04:43:03,109 --> 04:43:04,789
It's hard. - Yeah.

7247
04:43:04,789 --> 04:43:09,386
- Of course AI could maybe create logs

7248
04:43:10,759 --> 04:43:13,169
and do traces and do some kind of

7249
04:43:14,719 --> 04:43:17,869
loading a huge amount of data that humans can't,

7250
04:43:17,869 --> 04:43:19,159
but ultimately that just means

7251
04:43:19,159 --> 04:43:21,919
it could be a better assistant in debugging

7252
04:43:21,919 --> 04:43:24,139
versus the actual lead debugger.

7253
04:43:24,139 --> 04:43:25,639
- Yeah. I mean, it'd be great if they could.

7254
04:43:25,639 --> 04:43:28,039
I mean, the more it can do that, the better,

7255
04:43:28,039 --> 04:43:30,049
because as far as I can tell,

7256
04:43:30,049 --> 04:43:32,419
correct me where I'm wrong on this,

7257
04:43:32,419 --> 04:43:35,779
current state debugging is really, it looks at the code,

7258
04:43:35,779 --> 04:43:36,999
it looks at the bug problem,

7259
04:43:36,999 --> 04:43:38,809
it just kind of tries to text-predict

7260
04:43:38,809 --> 04:43:40,459
where it's most likely accurate,

7261
04:43:40,459 --> 04:43:41,959
and then just tries to fix that spot.

7262
04:43:41,959 --> 04:43:43,579
And so it's like it's likely this spot,

7263
04:43:43,579 --> 04:43:46,099
you said admin panel, it's slightly off, this, this, this.

7264
04:43:46,099 --> 04:43:47,479
It's probably this location,

7265
04:43:47,479 --> 04:43:50,209
which could actually be a really great way to do search,

7266
04:43:50,209 --> 04:43:53,419
let me do semantic searching, point to me where this is,

7267
04:43:53,419 --> 04:43:54,979
because maybe that is a really great way

7268
04:43:54,979 --> 04:43:56,419
to navigate large code bases.

7269
04:43:56,419 --> 04:43:58,339
It's like smart intelligent search.

7270
04:43:58,339 --> 04:44:00,049
As opposed to trying to make it do the thing,

7271
04:44:00,049 --> 04:44:02,239
ask it to just help you do the thing

7272
04:44:02,239 --> 04:44:04,072
in pinpointing problems.

7273
04:44:05,124 --> 04:44:06,679
I'd love to see more of that,

7274
04:44:06,679 --> 04:44:08,179
because that's for me is like the exciting part.

7275
04:44:08,179 --> 04:44:09,319
And there's this really great article

7276
04:44:09,319 --> 04:44:12,049
by creator or maintainer of curl,

7277
04:44:12,049 --> 04:44:15,079
it's the I in the LLM stands for intelligence.

7278
04:44:15,079 --> 04:44:18,439
And he writes curl and maintains Curl.

7279
04:44:18,439 --> 04:44:21,679
Curl has been inundated with security problems and all this,

7280
04:44:21,679 --> 04:44:23,276
and it's all from LLMs being like,

7281
04:44:23,276 --> 04:44:26,329
"Oh, I found a security flaw. Here's the security flaw,"

7282
04:44:26,329 --> 04:44:27,589
details it out in the code.

7283
04:44:27,589 --> 04:44:28,422
And he's just like,

7284
04:44:28,422 --> 04:44:29,779
"Okay, how did you reproduce that? Show me,"

7285
04:44:29,779 --> 04:44:31,699
because if you look at the code right here,

7286
04:44:31,699 --> 04:44:34,039
that's actually an impossible situation you're speaking of.

7287
04:44:34,039 --> 04:44:35,959
And it's just like going in these circles

7288
04:44:35,959 --> 04:44:38,599
and security right now is being inundated,

7289
04:44:38,599 --> 04:44:40,639
these bug bounty programs are being inundated

7290
04:44:40,639 --> 04:44:43,099
by LLM-submitted responses

7291
04:44:43,099 --> 04:44:46,039
because they can't actually analyze the code

7292
04:44:46,039 --> 04:44:48,806
beyond just like basic text prediction.

7293
04:44:48,806 --> 04:44:50,029
"Oh, this is a stir copy.

7294
04:44:50,029 --> 04:44:52,609
Stir copy is commonly referred, blah, blah, blah, blah.

7295
04:44:52,609 --> 04:44:53,869
Boom, there you go. Here's the bug."

7296
04:44:53,869 --> 04:44:55,669
And it's just like, "No, that's actually impossible

7297
04:44:55,669 --> 04:44:57,769
because the if statement right beforehand

7298
04:44:57,769 --> 04:44:59,869
leaves the function if the string is too long,

7299
04:44:59,869 --> 04:45:01,639
so it's like we don't even run into this case.

7300
04:45:01,639 --> 04:45:03,799
It's impossible what you're saying."

7301
04:45:03,799 --> 04:45:05,569
So debugging is very interesting.

7302
04:45:05,569 --> 04:45:07,909
- Yeah, I mean, that for me would be the big,

7303
04:45:07,909 --> 04:45:10,536
if it can solve that, not solve that, but improve that,

7304
04:45:10,536 --> 04:45:12,409
that would be huge, whether it's agents

7305
04:45:12,409 --> 04:45:16,039
or just LLMs integrated into IDE.

7306
04:45:16,039 --> 04:45:17,719
- I think there's this whole idea,

7307
04:45:17,719 --> 04:45:19,999
I call it a denial of attention.

7308
04:45:19,999 --> 04:45:21,589
I think there's an entire attack vector

7309
04:45:21,589 --> 04:45:22,729
that's going to be happening.

7310
04:45:22,729 --> 04:45:25,039
We're using LLMs to generate fake bug reports,

7311
04:45:25,039 --> 04:45:28,759
fake all these things to just actually effectively

7312
04:45:28,759 --> 04:45:31,369
to demotivate

7313
04:45:31,369 --> 04:45:35,529
and hurt open source maintainers.

7314
04:45:35,529 --> 04:45:38,689
Polykill was the first bug that kind of had this experience,

7315
04:45:38,689 --> 04:45:39,979
is this denial of attention

7316
04:45:39,979 --> 04:45:44,979
where an active malicious maintainer just hounded the owner.

7317
04:45:45,349 --> 04:45:46,999
And then a white knight came out

7318
04:45:46,999 --> 04:45:49,549
and offered to buy some stuff from under them.

7319
04:45:49,549 --> 04:45:51,079
And when they bought it, they actually replaced it

7320
04:45:51,079 --> 04:45:53,539
with a malicious piece of code and then used it.

7321
04:45:53,539 --> 04:45:55,879
So there's this whole security world

7322
04:45:55,879 --> 04:45:57,619
that's developing around using these

7323
04:45:57,619 --> 04:46:01,039
in a very aggressive format.

7324
04:46:01,039 --> 04:46:03,529
- I mean, it's a fascinating world we're entering into,

7325
04:46:03,529 --> 04:46:05,119
but I do agree with you

7326
04:46:05,119 --> 04:46:08,269
that human developers will be a huge part of that world.

7327
04:46:08,269 --> 04:46:09,292
- Yeah.

7328
04:46:09,292 --> 04:46:13,339
- That the job might evolve, but it's going to be there.

7329
04:46:13,339 --> 04:46:15,499
If I can, I didn't really look at this page,

7330
04:46:15,499 --> 04:46:17,573
I thought it would be cool to go over with you.

7331
04:46:17,573 --> 04:46:19,096
This is, again, the-

7332
04:46:19,096 --> 04:46:20,059
- Stack overflow, my favorite.

7333
04:46:20,059 --> 04:46:23,239
- Stack Overflow Developer Survey,

7334
04:46:23,239 --> 04:46:27,049
talking about their sentiment and usage of AI systems.

7335
04:46:27,049 --> 04:46:29,662
The general sentiment of, yes,

7336
04:46:30,799 --> 04:46:33,679
61% say yes, they use it

7337
04:46:33,679 --> 04:46:37,339
and 25% say no, don't plan to.

7338
04:46:37,339 --> 04:46:38,869
So majority use it,

7339
04:46:38,869 --> 04:46:42,679
majority have a favorable sentiment over it,

7340
04:46:42,679 --> 04:46:45,859
favorable or very favorable or indifferent.

7341
04:46:45,859 --> 04:46:49,489
That's like looks like over 90%.

7342
04:46:49,489 --> 04:46:50,509
- That's really surprising that

7343
04:46:50,509 --> 04:46:53,689
that many people just have no plan in looking into AI.

7344
04:46:53,689 --> 04:46:55,519
As much as I don't like using it for coding,

7345
04:46:55,519 --> 04:46:57,529
I hope one day I can use it more.

7346
04:46:57,529 --> 04:46:59,239
And so it's like, to me,

7347
04:46:59,239 --> 04:47:01,489
I'm always looking for the next thing.

7348
04:47:01,489 --> 04:47:03,169
I'm just surprised that people are, that,

7349
04:47:03,169 --> 04:47:04,819
I guess obstinate for it.

7350
04:47:04,819 --> 04:47:07,369
Obviously, the second one, the AI tool sentiment,

7351
04:47:07,369 --> 04:47:09,719
it must be only the users who responded

7352
04:47:11,119 --> 04:47:13,009
to the top two of that first one

7353
04:47:13,009 --> 04:47:14,719
just given the amount of respondents.

7354
04:47:14,719 --> 04:47:17,689
- [Lex] I wonder if no and don't plan to are people

7355
04:47:17,689 --> 04:47:20,966
who have tried it and quickly built up the intuition like,

7356
04:47:20,966 --> 04:47:22,549
"This really sucks."

7357
04:47:22,549 --> 04:47:26,119
- Yeah. - So it could be

7358
04:47:26,119 --> 04:47:27,739
like experienced programmers.

7359
04:47:27,739 --> 04:47:31,369
They're like, "No, this is not making me more productive."

7360
04:47:31,369 --> 04:47:33,679
81% agree that increasing productivity

7361
04:47:33,679 --> 04:47:35,869
is the biggest benefit that the developers identify

7362
04:47:35,869 --> 04:47:37,579
for AI tools.

7363
04:47:37,579 --> 04:47:39,619
Okay, so this is, what are the benefits?

7364
04:47:39,619 --> 04:47:41,689
Increased productivity, speed up learning,

7365
04:47:41,689 --> 04:47:44,239
greater efficiency, improve accuracy in coding,

7366
04:47:44,239 --> 04:47:46,789
make workload more manageable, improve collaborate.

7367
04:47:46,789 --> 04:47:49,999
Where's the fun, increased fun?

7368
04:47:49,999 --> 04:47:52,219
I would say that's like number one for me.

7369
04:47:52,219 --> 04:47:56,209
- Maybe speed up learning is like a subcategory of fun.

7370
04:47:56,209 --> 04:47:59,149
If you're able to learn more and be able to become better.

7371
04:47:59,149 --> 04:48:01,102
To me, that sounds good.

7372
04:48:02,539 --> 04:48:03,372
- [Lex] I don't know.

7373
04:48:03,372 --> 04:48:05,869
It's different because productivity is part of fun too.

7374
04:48:05,869 --> 04:48:08,539
There is just a lightness.

7375
04:48:08,539 --> 04:48:10,369
I mean, maybe improved collaboration,

7376
04:48:10,369 --> 04:48:11,992
all of these elements for sure.

7377
04:48:13,009 --> 04:48:14,749
- My time using Copilot,

7378
04:48:14,749 --> 04:48:16,549
there was certainly a level of wonder

7379
04:48:16,549 --> 04:48:17,959
that would happen for quite some time

7380
04:48:17,959 --> 04:48:20,629
where it's just like, it's just amazing what it can do.

7381
04:48:20,629 --> 04:48:22,219
- Yeah. - I'm just super impressed

7382
04:48:22,219 --> 04:48:24,529
by what it can do, even though I don't use it.

7383
04:48:24,529 --> 04:48:26,599
It's amazing to me that we have something

7384
04:48:26,599 --> 04:48:28,609
that can even get that close.

7385
04:48:28,609 --> 04:48:31,099
- [Lex] In terms of accuracy of AI tools,

7386
04:48:31,099 --> 04:48:34,609
only 2.7% highly trust.

7387
04:48:34,609 --> 04:48:36,709
- [ThePrimeagen] I would say that you have to be very green

7388
04:48:36,709 --> 04:48:39,079
to think that you should highly trust an AI output.

7389
04:48:39,079 --> 04:48:40,189
You should be very skeptical.

7390
04:48:40,189 --> 04:48:41,509
- [Lex] Yeah, I don't know where I stand.

7391
04:48:41,509 --> 04:48:42,769
Probably somewhat distrust.

7392
04:48:42,769 --> 04:48:44,869
Highly distrust seems aggressive.

7393
04:48:44,869 --> 04:48:45,979
- It does seem a little, true.

7394
04:48:45,979 --> 04:48:48,289
You definitely be in the somewhat like...

7395
04:48:48,289 --> 04:48:50,479
You should always assume that there's something wrong,

7396
04:48:50,479 --> 04:48:54,390
and then from there you can go and challenge it.

7397
04:48:54,390 --> 04:48:56,329
- [Lex] And then estimation

7398
04:48:56,329 --> 04:48:58,429
of whether AI can handle complex tasks,

7399
04:48:58,429 --> 04:49:01,369
most people don't think it can handle complex tasks.

7400
04:49:01,369 --> 04:49:03,199
I mean, it seems like people have a good sense

7401
04:49:03,199 --> 04:49:04,939
of what it's able to handle and not.

7402
04:49:04,939 --> 04:49:06,979
- I would argue that people don't have a good grasp

7403
04:49:06,979 --> 04:49:08,569
of what complex is in programming.

7404
04:49:08,569 --> 04:49:09,402
- [Lex] Sure, yeah.

7405
04:49:09,402 --> 04:49:11,479
- If you say, "Write me quicksort,"

7406
04:49:11,479 --> 04:49:14,149
some people will think quicksort's super complex.

7407
04:49:14,149 --> 04:49:15,529
But I would argue that that's actually

7408
04:49:15,529 --> 04:49:18,409
probably the simplest thing you could ask an AI to do.

7409
04:49:18,409 --> 04:49:20,119
Things that are so well documented,

7410
04:49:20,119 --> 04:49:23,479
it's going to do a great job at that.

7411
04:49:23,479 --> 04:49:25,489
- Yeah, probably high-level design decisions,

7412
04:49:25,489 --> 04:49:28,189
which people don't even use AI for right now,

7413
04:49:28,189 --> 04:49:30,679
I guess agents are supposed to be doing that kind of stuff.

7414
04:49:30,679 --> 04:49:33,409
That's probably the most difficult thing

7415
04:49:33,409 --> 04:49:35,482
or the most impactful thing,

7416
04:49:36,769 --> 04:49:39,259
or the most difficult thing is finding bugs.

7417
04:49:39,259 --> 04:49:40,429
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.

7418
04:49:40,429 --> 04:49:44,119
- [Lex] AI tools next year, writing code, and so on.

7419
04:49:44,119 --> 04:49:45,679
- [ThePrimeagen] Now, this one, the ethics part.

7420
04:49:45,679 --> 04:49:49,159
I'm actually super curious your take on the ethics.

7421
04:49:49,159 --> 04:49:53,089
Will we see Europe laying down some new regulations?

7422
04:49:53,089 --> 04:49:53,922
- [Lex] Oh, boy.

7423
04:49:53,922 --> 04:49:56,179
- [ThePrimeagen] What about artists?

7424
04:49:56,179 --> 04:49:57,349
What about people that are really...

7425
04:49:57,349 --> 04:49:59,689
Because the difference between coding and artists

7426
04:49:59,689 --> 04:50:01,009
is very, very simple.

7427
04:50:01,009 --> 04:50:04,039
If you gave me a sheet of paper, I could draw you a crab.

7428
04:50:04,039 --> 04:50:06,049
You go, "That's a crab."

7429
04:50:06,049 --> 04:50:07,669
But you can't do that with coding.

7430
04:50:07,669 --> 04:50:09,409
It's like it's right or it's wrong.

7431
04:50:09,409 --> 04:50:11,179
There's not a variation of interpretation

7432
04:50:11,179 --> 04:50:12,019
for what a crab is.

7433
04:50:12,019 --> 04:50:15,529
It's like, "No, you cannot make that statement."

7434
04:50:15,529 --> 04:50:17,629
It's very bounded in what it can express.

7435
04:50:17,629 --> 04:50:19,579
And I could see why artists,

7436
04:50:19,579 --> 04:50:21,949
that's a very frustrating point.

7437
04:50:21,949 --> 04:50:23,949
And then who gets rewarded for all that?

7438
04:50:25,431 --> 04:50:26,299
And then there's like the whole thing

7439
04:50:26,299 --> 04:50:27,769
with coding and licenses.

7440
04:50:27,769 --> 04:50:29,629
How much of it is GPL licenses, do you think,

7441
04:50:29,629 --> 04:50:31,039
they've scraped and used as training data?

7442
04:50:31,039 --> 04:50:33,499
GPL forces open source.

7443
04:50:33,499 --> 04:50:35,149
What are you going to do with that one?

7444
04:50:35,149 --> 04:50:37,926
That means your model might need to be open source.

7445
04:50:37,926 --> 04:50:40,669
OpenAI may have to get forced open,

7446
04:50:40,669 --> 04:50:42,649
all their previous stuff

7447
04:50:42,649 --> 04:50:45,079
if there's any hint of GPL.

7448
04:50:45,079 --> 04:50:46,459
- Yeah, that's a weird one.

7449
04:50:46,459 --> 04:50:48,019
That's a really weird one

7450
04:50:48,019 --> 04:50:50,179
because most of these models I think are training on data

7451
04:50:50,179 --> 04:50:52,939
they don't technically have rights to be training on.

7452
04:50:52,939 --> 04:50:54,709
- Yeah, there's a lot of questions.

7453
04:50:54,709 --> 04:50:58,129
- There's an unspoken, it's a real Wild West.

7454
04:50:58,129 --> 04:51:01,609
- Because you could imagine that, I always use Europe

7455
04:51:01,609 --> 04:51:02,869
because they tend to have like

7456
04:51:02,869 --> 04:51:05,989
maybe the most consumer protection laws out there.

7457
04:51:05,989 --> 04:51:08,089
You could imagine what happens if a law came down that said

7458
04:51:08,089 --> 04:51:12,949
that if you used a model that produced GPL potential code,

7459
04:51:12,949 --> 04:51:14,209
you have to open source?

7460
04:51:14,209 --> 04:51:16,999
How many companies are going to be like, "Oh my gosh"?

7461
04:51:16,999 --> 04:51:18,739
Like, "You have one year to get rid of all code

7462
04:51:18,739 --> 04:51:20,539
that was generated that's potentially GPL-sourced

7463
04:51:20,539 --> 04:51:21,979
from a model."

7464
04:51:21,979 --> 04:51:23,869
You could imagine just the sheer panic

7465
04:51:23,869 --> 04:51:25,019
that's going to happen.

7466
04:51:26,029 --> 04:51:27,862
It'd be a fire sale of code.

7467
04:51:28,759 --> 04:51:30,469
- So given all that,

7468
04:51:30,469 --> 04:51:33,112
can you give advice to young programmers?

7469
04:51:34,489 --> 04:51:36,859
This is another question from Reddit,

7470
04:51:36,859 --> 04:51:38,126
the infinite wisdom of Reddit.

7471
04:51:38,126 --> 04:51:41,359
"What should a person in their early 20s do

7472
04:51:41,359 --> 04:51:44,236
to move forward in the tech industry?"

7473
04:51:45,139 --> 04:51:49,676
And this is an interesting addition to the question,

7474
04:51:49,676 --> 04:51:50,749
"And by doing it,

7475
04:51:50,749 --> 04:51:53,356
will this be walking on someone else's path?"

7476
04:51:56,809 --> 04:52:00,049
- I am going to try to answer that question,

7477
04:52:00,049 --> 04:52:01,199
I guess the best I can,

7478
04:52:03,049 --> 04:52:06,682
which I think that if you're entering into the tech world,

7479
04:52:08,119 --> 04:52:10,099
one of the hardest pieces of advice

7480
04:52:10,099 --> 04:52:12,919
that I took a long time to learn was

7481
04:52:12,919 --> 04:52:14,689
I became enamored and addicted.

7482
04:52:14,689 --> 04:52:16,429
Obviously, we talked about that I program

7483
04:52:16,429 --> 04:52:17,602
for way too many hours,

7484
04:52:18,919 --> 04:52:22,789
forgetting to spend the time I needed with my wife,

7485
04:52:22,789 --> 04:52:24,559
with my friends, all that stuff,

7486
04:52:24,559 --> 04:52:27,499
like totally wrapping myself up into one activity.

7487
04:52:27,499 --> 04:52:30,229
I think though it made me who I am,

7488
04:52:30,229 --> 04:52:31,789
it was probably an unhealthy activity

7489
04:52:31,789 --> 04:52:33,589
and probably not a wise activity.

7490
04:52:33,589 --> 04:52:35,569
And so the best advice I can give is that

7491
04:52:35,569 --> 04:52:38,269
you got to develop the love, the skill, the desire for it.

7492
04:52:38,269 --> 04:52:40,519
Whether that's just only using AI agents,

7493
04:52:40,519 --> 04:52:43,639
programming yourself, using Zig or programming JavaScript,

7494
04:52:43,639 --> 04:52:45,049
whatever that flavor is

7495
04:52:45,049 --> 04:52:47,539
that's going to get you coming back every single day,

7496
04:52:47,539 --> 04:52:50,419
getting the reps in the gym, if you will for programming.

7497
04:52:50,419 --> 04:52:53,779
But also knowing how to value what is valuable

7498
04:52:53,779 --> 04:52:56,929
and not getting lost in the sauce where you're just so stuck

7499
04:52:56,929 --> 04:52:59,209
on trying to make the next greatest startup

7500
04:52:59,209 --> 04:53:00,829
that you sacrifice your health,

7501
04:53:00,829 --> 04:53:02,449
you sacrifice your relationships.

7502
04:53:02,449 --> 04:53:04,429
Or even worse, you sacrifice your own morals

7503
04:53:04,429 --> 04:53:06,079
to take certain shortcuts

7504
04:53:06,079 --> 04:53:08,449
that you probably shouldn't be taking

7505
04:53:08,449 --> 04:53:10,249
in life to be able to achieve these things,

7506
04:53:10,249 --> 04:53:13,189
because I'm sure there's hundreds of horror stories

7507
04:53:13,189 --> 04:53:15,049
you could hear where people

7508
04:53:15,049 --> 04:53:19,159
definitely shortcutted their morals for monetary success.

7509
04:53:19,159 --> 04:53:23,119
- Yeah, I mean, the golden handcuffs comfort

7510
04:53:23,119 --> 04:53:25,672
can destroy the soul in some sense.

7511
04:53:27,728 --> 04:53:29,978
Yeah, so that's really important to remember.

7512
04:53:31,519 --> 04:53:32,726
There's young people kind of thinking,

7513
04:53:32,726 --> 04:53:34,756
"Do I even want to be a programmer now?"

7514
04:53:36,259 --> 04:53:39,212
It seems like AI is getting better and better

7515
04:53:39,212 --> 04:53:40,045
at programming.

7516
04:53:41,809 --> 04:53:43,939
If they were trying to make that decision,

7517
04:53:43,939 --> 04:53:44,816
would you still say,

7518
04:53:44,816 --> 04:53:48,409
"Yeah, if this is something that fills you with joy"?

7519
04:53:48,409 --> 04:53:50,869
- I still want my kids to learn how to program

7520
04:53:50,869 --> 04:53:54,038
if I can answer that, if that's a good enough answer.

7521
04:53:54,038 --> 04:53:54,871
- Yeah, that's a really - In the sense that

7522
04:53:54,871 --> 04:53:56,419
- Powerful answer. - my kids are

7523
04:53:56,419 --> 04:53:58,669
decade younger than a young person trying to learn

7524
04:53:58,669 --> 04:53:59,989
how to program right now.

7525
04:53:59,989 --> 04:54:01,399
And so if I want...

7526
04:54:01,399 --> 04:54:03,229
I'm hoping that my kid can run and build

7527
04:54:03,229 --> 04:54:04,639
whatever he wants in Roblox.

7528
04:54:04,639 --> 04:54:06,026
I'm showing him ChatGPT and be like,

7529
04:54:06,026 --> 04:54:08,119
"All right, let's ask questions. How do we do this?"

7530
04:54:08,119 --> 04:54:10,429
It's still extremely confusing for him

7531
04:54:10,429 --> 04:54:11,262
to do all these things.

7532
04:54:11,262 --> 04:54:13,039
And so it's like, "Let's do this."

7533
04:54:13,039 --> 04:54:14,719
I want him to learn and be effective,

7534
04:54:14,719 --> 04:54:16,099
and maybe one day he has to throw away

7535
04:54:16,099 --> 04:54:17,749
all those skills in 20 years.

7536
04:54:17,749 --> 04:54:20,809
But I bet you that whatever skills he threw away

7537
04:54:20,809 --> 04:54:23,179
or whatever hard skills he had to throw away,

7538
04:54:23,179 --> 04:54:25,736
an entirely new field that none of us have thought about,

7539
04:54:25,736 --> 04:54:28,436
just like if you would have asked somebody in the '70s

7540
04:54:29,569 --> 04:54:30,926
about social networks, they'd be like,

7541
04:54:30,926 --> 04:54:33,259
"What the heck are you even talking about?"

7542
04:54:33,259 --> 04:54:34,549
Things will exist in the future

7543
04:54:34,549 --> 04:54:35,899
that are going to be massively different,

7544
04:54:35,899 --> 04:54:37,429
and crazy, and exciting.

7545
04:54:37,429 --> 04:54:39,139
- Maybe in virtual reality.

7546
04:54:39,139 --> 04:54:39,972
- [ThePrimeagen] There you go.

7547
04:54:39,972 --> 04:54:41,509
- Maybe all of us actually down the line

7548
04:54:41,509 --> 04:54:43,699
will just be building video games.

7549
04:54:43,699 --> 04:54:45,169
- Just entertainment for all,

7550
04:54:45,169 --> 04:54:47,509
the brave new world of our world?

7551
04:54:47,509 --> 04:54:50,759
- Well, I think entertainment

7552
04:54:52,069 --> 04:54:55,189
is a kind of trivialized version

7553
04:54:55,189 --> 04:54:57,439
of what a video game could be.

7554
04:54:57,439 --> 04:54:59,419
It's like, what is the purpose of life anyway?

7555
04:54:59,419 --> 04:55:02,809
I mean, it could be a deeply fulfilling video game.

7556
04:55:02,809 --> 04:55:06,409
It doesn't have to be just like dopamine rush.

7557
04:55:06,409 --> 04:55:07,939
It could be educational,

7558
04:55:07,939 --> 04:55:12,739
it could be scary, it could be challenging,

7559
04:55:12,739 --> 04:55:14,389
forcing an evolution,

7560
04:55:14,389 --> 04:55:16,039
the leap into adventure

7561
04:55:16,039 --> 04:55:19,879
that it makes up a fulfilling life.

7562
04:55:19,879 --> 04:55:21,979
That could be video games. Who knows?

7563
04:55:21,979 --> 04:55:23,479
Especially in virtual reality.

7564
04:55:24,529 --> 04:55:25,849
I tend to...

7565
04:55:25,849 --> 04:55:29,332
That's the other thing. I play a lot of video games.

7566
04:55:31,399 --> 04:55:32,959
I think there's a lot of room

7567
04:55:32,959 --> 04:55:36,379
to make video games deeply fulfilling,

7568
04:55:36,379 --> 04:55:39,109
like there's a lot of space where that can go.

7569
04:55:39,109 --> 04:55:40,399
- I didn't know you played a lot of video games,

7570
04:55:40,399 --> 04:55:42,386
because when I asked you specifically,

7571
04:55:42,386 --> 04:55:44,929
"Should I play World of Warcraft or do Advent of Code,"

7572
04:55:44,929 --> 04:55:47,449
you're like, "Advent of Code, Advent of Code."

7573
04:55:47,449 --> 04:55:49,189
- Oh, well, that might mean

7574
04:55:49,189 --> 04:55:50,659
I've never played World of Warcraft

7575
04:55:50,659 --> 04:55:52,879
because there's certain games I avoid.

7576
04:55:52,879 --> 04:55:55,549
Fortnite, by the way, I think was one of them

7577
04:55:55,549 --> 04:55:57,829
because I was worried it'd become too addicted.

7578
04:55:57,829 --> 04:55:58,759
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah, yeah.

7579
04:55:58,759 --> 04:56:00,349
- So there's certain games I just know

7580
04:56:00,349 --> 04:56:01,972
I won't get super addicted to.

7581
04:56:01,972 --> 04:56:04,759
Like for example, I'm terrified of Civilization.

7582
04:56:04,759 --> 04:56:08,989
I have never played a Civ's game because I'm worried.

7583
04:56:08,989 --> 04:56:12,799
I'm worried the dark path in my lead

7584
04:56:12,799 --> 04:56:15,289
because there's some games just really pull you in.

7585
04:56:15,289 --> 04:56:18,289
I'm much better with, that's why I play Skyrim.

7586
04:56:18,289 --> 04:56:22,249
I can play these games or a Baldur's Gate,

7587
04:56:22,249 --> 04:56:25,069
and moderate how much I play.

7588
04:56:25,069 --> 04:56:27,139
And they could be like a lifelong companion

7589
04:56:27,139 --> 04:56:30,709
versus an addiction where it's like sunrise

7590
04:56:30,709 --> 04:56:32,689
and you're like, "What's happening with my life?"

7591
04:56:32,689 --> 04:56:35,119
And I find myself naked behind a dumpster somewhere

7592
04:56:35,119 --> 04:56:36,862
just wondering what happened.

7593
04:56:38,209 --> 04:56:40,729
Yeah, so that's how I choose my video games.

7594
04:56:40,729 --> 04:56:42,859
- You're not the first person

7595
04:56:42,859 --> 04:56:45,229
who has specifically called out Civilization.

7596
04:56:45,229 --> 04:56:46,399
- Yeah. - I've had more

7597
04:56:46,399 --> 04:56:49,069
than one person, also very high up in the tech world,

7598
04:56:49,069 --> 04:56:51,109
be like, "Civilization is my downfall.

7599
04:56:51,109 --> 04:56:52,999
If I get near that game, I'm done."

7600
04:56:52,999 --> 04:56:54,529
- [Lex] Yeah. So.

7601
04:56:54,529 --> 04:56:55,609
- I've never even played the game.

7602
04:56:55,609 --> 04:56:56,926
Now it makes me be like,

7603
04:56:56,926 --> 04:56:59,186
"Dude, I got to give this a try. That sounds crazy."

7604
04:56:59,186 --> 04:57:00,019
- Yeah, and the new one

7605
04:57:00,019 --> 04:57:01,612
is actually supposed to be really, really good.

7606
04:57:01,612 --> 04:57:03,709
What were we talking about? Yes.

7607
04:57:03,709 --> 04:57:04,849
For that same young developer,

7608
04:57:04,849 --> 04:57:07,049
is there a trajectory through jobs

7609
04:57:07,999 --> 04:57:10,759
that you could give advice on?

7610
04:57:10,759 --> 04:57:14,119
So you started out with Schedulicity?

7611
04:57:14,119 --> 04:57:16,579
- Yeah, that was my first full-time...

7612
04:57:16,579 --> 04:57:18,319
When I had the government contracting one before,

7613
04:57:18,319 --> 04:57:19,236
that wasn't quite full-time.

7614
04:57:19,236 --> 04:57:21,589
It was in C. It was a lot of fun.

7615
04:57:21,589 --> 04:57:23,679
And then building my own startup for quite some time.

7616
04:57:23,679 --> 04:57:25,909
So if you count either of those as full-time,

7617
04:57:25,909 --> 04:57:27,019
then those would be the full-time.

7618
04:57:27,019 --> 04:57:29,683
Schedulicity was the official on the docs.

7619
04:57:29,683 --> 04:57:31,792
- Is there some value to jumping around,

7620
04:57:33,649 --> 04:57:34,549
working in one company

7621
04:57:34,549 --> 04:57:38,359
and another to try to figure out what brings you joy?

7622
04:57:38,359 --> 04:57:39,949
- I think there's a lot to that

7623
04:57:39,949 --> 04:57:44,689
because not every job you're gonna get is gonna be great.

7624
04:57:44,689 --> 04:57:45,859
Now, your first job you could get

7625
04:57:45,859 --> 04:57:47,959
could make you think you hate programming.

7626
04:57:49,639 --> 04:57:51,106
It happened, I did an internship at a place

7627
04:57:51,106 --> 04:57:52,789
and I keep on surprising you

7628
04:57:52,789 --> 04:57:54,679
with more kind of things I did in the past,

7629
04:57:54,679 --> 04:57:56,599
did an internship at-

7630
04:57:56,599 --> 04:57:58,339
- Fuck. You did so many things.

7631
04:57:58,339 --> 04:57:59,172
It's incredible.

7632
04:57:59,172 --> 04:58:01,429
- At a place called Total Information Management System.

7633
04:58:01,429 --> 04:58:03,559
Remember when I talked about that hours ago,

7634
04:58:03,559 --> 04:58:05,419
about healthcare and that

7635
04:58:05,419 --> 04:58:06,379
and industrial shipping and all that?

7636
04:58:06,379 --> 04:58:07,999
It was a C-sharp shop.

7637
04:58:07,999 --> 04:58:09,799
It was so bad that after I did that,

7638
04:58:09,799 --> 04:58:11,359
I went and changed my major

7639
04:58:11,359 --> 04:58:12,949
to mechanical engineering first semester in college.

7640
04:58:12,949 --> 04:58:14,076
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. - I thought I,

7641
04:58:14,076 --> 04:58:16,579
"Okay. Actually I like computer science.

7642
04:58:16,579 --> 04:58:18,469
I hate the programming."

7643
04:58:18,469 --> 04:58:20,809
So just because you've had a job

7644
04:58:20,809 --> 04:58:22,152
doesn't mean it's going to be the one.

7645
04:58:22,152 --> 04:58:24,009
And the thing is, here's the best part though,

7646
04:58:24,009 --> 04:58:26,509
if you get a job and you like it

7647
04:58:26,509 --> 04:58:28,819
and you want to do it and it's exciting,

7648
04:58:28,819 --> 04:58:30,069
you don't need to change.

7649
04:58:31,159 --> 04:58:31,992
I think a lot of people are like,

7650
04:58:31,992 --> 04:58:33,079
"Oh, I got to find the next thing.

7651
04:58:33,079 --> 04:58:34,219
I've been here for two years."

7652
04:58:34,219 --> 04:58:37,369
There's of this, you got to move around mindset.

7653
04:58:37,369 --> 04:58:39,019
I don't think you have to move around.

7654
04:58:39,019 --> 04:58:40,609
I don't think it hurts your career.

7655
04:58:40,609 --> 04:58:42,529
Because if anything, you'll gain more responsibility

7656
04:58:42,529 --> 04:58:44,059
and you'll be able to talk with way more authority.

7657
04:58:44,059 --> 04:58:44,989
And the next time you interview,

7658
04:58:44,989 --> 04:58:46,736
you're going to be way more into like,

7659
04:58:46,736 --> 04:58:49,369
"Oh yeah, I had to get these X people and these X people

7660
04:58:49,369 --> 04:58:50,206
to be able to do all this stuff."

7661
04:58:50,206 --> 04:58:52,249
And it's like you can talk with much more authority

7662
04:58:52,249 --> 04:58:53,779
if you stay at a place longer.

7663
04:58:53,779 --> 04:58:55,969
And that's nothing but benefits in my book.

7664
04:58:55,969 --> 04:58:58,339
It's only if you stay at a place because you're afraid

7665
04:58:58,339 --> 04:59:00,139
or you don't want to...

7666
04:59:00,139 --> 04:59:01,092
You already have something that works for you

7667
04:59:01,092 --> 04:59:03,566
and you just never want to change and you're just like,

7668
04:59:03,566 --> 04:59:05,959
"I get to go in and just be completely mindless."

7669
04:59:05,959 --> 04:59:07,519
I think if you go mindless for a couple years,

7670
04:59:07,519 --> 04:59:08,689
you'll find yourself...

7671
04:59:08,689 --> 04:59:10,549
That's the only real danger.

7672
04:59:10,549 --> 04:59:13,069
You just come out with nothing at all.

7673
04:59:13,069 --> 04:59:15,296
- Especially when you're younger, that's the whole point.

7674
04:59:15,296 --> 04:59:16,129
"Take the risk.

7675
04:59:16,129 --> 04:59:18,589
Take the leap out to the next thing, to the next thing."

7676
04:59:18,589 --> 04:59:21,889
And not for money, but for just personal joy, joy.

7677
04:59:21,889 --> 04:59:23,809
- And money could get at the end, that's the best part.

7678
04:59:23,809 --> 04:59:24,799
When you don't strive for the money,

7679
04:59:24,799 --> 04:59:26,509
sometimes the money just shows up anyways.

7680
04:59:26,509 --> 04:59:27,342
- Yeah.

7681
04:59:27,342 --> 04:59:30,019
And some of the, what makes life worth living

7682
04:59:30,019 --> 04:59:33,379
is the people you work with, a good team.

7683
04:59:33,379 --> 04:59:37,249
Some of it's not to be generic, but culture matters.

7684
04:59:37,249 --> 04:59:41,269
It's whatever makes you happy.

7685
04:59:41,269 --> 04:59:44,419
For example, I just had won't call out places,

7686
04:59:44,419 --> 04:59:45,889
but there's certain companies

7687
04:59:45,889 --> 04:59:48,109
where everybody is very nine to five.

7688
04:59:48,109 --> 04:59:51,439
And even if the work is exciting,

7689
04:59:51,439 --> 04:59:53,719
they don't work hard enough I would say.

7690
04:59:53,719 --> 04:59:56,299
I'm one of those people that likes to go all out,

7691
04:59:56,299 --> 04:59:59,209
likes to be surrounded by people who are super passionate.

7692
04:59:59,209 --> 05:00:03,679
Now to be fair, a lot of them don't have families or don't-

7693
05:00:03,679 --> 05:00:04,512
- Yeah.

7694
05:00:04,512 --> 05:00:05,345
- It's a fascinating choice.

7695
05:00:05,345 --> 05:00:07,849
I really don't want to talk down on any choice

7696
05:00:07,849 --> 05:00:10,549
like work-life balance or not,

7697
05:00:10,549 --> 05:00:12,559
I think both are beautiful paths.

7698
05:00:12,559 --> 05:00:16,219
And if you really derive a lot of value

7699
05:00:16,219 --> 05:00:19,159
from joy from your work,

7700
05:00:19,159 --> 05:00:22,819
going all in, at least for some stretch of your life

7701
05:00:22,819 --> 05:00:24,949
is a beautiful thing to do.

7702
05:00:24,949 --> 05:00:26,722
Just all out,

7703
05:00:29,029 --> 05:00:32,509
full-on passion, sacrifice a lot of social life,

7704
05:00:32,509 --> 05:00:33,919
all that kind of stuff.

7705
05:00:33,919 --> 05:00:36,169
I don't know. That could also be beautiful.

7706
05:00:36,169 --> 05:00:38,389
- There could be something very, very exciting about that

7707
05:00:38,389 --> 05:00:41,179
in some sense, especially if you're building your own thing.

7708
05:00:41,179 --> 05:00:42,829
I could imagine that would be very exciting.

7709
05:00:42,829 --> 05:00:45,409
If I was Amazon, Jeff Bezos building Amazon,

7710
05:00:45,409 --> 05:00:46,909
one could imagine that those early years

7711
05:00:46,909 --> 05:00:49,639
were probably very rough and the amount of hours

7712
05:00:49,639 --> 05:00:52,339
he probably put in were very, very rough.

7713
05:00:52,339 --> 05:00:54,289
But I will say that there's this unique aspect

7714
05:00:54,289 --> 05:00:57,709
in our culture where we make this as an equal trade-off

7715
05:00:57,709 --> 05:00:59,272
between family or work,

7716
05:01:00,169 --> 05:01:02,839
like "Oh, you do or you don't have to have kids."

7717
05:01:02,839 --> 05:01:05,459
And my only real notion with that one is that

7718
05:01:06,499 --> 05:01:10,349
you will never know your capacity for love

7719
05:01:11,239 --> 05:01:12,679
until you have kids.

7720
05:01:12,679 --> 05:01:13,969
You just don't know.

7721
05:01:13,969 --> 05:01:16,279
And some people are like, "Oh yeah, but I love my dog."

7722
05:01:16,279 --> 05:01:18,892
It's just like I loved my dogs too.

7723
05:01:19,969 --> 05:01:21,701
And then I had kids and now my dogs are,

7724
05:01:21,701 --> 05:01:23,994
"They're all right. I like them."

7725
05:01:23,994 --> 05:01:24,827
- I get it. - I could come home

7726
05:01:24,827 --> 05:01:25,939
and I pet Indy and I'm like, "Oh, Indy."

7727
05:01:25,939 --> 05:01:27,513
And then I'm just like, "Okay, bye Indy."

7728
05:01:27,513 --> 05:01:30,502
I can't even describe the difference between the two,

7729
05:01:31,443 --> 05:01:32,356
it's not even the same.

7730
05:01:32,356 --> 05:01:36,499
And so that trade-off making is no one can tell you

7731
05:01:36,499 --> 05:01:39,679
what it's like because there's a real reality

7732
05:01:39,679 --> 05:01:43,249
that's right now, and I'm sure, I'm 100% positive

7733
05:01:43,249 --> 05:01:44,929
this is with my wife as well,

7734
05:01:44,929 --> 05:01:47,659
where if right now we got news that said

7735
05:01:47,659 --> 05:01:49,879
you have some medical procedure where if we do this,

7736
05:01:49,879 --> 05:01:51,679
you will die, but your kid will live,

7737
05:01:51,679 --> 05:01:55,009
there's not a question in my soul that I wouldn't do that.

7738
05:01:55,009 --> 05:01:55,986
If I could look into the future

7739
05:01:55,986 --> 05:01:57,559
and if I had to die right now

7740
05:01:57,559 --> 05:01:58,969
knowing that my kids would've a better life,

7741
05:01:58,969 --> 05:02:00,799
they would be happier, they'd be more fulfilled

7742
05:02:00,799 --> 05:02:03,199
and all those things, I guarantee you

7743
05:02:03,199 --> 05:02:05,569
either my wife or I would take that every single time.

7744
05:02:05,569 --> 05:02:06,889
It's just like you'll never be able

7745
05:02:06,889 --> 05:02:07,909
to say that about most things.

7746
05:02:07,909 --> 05:02:09,259
People will jokingly say that

7747
05:02:09,259 --> 05:02:11,509
until it's actually on the line.

7748
05:02:11,509 --> 05:02:14,269
But it's like with that, you just have this ferociousness.

7749
05:02:14,269 --> 05:02:16,309
I can break out and sweat thinking

7750
05:02:16,309 --> 05:02:19,909
about somebody fictionally pushing my kid to the ground,

7751
05:02:19,909 --> 05:02:24,109
actually get real adrenal responses flowing through my body.

7752
05:02:24,109 --> 05:02:25,426
So it's just such a different world

7753
05:02:25,426 --> 05:02:26,749
and it's hard to explain.

7754
05:02:26,749 --> 05:02:27,919
And you could never have convinced me

7755
05:02:27,919 --> 05:02:29,359
when I was young that it'd be this big.

7756
05:02:29,359 --> 05:02:31,025
- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. I thought I knew.

7757
05:02:31,025 --> 05:02:32,689
I didn't know.

7758
05:02:32,689 --> 05:02:35,119
- But to add on top of that,

7759
05:02:35,119 --> 05:02:37,369
some of the most successful people I know,

7760
05:02:37,369 --> 05:02:39,829
some of the most productive people I know have kids.

7761
05:02:39,829 --> 05:02:43,249
So I don't know if it's even a trade-off.

7762
05:02:43,249 --> 05:02:47,439
That love you feel, it seems to be a catalyst for like

7763
05:02:47,439 --> 05:02:50,119
to make sure you have less time,

7764
05:02:50,119 --> 05:02:52,999
but you're going to use that time better to be productive.

7765
05:02:52,999 --> 05:02:57,046
- I would argue that it definitely changed a lot of my life

7766
05:02:57,046 --> 05:02:59,209
and how I approach problems and everything,

7767
05:02:59,209 --> 05:03:00,919
in a very different way.

7768
05:03:00,919 --> 05:03:04,519
- Let me ask some random questions from Reddit.

7769
05:03:04,519 --> 05:03:08,179
On a scale of one to 10, how much do you hate every product

7770
05:03:08,179 --> 05:03:11,599
Microsoft has ever created and why is it a 10?

7771
05:03:11,599 --> 05:03:13,009
I think we covered that.

7772
05:03:13,009 --> 05:03:15,289
- We haven't technically covered it.

7773
05:03:15,289 --> 05:03:17,269
- There you go. All right, go ahead, go ahead.

7774
05:03:17,269 --> 05:03:18,259
- Okay, the only thing

7775
05:03:18,259 --> 05:03:19,249
I'll say is that - Use your time.

7776
05:03:19,249 --> 05:03:22,849
- I don't like that Microsoft pretends to be the good guy

7777
05:03:22,849 --> 05:03:24,769
when what they really wanted to get you addicted

7778
05:03:24,769 --> 05:03:26,539
to their products, to get you to use their products

7779
05:03:26,539 --> 05:03:27,979
as much as possible so they can extract

7780
05:03:27,979 --> 05:03:29,059
as much money out of you.

7781
05:03:29,059 --> 05:03:32,539
- Well, in this world, are there really good guys?

7782
05:03:32,539 --> 05:03:35,569
- That's a great point. I would argue Neovim is a great guy.

7783
05:03:35,569 --> 05:03:37,579
There's no way they can make money.

7784
05:03:37,579 --> 05:03:39,559
Justin Keyes is the benevolent dictator

7785
05:03:39,559 --> 05:03:41,389
and he thinks deeply about the product

7786
05:03:41,389 --> 05:03:43,279
and tries to make it the best as possible.

7787
05:03:43,279 --> 05:03:45,109
Whereas something like Microsoft,

7788
05:03:45,109 --> 05:03:47,092
they made VS Code as a loss leader.

7789
05:03:48,488 --> 05:03:50,629
Copilot's probably operating on a loss leader.

7790
05:03:50,629 --> 05:03:52,969
These things are all getting you so tied into,

7791
05:03:52,969 --> 05:03:56,959
GitHub, remote workspaces, CI, Copilot,

7792
05:03:56,959 --> 05:03:59,539
you become this trapped in permanent person

7793
05:03:59,539 --> 05:04:01,129
and if that price rises,

7794
05:04:01,129 --> 05:04:03,199
the switching cost is so great at some point

7795
05:04:03,199 --> 05:04:04,579
that you'll never be able to switch.

7796
05:04:04,579 --> 05:04:07,009
That's my only fear is that Microsoft was once accused

7797
05:04:07,009 --> 05:04:10,009
of EEE and it feels like they're EEEing again.

7798
05:04:10,009 --> 05:04:13,939
- Yeah, I'm nervous about criticizing a good thing

7799
05:04:13,939 --> 05:04:16,369
because you could see an incentive to do that good thing,

7800
05:04:16,369 --> 05:04:18,979
like Google creating all these services

7801
05:04:18,979 --> 05:04:21,199
that don't make money like Gmail for example,

7802
05:04:21,199 --> 05:04:25,159
you can cynically say

7803
05:04:25,159 --> 05:04:27,259
they're only doing that to tie you into an ecosystem

7804
05:04:27,259 --> 05:04:31,609
so they can basically keep you for life.

7805
05:04:31,609 --> 05:04:34,026
But also it's awesome that they created Gmail.

7806
05:04:34,026 --> 05:04:34,859
- Yeah.

7807
05:04:34,859 --> 05:04:37,819
- And they created an incredible product, so...

7808
05:04:37,819 --> 05:04:38,839
- I can side with you on that one.

7809
05:04:38,839 --> 05:04:41,479
It is a good product. VS Code is a good product.

7810
05:04:41,479 --> 05:04:42,312
- Yeah. - Now, I think,

7811
05:04:42,312 --> 05:04:44,106
don't put that on the...

7812
05:04:44,106 --> 05:04:47,179
But it is fine. They did a great job.

7813
05:04:47,179 --> 05:04:50,359
- Yeah, so there is going to be financial incentives

7814
05:04:50,359 --> 05:04:51,439
behind some of these companies.

7815
05:04:51,439 --> 05:04:54,229
And by the way, me defending, not defending,

7816
05:04:54,229 --> 05:04:55,819
but saying positive things about Microsoft

7817
05:04:55,819 --> 05:04:57,349
is just so I could talk shit to Prime.

7818
05:04:57,349 --> 05:04:59,029
But that's...

7819
05:04:59,029 --> 05:05:00,199
- I love that by the way.

7820
05:05:00,199 --> 05:05:03,889
- Yeah, Linux is my first and last love, it definitely...

7821
05:05:03,889 --> 05:05:06,589
The spirit of Linux and open source is a beautiful thing

7822
05:05:06,589 --> 05:05:11,589
so I do think that when you have these large corporations,

7823
05:05:12,499 --> 05:05:13,999
even when they try to do good,

7824
05:05:13,999 --> 05:05:17,629
oftentimes the profit imperative

7825
05:05:17,629 --> 05:05:21,709
just takes over and they can corrupt themselves

7826
05:05:21,709 --> 05:05:23,149
and Microsoft has a long history

7827
05:05:23,149 --> 05:05:24,949
of doing just that to themselves.

7828
05:05:24,949 --> 05:05:26,699
- Yeah. - That said, they've done,

7829
05:05:27,559 --> 05:05:29,509
they have you could say for cynical reason

7830
05:05:29,509 --> 05:05:32,239
because they want to seem like the good guy

7831
05:05:32,239 --> 05:05:34,339
amongst developers, but they've done a lot

7832
05:05:34,339 --> 05:05:35,569
to support open source.

7833
05:05:35,569 --> 05:05:40,189
It's just like, same with Meta, Meta has done insane amount-

7834
05:05:40,189 --> 05:05:42,139
- Yeah. - to support open source.

7835
05:05:42,139 --> 05:05:44,749
You can say, actually for that one,

7836
05:05:44,749 --> 05:05:48,049
I don't know if I can even make a financial

7837
05:05:48,049 --> 05:05:49,909
or a cynical case for why Meta

7838
05:05:49,909 --> 05:05:52,009
is open sourcing Llama and these-

7839
05:05:52,009 --> 05:05:53,779
- Yeah, that one's confusing. It just seems great.

7840
05:05:53,779 --> 05:05:55,129
- Maybe for hiring.

7841
05:05:55,129 --> 05:05:57,649
But no, I think that's legit,

7842
05:05:57,649 --> 05:06:01,819
just an ethical, really powerful decision.

7843
05:06:01,819 --> 05:06:03,322
And sometimes these companies,

7844
05:06:04,309 --> 05:06:06,709
because they have a lot of cash,

7845
05:06:06,709 --> 05:06:10,399
can make the right, do the right thing.

7846
05:06:10,399 --> 05:06:12,559
- Yeah. It's a really positive way to look at it.

7847
05:06:12,559 --> 05:06:14,059
And I think that's really nice.

7848
05:06:14,059 --> 05:06:15,889
- Well, we should always be skeptical.

7849
05:06:15,889 --> 05:06:17,899
- Yeah, I mean because at the end of the day, companies,

7850
05:06:17,899 --> 05:06:20,539
they're not good, they're not bad, they're morally neutral.

7851
05:06:20,539 --> 05:06:21,529
It's the people that are running them,

7852
05:06:21,529 --> 05:06:23,149
the decisions those people make that are really

7853
05:06:23,149 --> 05:06:25,519
where the bad or the good comes from.

7854
05:06:25,519 --> 05:06:28,159
- Another question, ask him if he knows how to milk a cow?

7855
05:06:28,159 --> 05:06:29,539
I've already asked that.

7856
05:06:29,539 --> 05:06:30,949
The answer is- - No.

7857
05:06:30,949 --> 05:06:31,912
- Oh, no, you don't know.

7858
05:06:31,912 --> 05:06:33,349
- I've never milked a cow.

7859
05:06:33,349 --> 05:06:34,759
- Never milked a cow.

7860
05:06:34,759 --> 05:06:37,249
- Almost been killed by a cow, but never milked a cow.

7861
05:06:37,249 --> 05:06:38,802
- Did you ever ride a bull?

7862
05:06:38,802 --> 05:06:43,789
- No. - All right. Why male models?

7863
05:06:43,789 --> 05:06:45,799
- Okay, so I can explain that one.

7864
05:06:45,799 --> 05:06:47,726
I will say something like,

7865
05:06:47,726 --> 05:06:50,869
"I really dislike the color purple

7866
05:06:50,869 --> 05:06:52,669
because the color purple makes me upset."

7867
05:06:52,669 --> 05:06:54,229
I don't know, just something very benign.

7868
05:06:54,229 --> 05:06:56,786
But then someone right afterwards will be like,

7869
05:06:56,786 --> 05:06:59,899
"But why don't you like the color purple?"

7870
05:06:59,899 --> 05:07:01,069
And it'll just be like...

7871
05:07:01,069 --> 05:07:02,419
It's just like Derek Zoolander.

7872
05:07:02,419 --> 05:07:05,328
It's just like I get done on a five-minute talk about it

7873
05:07:05,328 --> 05:07:06,176
and then the next question's like,

7874
05:07:06,176 --> 05:07:07,445
"But seriously why though?"

7875
05:07:07,445 --> 05:07:09,469
It was just like, "Why male models?"

7876
05:07:09,469 --> 05:07:11,029
- Yeah, so that's the Zoolander reference

7877
05:07:11,029 --> 05:07:12,889
when there's a long explanation

7878
05:07:12,889 --> 05:07:17,329
why male models and he agrees and then forgets.

7879
05:07:17,329 --> 05:07:18,162
- Yep.

7880
05:07:20,959 --> 05:07:22,102
- What is Ligma?

7881
05:07:23,689 --> 05:07:25,879
- I've died by Ligma quite a few times.

7882
05:07:25,879 --> 05:07:27,709
So do you know the origin story of Ligma?

7883
05:07:27,709 --> 05:07:28,542
- [Lex] No.

7884
05:07:28,542 --> 05:07:31,792
- So Ninja, famous streamer, someone got him with Ligma

7885
05:07:31,792 --> 05:07:32,625
and said like, "Oh," something like,

7886
05:07:32,625 --> 05:07:33,589
"Have you heard about Ligma?"

7887
05:07:33,589 --> 05:07:36,799
And he was like, "No." And he's like, "Oh, Ligma balls."

7888
05:07:36,799 --> 05:07:40,189
And then after that Ninja got so hurt

7889
05:07:40,189 --> 05:07:42,589
by getting had by that,

7890
05:07:42,589 --> 05:07:44,929
he started banning anyone in chat who's said the word Ligma

7891
05:07:44,929 --> 05:07:45,762
or something like that.

7892
05:07:45,762 --> 05:07:49,339
And so then if you don't embrace the meme you get destroyed.

7893
05:07:49,339 --> 05:07:50,326
So of course, gets destroyed

7894
05:07:50,326 --> 05:07:51,799
and so then the whole goal is that,

7895
05:07:51,799 --> 05:07:53,989
can people get me with Ligma?

7896
05:07:53,989 --> 05:07:55,189
TJ did iladies.

7897
05:07:55,189 --> 05:07:56,689
He's like, "Oh, did you hear that E-girls

7898
05:07:56,689 --> 05:07:57,706
got renamed to iladies?"

7899
05:07:57,706 --> 05:07:59,299
And I just didn't even see it coming.

7900
05:07:59,299 --> 05:08:00,136
And I was just like, "What?"

7901
05:08:00,136 --> 05:08:01,999
And he's like, "iladies nuts on your face."

7902
05:08:01,999 --> 05:08:03,799
And then it's just like, "Oh my gosh."

7903
05:08:03,799 --> 05:08:05,906
And then a pirate software has also got me like,

7904
05:08:05,906 --> 05:08:07,309
"Oh, have you heard about Google SIMA,"

7905
05:08:07,309 --> 05:08:09,409
which SEMA is a real product by Google>

7906
05:08:09,409 --> 05:08:10,789
And I'm like, "Oh yeah, I've heard about this.

7907
05:08:10,789 --> 05:08:12,859
What is this again?" He's like, "SIMA balls," right?

7908
05:08:12,859 --> 05:08:14,479
It's just like, "Dang it," how do I keep...?

7909
05:08:14,479 --> 05:08:19,069
So I've just had it happen live on stream many, many times.

7910
05:08:19,069 --> 05:08:21,379
I've died by Ligma the most.

7911
05:08:21,379 --> 05:08:25,469
- Please ask him about the size of his dict.

7912
05:08:25,469 --> 05:08:29,329
- Okay, so that's D-I-C-T, that's dictionary in Python.

7913
05:08:29,329 --> 05:08:31,129
- Who doesn't love dicts?

7914
05:08:31,129 --> 05:08:33,079
- Yeah, that's a great question.

7915
05:08:33,079 --> 05:08:35,119
Just a dicts party when you use Python.

7916
05:08:35,119 --> 05:08:36,769
- I love dicts.

7917
05:08:36,769 --> 05:08:38,119
- That should be a T-shirt.

7918
05:08:39,469 --> 05:08:41,449
That's actually a hilarious T-shirt.

7919
05:08:41,449 --> 05:08:44,869
So on Stack Overflow, you can ask any question you want,

7920
05:08:44,869 --> 05:08:48,529
and I decided to craft a question one day on Stack Overflow

7921
05:08:48,529 --> 05:08:51,499
that says how to measure your dict in bytes.

7922
05:08:51,499 --> 05:08:54,709
And then I proceeded to really go to town

7923
05:08:54,709 --> 05:08:56,396
and explain all the different things like,

7924
05:08:56,396 --> 05:08:57,859
"Well, what about the cost of the strings

7925
05:08:57,859 --> 05:08:59,059
and the references?"

7926
05:08:59,059 --> 05:09:01,486
And when you really get both hands on your dict

7927
05:09:01,486 --> 05:09:03,919
and really go after it, it's very hard to,

7928
05:09:03,919 --> 05:09:05,569
really threw in some innuendos.

7929
05:09:05,569 --> 05:09:08,929
The Stack Overflow team deleted the question,

7930
05:09:08,929 --> 05:09:13,069
and then someone hand wrote me an email explaining

7931
05:09:13,069 --> 05:09:15,829
why they deleted the question and complimented me

7932
05:09:15,829 --> 05:09:19,339
on how thoroughly and thoughtful the question was

7933
05:09:19,339 --> 05:09:20,959
just to weave in innuendos

7934
05:09:20,959 --> 05:09:23,119
and that the entire team was impressed,

7935
05:09:23,119 --> 05:09:25,849
but it's inappropriate and it had to be deleted

7936
05:09:25,849 --> 05:09:28,009
and don't do it again or we're going to ban your account.

7937
05:09:28,009 --> 05:09:30,476
And so it was a very funny moment and so I was like,

7938
05:09:30,476 --> 05:09:32,126
"Oh, that's funny that happened."

7939
05:09:33,109 --> 05:09:35,839
That was about six years ago.

7940
05:09:35,839 --> 05:09:37,879
Last year I was at a conference

7941
05:09:37,879 --> 05:09:41,149
and there's a guy wearing a Stack Overflow name tag

7942
05:09:41,149 --> 05:09:43,189
and I was like, "Oh, you work at Stack Overflow?"

7943
05:09:43,189 --> 05:09:44,022
He's like, "Oh, yeah, I do."

7944
05:09:44,022 --> 05:09:45,840
I'm like, "Do I got a story for you." And he goes,

7945
05:09:45,840 --> 05:09:47,209
- Oh, no. - "No, wait a second.

7946
05:09:47,209 --> 05:09:48,419
Are you the dict guy?"

7947
05:09:48,419 --> 05:09:49,669
- Yeah. - That was his

7948
05:09:49,669 --> 05:09:51,046
only question was that.

7949
05:09:51,046 --> 05:09:52,729
And I was just like, "Let's go."

7950
05:09:52,729 --> 05:09:54,556
I didn't even say anything about me

7951
05:09:54,556 --> 05:09:57,829
and he already knew immediately I was the dict guy.

7952
05:09:57,829 --> 05:09:59,209
- I should say in all seriousness,

7953
05:09:59,209 --> 05:10:01,489
I think I've had a bunch of conversations

7954
05:10:01,489 --> 05:10:03,919
in the Python world where I would have to mention

7955
05:10:03,919 --> 05:10:05,089
the name of this data structure

7956
05:10:05,089 --> 05:10:07,506
and it makes me uncomfortable every time.

7957
05:10:07,506 --> 05:10:10,159
- It's a very unfortunate shortening of a word.

7958
05:10:10,159 --> 05:10:11,359
- Dict.

7959
05:10:11,359 --> 05:10:13,069
It's just like when I go to the hardware store

7960
05:10:13,069 --> 05:10:14,759
and ask for caulk

7961
05:10:16,369 --> 05:10:18,709
and there's always a nice old lady

7962
05:10:18,709 --> 05:10:22,622
and I ask her where to find, and it's very uncomfortable.

7963
05:10:22,622 --> 05:10:24,469
I try to pronounce it as hard as I can.

7964
05:10:24,469 --> 05:10:26,999
- Really get that L in there, like caulk.

7965
05:10:26,999 --> 05:10:29,689
- Caulk, just to be clear.

7966
05:10:29,689 --> 05:10:31,889
And try to avoid eye contact the whole time.

7967
05:10:33,585 --> 05:10:36,469
You said that God was a big part,

7968
05:10:36,469 --> 05:10:37,669
was a big part of your life.

7969
05:10:37,669 --> 05:10:39,349
Can you speak to that a little bit more?

7970
05:10:39,349 --> 05:10:42,439
Who is God and what effect,

7971
05:10:42,439 --> 05:10:44,659
what role did he play in your life?

7972
05:10:44,659 --> 05:10:48,769
- So I did talk about that one important evening where I,

7973
05:10:48,769 --> 05:10:52,432
for whatever reason, gained my conscious that moment.

7974
05:10:53,839 --> 05:10:57,349
So obviously for me that I grew up with a life

7975
05:10:57,349 --> 05:11:00,229
where I would probably argue myself as a functional atheist.

7976
05:11:00,229 --> 05:11:01,969
I went to church a handful of times.

7977
05:11:01,969 --> 05:11:04,789
I can't quite really remember actually going to church

7978
05:11:04,789 --> 05:11:06,649
as a family in any sort of sense.

7979
05:11:06,649 --> 05:11:08,869
So there wasn't some super strong tie

7980
05:11:08,869 --> 05:11:10,939
or anything like that to it.

7981
05:11:10,939 --> 05:11:13,066
Pretty much anyone else growing up in America in the '90s,

7982
05:11:13,066 --> 05:11:16,009
you had some sort of impact or intersection

7983
05:11:16,009 --> 05:11:18,439
with church at some point in your life,

7984
05:11:18,439 --> 05:11:22,009
that was just a very normal thing I would probably say.

7985
05:11:22,009 --> 05:11:23,692
And so when that happened,

7986
05:11:24,602 --> 05:11:27,049
it was a fairly big surprise for me.

7987
05:11:27,049 --> 05:11:29,329
I wasn't necessarily going that direction

7988
05:11:29,329 --> 05:11:30,816
or deciding to do any of those things.

7989
05:11:30,816 --> 05:11:34,009
And so for me, it's obviously the turning point

7990
05:11:34,009 --> 05:11:35,032
of my entire life.

7991
05:11:37,009 --> 05:11:40,969
I cannot speak to who I would be now without that.

7992
05:11:40,969 --> 05:11:43,069
I can just tell you that I wouldn't have had the drive.

7993
05:11:43,069 --> 05:11:44,910
I probably would not have completed college.

7994
05:11:44,910 --> 05:11:47,059
I would've not have found my wife or had my kids.

7995
05:11:47,059 --> 05:11:48,619
I wouldn't know how to value people.

7996
05:11:48,619 --> 05:11:51,709
I don't think without that whole thing,

7997
05:11:51,709 --> 05:11:54,649
my value for people would've been very, very small

7998
05:11:54,649 --> 05:11:57,019
because I would've continued to just objectifying

7999
05:11:57,019 --> 05:11:58,219
in the way I was.

8000
05:11:58,219 --> 05:12:00,679
And then probably the biggest thing is

8001
05:12:00,679 --> 05:12:03,619
there's this one verse, I don't even know where it's at,

8002
05:12:03,619 --> 05:12:07,159
it effectively says that we love because he first loved us.

8003
05:12:07,159 --> 05:12:08,309
And so for me it's like

8004
05:12:11,179 --> 05:12:13,879
I don't think I would've ever lived a life

8005
05:12:13,879 --> 05:12:15,799
that was happy without this.

8006
05:12:15,799 --> 05:12:19,249
And I just didn't even know that that was an option for me.

8007
05:12:19,249 --> 05:12:20,929
And I never really,

8008
05:12:20,929 --> 05:12:23,026
it was a very tough set of years for me

8009
05:12:23,026 --> 05:12:24,859
and I was very, very sad

8010
05:12:24,859 --> 05:12:27,859
and just always just constantly looking for something

8011
05:12:27,859 --> 05:12:28,849
to fulfill me.

8012
05:12:28,849 --> 05:12:31,579
And so it's like I didn't have any confidence,

8013
05:12:31,579 --> 05:12:33,052
I didn't have any joy.

8014
05:12:34,429 --> 05:12:36,619
I felt very sad.

8015
05:12:36,619 --> 05:12:40,649
And so that was this moment where

8016
05:12:42,169 --> 05:12:44,509
for the first time ever didn't, all of a sudden

8017
05:12:44,509 --> 05:12:47,309
I just felt like I didn't have to live up to a standard.

8018
05:12:48,409 --> 05:12:49,969
The standards have already been paid for,

8019
05:12:49,969 --> 05:12:52,939
everything's already, that's the free gift,

8020
05:12:52,939 --> 05:12:53,839
that's the exchange.

8021
05:12:53,839 --> 05:12:55,459
And so it's just like for the first time,

8022
05:12:55,459 --> 05:12:57,409
I didn't have to be the cool guy,

8023
05:12:57,409 --> 05:12:58,729
I didn't have to have all the right words,

8024
05:12:58,729 --> 05:13:01,729
I didn't have to feel, I didn't have to go on the conquest,

8025
05:13:01,729 --> 05:13:04,009
the sexual conquest to find validation.

8026
05:13:04,009 --> 05:13:06,109
I didn't have to do any of those things

8027
05:13:06,109 --> 05:13:09,139
and it was exceptionally liberating.

8028
05:13:09,139 --> 05:13:10,309
And so who is God?

8029
05:13:10,309 --> 05:13:13,639
That's more of a catechism question perhaps.

8030
05:13:13,639 --> 05:13:15,439
What is man, who is God?

8031
05:13:15,439 --> 05:13:17,272
Those are much harder questions.

8032
05:13:18,289 --> 05:13:20,449
I believe that anytime you try to get too deep

8033
05:13:20,449 --> 05:13:21,559
into describing who God is,

8034
05:13:21,559 --> 05:13:24,529
you typically fall into Christian heresy.

8035
05:13:24,529 --> 05:13:28,159
- But for you, he gave you a chance to be happy.

8036
05:13:28,159 --> 05:13:30,079
- Yeah, he gave me a chance not just to be happy,

8037
05:13:30,079 --> 05:13:34,319
but also made it so that the first time

8038
05:13:35,539 --> 05:13:38,332
I can actually feel forgiven I guess in some sense,

8039
05:13:39,199 --> 05:13:41,299
and able to forgive people that hurt me.

8040
05:13:41,299 --> 05:13:44,959
For a long time I had this weight I'd carry around

8041
05:13:44,959 --> 05:13:46,939
from the things I hated about high school

8042
05:13:46,939 --> 05:13:48,379
and all that kind of stuff.

8043
05:13:48,379 --> 05:13:50,989
And through that experience,

8044
05:13:50,989 --> 05:13:52,699
I just wrote down every last person's name

8045
05:13:52,699 --> 05:13:54,949
and actually held them with me for quite some time

8046
05:13:54,949 --> 05:13:57,559
and this was the list of people I forgave.

8047
05:13:57,559 --> 05:13:58,859
And I read it a few times.

8048
05:13:59,929 --> 05:14:02,299
I couldn't let myself be angry or consumed

8049
05:14:02,299 --> 05:14:05,722
by that kind of stuff because hate is so sticky,

8050
05:14:06,679 --> 05:14:07,789
it sticks for a lifetime.

8051
05:14:07,789 --> 05:14:10,099
And there really is only one cure for hate,

8052
05:14:10,099 --> 05:14:11,269
which is forgiveness.

8053
05:14:11,269 --> 05:14:14,359
I just don't think you can get rid of it without that.

8054
05:14:14,359 --> 05:14:16,879
And so I just had choose to forgive these people

8055
05:14:16,879 --> 05:14:19,429
and to move on, and it really kind of freed me.

8056
05:14:19,429 --> 05:14:22,819
And I would never have thought forgiveness as a means

8057
05:14:22,819 --> 05:14:26,212
for that change if I didn't first experience it myself.

8058
05:14:27,439 --> 05:14:30,739
- What's the role of love in the human condition,

8059
05:14:30,739 --> 05:14:32,899
to go to the philosophical,

8060
05:14:32,899 --> 05:14:35,812
and what's been the role of love in your life?

8061
05:14:37,369 --> 05:14:39,409
- It's very obvious

8062
05:14:39,409 --> 05:14:43,162
that every person wants or desires love.

8063
05:14:44,119 --> 05:14:46,429
My wife has recently convinced me

8064
05:14:46,429 --> 05:14:48,829
to watch Love is Blind with her one time.

8065
05:14:48,829 --> 05:14:51,729
And you watch the show and if you're not familiar with it,

8066
05:14:53,321 --> 05:14:55,519
it feels like just a disaster of an experiment

8067
05:14:55,519 --> 05:14:57,139
to just cause crazy filming.

8068
05:14:57,139 --> 05:14:58,399
But anyways, the idea is that

8069
05:14:58,399 --> 05:14:59,629
if you just don't see somebody,

8070
05:14:59,629 --> 05:15:00,709
you can fall in love with somebody

8071
05:15:00,709 --> 05:15:02,239
and want to marry them after 10 days

8072
05:15:02,239 --> 05:15:04,729
or some very small period of time.

8073
05:15:04,729 --> 05:15:09,229
And what you really end up seeing is all these people

8074
05:15:09,229 --> 05:15:11,509
who are just desperate for actually love.

8075
05:15:11,509 --> 05:15:13,502
And there's some part of it...

8076
05:15:13,502 --> 05:15:15,319
I told my wife, "It's like love gladiators."

8077
05:15:15,319 --> 05:15:17,689
We're watching people battle it out for drama

8078
05:15:17,689 --> 05:15:19,069
and really what they want is love.

8079
05:15:19,069 --> 05:15:21,169
And it's like they're fighting to the death and love,

8080
05:15:21,169 --> 05:15:22,002
if you will.

8081
05:15:22,002 --> 05:15:25,012
And it's this almost kind of sad aspect to watch.

8082
05:15:25,849 --> 05:15:29,599
And so I think that it's hard to call,

8083
05:15:29,599 --> 05:15:32,149
what is its role in the human experience,

8084
05:15:32,149 --> 05:15:36,139
because I think it's just something

8085
05:15:36,139 --> 05:15:39,469
that we all naturally not just want, but need.

8086
05:15:39,469 --> 05:15:42,259
And I don't think that you can really progress,

8087
05:15:42,259 --> 05:15:43,969
and when I say the word love,

8088
05:15:43,969 --> 05:15:47,896
I would like to kind of narrow it down maybe a bit more.

8089
05:15:47,896 --> 05:15:50,992
And I don't mean Eros, the Greek word like sexy love,

8090
05:15:51,889 --> 05:15:54,049
I think that paternal and friendship love

8091
05:15:54,049 --> 05:15:54,882
are extremely important.

8092
05:15:54,882 --> 05:15:57,532
And I think agape, God love is also very important.

8093
05:15:57,532 --> 05:16:00,799
Agape love is the one that is superior to them all,

8094
05:16:00,799 --> 05:16:03,709
but obviously different and also co-needed

8095
05:16:03,709 --> 05:16:05,266
with the parental ones and all that.

8096
05:16:05,266 --> 05:16:08,062
And so you kind of need this mixture of them all,

8097
05:16:08,936 --> 05:16:10,579
and each one is different for each reason

8098
05:16:10,579 --> 05:16:11,929
and where it's applied.

8099
05:16:11,929 --> 05:16:14,439
And so I don't think...

8100
05:16:15,889 --> 05:16:19,896
I just don't see a world in which is good

8101
05:16:22,219 --> 05:16:25,582
of any kind without that as a very foundational piece.

8102
05:16:26,479 --> 05:16:29,749
Because again, I didn't come here

8103
05:16:29,749 --> 05:16:32,389
trying to quote any sort of scripture, but it says

8104
05:16:32,389 --> 05:16:34,459
that it's not the nails that hung on there, it's love.

8105
05:16:34,459 --> 05:16:36,409
That's the reason why these things happen.

8106
05:16:36,409 --> 05:16:40,249
And so if forgiveness is the requirement

8107
05:16:40,249 --> 05:16:42,649
to kind of pay off hate in some sense,

8108
05:16:42,649 --> 05:16:45,529
then love has to be the motivation for forgiveness.

8109
05:16:45,529 --> 05:16:48,379
- Yeah, that's the tragic aspect of life.

8110
05:16:48,379 --> 05:16:50,919
I think there's a deep loneliness

8111
05:16:50,919 --> 05:16:52,979
in all of us and a longing

8112
05:16:54,679 --> 05:16:58,372
to be a part of this bigger thing.

8113
05:16:59,329 --> 05:17:04,329
And that longing is a love and it has many names, but yeah.

8114
05:17:04,529 --> 05:17:06,319
Yeah, the love aspect of it,

8115
05:17:06,319 --> 05:17:08,329
it's the beautiful aspect of life,

8116
05:17:08,329 --> 05:17:10,759
the tragedies, the loneliness,

8117
05:17:10,759 --> 05:17:14,449
and the unfortunate suffering

8118
05:17:14,449 --> 05:17:15,856
that is a fundamental part of life

8119
05:17:15,856 --> 05:17:18,442
and the beautiful aspect is the love.

8120
05:17:19,369 --> 05:17:20,352
- [ThePrimeagen] Yeah.

8121
05:17:21,409 --> 05:17:24,109
- Which I think is a good time to mention more Reddit,

8122
05:17:25,703 --> 05:17:28,222
the place for everlasting positivity and love.

8123
05:17:29,569 --> 05:17:34,132
Somebody wrote, "Please thank him, you,

8124
05:17:35,089 --> 05:17:37,939
for his everlasting positivity

8125
05:17:37,939 --> 05:17:40,486
and give him a big hug for me."

8126
05:17:41,389 --> 05:17:44,839
So I won't give you a big hug on camera

8127
05:17:44,839 --> 05:17:46,579
because I'm afraid I'll get a boner

8128
05:17:46,579 --> 05:17:48,529
and that'll be very unfortunate.

8129
05:17:48,529 --> 05:17:50,749
- Hey, let's not bring dicts into this again, okay?

8130
05:17:50,749 --> 05:17:52,549
- It's my favorite data structure.

8131
05:17:52,549 --> 05:17:54,709
Like I said, I love dicts,

8132
05:17:54,709 --> 05:17:57,146
all kinds of dicts, ordered dicts-

8133
05:17:57,146 --> 05:17:57,979
- Unordered.

8134
05:17:57,979 --> 05:18:00,924
- Unordered dicts. I don't discriminate.

8135
05:18:00,924 --> 05:18:02,602
Yeah.

8136
05:18:04,279 --> 05:18:08,642
But just that to say big thank you from me.

8137
05:18:10,219 --> 05:18:13,819
I listen to you a lot and I just really enjoy...

8138
05:18:13,819 --> 05:18:15,829
I've been going through a lot of shit myself

8139
05:18:15,829 --> 05:18:18,589
and just the positivity,

8140
05:18:18,589 --> 05:18:21,289
even when you're building the stupidest shit,

8141
05:18:21,289 --> 05:18:23,689
it's just the positivity radiates from you

8142
05:18:23,689 --> 05:18:27,499
and you inspire me to be a good person.

8143
05:18:27,499 --> 05:18:30,409
You inspire me to build stuff. So thank you.

8144
05:18:30,409 --> 05:18:32,089
And I'm sure there's many, many others

8145
05:18:32,089 --> 05:18:33,589
who listen to you for the same reason.

8146
05:18:33,589 --> 05:18:35,419
So thank you for your positivity.

8147
05:18:35,419 --> 05:18:38,839
Thank you for being the light in many people's lives,

8148
05:18:38,839 --> 05:18:40,489
and thank you for talking to me, brother.

8149
05:18:40,489 --> 05:18:42,529
- Dang. That was very, very kind.

8150
05:18:42,529 --> 05:18:44,119
I really do appreciate all those

8151
05:18:44,119 --> 05:18:45,589
extremely nice words even from Reddit.

8152
05:18:45,589 --> 05:18:47,962
That's very surprising. But thank you.

8153
05:18:50,029 --> 05:18:51,709
I mean, I know you know

8154
05:18:51,709 --> 05:18:54,949
that there's many people's lives,

8155
05:18:54,949 --> 05:18:56,149
and I'm sure you've received the letters

8156
05:18:56,149 --> 05:18:59,359
that have been changed from actions and things you've said

8157
05:18:59,359 --> 05:19:00,192
and things you've done.

8158
05:19:00,192 --> 05:19:03,709
And so it's one of the best parts

8159
05:19:03,709 --> 05:19:07,009
about doing this side is that

8160
05:19:07,009 --> 05:19:10,519
you get a chance to potentially improve somebody's life.

8161
05:19:10,519 --> 05:19:12,619
And you getting to interview a lot of people,

8162
05:19:12,619 --> 05:19:15,829
there's a lot of people that listened to Chris Latner

8163
05:19:15,829 --> 05:19:18,229
and saw his excitement for Swift

8164
05:19:18,229 --> 05:19:19,789
and probably went and learned Swift

8165
05:19:19,789 --> 05:19:21,409
and then got really amazing jobs

8166
05:19:21,409 --> 05:19:23,239
and it can be all origined back to back to you

8167
05:19:23,239 --> 05:19:26,059
and that interview, and so those are amazing things.

8168
05:19:26,059 --> 05:19:29,727
And so same goes back to you,

8169
05:19:29,727 --> 05:19:31,879
you've done a lot of good stuff.

8170
05:19:31,879 --> 05:19:35,239
- Right back at you brother. Thank you for talking today.

8171
05:19:35,239 --> 05:19:37,039

8176
05:19:49,196 --> 05:19:52,789
"When we strive to become better than we are,

8177
05:19:52,789 --> 05:19:55,879
everything around us becomes better too."

8178
